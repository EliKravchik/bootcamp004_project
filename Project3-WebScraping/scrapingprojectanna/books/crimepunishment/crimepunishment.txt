I ve read this book several times  It is one of the most readable pieces of great literature  The story is compelling on a very simplistic level  but the there are many layers to the novel  When I read this for the second time in college  I remember thinking  this story reminds me of the television series Columbo  The detective who plays dumb  the perpetrator of the crime who feels superior to the detective  etc  I thought I was so clever to make this leap between literature and popular culture  Much later I found out that Columbo was based on the novel  So much for great insight  Hatte ich mir nicht endlich dieses grossartige Buch vorgeknopft  hatte ich in meinem Leseleben wirklich etwas verpasst  When I first started reading this book  I was rather unimpressed  But as the story progresses  and the character s inner dialogue is further revealed  it was hard to put down  Overall and excellent investigation into the heart of humanity  Amazing character development  You can see inside a person s mind and feel a normal man grow insane  Unsettling at first  as its supposed to be  but utterly amazing  One of the best books I have ever read   5 yildizin bile yeterli oldugunu sanmiyorum Crime and Punishment is one of my favorite classic ever  I am still not sure about why this one has impressed me so much  Most probably it is because Dostoyevski has really been aware of what human psychology is like  and he has the gift about how to voice it I m asking to the ones who has read this masterpiece  who has put himself in Raskolnikov s place  while reading  I bet everybody did  Why  Because you just don t read it  you feel the plot  story  place   everything  Dostoyevski is a great writer ever  dstwfskyb y shy   lqtrf  lk qb t jwys w hsh w yyts w rmbw Crime and Punishment was recommended to my by many in the Mikkelson AP Literature class this year  Having felt strange for having read so much science non fiction and science fiction  I decided to delve back into the literary mainstream  Here s what I thought of this work by Fyodor Dostoyevsky Crime and Punishment was a unique novel  poignant in its timeliness and portrayal of 19th century Russia  but also oddly relatable to modern destitution and poverty  When considering the title of this work  we think logically about the natural transition from crime to punishment  the latter dealt out by law enforcement  However  for protagonist Rodion Raskolnikov  his crime stems from the fact that he believes himself to be capable of dealing with a murder mentally  and his punishment results when his conscience gnaws at him in the coming investigation Often when reading books where the writer attempts to project his own ideals or vignettes of his own ideas onto the characters  the reader must understand the context and the background before being able to understand the subtle  or sometimes overt  meaning behind the characters  actions  However  with Crime and Punishment  Dostoyevsky is able to show his ideology and his thoughts without further investigation  For example  in Part II  Chapter I  Raskolnikov experiences  something never before experienced   that it was  no longer possible to address  the  people in the police station   reflects the isolation felt by Dostoyevsky himself during those years and how it could be a catalyst for things such as murder  2 1   For those who know that Dostoyevsky spent many years in exile in Siberia  this is definitely a prime example of his ideas coming out in the pages he wrote In the epilogue  the sixth and final part of the book  Raskolnikov s love for a certain person is finally realized by that person  There was  no doubt that he loved her infinitely  and that at last that moment had come   This signifies redemption for the protagonist  and perhaps redemption for the author as well  The novel  published in 1866  was written only a few years after his time in Siberia  Perhaps  through this book  Dostoyevsky is simply putting on paper his thoughts  his dogma  his ideals In the end  I found this to be an enjoyable book  Although I have reservations about the epilogue and whether it truly makes sense is worthy when compared to the novel  I was glad to be able to digest and read into this classic   thought provoking and intense This book is a masterpiece  I found myself rooting for an ax murderer  Nearly as good as Anna Karenina  where I found myself cheering on the adulteress   Russians know how to write  That was a quick 950 pages  If you can swallow Russian literature  there is much wisdom waiting to be unearthed in this novel  Time to give this another go  Having read it many years ago  high school    I remember only the general outlines and the trouble I had keeping all the characters straight because they each had so many different names  This particular translation is highly regarded  My reading of Crime and Punishment was the start of what I hope to be a revisiting of numerous Russian classics  I read all the big guns  barring War and Peace  many years ago and  quite frankly  got NOTHING out of them  I was confused  bored  confused  unable to wade through the thick writing  confused and  lastly  confused  I should probably address my confusion  I am  in real life as well as in art  an absolute clod at handling peoples  names  And it is common in the writing of many languages for characters to be referred to with various handles  In Russian you have the complete name  the last name  and the familiar name all interchanged willy nilly  So your main character will be Raskolnikov for the first ten pages and then suddenly someone named Rodya will be addressed  And you re supposed to know with zero instruction that this is Raskolnikov s nickname  or familiar address  Which is fine  I shorten Elizabeth to Liz or Thomas to Tom or Richard to Dick  though I ve never understood that last one   But when it s a nickname for a giant name in a foreign language that I hadn t grasped much to begin with and has very little to do with the original name and there is zero hand holding given   well I get lost  Combine three names per character with 12 or 13 main characters and for me it s a complete cluster f  k of proper nouns that I have a hard time keeping straight  Ten years ago I was lost  now I managed to keep my head in the game and sort out what name referred to whom with  for me  shocking accuracy  I know that seems like a terribly superficial thing to dwell on  but nothing has effected my ability to enjoy Russian literature more than this  And I m not saying it should change  again  this is standard fare for many languages  but man does it make for some rough going  Okay  that s out of the way  now onto the book  The book is awesome  Somehow I missed this ten years ago  It s a brilliantly gripping story of murder told mainly through the eyes of the murderer  Raskolnikov s madness and rambling thoughts are beautifully painted as well as his struggles during lucid moments to come to terms with what he actually believes  This struggle takes place amid tons of philosophical ramblings from all the characters  But the philosophies discussed were only barely overwritten  I generally have little patience for authors who let a character take ten pages to pontificate on their personal philosophy   a few sentences  sure  but I ve never been out drinking and heard anyone talk for twenty minutes straight about the nature of man  It just doesn t happen and whenever I catch an author doing this it pulls me out of the story   The cast of characters were interesting  the numerous subplots of blackmail  coercion  love and desperate attempts to cling to the past were all fascinating  Not to mention you get a very interesting twist on the classic Who Done It here where   well you  know   Who Did It   You watch him do it  And yet the book manages to keep the police investigation interesting and believable as well as cast just enough doubt on what on earth actually happened due to Raskolnikov s somewhat unreliable viewpoint  And then  after all of this  at the end  you are suddenly given just a stunningly beautiful affirmation of humanity and love that came so out of nowhere yet had a perfect foundation under it that I got chills up and down  I can t wait to read this again in ten years   maybe even less   depends on how long War and Peace takes me  Crime and Punishment is a must read  I first read it many years ago  but I still often go back to it when I don t have any books to read at the moment  One of the many things that I liked about this book is how the characters were molded  Each of them has their own philosophy in life  and I believe that s something that we all should learn from  I ve read this novel four or five times  and IMO the Pevear Volokhonsky translation is the one that rocks the hardest  If you re reading Dostoyevsky for the first time  this is the novel to start with  and this edition is worth springing for  I feel I read this book at the improper time  I was forced to read it for a class over the summer in high school and did not enjoy it  I feel that if I were to re read it today I would love it for the brilliant piece it is   But that is the beginning of a new story    the story of the gradual renewal of a man  the story of his gradual regeneration  of his passing from one world into another  of his initiation into a new unknown life  That might be the subject of a new story  but our present story is ended  It took me a very  very long time to finish this book but it was definitely worth it  Full of misery  thoughts and tourments  the words and the conversations make you dive deep into this world of different consciousness It s all about the struggle between what is right and what is wrong  what you believe in and what others believe in  the struggle to prove yourself right and the strength to face the chaos of your heart  It took me some time to reclaim my breath reading Dostoyevsky  and probably lead me to develop a deep seated  somewhat cynical contempt for nihilism  beside Camus  I m not sure if I d be able to figuratively read it twice  with both eyes open  Crime and Punishment is actually a satisfying crime thriller  I rarely enjoyed a novel until  when I finished the book  I felt like that my life s changed a bit  You can say that it s the same feeling after you finished watching the series finale of your favourite TV show  or after you had beaten the final boss of the best video game ever you ever played  The book isn t just a crime thriller  duh    It actually contains observations and commentaries on the base nature of men  and of how radical subscription to an ideal might be as equally dangerous as having no ideals at all  It also contains Dostoyevsky s religious belief on how suffering is the only way to expiate one s sins  If you are not familiar with the Russian culture  it might be benificial if one could familiarise yourself on Russian honorifics  That might save you from being easily confused in keeping track of all the characters  Like Tolstoy  Dostoyevsky really understands human psychology  It is easy to identify with his characters  emotions  thoughts  and moods  Excellent  A book must be read by everyone  It is simple  yet it feels quite heavy to digest initially  As it gets the pace and you get immersed in the story  then it sort of becomes an addiction and you don t want to put down this book  A classic rendition and a great way to tell the story  As simple as it sounds for the present generation  this story is way ahead of its time  Author Dostoyevsky has created a character that speaks like a great philosopher  yet  he is the most aloof person  The protagonist Raskolnikov and his journey towards the punishments for the crime he has committed is splendidly superb  The adjoining characters that sails with him through the story complimented really well  Razumihin  Dounia  the police characters  Svidrigailov  Sonia  the pawnbroker lady  etc    etc    are all well portrayed  A must read book  On my list as one of the best books i have EVER read     Camus and Dostoyevsky are my two favorite authors  and this has to be considered when talking about Dostoyevsky s work  Very long  and not the easiest to read  of course  the same can be said for Tolstoy  Dickens  Austen  Victor Hugo or any of the other 19th Century novelists who get paid by the word   but well worth it    i did not find this novel as enjoyable as The Devils  or The Brothers Karamazov  but still fantastic  From my 1001 Books to Read Before you Die  Edited by Peter Boxall  reading list Dostoyevsky s multifaceted characters and continually evolving plot lead the reader seamlessly through the dominant explanations of why we do what we do  The novel is a psychological  theological  philosophical  sociological  political   economic examination of human behavior that leads to the conclusion that we are at once simple and extremely complex creatures  Exhausting and awesome   Nada posso dizer de novo sobre  Crime e Castigo   1886  de Dostoievski  e um classico  como tal escrutinado em todas as demais dimensoes que possamos imaginar  Contudo aproveitarei estas linhas para dar conta da minha experiencia com o livro  Escrito no seculo XIX nada lhe falta se comparado com o genero literario tao em voga neste nosso seculo  o thriller psicologico  Os personagens e os seus problemas desmontados como quem desmonta um relogio suico  a constante introducao de novos problemas e as suas reviravoltas  a gestao minuciosa do suspense atraves do ritmo a que cada nova informacao vai sendo revelada  E um livro escrito para nos prender  ainda que mesmo que o nao fosse  nos manteria interessados pelo seu personagem e a sua busca existencial  Nesse sentido acaba sendo uma obra intemporal  ja que o amago da discussao se prende aquilo que faz de nos seres humanos   Crime e Castigo  e um relato do mundo realizado a partir do interior de uma alma amargurada  Dostoievski coloca nos sob a pele de Raskolnikov  e faz nos sentir o peso do ser  do outro  da sociedade  E um relato imensamente poderoso  que muito deve a experiencia pessoal do autor  Em 1849 Dostoievski foi preso sob suspeita de conspiracao contra Nicolau I da Russia  Com ele foram detidos muitos outros  todos condenados a morte  No dia marcado para a execucao  ja estavam amarrados aos postes os primeiros quando chegou a ordem do Czar para comutar a pena por trabalhos forcados na Siberia  A magoa e a inquietude sem saida de todo aquele tempo  sobretudo das ultimas horas  tinham no oprimido a um ponto tal que agora se precipitava  literalmente  para a esperanca que lhe abria aquela sensacao plena  nova  integra  A sensacao acometeu o como um ataque  acendeu se lhe na alma como uma faisca e  num sopro  incendiou o todo  Tudo nele se abrandou de vez  jorraram lhe as lagrimas  Caiu de joelhos     Dostoievski   Crime e Castigo   1886 A medida que vou recuperando a leitura de classicos  e seguindo obras enaltecidas  dou me conta do quao relevante e o peso autobiografico de uma obra  Como a experiencia pessoal de sentires  vivencias  lugares  pessoas  vidas  medos e alegrias e importante no criar de lastro de sustentacao do relato de uma historia interessante  crepitante  capaz de se dar a uma total degustacao por outro ser humano  A obra imaginada  deslocada do fio de vida de quem a escreve  pode ate ser um exercicio interessante  mas dificilmente contem o detalhe necessario a reconstrucao cristalina de um espaco tempo capaz de ombrear com a obra que se recria a partir das experiencias vividas de um autor Isto explica  em parte  as razoes pelas quais certos autores conseguem por vezes fazer uma obra  de rasgo genial  mas depois nunca mais voltam a atingir picos com a mesma intensidade  Alias  isto vem de encontro a queixa do juri do premio Nobel deste ano que referiu o facto de os escritores se acomodarem ao conforto da vida com bolsas  impossibilitando o surgimento de experiencias de vida capazes de suportar novas ideias  novas abordagens  novos mundos  Mas isto nao e uma queixa apenas deste juri  para quem vive no meio  e o gere enquanto editor  sabe que isso e uma realidade  Atente se nas palavras de Bruno Vieira Amaral  autor de uma primeira obra nacional de enorme sucesso junto da critica em 2013  com varios premios  e que em entrevista nos diz que nao quer dedicar se apenas a escrita  que ira continuar a dedicar se a multiplas outras coisas  Nao quero viver da escrita  isso e uma armadilha    obriga a uma desmultiplicacao    Sei como o meio funciona    obriga a decisoes que podem ser mas a medio  longo prazo para o trabalho do escritor  Muita producao  com um ritmo que rouba a liberdade de dizer  vou escrever quando me apetecer     Bruno Vieira Amaral  in iOnline  10 2013 Isto sente se bastante quando comecamos a ler  ou a ver no caso do cinema  a obra de certos autores  nomeadamente os contemporaneos  que pouco mais fizeram na vida para alem de escrever  Ao fim de 3 ou 4 livros ficamos com a ideia que dizem sempre o mesmo  que nada mais dali se pode esperar retirar  Nao admira que criativos mais conscientes desta vicissitude da criacao artistica  pensem em renegar a arte que os consagrou  A titulo de exemplo veja se Bela Tarr  retirou se em 2011 depois de 30 anos e 9 filmes  atente se as suas palavras  Ser cineasta e um belo trabalho burgues  Mas eu realmente nao o quero fazer  Eu nao sou um verdadeiro cineasta  Eu sempre estive nisto pelas pessoas  e so queria dizer algo sobre as suas vidas  Durante 34 anos de cinema  disse tudo aquilo que queria dizer  Eu posso repetir  posso fazer uma centena de coisas  mas na verdade nao quero aborrecer vos  Nao quero copiar os meus filmes  E isto    Bela Tarr  in IndieWire  02 2012 Num sentido completamente oposto  veja se como Antonio Lobo Antunes  com 24 romances publicados  se mantem ativo  e como se processa a escrita de cada nova obra sua  Como o processo mecanico e repetitivo toma conta da vontade expressiva  transformando o pessoal em maquinal  Cada vez mais escrevo sem plano  Sento me e fico a espera de comecar a ouvir a voz  Tenho de fechar uma parte da cabeca para que a outra funcione  E a mao comeca a andar sozinha    Este livro esta pronto ha muito tempo  Nao sei  nao me lembro  So escrevi  Nao me lembro de nenhum  mesmo deste que estou a escrever  Leio a ultima linha e continuo    Antonio Lobo Antunes  in Estante  10 2014  Para ver com imagens  formatacao e links  ler em  http   virtual illusion blogspot pt 2    Perhaps the best book I have ever read  Intrigue on every page  vivid discriptions  characters jumping off the page  a true masterpiece of literature  Doestoevsky s work is absolutely phenomenal  He follows the insanity of the main protagonist  Raskolinikov  and comments on human nature  politics  psychology  and society  He contrasts the opposing sides of Raskolnikov s nature through characters  Alena vs Lizaveta and Sonya vs  Svidrigaylov and the necessity of one to the other  Normally I like books with more action  but even this book filled with interesting characters and ideas and kept me hooked until the end  You may have heard the popular saying about this novel   He commits the crime in the first pages and we are punished the rest of the novel   Nothing could be further from the truth  A truly wonderful novel that delves into the human soul and psyche to unravel the dichotomy of good and evil  Intriguing and suspenseful This novel does more  I believe  to address questions of Dostoevsky s own views on religion than his other novels   Intense  psychologically convincing  packed with ideas and great characters  I never expected it to be such a page turner  One tiny quibble  the ending felt a bit rushed A book I didn t want to end  This is a timeless piece of writing  and it was done in personal agony  Haven t we all wondered   and toyed with   what it would mean to take a principle to its ultimate point  In a world of overwhelming imperfection  our protagonist decides that the only way to prove his commitment to his conviction is to act upon it   to murder  There are fascinating aspects to the book that perhaps Dostoyevsky himself would be shocked to see in the rearview mirror  In some odd but strangely prophetic sense  his dissection of one Russian soul and its fanatic dedication to a theory presages his country s leninist and stalinist future  that to achieve the perfection foreseen for communism  any number of innocent lives can be offered as payment  If Dostoyevsky wanted us to examine more deeply the meaning of punishment as well as crime  he could not have picked a better set of characters  A family is destroyed because an alcoholic cannot make his way out of the abyss  Officials wallowing in corruption and determined to exploit human weakness sail past judgment without a care  Those who commit crimes on the largest scale in the name of creating a greater good  e g  Napoleon   Stalin 75 years later  suffer or benefit not because of the morality of what they do but because of the success or failure of their attempt  Why should this not be true for a single person then  Dostoyevsky s hero Raskolnikov asks   himself and therefore us  One hundred and fifty years after it was written  this book and its questions will remain with you for a long time   Neu vi Toi Ac va Hinh Phat nhu nguoi yeu thi co le day chinh la nguoi yeu ma khi chia tay roi

different translation than the one I ve listed  I haven t read this book since my senior year of high school  so I can t give a detailed review of it  I ll come back when I reread it  which I hope to do soon   but I think it s brilliantly written  Oh  my dear Sonya  Raskolnikov  and Dunya  I pray for your strength  Razumikhin  come  have a drink with me  Let us catch up  I must know  how are poor Katerina s children A truly excellent novel written by an authentic artist who only saw clearly and commented earnestly on the duality of   I was suprised by my reaction to this book  I read this book quickly  I just had to keep reading  I felt as though I was seeing it all through the main character s  Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov  own eyes and I was there with him  It was written by a Russian author in the 1800s  The story centers around a young man  and what consequences certain decisions actions of his lead to  There is so much more than that  but you will have to read it    It is a full journey and I think it is a journey worth taking  Excellent read  This was the first book I read by Dostoevky and I look forward to reading him again  The book was easy to read and makes you reflect on what can truly be considered good or evil  A must read for existentialists  9 10This is one of those books that I have a hard time defining why it s so good  I ll admit that there are times in the middle where my mind starts to wander  but the feeling that I m left with at the end means a whole lot more  It s like Dostoyevsky has done such a good job of placing me in each moment of Raskolnikov s journey that I empathize and understand him  even as he s going to kill someone  Then the utter insanity and eventual guilt that follow  Ultimately it has much of the setting and feel of a Dickens novel  with much more darkness and soul searching  The end is so perfect  I want to say more but shouldn t  It s a story that ebbs and flows  but has many of the same themes as Count of Monte Cristo  It s hard to make such a flawed character into someone we want to root for  Great work  takes a bit of patience  but it is well rewarded  Requiem for a Dream  Anthem for Doomed Youth  Either would work as an alternative title for a story in which protagonist Raskolnikov   fierce intellect over stimulated and under utilised   contrives and executes a plan to murder an unscrupulous pawnbroker as a sort of intellectual experiment  then starts to fall apart as his hypothesis collapses  It d hardly be much of a stretch to film a version of this in austerity era Britain  Rodion Romanovich can t afford his uni fees and is stuck in a slum while pawning his possessions  his excitable pal Razumikhin is semi employed in a series of temp jobs  and his sister Dounia is making all the wrong career and romantic choices  The doomed Marmeladov family  meanwhile  inhibit the sort of tenement that might have the family from  Shameless  as tenants  allowing for geography and time Dostoevsky s prose matches the mental anguish of Raskolnikov with a frantic and anxious prose style  hardly a page goes by without someone screaming  shouting or frothing at the mouth  It s an exhausting read  made compelling by the protagonist and his chaotic interactions with a world that doesn t   cannot   get him  The extended Svidrigailov sequence is the only part that felt like a chore  particularly so close to the end  but the nightmare hysteria of the St Petersburg slums is a must read  One of my favourite books of all time    I LOVED this book  My college age daughter suggested it as she read it in AP Lit 12  It is about crime but more about self punishment  It is about crime but also about the justification of crime in the mind of the criminal  It is about love  Bu kitabi okuyan insanla okumayan insan bir degildir  Bence konu bu kadar basit  I would give this brilliant masterwork by Dostoevsky more stars if I could This is the story of a man intensly divided in his mind  completely crushed by poverty and squalor  but possesses an intellectual caliber so lofty  it gives rise to pride and ego quite difficult to handle   view spoiler   Set in the great city of St  Petersburg during pre evolutionary 18th century Russia  and through an unusual combination of circumstances and ideals  Raskolnikov  our main protagonist  is incited to murder In a belief which when closely examined might not seem so addled  he comes to the conclusion that humanity is divided into two segments  those with the ability to bring utilitarian good  and those without it  He argues that there exists an echelon of Napoleon like men  who are allowed to transgress laws because in doing so  they bring about a desirable result for all  Also  in the success of their initiatives  old rules are demolished and new ones are set  allowing them to transcend punishment  The same concept follows the idea of revolutionaries who  in succeeding to overthrow standing government  punish other revolutionaries who try to oust them  even though it is the same process once used to achieve their own goals Once the murder is committed  and perhaps even before so  Raskolnikov begins his journey of suffering  punishment  and for the least part  atonement   hide spoiler  I really don t know where to begin with the review of this novel  Every single aspect brought forth by Dostoevsky has a purpose and a meaning  The characters have such rich and colorful psychological profiles  the symbolic dreams of Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov  each dealing with issues brought on by their subconscious minds and leading them to action  the weak mindedness of Katerina Ivanovna as she wastes away because of her intense suffering  not to mention consumption   the extreme smoothness of Porfiry Petrovich in his battle of wits with Raskolnikov  Marmeladov s story which sets the tone for the entire plot with a heartrending account of his family s troubles  brought on solely by himself  And Sonya  dear poor timid Sonya  forced to prostitute herself to support her family  consisting of her drunken  irresponsible and masochistic father  Marmeladov   her hysterical and delirious step mother  Katerina Ivanovna   and her underfed  dirty step siblings There are also all sorts of themes  motifs  and symbols in the book  the color yellow for instance  associated with dirtiness and poverty  and later on symbolizing guilt and insanity  The crossing of bridges  as if crossing over into a different realm of mentality for Raskolnikov  Crossroads  and their implication of a turning point  Going to America  being associated with a place for the guilty to escape  Alienation from society  the crudeness of the typical Russian peasant  the psychology of crime and punishment  how a criminal in reality longs to be caught and punished because deep inside  he harbors guilt  Dostoevsky s unconventional nihilism makes its way and shows itself tremendously in the character of Raskolnikov  his utter disregard for social order and the emotions of others  as well as his dialogue with other characters in the book This is the second book I ve read for Dostoevsky  the first being The Brothers Karamazov and some people would insist on the superiority of the former to the latter  I ve spent quite a bit of time considering this  and have decided that even though murder is a large part of both novels  such a comparison cannot be made  To start with  they are both of different genres  Crime and Punishment being a psychological drama  and The Brothers Karamazov being realist fiction  second the themes and motifs presented in each are completely different from each other  for Crime and Punishment it s the points I ve mentioned above  while for Karamazov  it s the conflict of faith and doubt  moral responsibility and its possible roots in religion  as well as the burden of free will  The nature of the protagonists is completely different as well  Raskolnikov being a misanthrope  an outcast of society disliked by most people who chance to meet him  while Alyosha Karamazov is the closest embodiment of an angel on earth  pure in spirit and going about charming one person after another  They are simply different animals A great pleasure indeed  If you re going to read this book  and I beg you to do so  please read the unabridged translation by Richard Pevear and his wife Larissa Volokhonsky  I urge you to check out The Brothers Karamazov as well  it is also well worth your time  My favorite classic of all time  Just how deep the author goes into Raskolnikov s psyche is amazing  Full Review  http   bookshelves infinity tumblr co     It s my first experience reading Dostoevsky which I ve totally enjoyed  Shat dzhvar verjats rets i ow p akets i girk e Shat dzhvar ei

favourite book of all time  the way Dostoyevsky is able to pull you in and take you on a downward spiral into madness is brilliant  I can t recommend this book enough  Great themes wonderfully developed in this claustrophobic story  I was struck  however  by the protagonist deciding the girl deserved to be murdered as a freak of nature for being 5  10   as I am   and that his old  old mother was in her early 40s  I always found this book exceptional for the multitude of voices that it is written in and the incredible atmosphere that just holds a reader captive  This translation is fantastic   I was laying on the couch in my parent s house reading this book one summer evening and I fell asleep  My mom came home and touched my shoulder  and whispered   Albin  wake up   In the second it took to open my eyes  I had convinced myself that I killed two people but I could face my mom because they both deserved to die  This book will get in your head  It took me a while to read this  mainly because you have to give it your absolute full attention or risk missing something crucial  I picked it up in anticipation of a lengthy plane trip because I thought it had been too long since I read a really good book  Six weeks after the trip  I just finished it  and am now devastated to have to finally put it down after growing quite attached to it over those hours of reading  It fulfilled all my fantasies  It is beautifully written in a translation that very rarely reminds you that the original was written nearly 150 years ago  It is the ultimate crime detective novel  exploring all the great themes and elaborated in a way that made me gasp out loud at regular intervals  The plot is intricate and full of unexpected twists and turns  The characters are extraordinary and end up linked to one another in amazing ways  It has been a great distraction from time otherwise spent watching the world end      I remember sitting in the woods smoking a cigar and sweating while I read this book during the summer before 11th grade  It was intense and I loved it  Definitely need to read it again sometime   Brilliant Dostoyevsky took us on a psychological tour of the mind of a criminal before  during and after the double murders were committed  Dostoyevsky explored the circumstances that push a person to cross the line  Abject poverty  Unrealistic expectation  Societal and family pressure  Delusions of grandeur  Whatever the reasons  these ciminals that do succumb to temptations or pressure and crossed the line  some like Raskolnicov would find because God provided them with interventions from angels like Sonja  With the immense and patient self sacrifical love from the down trodden but virtuos  Sonja  Dostoyevsky soul was turned and lead to a place where there was light  warmth and redemption   Ok  this one took about 150 pages to really get into  mostly because it was difficult to follow the switching of names due to the translation  After that point not only did the story really pick up  but I felt I could really follow the story smoothly  This one is definitely a fantastic story by a great author  It just requires a real time and concentration commitment  Now this is where you start with Dostoevsky  I may have erred on the side of anticipation in first reading THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV  but CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is really where I d recommend one to start with the Russian Master  CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is fantastic for a slew of reasons  not the least of which is its compulsive readability  I don t mean at all to say that the translation was trite  and it isn t  Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky are renowned for their true to form Dostoevsky translations  or the concepts simplistic  this is just a case of one experiencing intrigue with a book of great ideas and insights The premise of the book is nothing less than the examination of what drives and shapes an intellectual murderer  Dostoevsky begins his  novel in six parts with epilogue  with an examination of the killer s state of mind before the criminal act  The reader meets Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov one day before the act occurs and examines his motivations  We first learn that he harbors a self centered opinion of the world around him  In nearly every interaction he believes himself to be the motivation  An example of this occurs early on when Raskolnikov reads a letter from his mother and deigns that both her decisions as well as his sister  Dunya s  are motivated by the desire to bolster his well being  A second aspect of Raskolnikov  and probably the most notable  is his inability to connect with others  Raskolnikov craves a connection with humanity but always finds himself at an arm s length  never fully capable of true companionship  The greatest driving force behind this disconnect is Raskolnikov s belief that he is an intellectual rung above the masses  In most interactions Raskolnikov is forced to reckon with what he believes is the fact that he has a greater capacity to understand the world than his fellow man  As a result  he is never fully able to connect The first part of the novel concludes with the consummation of Raskolnikov s crime  the murders of Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta  It is slowly revealed  primarily through a published article entitled  On Crime   that Raskolnikov s world view consists of the notion that there exists two types of people in the world  the ordinary and the extraordinary  The ordinary people  according to Raskolnikov  exist merely to procreate and abide by the rules the extraordinary set  The extraordinary people do just that  interpret the world and set the rules and regulations by which the rest of the population live  As a result  Raskolnikov determines that the extraordinary set is thereby  exempt  from the laws of society for the sake of their world changing ideas  Desperately  Raskolnikov envisions himself a member of this latter set  In order to effectuate his notion  he decides to kill Alyona Ivanovna  an old  crone  who is essentially a shyster pawnbroker  in order to rob her  As a result  Raskolnikov believes that he will be eliminating a louse in order to benefit others  Terminologically speaking  he wishes to accomplish an act of utilitarianism  his great contribution to the world As the novel progresses  however  Raskolnikov comes to the realization that he may not be a member of his purported  extraordinary set   Instead of feeling bolstered with purpose  Raskolnikov is burdened with paranoia and suppressed with guilt after the murders take place  He not only tortures himself with his guilt  but at the same time plays a tormented game of cat and mouse with the police investigator  Porfiry Petrovich  who sees through his psychosis early on  Ultimately  and through Dostoevsky s great skill for suspenseful writing  Raskolnikov s works himself toward his ultimate confession of the crime Motivating Raskolnikov s confession and assumed redemption is Sonya  the daughter of the peripheral but pivotal character Marmelodiov  a girl who has sacrificed herself to a life of prostitution in order to support her family  Sonya is motivated by her religion and love for her fellow human being  notably Raskolnikov  Through the companionship she demonstrates throughout the novel and epilogue Raskolnikov is able to come to terms with his need for human comraderie and submits to his love for Sonya  His ultimate submission gives the reader hope that Raskolnikov not only feels actual remorse for his crime  but will actually atone for it as well Raskolnikov s story is wrought with insight into the human condition  which is in fact  the decisive lure of this book  Dostoevsky has such an excellent grasp of what motivates a person to do the unthinkable act of murder that the reader cannot help but be intrigued  The text is ample with characters that each act according to the code that the human condition requires  rendering the text originally published in Russian in 1866 timeless and universal  For anyone interested in deepening his her understanding of the human condition I would certainly recommend beginning withCRIME AND PUNISHMENT   Utter genius  I understand poverty  I understand the anxiety of being a powerless female in a patriarchal society  I understand the agonies of having a male family member who is mentally ill  yet he is nominally in charge of the family and finances  and how  as a woman  one can only  desperately  hang onto his coat tails in a feeble attempt to hold back the wild insane tantrums which are devastating whatever future the family may have had  I have  however  no sympathy for such a cruel mind as the main protagonist in this famous book  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov   whose name means  a schism  or split   raskolnik  is  one who splits  or  dissenter   the verb raskalyvat  means  to cleave    to chop   to crack   to split  or  to break   The former translations clarify the literal meaning of the word  The figurative meaning of the word is  to bring to light    to make to confess or acknowledge the truth   etc   per Wikipedia http   en wikipedia org wiki Crime_an     Raskolnikov murders in a dreadful manner  using an ax  an old tough woman who earns her living as a pawnbroker  Alyona Ivanovna  and her sweet natured sister  Lizaveta  who walked into her sister s apartment unexpectedly during the chaotic and stupid murder  Raskolnikov thinks the pawnbroker is disgusting  evil  but she struck me as an entrepreneur earning her living as competently as she knew  It is obvious the author is also aware of the innocence of the murder victims  but I wonder at the psychological intensity and authentic exploration of Raskolnikov s twisted intelligence and spiteful hatred  How does Fyodor Dostoevsky appear to be so intimately educated about such a mind  But of course  I wonder at how the author is also spot on psychologically with every one of his characters in the novel  He is an incredibly astute creator of the internal mechanics of all of his characters  and by the end of the book  everyone  not only the god wannabe Raskolnikov  is as known to the reader as much as real family members The book is about the whack job Raskolnikov and his extremely impoverished 19th century St  Petersburg environment  friends  family and acquaintances  Wherever he goes  we readers follow  with a few digressions into the minds and activities of people he meets and knows  The character I most identified with was  Dunya  Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov s sister  but most of my sympathy was with  Sonya  Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov  who was forced into prostitution as a teen to support her family  I am also a fan of Dmitri Prokofych Razumikhin  student friend of Raskolnikov  a gentle intelligent man of feelings who helps modestly when he is able  If Raskolnikov hadn t been such a despicable pig  the character I would have most hated is the alcoholic Semyon Zakarovich Marmeladov  Sonya s stepfather  Sonya s poor mother  Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladov  dying of consumption  with small children to raise  also had my heart in a painful grip of sympathy  Though the despair and madness of her illness caused her to behave harshly  she was very understandably grasping at what little dignity and hope she could muster under the most desperate of circumstances  She convinced Sonya to become a prostitute  getting a  yellow card  from the authorities because it is the only way for the family to buy food and shelter  Even so  Marmeladov  the drunk  steals what little money Katerina is able to hide and goes out to drink up every kopek  leaving his wife and babies to starve for days  He is not a complete monster  as none of the characters are  Unlike today s novels  especially genre thrillers and mysteries  these and all other characters in the novel are full fleshed and three dimensional  not sketched out with broad strokes immediately recognizable from our familiarity with this century s stock actors  not that there is anything wrong with that   The most shocking character is Nikolai Dementiev  a painter who was working in an apartment downstairs from the murder victims  He IS a revelation  Nikolai confesses to the murder despite having nothing to do with the killings except for being in the area and a suspect for a time  What I found amazing is such false confessions occurred for crimes in the 19th century and these people were well known to police in Russia  as they are to the Western world today Human nature does not change  however disgusting  heroic  ordinary or desperate a person s responses may be  The characters Dostoevsky writes about are all easily recognizable to me even though they are Russian and lived more than a hundred years in the past during the czar Alexander III s reign  As difficult as reading this densely populated and lengthy examination of the individuals living in an urban Russian neighborhood  with the exception of serfs and aristocrats  who are the only groups of people missing from the story  can be  I thought it as rewarding and illuminating to read as watching relatives and co workers or being married for a long time  Grinding poverty clearly is the motivating factor behind every character s decisions  which the author thoughtfully examines and explores with all of the intelligence that literary genius writers of classics are capable  Romantic solutions are offered  but in no way is this a romantic book  People live up to their expectations  which is the tragedy and the beauty of being human  Dostoevsky captures the entire array of the possibilities humans think to absolve or involve themselves in schemes  ideas and actions  seeking ways to maneuver around  with and for people and yet financially support themselves with minimal loss of self respect or harm to others   except Raskolnikov Raskolnikov believes in a theory he developed on his own  using elements from history  psychology and philosophy  He is a great admirer of Napoleon   http   en wikipedia org wiki Napoleon   and believes himself to be like his hero  or in fact  his deluded ideas about his hero  whom he thinks was a great man because he willfully and with historical purpose ignored the laws and mores of society  The theory he develops  which the murder of the pawnbroker he hoped would demonstrate  is that some men  supermen  actually  do not have normal emotions or needs  Instead  being smarter and emotionally stronger than the average citizen  they have a responsibility to history and society to take upon themselves the powers of life and death beyond sentiment  morality or law  In murdering Alyona Ivanovna  symbol of an abuser of necessity and need  he is testing his imagined likeness to his hero  Napoleon  and he hopes to wake the sleeping lion king within  moving on to further successes and leadership of men lesser than himself These ideas are not unfamiliar   Nietzsche  http   en wikipedia org wiki Friedric     apparently began writing about his ideas in 1870  but the reader should be reminded  Crime and Punishment  was written in 1866  before some well known philosophers and nations actually tried on portions of these ideas for governance and genocide with the resultant horrific outcomes with which we are familiar  Most remarkable to me are the odd coincidences and similarities between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky s life  and even more weird  plot   On 3 January 1889  Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse  Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of Turin  What happened remains unknown  but an often repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto  ran to the horse  threw his arms up around its neck to protect it  and then collapsed to the ground   A nightmare Raskolnikov has in the book is very much the same The link below is the best short analysis in my opinion  and it accurately describes exactly what the book seemed to be about to me http   www sparknotes com lit crime c    view spoiler  This section is one I completely agree with  and I cannot say it better NihilismNihilism was a philosophical position developed in Russia in the 1850s and 1860s  known for  negating more   in the words of Lebezyatnikov  It rejected family and societal bonds and emotional and aesthetic concerns in favor of a strict materialism  or the idea that there is no  mind  or  soul  outside of the physical world  Linked to nihilism is utilitarianism  or the idea that moral decisions should be based on the rule of the greatest happiness for the largest number of people  Raskolnikov originally justifies the murder of Alyona on utilitarian grounds  claiming that a  louse  has been removed from society  Whether or not the murder is actually a utilitarian act  Raskolnikov is certainly a nihilist  completely unsentimental for most of the novel  he cares nothing about the emotions of others  Similarly  he utterly disregards social conventions that run counter to the austere interactions that he desires with the world  However  at the end of the novel  as Raskolnikov discovers love  he throws off his nihilism  Through this action  the novel condemns nihilism as empty  from Spark Notes  Naturally  Raskolnikov discovers his untested supposition about the likeness to Napoleon he believes himself to be leads him down dark alleys of conscience he never knew existed in his soul once he commits murder  However  when he realizes that the nervous anxieties  which he also was aware existed within himself  are not sated or satisfied by being able to kill  he feels great gusts of disgust and self hatred  believing himself to be a failure because of his apparent bourgeois mediocrity  rather than from any sense of remorse   hide spoiler  I did not see a single thing to admire or love about Raskolnikov  His neurotic insanities are not excused by poverty  starvation or any horror of the society he lives in  His innermost desire is to transcend poverty and ignorance through enhancing psychopathic tendencies  instead of nurturing and helping the weak  His way is not self sacrifice  as Sonya does  or practical informed morality as Dunia symbolizes  or hopeful anxiety as his mother uses to maneuver  He isn t s sensualist as Svidrigailov shows himself to be  or a solid  mediocrity  as he would define his friend Razumikhin to be  Raskolnikov s madness is not that of Katerina s  brought on by physical disease  or even that of Marmeladov  helpless alcoholic  He has no desire to be of assistance to humanity or for excitements of the chase  as the police  Instead  he poisons himself with theory and arid intellectual ideas  emphasizing alienation from and superiority over the common man   view spoiler   Hopefully  Sonya will be able to bring out the other side of his nature which he has worked so horribly to suppress  She follows him to Siberia after he is sentenced to prison for 8 years  and with a great deal of love and perseverance  as well as acceptance of her lot and choices  she seems to break through to the Raskolnikov who  before he decided on the attempt to become another Napoleon  as he perceived Napoleon the celebrity to be   he begins to thaw  possibly  into regret  sorrow and love  He had shown a kinder  gentler self in several heroic acts of bravery and generosity of spirit previous to isolating himself from his family and friends  So  gentle reader  I can say the book ends on a hopeful tone    Maybe    hide spoiler  This is a great read  I loved it  It is the real  masterpiece  kind of literary writing that I think writers  such as Mauve Binchy  for example  dimly echo in their simple character driven stories   Yes  laugh at me if you must  but to me it was as if this book was the Plato  allegory of the cave  http   en wikipedia org wiki Allegory    original  reality form  that Binchy s books kinda copy in a dumbed down fashion  I can t help it  but that is what my mind kept leaping to as I read  I know  I m an idiot  but did I ever say I wasn t  I never promised I am a towering intellect like the authors I presume to review  The world is indeed a peculiar place  but do

this book  it felt like it changed me    took me to dark places  made me feel like I was growing  I love that feeling  especially when it doesn t feel cheesy or snobby  Incredible  Love conquers all  in this most extraordinary of love stories Young law student  Raskolnikov  deeply affected by the suffering of humanity to which he  bows down   formulates an ethical view that gives  extraordinary  people with the capacity for saying something new  the right to commit breaches of morality and crimes for the benefit of humanity An unlikely criminal  Raskolnikov assumes this right for himself and murders an old woman whom he regards as  a louse  a useless  loathsome  harmful creature  with the aim to use the money stolen to improve his position in life for the benefit of humanity  Unplanned  her timid and idiotic younger sister is also murdered when she encounters him red handed on the murder scene Following the double homicide  Raskolnikov descends into a hell of anguish  His terrible suffering seeks relief by admission  but he fears the consequences  The frightening trajectory of his conscience to finding relief plays out in a thrilling intrigue of Raskolnikov s interaction with those he loves and those he hates  A manic storytelling style  sometimes verging on the incoherent  is brilliantly used by Dostoevsky to evoke in the reader the dark and frightening anguish experienced by Raskolnikov Desparate for relief  Raskolnikov admits his terrible crime to Sonia  a kind  gentle and loving Christian girl  humiliated into prostitution by life wrenching poverty  Raskolnikov tries but fails to provide a reasonable justification of his crime to Sonia  but with infinite love she offers to suffer with him and together with him to bear their cross Sonia s love empowers Raskolnikov with the courage to also admit his crime to the authorities and face the consequences  Ultimately  at first hand  Raskolnikov receives and is revitalised by the love of the cross The most extraordinary of love stories  based on the archetype of Christian love  There are many books   And then there is this one book  It isn t my favourite by any long shot  But  I am awed by it  by the way it has been written  by the characters  by the descriptions  by the utter simplicity of language and yet  its density  I have not read enough of Dostoyevsky to give a detailed review  but this book  is a story  really  This book makes you think  and not only about deep stuff  just think about things we all have thought about sometime or the other and never shared with anyone  This man  hoewever  wrote characters who he exposed  or tried to  with a surgical precision which is scary  It took me a long time to read it  At times  I just put it down  too frustrated by the density of description and its length  But never did I think about discontinuing reading Reading this book began as a challenge to self  it soon became an inevitability I think there is a particular time to read certain books  I am glad I picked this one at the right moment   Finalmente l ho finito  Sento che qualsiasi mio commento sminuirebbe la portata monumentale e sempre attuale dell opera  Capolavoro assoluto che va letto almeno una volta nella vita    An excellent book  although I found the ending rather disappointing My tip for reading this book is to do a quick read online about Russian naming practices first  Each character is referred to by several different names  but if you read up on Russsian naming practices first you will understand the novel more easily  Amazing book  Some of the scenes depicted had me on the verge of tears  Really delves into the mind of Raskolnikov and you feel his struggle just as he does  It was also interesting to see how the other characters around him develop and change as they meet  Superb book  Thought provoking story  I was kind of bored with the long conversation but the style of writing and topic are interesting     dlswzy  chr dltn brym bswzd

crafts such complex  interesting characters and delves deep into their thoughts  Raskolnikov is a prideful  cynical man who commits a coldhearted murder  but he is also innately generous and idealistic  although an unlikely hero  you find yourself rooting for him  So  first of all if I d ever have to mention a book that is closest to perfection  Crime and Punishment would be it   although I don t mean it s my favourite book but it s the most complex and yet whole story I ve held in my hands  I mean  the story was overall brilliant  especially the beginning when it was only about Raszkolnyikov was the best  Though then I didn t really understand him and what the author would like to express with his character  Then later when all those side characters came to the plot the whole story felt a bit out of place  however not a singular word was wasted on excess details  The mood in the beginning returned in the end when Rogya went back to the police station or whatever for the second time and confessed everything  And in the epilogue the ending was really the happiest this story could bear and it was also relieving  By the way I m pretty much sure Death Note got the inspiration from this book  Tortuosa liberacion nihilista   This was a little easier to get through than The Brothers Karamizov and I  got it  more so than The Brother Karamazov  I repeat my comments for that book   Incredible in many ways   incredibly depressing  incredibly written  incredibly long  incredibly dense  incredibly complex    It would be too depressing for me now  but when I was young  depressed  full of angst  looking for some sort of identity  and trying to make up for not reading enough as a child and a young andolsecent  it was perfect  I do love the Russians  but Jesus     this one will really bring you down Didn t we have to read it in H  School  Well  I must ve skimmed it then It s so good and so hard and will make you go crazy   This is the most riveting piece of literature that i have ever read  I thought Capote was a lyrical genuious but Dyostevosky is committed to making ever sentence sound like a lyric on a page  I really coudl not put this boko down  I am glad that i read it now as an adult rather than reading it in high school or in college  I don t think that I will ever forget the complexity and personal struggles that Raskolnikov faced  This book is unforgettable   4 5 ish  I am a happy person  We all have moods  and I probably spend some time feeling moody like anyone else  But I could say that I am  on the whole  a happy person who is content with his life  his family  and his faith Then why does Dostoevsky speak to me the way he does  I could get lost in his misery any day of the week  I am equally drawn to the tempestuous  minor chords of Rachmaninoff s concertos or the twisted wreckage of Klimpt s ornamented nudes  so perhaps it s no surprise that I would be comfortable in the gray mire of Dostoevsky s moral and philosophical musings  Because I really eat it up I loved this book  I don t even know if love is something one is supposed to feel for such a book  But I did  Can t say which I loved more  this or Karamazov  Both are pillars supporting the roof of literary history  Tuve como tarea  leer este libro para mi clase de Logica juridica  y he aqui la conclusion de mi ensayo  Este libro me parecio muy interesante  porque refleja de una manera muy directa la realidad que vivimos dia a dia  El hecho de que muchas personas tengan bajos recursos economicos  las puede impulsar a cometer actos  desesperados  que pueden haber sido realizados de manera consciente o inconsciente  pero que a final de cuentas tiene un efecto negativo en los demas  Ademas de que encontramos un claro ejemplo de que muchas veces las personas que tienen de cierta forma algun  poder   ya sea economico o de cualquier otro tipo  utilizan esto a su favor y se aprovechan de las necesidades de los que no tienen nada  Por ultimo creo que la culpa que Raskolnikov es un ejemplo de   El fin no justifica los medios  ya que no importa que tan mal se haya sentido despues de haber llevado a cabo los asesinatos  lo hecho  hecho estaba y tenia que cumplir un castigo por los actos que realizo   The Vintage Publishing edition is much better but this was the book that made me fall in love with Russian Lit  Dostoevysky does an amazing job at telling a tale of a man tormented by the guilt of his crime  If you liked Poe s  Tell Tale Heart  then think of Crime and Punishment as a very extended and more detailed version of it  One of my favorites  Crime and Punishment is a compelling and complex novel that not only explores a deplorable act of violence  but also the possible psychology behind the crime  Raskolnikov  the protagonist  is a victim of society in many ways  Although he is of above average intelligence  he is poor  without employment  and has left university  It is perhaps his intellect allows him to fantasize over the act of murder without any moral or legal consequences  Raskolnikov entertains the idea that some men are able to kill others without consequence for the greater advancement of society   this theory being largely based on Napoleon  who was remembered for his incredible feats and not the people he slayed  It is with this theory in mind Raskolnikov murders an old pawnbroker and her sister in their apartment  Thereafter he is terrified that his guilt will betray him to his friends and the authorities  This terror is widely observed by Raskonlikov s friends  family and the inscrutable police inspector Porfiry which thrusts Raskolnikov into a dangerous game of wits  It is truly a magnificent story of depravity  psychology  and redemption   My all time favourite book  I read it many years ago and still is my first peek when I am asked which book is my favourite  The way Dostoyesvsky surprises all the psychological fights of Raskolnikov  his demons which torment him up to the point that he goes mad and gives him his so searched soul peace only at the point that you don t think is possible to find it anymore   this is a masterpiece about men and life While I would never have liked this book as a pleasure read  I found that I was enamored with it as a close read  a book I had to study  analyze  and report on  It drew me in with its fantastic diction and the vivid nature of the world Dostoyevsky creates  I will always consider this book one of my favorites   I read this once a year and every time it hits me differently  but always amazingly  An incredible work that makes you fall in love with the main character for the same reasons you should despise him  Everyone in the world should read this book  for it exposes motives for actions  good and evil at conflict in one being  the ideas of self destruction through being overly conscious of one s self and the world that one lives in  and the idea of salvation through both selfish and self submissive actions and thoughts  Read it and your life will never be the same again  Seriously  It was a rewarding experience to read this book  I am sure my meager review is not going to do any justice to it  so I won t pretend to write about how Dostoevsky reaches into unlit recesses  dark has a negative tinge to it  of human mind and how masterfully he has constructed a great novel out of a story which otherwise could have been just a melodrama  Instead I would just mention my reading experience  Normally it is tough for me to concentrate and read anything over 15 20 pages at a stretch at a noisy place  but I read this book s fifth part in one sitting in a crowded cafe  To say that the poignant tale of Raskolnikov and Katerina Ivanovna is gripping would be a gross understatement  It might sound strange  but it almost affects you physically  Very few passages from any other book that I ve read so far would rival its effect I wanted to read through to sixth  last  part  but was simply too overwhelmed to continue  May be it was due to the dark and gloomy December evening outside combined with the purest melancholy that Dostoevsky can summon in his words or the fact that I ve seen someone suffer through the same psychological symptoms as that of Katerina Ivanovna or the combination of the two  It is hard to say  It is hard to describe the anguish that transcends your petty personal sorrows and troubles  Perhaps only a melancholy raaga played on a Violin or Lata s masterly sad songs of the  50s would come close  Such experiences are rare  I can only be grateful  A super classic  Nobody  but nobody has ever managed a deeper psychological thriller  I read that a long time ago  in my 20s  and I still remember as if I had read it yesterday    Ben  Bu kitabin sonunda aglamakli olduysam  sizin ne gibi duygular yasayabileceginizi hayal edemiyorum   This has to be one of my favorite  classics     after suffering from War and Peace  to discover that I could ravish every moment of a famous Russian novel was really a glorious thing  And this is glory in novel form  I love  love love it  LOVE it  I would go to the gym in Moscow  sit on the reclining bike and read for a straight hour of cardio and never had enough  Awesome  So  if you haven t read any Russian lit and you re choosing between Tolstoy and them other bitchez  THIS IS THE WAY TO GO   I haven t read much others yet  I m sure they re good too  But this one rocks my casbah   A beautifully translated classic  Dostoevsky is brilliant in his depiction of the inner psyche of a desperate  criminal   His deft prose enables the reader to live the mind of the protagonist  I broke into a cold sweat when Raskolnikov was in a tense situation  adrenalin pours through my own veins when he is caught up with the police  This book should be studied by anyone who is into criminal law or psychology  Este libro me encanto en toda la extension de la palabra  Lo ame  ame la trama y sobretodo el desarrollo psicologico de Raskolnikov  un personaje del que me enamore sin saber muy bien porque  Me encantaba que fuera una mente tan perdida y que sin embargo pudiera sentir compasion o amor  Me encantaba el amor incondicional que le demostraba a Sonia  o a su hermana  Me encanto la forma en que Dostoyevsky demuestra la sociedad y los crimenes y el castigo en si  A mi manera de ver  demuestra mas como es que la persona que comete el crimen se castiga a si mismo y no como la sociedad lo castiga  Me encanto   Favorite book of all time  i own like 10 copies of it and have read it at least 20 times   The Russian Bible     Dostoievski est la seule personne qui m ait appris quelque chose en psychologie      Friedrich Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche called Dostoyevsky  the only psychologist     from whom I had something to learn  he ranks among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in my life  Hermann cautioned that to read him is like a  glimpse into the havoc  The Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun wrote that  no one has analysed the complicated human structure as Dostoyevsky  His psychologic sense is overwhelming and visionary   Grande livro  escrita intensa  cheia de pormenores que conseguem levar nos as cenas do romance  A personagem Raskolnikov e Sonia sao fantasticas  E um livro obrigatorio na biblioteca e na nossa mente   It s pronounced as Dosto v fesky   Now  one of those works on psychology  which makes you  many a times while reading  suddenly close the book to grasp the depth and relevance of what you just read and say out loud  O Fuck  This is sacred    The book deals with criminal psychology and what goes behind a criminal mind  For those who don t already know this also is a masterpiece of existentialism  infact one of the first works on the theme  The element of absurd appears many a times and is pretty palpable by the book ends  No doubt Camus and Sartre received their motivation from this work  Nietzsche also praised the book for it s psychological element  I guess that marks the final test of quality that this masterpiece proudly owes to its readers  So go ahead purchase your copy and read this great work by Dosoyevsky   Excellently constructed psychological tale about a man who deems himself above any kinds of crime and punishment  and the consequences of such dangerous thoughts in a society unable to detach itself from convention  Definitely not a light read  but a worthwile one  Borjade lasa med installningen att den har boken maste man pressa sig igenom  sa fel man kan ha  Otroligt fascinerande bild av manniskans natur och svar att lagga ifran sig  One of the best books I have ever read  Great read Lots of insight  Amazing drama Dostoevsky allows you to plunge deep into a criminals mind and think what he thinks  feel what he feels  and see what he sees   lzlt  r   n l db lrwsy    db m qbl lthwr  lblshfy    hw   Zm m  ntjth lbshry  mn  db l  lywm  hdh  db nsny bmtyz  w n dwstwyfsky hw   mq w hm rwdh blnsb  ly  lm

is a murderer  but because he spends so much time whining  desperately wondering whether or not he s important  It s like every boy we ever dated  or thought about dating  in high school  But  the brilliance of the book shines through anyway  through each character attempting to cobble together some  sometimes delusional  sense of being something  It s his secondary characters that won me over  especially poor Katerina Ivanovna  and which document Dostoyevsky s singular talent of psychological portrait  I still prefer the Idiot  and also the Brothers K  but this is an excellent book  It takes a lot of effort  but it s worth it  Dostoyevsky s legendary book was all it was cracked up to be  Suspenseful  engaging  and thought provoking  I felt Rodion s quest from his early crime to his eventual acknowledgement of its punishment  apt title  this one  to its conclusion to be extraordinarily well written and beautifully told through Constance Garrett s translation  Dostoyevsky had a way of describing facial movements with incredible skill  As the characters displayed their emotions  the details given were crystal clear and easy to visualize  That aspect alone made this a wonderful book  not to mention its excellent narrative  The edition I read also had masterful woodcuts by one of my favorite illustrators  Fritz Eichenberg  Together  Dostoyevsky  Garrett and Eichenberg united to make this one wonderful read  i remember being 16 and reading this book in one long session  i didn t sleep that night  but lay awake unable to stop reading  it will always remain my measure of a novel  my only regret is that i had to read a translation  more of this stuff would fix our public schools and a rising generation of kids who think that reading has to do with the terse communication and screen of a cell phone   my apologies to those younger people who do actually read books deeper than harry potter  and at least  thank heaven  there is harry potter    There isn t much wrong with this book  This is probably one of the best novels ever written  The villain is the main character  but he other than the crime he committs he is a normal man that we can all relate to  The journey on which his guilt takes him has tragic consequences for more than just the main character  A MUST read  I had to read this book for a university class a couple years ago  and I ve rarely felt so pleased to be forced to read a book  Before I read it  someone who had already read some of Dostoyevsky s works suggested that I should read it while in a  19th century Russian state of mind    which I tried   and I really enjoyed the book  in fact  I seem to recall that I found certain parts of it funny I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in human nature  and why people do the things they do    Aci ve uzuntu  engin bir bilinc ve derin bir yurek icin her zaman zorunludur        Bence gercekten buyuk insanlar  buyuk acilar cekmek zorundadirlar    Onlarca alti

em devaneios ficara perturbado pelos seus proprios demonios  diria que Rodia tinha 3 opcoes  Se matar  Se entregar ou ainda  enlouquecer o que terminaria por ser uma morte da consciencia  Somente um psicopata consegue se safar disso  para pessoas normais tal coisa seria impossivel  Tremendo livro  Quando Porfirio  Juiz de Instrucao  falou a nosso Rodia que ele era como uma borboleta que rodopiava no fogo crepitante e que Porfirio seria o fogo e que por experiencia propria ele bem o sabe que as borboletas sempre vao de encontro ao fogo e terminam chamuscadas Tambem compreendi como o amor e capaz de ressuscitar um homem morto da sua consciencia  Da ideia nefasta ao crime tremendo  o amor ressuscita o pior dos homens   Increible como Dostoyevsky ha conseguido sumergirme en este libro  Es como si viera con mis propios ojos cada suceso  como si yo misma hiciera esas reflexiones  tuviera esas inquietudes  esos miedos y esas seguridades  Los personajes son muy completos y estan muy bien tratados psicologicamente  los escenarios  perfectamente descritos  Un halo de oscuridad rodea toda la historia  Es complicado explicar como ha hecho que me sienta este libro  y eso me gusta  El final me ha dejado buen sabor de boca  aunque mucha curiosidad  The second  classic lit  book to really drag me in and not let me go til it was finished  I lived within this book for several days  feeling quite paranoid and completly unable to escape its world when I emerged for meals or school  What an amazing book  I must compare translations  Buku ini hanya ada satu di perpust SMA saya dulu  Makanya tidak bisa dipinjam n juga tidak bisa dibaca sekaligus sampai selesai  Tetapi saya akhirnya dapat menyelesaikan membaca cerita ini semasa kuliah  Ceritanya tentang seorang mahasiswa rantau di St  Petersburg yang membunuh wanita tua  Di sana terdapat pemikiran yang rada filosofis tentang bagaimana si pelaku boleh membunuh si wanita tua karena si wanita tua adalah lintah darat  Apakah ia diperbolehkan membunuh  Bagaimana ia dikejar kejar perasaan bersalah  dan kemudian menyerahkan diri kepada tangan hukum  Menarik  I consider this a personal triumph to finally have conquered this novel  This is a disturbing and provocative look into the mind of a killer  primarily because it makes the act seem so possible  A psychological thriller that s definitely worth the effort  An absolutely amazing book comparable to  The Picture of Dorian Gray  in its thoughtful and haunting examination of the human conscience  This book became my friend as I read it  and I ll miss it until the next time   So I m embarrassed that it took me so long to get around to reading this book  It was fantastic  There were so many surprises throughout  Humor  intrigue  insanity  and brutal crime  as I told my sister quite glibly after finishing it yesterday afternoon  it was Law   Order  St  Petersburg  I think I heard the  buh buh  at the beginning      i read this when i was just out of college  dostoevskys unpretentious philosophical outlooks are almost accidental in his telling of this and other tales as well  a very well deserved classic label on this one for sure  although conversations can seem to go on for days and days  in the long run raskalnikov and dostoevskys tale sticks with you for a long time  I m always reluctant to tackle  great books  because I think they ll be too heavy to really enjoy  But I m always wrong  Crime and Punishment is certainly dealing with serious things but it is also gripping  funny  and sad  Dostoevsky puts you in the room the way many 19th century writers do not  The characters in the book are so finely drawn you feel like you coul know them now  which makes the whole thing that much more disturbing   I am currently reading this book again  Each time I do I feel like I am reading a new book  Unlike his magnum opus  The Brothers Karamazov  Crime and Punishment reads more like a prose poem  The mind of the main character isn t given all at once  but slowly unfolds to the reader  The artistry of this book is the fact that the physical action compels the reading throughout  but even more engaging is the psychological story behind the physical story  Dramatic irony abounds  particularly in the several places where Raskolnikov confesses   yet without repentance  and so is not reconciled  An interesting take on the detective story  since the reader already knows everything  Rather  the reader is left to piece together Raskolnikov s psyche as he descends through hell and into paradise  Cf  Augustine s Confessions  and Dante s Divine Comedy  Dostoyevski may have been paid by the word  but I wouldn t strike a single line from this novel  One of the best books I have ever read  My first Dostoevsky book  the plot is much more cohesive and fast moving than Brothers Karamazov or The Idiot  If you like psychologically tormeted main characters  you d probably enjoy this one  My favorite Dostoevsky novel Rinuncio a lodare questo libro e la sua attualita perche altrimenti non la finirei piu Delitto e castigo tratta di un delitto e della conseguente colpa pena che prendera vita grazie ad un percorso  sia geografico che mentale  dall   occidente razionale  che sfida la morale comune  all intimismo della redenzione psicologica E  difficile trovare armonia tra la dualita degli opposti in ognuno di noi  forse non e azzardato pensare ad una sorta di parallelo tra il Medioevo e la storia di Rodion Romanovic Raskol nikov Nel Medioevo era la Volonta Divina a decidere se il presunto colpevole  gettato in acqua dentro un sacco  fosse o meno responsabile del reato  se colpevole  la malvagita alla quale si era venduto non avrebbe permesso il suo annegamento  se innocente  avrebbe trovato la morte sott acqua e la redenzione dalle accuse Raskol nikov  colpevole  potrebbe alla fine farla franca ma ricerca la colpevolezza e si consegna spontaneamente alle autorita  fedele a quell idea cristiana per cui l atto del soffrire ha un effetto purificatore sullo spirito umano Tra i personaggi c e chi emerge di piu e chi di meno  ma esiste una sola voce corale che li racchiude tutti perche tutti sono necessari  giocano per contrasti con i loro caratteri cosi diversi ma mai assoluti  non c e in assoluto buono e cattivo  stupido o intelligente  tutti sono veri e compositi cosi com e composita e stratificata la realta che si trovano a dover vivere  I have had the privilege to read Russian authors since childhood thanks to my maternal uncle  My favourite two have always been Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekov This is one of my favourite books and I will continue reading it time and again  If anyone has nailed human nature so precisely  the honour definitely goes to Fyodor for this classic novel  A well told tale about human redemption where the crime and punishment both take a back seat  A must read for a book lover   I do wish I could rate it above 5 stars  This blew me away  Flawless execution on Dostoyevsky s part in depicting the innate egoism of Raskolnikov  He thinks himself equipped of this Napoleonic personality  where  in the interests of a higher social good  he possesses a moral right to kill  which is a mentality he stands by for the entirety of the story  Although towards the end he tries to pay his dues  to Raskolnikov it s more of a personal crime that he has to pay for  the fact that he eventually turned himself in  and that he didn t have the convictions to stand by and remain faithful to his ideologies  as opposed to the actual murder itself  The whole psychology surrounding Raskolnikov and how he deals with what he s done and the relationships he then forms with a variety of equally sad characters is amazingly well done Dostoyevsky has this remarkable talent to show the humanity in people who s characters aren t often alighted upon with such alacrity  You develop sympathy and even empathy for these characters  irregardless of what misdeeds they ve done and they re represented in such a truthful way that it s clear to see why Dostoevsky is considered one of the great writers  He draws you so far into the world of these people that you honestly hope Raskolnikov gets away with his crimes  you start to understand the ideologies that he s tried to live by and it brings into light a lot of moral questions that often go ignored While I think that the epilogue could have been scrapped entirely  the whole novel is compelling  I have just finished this book and I thought that fortunately for me when I find it then reading it whithin a week  There have a lot of things about this book go on my mind  I thought about Raskolnikov  a special character  I believe that I can sympathize with his bcoz of his personality that I can see when I finished each steps of this book I cant say anything else about him bcoz all of his life  his choose  his awareness  his anxiety is presented clearly throught the series of his stories  I only say that  the kindly of each people always exist under their act but  Not only other people but also yourself cant be see it In conclusion  Crime and Punishment is one of the most favourite books in my bookself  Hope that more people could be read it and realize something from this great book  Thought provoking  accessible masterpieceThis is the kind of book which I would recommend to people who want to start out in literature  The story  about a murderer and his struggles to prove to himself his significance in the world and then deal with consequences of this is unique The story is highly relevant to our age  intersting and deeply confrontational at a human level that it will engage most readers  The beauty of it is that  while being pretty dense  the language and style is definately accessible  Dostoevsky s study of the human mind  and the way in which we can actually imprison and torture ourselves with guilt and grief is facinating   I was pleasantly surprised to find this was a much easier read than other Russian classics I ve read  as it had a much smaller cast of characters  Apparently Russians really like to change up people s names on a regular basis  Anyhow  it explores the psychologically of murder and guilt  A story that is still relevant 150 years later  Best book I ve ever read  I felt insane as I was reading the book  Yes  that is different than normal  No  I m not talking to myself  Fine  I might be  Who s talking  Show yourself   Crime and Punishment is mandatory reading for anyone planning to visit St Petersburg  Better yet  it is the best book to pack and read while in the city itself  Lush with descriptions  you feel as if you are wandering yourself the streets of 19th Century  Peters  alongside a sickly  troubled Raskolnikov reminiscing over and over about the crime he foolishly committed  Rife with details about the culture and state of mind of the Russian people at the time  the author is generous with side stories and exquisitely detailed supporting characters  from the deeply religious Sonia to the boisterous  naive but golden hearted Razumikhin If you ever find yourself in this most beautiful of Russian cities  make sure pay Dostoyevsky last house a visit  to walk the hallways where stories like this one where thought out  and the office where the words were put to paper  under Dostoyevsky s wife loving eyes  I dare you not to feel a pang in your heart  and maybe a tear of two in your eyes    What brings me back to this perfect novel is that here Dostoyevsky achieve perfection of form as well as his usual depth of insights   Crime and Punishment is the window into the mind of Raskolnikov  a university drop out whose theory that the death of one elderly pawnbroker would serve as the catalyst for the elevation of his financial  social and philosophical status becomes the source of his moral torment in practice Told with the attention to detail seen in Herman Melville s Moby Dick  while questioning issues of morality in a way that reflects the later Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov  Dostoyevsky provides an insight into the psychological conflict that follows Raskolnikov s actions  While the murder of Alonya and Lizaveta establishes the framework of his inner crisis  the obfuscation of what is right and wrong throughout the novel can be applicable to most decisions and judgements one reaches in everyday life Of Raskolnikov  I found myself repulsed and sympathetic in equal measure  his character is one that cannot be boiled down to cut and dry terms as he manifests all the complexities contradictions of what it is to be human  Meanwhile  the characters that orbit Raskolnikov illuminate the consequences of his actions upon the society in which he navigates  These characters always feel believable and each have their own stories worthy of similar detailed analysis to Raskolnikov  particularly Sonya and the Machiavellian Svidrigailov  I suspect that further secrets and wonders will be unveiled through repeated reading of the novel  Crime and Punishment encapsulates the reason I invest so much time in literature  although I became immersed in the environment of the novel  it has already affected the way I perceive my own world  Crime and Punishment is a novel that has haunted me for much of my adult life  That s not because it is partly a ghost story  nor because it s one of those books that I ve never read but always felt like I should  this read through was my third or fourth  though I didn t read it the first time until after college   It haunts me because every time I read it I get drawn into it  into Raskolnikov s thoughts and terrors  Reading Crime and Punishment makes me feel the weight of the novel more than any other book I ve read  I always feel that I m living Raskolnikov s delirium right along with him  That makes it a somewhat scary book to pick up again  but it also invites me  maybe even dares me  to come back to it Dostoevsky creates an eerie St  Petersburg  an absurd  surreal world in which a suspected murderer is allowed to roam the streets until he decides to turn himself in  a world in which everyone is obsessed with the idea of justice  but true justice is almost nowhere to be found and rarely rewarded  After the initial action at the pawnbroker s flat  the dream like scenes shift from one to another  very slowly building in intensity  For me the turning point is Raskolnikov s encounter with Sonya  when she reads him the story of Lazarus  From that point on  the novel speeds ahead and every word everyone speaks is compelling and important  The conversations are long  and they make me think  with some nostalgia  about a time when people really did talk together at length  rather than in short bursts of social media updates  In some ways I feel like I m looking in a mirror as I read about Raskolnikov s inner conflict  and the contradictory ways that the conflict manifests itself in his behaviors toward other people  When he carefully crafts words to be deliberately hurtful  but while speaking the words is unable to open his eyes or look at the person he s speaking to  I see myself in my worst moments  His constant self analytical  self doubting inner life is very much how I sometimes feel about myself  I haven t committed murder  but in Raskolnikov Dostoevsky challenges the reader to consider any sin  When Raskolnikov tries to believe that his crime was really not very bad  I think about the times that I try to minimize the seriousness of any of my sinfulness  Can I really believe that I m any prettier than Raskolnikov in my thoughts  words  and actions  Against that bleak backdrop  the redemption of Raskolnikov and the sacrificial love of Sonya are some of the most amazing  wonderful things in any novel  The epilogue makes me yearn for that completeness and togetherness that Raskolnikov is  we hope  on his way to discovering  The rest of Raskolnikov s story that Dostoevsky hints at at the end of the novel is merely his invitation to the reader to be the rest of Raskolnikov s story   Though I hope that in heaven I ll be able to hear Dostoevsky tell more of the story  Crime and Punishment is a difficult  challenging book  but it s one of the best  I know I ll keep returning to it  as frightening as it is  For this read through  I read Jessie Coulson s translation from 1953  It holds up really well  with only a few odd word choices or constructions here and there  Previously I had only read the Constance Garnet  and I was interested to try a different translation  I ll never be able to pick just one translation as The Best  but I can certainly recommend Coulson s as one good choice among many  Together with The Brothers Karamazov Dostoevsky s masterpiece  Only Cervantes surpasses this titan  Que se sepa que este libro esta muy por debajo de los de Stephanie Meyer en la lista de Best Books Ever Ahi es nada   I was hellbent on giving this book 4 stars  but I simply couldn t  Yes  it did seem a bit  just a bit  tedious at some point  but that was my own fault  Other than that  the book is thoroughly enticing  despite a few minor comments  And that cliffhanger at the end  my God  My favorite part  though  is Raskolnikov s inner conflict  the way guilt and pride were both gnawing at his sanity A beautiful book  to say the least  One of the first books that really took me along for the ride and put me into someone else s paranoid mind with such convincingly great details   I first read this while living in St Petersburg literally around the corner from where it was written  I was so excited that every street  market  bridge etc were all familiar to me and it really helped me gain a sympathy and understanding of Raskolnikov  I absolutely love this book  even though nothing really happens in it  Anyone who has ever sinned will enjoy this book  In fact  only the devil  who feels no remorse and angels  who don t sin won t enjoy this book  for everyone else  it s a must read  Dostoevsky  like most Russian authors have a talent for describing the human character in very realistic and relatable terms  The way he gets through the various manifestations of guilty is just incredible  One all time favourite books  And it s got its fair share of action too  very unlike 19th century novels  So many people have commented thoroughly on this one already  I think I ll pass It s an easy read  It s long but still easy  And quite enjoyable  I learned a couple of things or three  Now I know that killing is alright as long as you regret it afterwards  Or even if you don t  it s not really much of a big deal  Just kiding  I really liked how the reader is drawn into the character s mind  The psychological study  as someone put it here on GR  is fantastic I do think the ending was rushed  lately I find all endings to be rushed so maybe  I  am the problem   I mean  we ve read so much about the main characters and their past lives  and their illnesses  and then the secondary characters and their pasts and illnesses  And then there s this long dinner party  And the many times the character talks to the policeman  And the doctor  Oh  and the best friend  aka angel in disguise   Everything feels so long and described in detail  And then  bam  Don t want to spoil the ending  but seriously  the length of a clousure should be proportional to the length of the book  It s ok for Snowhite and the Prince to marry in three lines  It s a short story  It s not ok for a final resolution to take two pages within a 540 pages novel   Probably the best book I ve ever read  At times I was really upset with the behaviour of the leading chararacter Raskolnikov  How can he be like that    And to see his slow descent into mental illness was something that made me wanna cry out  Dostoyevsky has a profound knowledge of human psyche  his characters feel so alive  I was never the same after reading this  Thanks to my beloved sister for giving me this book  I didn t understand why this book was great until almost half way through it  In the beginning I only felt the dreariness and couldn t sympathize at all with Raskolnikov  I started to really like the novel only at the scene where Raskolnikov connected with Sonya  It s as if  he didn t really become a human being to me until he proved that he could transcend himself Dostoyevsky is the only author who can make me cry through description  Also  surprised that this novel is a love story  Most girls in my law and literature class were offended with Sonya s dependence and lack of personality  They thought the  golden heart prostitute  image was flat  But  I liked her most  For me  it is painfully beautiful to see women give grace to destructive men who don t deserve it  As professor Boyle stated  this novel could have been called  Sin and Redemption  instead  because in a way  the crime and the punishment didn t really matter Finally  as my best friend Christina said on the novel   Life is complicated and cruel   Bad people can still be useful do good things  thus it is impossible to ever rid ourselves of them   they have to go on their own accord   If there is one thing you can say about Dostoyevsky that everyone would agree with  it s probably that you either love him or you hate him I understand why plenty of people could read this and not like it  or even not get through it  but I am not one of those people To me  Crime and Punishment is one of those books that everyone should read  Yes it s about crime  but it s also about the inherence of evil versus the inherence of goodness  what that looks like on human faces  how to come back from a place of mental despair  and the power of redemption  El epilogo  la

Sdyq  lm tkn  q   dy  tlk m nsh t byny w byn  ljrym  w l qb   Like most of Dostoevsky books does not have a story which spans a long period or follows a complex story plot  The action in the story happens quickly with the murder of Lizuveta in the beginning itself  Rest of the book is psycho philosophical evaluation of the event  the backdrop and the hero of the book  Rodya  Amazing book  Great writing not only entertains  they answer some questions and set you on path to discover your own answers for other questions which they leave you with  This is one such book  Are some people worthy of being treated above justice  on account of their greatness  How do we assess that they are great enough to be entitled of special treatment and be allowed to get away with murder  in a literal sense here  My favorite novel   I thought this book was amazing  maybe not as good as notes from the underground  but definitely very good  The pretense of this book is that the main character Rodion Raskolnikov is a very poor man who used to be a student  Through the eyes of Rodion  Fyodor does an amazing job of describing the troubles of being poor in nineteenth century Russia  leaving out not even the smallest details  One example of this is when he describes Rodion trying to sneak past his land ladies apartment so he doesn t have to have the uncomfortable conversation with her about why he is so far behind on his payments to her  Fyodor also does  once again  an amazing job of describing the inner workings of the main character  and really showing us what makes this character tick  and push him to do what he does  Fyodor uses his words to paint an amazing picture of a man who is impoverished  and is internally conflicted  The main conflict inside of Rodion is whether or not to kill the pawnbroker in St  Petersburg  This seems at first like a strange crime since she is his main source of revenue  However  Dostoyevsky once again does his job to make you understand why Rodion does what he does  Whilst inside of a St  Petersburg tavern he meets a man named Marmeladov  and sees the type of poverty that he and his family live in  He even meets Marmeladov s daughter who has been forced into prostitution in order to make money to support the family  After seeing where his life could go to  he also over hears a student talking to an officer about how much better off society would be if the Pawnbroker Alyona were to be killed and her money distributed amongst the poor  The way in which this section is written is very convincing  it is done so that it is understandable to see how a mentally unstable individual such as Rodion would be convinced by this  Rodion throughout the book goes through these dramatic swings between wanting to kill Alyona  and being disgusted at himself for this  This  along with the argument of the student allow Dostoyevsky to make Rodion still seem like a human  even after cutting down and old woman and her sister with an axe  Though I would still say that this is a terrible thing to do  by giving the reasoning for it  it allows you to not feel like a monster for still feeling bad for Rodion  and his situation If you would like to read a book about how peoples environment can shape their actions  and read the story of a conflicted individual who I feel everyone will be able to relate to at some level  I would greatly recommend this book   Raskolnikov is definitely one of the most complicated characters in all of literature  Infatuated by the idea of becoming a Napoleon  he creates a spontaneous theory of being above crime and law  and is drawn to murder as if it were some unforeseen force  I found myself defending Raskolnikov throughout the novel and dreading his capture or his own pathetic confession because of his seemingly benevolent disposition  You can t help but pity him despite his depraved actions and insufferable self loathing  you hold on to a hope of eventual atonement  Dostoevsky s writing is swift  to the point  and riddled with such dark realism that the reader feels the terror of a murderer who committed such an emotionless crime  As the repercussions of his  crime  slyly bite at his ankles  you begin to feel the complete degradation of the soul of a guilty criminal  and that is the reader s punishment     rdt  n  j l mn nfsy nblywnan akhr w ldhlk qmt bqtlh hdh mqlh

 Zm m ktb fy l db lrwy y One of those books when you put them down you keep on thinking about it  Confusing with the multitude of names for the same person but the characteristics of each persona are clear enough to distinguish between all  Not a breese through but a great literary read Tried several times to read this book and kept putting it down  My brother advised me to keep reading and I would really like it  I did and it became one of my favorite books  Dostoevsky made me love Rashkolnikov even though he was a killer  I just loved these characters and was trying to tell them   Don t do it          They didn t listen  Oh well  I read this book in high school and it remains my favorite book  My favourite novel of all time  Gobsmacked  back in the day   I listened to this book on CD while I was driving from Virginia to Idaho with my sister  Charity  The key scene in the book is awful  and we almost stopped listening at that point  I m glad we kept with it  though  This story is a warning against over thinking things  disconnecting yourself from the world and people around you  and living life based on theories instead of living it based on love and Christian virtue  Through all of Rodya s study and academic observation  he has developed a philosophy about government and social order  He is convinced that this philosophy will change the world  He is so sure of it that he is willing to commit an awful crime in an attempt to prove it or to show his commitment to it  The whole book is about his internal struggle afterwards  can he keep hold to this theory after experiencing its horrid results first hand  or is he willing to abandon his it and connect with the world again  He is both the hero and the villain of the book  In the end  this is a story about redemption and about the power of long suffering  patience and love to soften even the hardest hearts  This book helped me to be less judgmental  It made me reconsider my feelings about capital punishment  It helped me to better understand how political structures and social philosophies like Communism and Nazi Facism came into being  I had just finished law school when I listened to the book  and I had been particularly unnerved by how some professors seemed to live in theory rather than reality  I went to one lecture called  The New Morality   which was previously called  immorality   He had thought it through and rationalized everything thoroughly  There is a temptation to over think and over complicate life  Really  I think it just comes down to the two great commandments  love God  and love your fellow man  and to Jesus s counsel that  By their fruits ye shall know them   Stray from those principles  and you can rationalize anything  This is a great book  and I highly recommend it   I don t know why   but  the whole book made sense  many of the things the characters went through   I could relate   and each sentence seemed like the truth of life  The way the protagonist loved his family  yet wanted to be away from them   didn t want to see them   he wanted to see only the girl   maybe thinking that only she could understand him or maybe she wouldn t judge him as she s in the same situation as he is     the drunkard repenting over how he neglected his family   but  still wouldn t   couldn t do anything    and I never thought that this was the tale of the guilt until my psychology lecturer defined it so   maybe it is   I need to read the book once again to see if it is the case   but  it is for me a tale of fear    Anyday   my favorite book  I read a Harvard Classics version that contained a very helpful Biographical Note section by WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON  Whether writing about the criminal mind came from his associations developed during his incarceration while in Siberia or simply a different way for the author to explore the soul  it was thoroughly explored  My rating system is fairly simple  Because I choose the period and author of my interest then if I am driven to keep reading it I vote higher than not  Hayatimda okudugum en guzel uc kitaptan birisi Suc ve Ceza  Karakteri yazmakla kalmamis  bildigin kanli canli hafizamiza yerlestirmis Dostoyevski  Bu yil icerisinde tekrar okumayi dusunuyorum  Hatta omrum boyunca tekrar tekrar okumayi dusunuyorum  Cunku her okudugumda daha da farkli bir keyif alacakmisim gibi bir hisse sahibim Bana tuhaf gelense adamlar bu kitaba da bes yildiz veriyorlar  Alacakaranlik  Twilight  serisine de  Farkli olabilirler  evet ama yine de hic icime sinmiyor     Read this for a class in college and surprisingly I finished it in a week  I felt so sorry for the main character  Rolskanikov  sp   I understood what he was going through  it was amazing  Definitely a must read  A classic read  Raskolnikov s inner battles and his views on society really  sell  the book  I loved the fact that you read on and start comparing what you would do in his situation and how  twisted  yet logical everything is  Just awesome   The man was a genius  I read in one of the footnotes that Dostoyevsky was influenced by another writer who invented fantastical realism  I think fantastical realism is the perfect description for the writing style in this book  It depicts reality  but distorted slightly through the viewpoint of a slightly deranged killer  Raskolnikov is constantly pushing against the limits of reality  I picture a film in black and white where the camera keeps zooming in on him  disheveled  as he sweats and makes exaggerated  suspicious gestures  Dostoyevsky uses Raskolnikov s illness to blur the line between what is real and what is simply the illusions of a fevered brain  This entire story explores the vast gray area between black and white  Good and evil  poverty and wealth  madness and sanity  The depth of material in this work is astonishing  I d love to take a course on Dostoyevsky someday  as I feel as though I barely scratched the surface in this complex novel  Raskolnikov  a young student in the grips of utter poverty  tries to rationalize the meaning of crime  He convinces himself to murder an old  miserly pawn broker  originally with the intent to rob her and put the money to good use  helping his family climb out of the rut of poverty  But as he sets out to execute the crime  something in him doesn t agree with his will  yet he brings himself to murder the old woman  and her sister  who unfortunately happens to enter the scene  Raskolnikov faces a lot of ordeal in trying to escape the scene of crime  but thanks to a streak of luck  he manages to scurry out  Although his grand scheme hinged on the loot he would rob  he somehow didn t have any interest in robbing  and in his fluster  he carelessly scooped in some random trinkets and some odd money  Even this little loot  he buries under a stone and has no interest in touching them  He spends the next few days in fever and hallucinations  driving himself insane on why he committed the crime  if he still justified the crime  or if he should confess it all to give himself some peace How curious a man   he commits a crime that he thinks is not a crime  and yet he can t be in peace  He is skeptical about God  his intellect and rational mind assuages him that he merely killed a parasitic old woman who was tricking the poor and collecting their hard earned money  that the money he robbed could give himself a new future  save his family and help him do much more good to the people of Petersburg  than he ever could as a law abiding citizen residing in a little hole of filth  with not even enough money to wash and feed himself  Despite the logical arithmetic of killing two to save many  there was something in him that wouldn t stop nagging him   his conscience  Here is where I merged with Raskolnikov  Although I am not contemplating any dire crime  I can relate to his qualms of stepping over the barriers to do something unconventional and extraordinary  And no matter how many hours  days  weeks  months and years are spent in trying to straighten out the logic and the rationality of it all  something never quietens  And there is no way out  Raskolnikov couldn t have walked away without executing his actions  neither could he be at peace after his actions  Having stuck oneself in the horns of a moral dilemma  there is no painless way out  And the scars are deep and will remain  It just becomes a matter of which horn to gouge oneself with  And in Raskolnikov s case  he gouged himself through both horns And that is the essence of the book  It tests the limits of human conscience  It s a debate between the rational mind and the inexplicable voice of the conscience  Dostoevsky is a master analyst  and an astute psychologist  No matter how many times I have already talked about his perceptive genius  I can t tire out  Here is an era wherein DNA fingerprinting and other sophisticated means of criminal investigation are unheard of  Yet  he weaves a suspenseful drama of how the crime is solved  with no material evidence   but all based on psychology  This is Dostoevsky s trademark    he used the same  double edged sword of psychology  in the courtroom drama of The Brother s Karamazov  But in this book  he doesn t go into as much explicit analysis He propounds a thesis on what makes a man extraordinary  What made the great Kings and leaders who are now immortal in the history of Mankind  so great  They could break rules and make their own  They didn t subject themselves to the letter of the law  they were brave enough to rise above it  to realize that certain rules need to be broken  that morality has to be redefined in their hands  and that only their essence needs to seep through for them to murder a few to save millions  and still have a peaceful conscience  Those who can t step over such man made pickets of rules  and who are unable to see such moral clarity and act with conviction  are but ordinary  Raskolnikov strove to be such an extraordinary man  but failed  He failed despite his intellect  and despite his lack of faith in God  I marvel at Dostoevsky s deftness in glorifying humanity  no matter what decision Raskolnikov took  He stresses on the innate goodness residing in all men  despite their efforts to rationalize crime  and be blind to belief and retribution from a higher authority Through his other characters  he also compares the shades of legality and morality  and how each measures the goodness in a person  There are many men who circumvent and stay clever and obedient in the eyes of the law  yet their moral character is far more loathsome than a person like Raskolnikov  who goes against law and commits the highest  sin    murder  Conscience is one factor  the other is the intention  Many philosophers and spiritualists have emphasized that an action by itself cannot be classified as good or bad    it is the intent behind it  and the purpose it serves  This is cleverly brought out in the book Another aspect that comes out is  how the murder affects Raskolnikov physically and mentally  The weight of his conscience and his immense resistance to the crime makes Raskolnikov feverish and delirious    these physical manifestations implying the psychosomatic effects of his inner tempest  Dostoevsky hints at how a person physically and mentally wears out every time he works against his conscience  This reminded me of the Horcruxes in Harry Potter  In my interpretation  this is exactly what Rowling also seems to imply  Every time Voldemort commits a horrendous crime  his entire soul suffers and splits into pieces  so much so that he deteriorates in both spirit and body As I mentioned  I m sure there is perhaps more to the book that I have missed and need to re read  But such is the beauty of this classic  It analyzes all the multiple complex facets of morality  crime and punishments  packed into words that are so impassioned and vivid  Truly a masterpiece  ldb km yjb n ykwnmn lm yqr  ldb lrws  flm yqr  db bHqwl tjrb  Hqyqyh m  ldb lrws  b d tjrbh bhth b ydh m  n krnyn mndh kthr mn khmsh  shr  mw qd knt mn mt  qrt  hdh l m bl w f

Dostoyevsky had had committed himself a murder and gone through the guilt and regret he so brilliantly describes throughout the book   It certainly is one of the favourite books I have read  and I don t think any book will easily top that  Ergin Altay in ceviride harika bir is cikardigini da soylemem gerekiyor   Amazingly dark and introspective book on human psychology Uno de los mejores libros que he leido  Una trama psicologica que te mantiene cautivo hasta el final  Los personajes tan bien definidos y sus dilemas morales tocan las fibras mas sensibles   I first read Crime and Punishment in my late teens  In those years I read several of the great Dostoevsky novels  The Idiot  Underground Man  and especially The Brothers Karamazov and C   P  In various bar and coffee shop conversations over the years about various  the BEST _____ ever   for instance  who is the hottest actress in the history of cinema  Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca or Lauren Bacall in To Have or Have Not   The Brothers K and C   P would top my Greatest Novels of All Time list  usually BK first  C   P second  I actually named one of my brooding gray cats Raskolnikov  Rascal  for short   so there  proof that it wasn t a trivial thing for me  this book  I come back to C   P more than four decades later  as part of the process of my revisiting some of my greatest reads  and also reading some other Great Books that had been on my bucket list for decades  such as Anna Karenina and In Search of Lost Time  Living  the  Reading  Dream  man Spoiler Alert  I want to talk about these books  so if you have never read them and still might  you might want to skip this review  Some reviews I write in part for others  some of them I write mainly for myself  as a kind of autobiography of my reading  This I put in the latter category though if you have read it  tell me what you think of what I think So most people who have never even read this book already know from the simple title that a crime has been committed  and most probably know a guy kills a woman or two  Then we know there is a punishment that follows the crime  Simple  You need 500 plus pages to tell that   The short answer is yes  But the crime is basically what happens in the first hundred or so pages  and we don t know why  really  We never get a good reason  actually  which is also part of the point  A guy named Raskolnikov kills his pawnbroker Alyona and robs her  though he never does anything with what he steals  In the process  his daughter Lizaveta walks in so he kills her  too  So that s the crime  The last 4 5 of the book is in part about the  punishment  which unless you omit the short epilogue  does not involve institutional punishment  The last 4 5 focuses on psychological and spiritual self punishment or what Dostoevsky always refers to as  suffering   And various considerations of what Dostoevsky never calls sin in a parade of wild and wonderful characters At the outset of the novel  we learn that former college student Raskolnikov lives in St  Petersburg  in relative poverty  spinning his wheels  drinking and hanging with women  or  whoring  though this is the nineteenth century  so the references here are vague  usually   things that we know Dostoevsky also did much of his life  in addition to gambling   As things proceed we see Rask has published an essay about how there are some people  usually great ones  who are  above the law   people who can do whatever they want and get away with it Nietzsche  a nineteenth century philosopher  called such folks  supermen   those who rise above the moral precepts of the time to achieve greatness or just to prove that moral systems do not apply to them  Rask commits the murders in part as a way of working out this stupid theory  though he is poor and could also use the cash but never does  He needs the money  but when he has it  he tends to give it away to others  Not that he is a good guy  he is a murderer  but he has some charitable aspects to his character revealed from time time  Sometimes he despicably tries to dismiss his murders as trivial  but he never gets off the hook for it  ever  especially with himself  This is not an isolated thing  this murder for philosophical principle  by the way  In the twentieth century  the two teenagers Leopold and Loeb read Nietzsche and just to test the theory killed a kid randomly in Chicago and fried for it  They had the same thing in mind  Great men will do Whatever They Want and not experience Guilt  They will rise above it  they think or  as most novelists and moralists decide  sink below it  The theory is an empty one  of course as most humans with any commons sense would see  but intellectuals  eh  Dostoevsky  D  hereafter   they are kinda blowin  in the winds of theoretical fashion  Arrogant  they all think they wanna be Napoleon This might begin to summarize simply the moral position of Nietzsche  You have your way  I have my way  As for the right way  the correct way  and the only way  it does not exist In other words  there s no God  and no religious or ethical system that must apply to all people Anyway  Rask is painfully aware his mother and sister will do anything to help him financially  And he s maybe in love with prostitute Sonya  who is doing this terrible thing to make money for her family  He fears his own sister  Dunya  will do similar sorts of prostituting  she has already  for instance  agreed to marry rich jerk Luzhin  just to help out the family that has gone poor supporting student Rask   But he never does anything with money except give some that he has to Sonya s family left destitute at the death of their drunken father  Marmeledov  So he s strange and mostly unlikable our anti hero Rask  though he is fascinating always and even a little likable sometimes to me  as I am also pretty fallible myself  so I have empathy for him sometimes Later  we might see a kind of  moral  in this story about a man like RASK who doesn t believe in God  from Dostoevsky through Nietzsche  He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster  And if you gaze for long into an abyss  the abyss gazes also into you That happens to Rask  and others in this book  They suffer  facing their demons or monsters And no one depicts suffering like Dostoevsky  His predecessor and mentor in Russian literature  Gogol  also knew suffering  though while he is similarly recognized for creating poor folk grotesques  his are often comic  D references and creates tributes to his Master in this work  but most people don t see D s grotesque  suffering folks as all that funny  In this reading  I saw them as funny sometimes  however  There s satire throughout  especially of the upper classes  D and literature in general don t usually make fun of the poor with any success  We see poverty and its attendant horrors in many ways in this book  and we come to care about them and their needs  They suffer and we can see this is central to humanity There s some action in this book  of course  in fact it is sometimes quite the page turner as we wonder what is going to happen  is Rask going to get caught  and so on  but the centerpiece is dialogue in the service of character  and it works breath takingly well here  Most of the male characters are tortured drunken philosophizers who go on page after page speaking their madness and grief  And most of these crazy flawed folks are indeed men doing most of the talking  The women are less crazy  and less flawed  on balance  and mostly crazy BECAUSE of the men  But the talk is amazing  it is the heart of the book  When men drink and talk  he has that down   this book came out of a failed attempt at a draft he called The Drunks   but the ideas that flow from their mouths  the thinking about the meaning of life  the struggles with love and morality  all this is incredible Does it go on a bit long  Some say yes  but not for me  We need to know what is going to happen and why for Rask  but we also need to broaden the lens and see others who are also suffering in their own ways  We need foils for understanding Rask in a sociological sense  And it s often very funny in these long stretches  so the length is worth  in my opinion  The drunken Marmeledov  for instance  is pathetic  but he s also hilarious and insightful and finally tragic  He s a full and rich and complex character  Luzhin  the self centered lawyer who is for a time engaged to Dunya  he s a world class jerk  but an interesting one  While Rask is never excused for his murders  these other men and their iniquities help us see what can be some goodness at times in Rask  and appreciate the remarkable end of the book  The also drunken philanderer Svidrigailov is a  drunken  of course  jerk  but he also takes care of Marmeledov s consumptive widow  and after her horrific death  her children  including her step daughter Sonya  she s the one who has become a prostitute to help her family  whom Rask sort of falls in love with  though simultaneously torments from time to time  in part because he is trying to bribe her into marriage  He also tries to bribe Rask s sister Dunya into marriage  though he is already engaged  and fails  He becomes a central character in the book because he  BIG spoiler  makes the decision to commit suicide  which makes him a foil to Rask  who contemplates this  but instead chooses confession  hard labor in Siberia with Sonya able to come north with him and visit regularly  Another great character is the Columbo like  look it up  You have google  Peter Falk   bumbling and rumpled old genius detective Porfiry  who finally convinces Rask to confess and give himself up  Rask s great friend Razumikhin is wonderful in defense of Rask against all evidence to the contrary  who also agrees to take care of his sister and mother  He s a strange man  also a drunk  D knows drunkenness  it s clear  but good where most men are not in this tome  The story is one of final and not easily achieved redemption  but we only see this in the very final pages of this long novel  as he finally accepts the love of Sonya  Sonya  the sort of  Madonna Whore   a long time literary stereotype  I know  of this book  is essentially the moral center of the book  with her unwaivering and not easily achieved faith in God  She s convincingly Good  Dunya and their mother are also good  giving up everything for her love of her son  Nastasya cares for Rask  too  She s also wholly good  The late goodbye scene between Rask and his mother  totally a good woman  is affecting and powerful  The scenes between Rask and  totally good  sister Dunya are powerful  too  Do you see a pattern here  Sure  Sonya is a prostitute  but only in necessity for her destitute family  Women are often saints here  they make the right choices  or most of them do  Maybe that is a flaw  that D deifies women  this is a kind of cliche  But there are a couple weak and wicked women in this book  too  The women don t always seems quite as real as the men sometimes because they are a little one dimentionally good  but they are still great  they seem real to me But it is LOVEthat redeems Raskolnikov  the love of a woman  Sonya  and his mother and sister  too  but mainly Sonya  and while it seems like a stretch she would care for him  she does  and both he and we come to believe in her goodness and love Some favorite scenes  Sonya s reading of the Biblical Lazurus story to Rask is ELECTRIC  unforgettable  The best scene in the whole book for my money  I was once religious and I know that passage from the Bible  I say now that I am agnostic  but that scene  that felt like an indictment  a promise to me  in my own lost soul ness  The scenes with Porfiry are great and the scene in particular where Porfiry finally accuses Rask is also ELECTRIC  I promise  as is the final scene of the book  The lyrical final scenes with Svidrigailov are wonderful  powerful and surprising  I had NO idea he was going to do that  Anytime Mom and Rask or Dunya and Rask are talking with each other  these scenes are poignant  Marmeledov s drunken talk with Rask is wonderfully comic early on  When I first read this book I was  churched  in a Calvinism that seemed darkly consistent with Dostoevsky s dark  angsty world view  Later  I came to like the work of D influenced South African writer J  M  Coetzee  who actually wrote his novel The Master of St  Petersburg about Dostoevsky  I still love these writers  though my views on matters of faith have shifted considerably  But as a veteran doubter  I liked D s anguished struggles with faith and the meaning of life more than anyone else s writing and thinking  And they led me  in my existentialist period  into Kafka  Sartre  Camus  and others  Camus s The Stranger and Kafka s  Metamorphosis  owe things to C   P  Hamlet and Macbeth are anguished precursors  as is D s own  Underground Man   Anyway  doubt and anguish have always seemed more interesting to me than joyful faith and happiness  and still do  I think the world is more complicated than mere celebration  though I have much to celebrate  too  But the world is a dark place now  as I see it  with a lot of ugliness in it  Dostoevsky resonates with the present for me as much as it ever did C   P is as much a psychological and sociological novel  about various forms of  madness  in nineteenth century Russia  as it is a philosophical renunciation of nihilism  though it is richly both  and much worth reading for these aspects  It s a real thriller  too  a cat and mouse story with the focus on Rask and his interior experience of suffering  but it is also a novel the literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin would identify as a  cultural forum  on issues in D s times in Russia  Raskolnikov is a jerk  a wonderfully reprehensible character that D refuses to sentimentalize  but as much as we despise him for some of his ridiculous youthful views  his ideas about the superman display the worst of the intellectualism of his times  we also come to appreciate him in various ways  Dostoevsky is a thinker  but he is first and foremost a poet of the heart and what used to be called  soul  unapologetically The translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky is supposedly the best ever  much lauded  and I can t say  not speaking the language  but it was fabulous to read  I read the Constance Garnett version 40 years ago  This is the one to read now  everyone says  so choose this one if you are going to read or reread  I also have read in the past couple years their Anna Karenina and Underground Man and Brothers Karamazov  so I can attest they are wonderful writers interpreters Finally  yes  it is  again  one of the best things I have ever read  and I highly recommend it  You may find it a tad long for contemporary tastes  but hey  you also have David Foster Wallace  who is very long  Pynchon is long  Ulysses was long  Sometimes great things are long  And maybe he is too nineteenth century modernist for you  finally  But for me he is great  deserving of his high status in the canon of world literature  Or  if you hate the very idea of Great Books and canons  it is just one hell of a read  This is  hands down  one of the best book I ve read  I know it s not an original way to start a review but it s really something that must be said Raskolnikov  Oh boy  Raskolnikov  I found myself having a weird crush on him right from the beginning   hey  do not judge me  Dostoevskij managed to capture every shade of his personality  to unveil every tiny corner of his troubled mind  to make him real  That s what Raskolnikov is  a real man  A great mind that has to cope with the dullness of reality  this is a fight that I m sure many of us had to go through at least once in a lifetime  even once a day   and the experience has taught us that the outcomes can only be two  The first one concerns a passive acceptance  accepting our place in this life  embracing it and looking for happiness in a blissful  ignorance  that we impose on ourselves  The second one is a brutal reaction leading to madness and to sick actions that deny every effort to adapt to the world we live in  Raskolnikov can t choose to accept  He wants to achieve something superior  he wants to make a difference  But he s also aware of his limits  he s not Napoleon  but he can be one  he wants to be one  and he has to start somewhere  So he plans the crime  killing the old  unpleasant lady is nothing but a step that will bring him closer to the very highest  ultimate point  But as he starts to plan the murder  he also starts to question himself about his mental sanity  And  nevertheless  who would possibly understand his exquisite plans  who could get the real meaning of his actions  without calling him murderer  Probably no one  There s so much to say on him  on all the other characters  every single one of them is a key that provides food for thought and all of them have a central role  but I don t want to keep boring you Another good thing I d like to mention  and then I promise  I m going to leave   after reading Crime and Punishment  I can finally fully appreciate the movie  Match Point   It s brilliant  Thank you Woody Allen for liking Dostoevskij Well  go read it  now  tlk llHZ  lm tqr  rwy  yzyd Twlh  l  thmnmy

presented throughout  but the most important ones are saved until the very end  This is my all time favorite novel  This book made me feel more emotion than anything I have ever read  I learned interesting ways to present characters thought  not just by saying so and so was upset  but by going through paragraphs of details  You get an overall view of what people think and feel that is relatable and believable  I learned many ways to use dialogue to show thoughts and feelings as well  What I enjoyed most was the anxiety I felt all through reading it  It really puts you into the mind set of the main character which is something i really want to work on   making the reader feel what the character feels  To the very end I had no idea what was going to happen  every page was a surprise but not in a cheesy or cliche way  powerful  my three favorite scenes are 1  Marmaladov s drunken speech at the tavern in which he gives his view of sinners  saints  and heaven  2  Sonya reads the raising of Lazarus to the doubting Raskolnikov  3  Epilogue  through Raskolnikov s acceptance of suffering and Sonya he accepts a true image of Christ Fyodor Dostoevsky s classic is certainly one I was not expecting to fly though  you are free to call me illiterate if you please  but I generally have a difficult time getting through 700  page books written more than a century ago Instead of the dull  monotonous  super pretentious novel I was expecting  Crime and Punishment is one of the most psychologically thrilling pieces of fiction I have encountered  The characters are all brilliantly fleshed out  and the story zooms along at a brisk pace despite its length  Dostoevsky s incredibly long paragraphs  my high school english teacher would have had a field day if I wrote like this  take a little while to get used to  but provide a fantastic means of gleaning the inner workings of our anti hero Highly recommended  Raskolnikov believes he is among the elite qualified to administer justice outside the law and kills the greedy pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta  But his conscience gnaws at him as he struggles to hide his crime and tries to help the Marmeladov family  the daughter Sonya forced to be a prostitute to feed the family and the drunk father driven over by a carriage  When his sister Dounia tries to marry Luzhin to secure the family s finances  Raskolnikov dismisses the man  His fits of fever and delirium reflect his inner struggle  In the end he couldn t accept that he is a Napoleon fit to judge and punish the wicked The detective Porfiry calls Raskolnikov to question about the crime and begins to suspect the man of murder but couldn t find the evidence  In the end  Sonya convinces Raskolnikov to confess  But even before going to jail  he conscience was punishing him for the crime because though he convinced himself that it is just to kill the pawnbroker  he isn t a psychopath or a sociopath and he feels the guilt of taking a life  Crime and Punishment is novel that probes the psychology of crime and its effect and futility of rationalization  even for justice s sake   A gloomy exploration of guilt and conscience set in even gloomier Russia  I suppose you need to be in the mood for that kind of literature  as it is pretty depressing  However  it is such a convincing portrayal of a criminal and written in thought provoking  interesting way  that it is very much among my favourite classics  Even though I made it through high school and my second to last semester in grad school without having to read this book  I am so happy I it finally showed up on a syllabus  Once I started reading this novel  I was spellbound  I love Sonia and Raskolnikov  Truly this is a great love story  unconditional love     that delves into the human psyche  Loved the ending   Words fail to describe how dear I hold this great novel  I have heard its praises in song over and over prior to actually picking it up  and I can say without a doubt that it did not  in the least  disappoint  The author s show of the degradation of Raskolnikov s psyche and overall mental state  written in such a beautiful and expressive way  is what struck me with awe the most  Though reeking in a gloomy and depressive atmosphere  this is definitely a novel that I will give another read  an act foreign to me   People can get really screwed up  We are capable of doing things we do not want to do  we did not think we could do  or thought that we could do  and then end up doing way worse Isolation  depression  loneliness  complete lack of self esteem to the point of self loathing  fear and beginning psychosis  Why do the same symptoms occur in modern day murderers  that were described by  J aimerais pouvoir mettre une demie etoile  car 4 5 5 serait certainement plus juste  J ai beaucoup apprecie ce classique  que j avais hate de decouvrir  L introspection et l approche de la maladie mentale face aux secrets  a ce qu on peut imaginer que les autres pensent de nous  le mensonge  la trahison  sont autant de themes fondamentaux et interessants m ayant accroches a ce roman  Que dire aussi de la reflexion que le personnage principal entretien sur la justification des crimes  justes   Peut on avoir des remords si notre theorie justifie certains crimes  Beaucoup de reflexions justifiants un interet eleve pour ce roman que je recommande a tous  The last pages of the book left me numb      just no words for how I felt     such an agonizing pain as if life has been taken out from every single breath slowly     Moved beyond senses      A very  very powerful book  Interesting plotting and amazing characters  Rodion Raskolnikov is student who has no money but he s a very proud person  He commits murder becouse he sees himself as a  Napoleon   higher on the ladder of humanity then others  He later starts the battle against the wole world around him  the detective  his freinds  his family  He becomes obsessed with his crime and sees it as a challenge for himself  Raskolnikov becomes self centered and cold altrough he s still capable of being kind  warm and generous  Raskolnikov s sister Dunya is a lot like her brother  After being proposed by a wealthy man  Luzhin  who is actuallyvery mean and wants to marry a poor girl in order to have influence over her   Dunya doesn t hesitate to accept the offer and to victimize herself to make the life of her brother easier  She s very strong  clever and can andure much pain as long as her loved ones are O K  There is a clvere detective porfirii Petrovich who solves the mystery of the murder and knows that Raskolnikov is the one who committed it  There is a long and interesting psychological battle between the detective and the murderer  which Raskolnikov doesn t want to give up  He later meets a girl Sonya  the daughter of a drunk man  who has to help her family a mad  ill stepmother and two little kids  She leads a life of a prostitute to earn money but on the inside she s the only one who remains absolutely clean and saint like  She falls in love with Raskolnikov and dispite him being cold and nasty  tries to help him  Raskolnikov tells her the truth and Sonya intends to help him  She convinces him to go to the detective and Raskolnikov  after many attempts does so He s sent to prison but Sonya never leaves him alone  With her faith and kindness he starts to love her and wants to start a new life with her  Crime adn Punishment is the most interesting book I ve read  Dostoyevsky is a real genious  There are many other characters I ve not mentioned and their portrays are so real  I didn t want the book to end but was too fascinated to put it down  The characters develop as the story progresses ant the plot takes turns I ve not mentioned  Every character is very human with her or his own problems  There is a small bridge border sanity and insanity in this book  It s very  very powerful and amazingly well composed  Every feeling and every word in it seems real  I d give the book millions and millions of stars if I could  This is the best book that I have read so far  I just bow the author for the immense pain he had by living in his characters  I never ever thought that words can have such power as these to hurt one s mind  I must say that the translation is equally wonderful  I am more than convinced that I should read more of Dostoevsky  A true work of art   Antes de leer este libro y sin conocer nada de la obra de Dostoyevsky llegue a pensar que me gustaria porque  que demonios  es un clasico universal   pero que no me encantaria ni me lo haria muy especial  Me equivoque  Obra mayor  magnifica   fama justificada al menos hasta donde yo habia leido escuchado  Maravillosa    Raskolnikov como uno de mis personajes favoritos de la literatura hasta ahora  Incredible writing  infuriating character  Just wanted to shake some sense into Raskolnikov  rwy    lys mthlh rwy  khr    Hbh b mq    wSy ljmy

classico russo sem soar a 1  snob  2  pseudo intelectual  3  com a puta da mania ou  pior  4  mentirosa  O problema com estes livros que sao considerados obras primas da literatura mundial e que vivem envoltos numa aura de misterio  como se fossem intocaveis ao comum dos mortais  Sobram mitos em volta dos grandes escritores e a conviccao que se cria e a de as suas obras sao tao dificeis e elaboradas que o melhor e passar ao largo  sob pena de se sofrer um derrame cerebral se ousarmos tocar lhes  Um erro  senhores  Agora posso dizer  por experiencia  que em vez de se perder tempo com dois  tres ou quatro titulos assim assim  que nos deixam com uma sensacao desconfortavel de balao meio cheio  mais vale dedicarmo nos a um destes livros que  por alguma razao  geram consenso gigante ha uma enormidade de anos  Nada disto e um bicho de sete cabecas  posso assegurar  Nao sao historias de mastigar e deitar fora  nao  nao sao  Mas por isso mesmo e que valem tanto a pena Aqui o leitor tera sempre um papel activo  Ver se a obrigado a questionar  a usar a cabeca  a reflectir e a tomar partido  Ser lhe a exigida uma leitura activa  atenta e  por isso mesmo  acabara por se relacionar emocionalmente com ideias que  embora escritas ha bem mais do seculo  se mantem actuais  porque vao a essencia do que e o ser humano  Foi o que se passou comigo  com este  Crime e castigo   que trazia debaixo de olho desde ha muito  Sem querer ser 1  snob  2  pseudo intelectual  3  com a puta da mania ou  pior  4  mentirosa  digo vos que este e um dos melhores livros que me passaram pelas maos  Se nao mesmo o melhor  Impossivel  pelo menos para mim  nao nos identificarmos com Raskolnikov e todo o turbilhao de sentimentos que o movem durante o tempo da accao que  neste livro  se passa mais na cabeca das personagens do que no espaco fisico  E um livro febril  que se le quase de rajada  tal o desconforto que causa  Lemos porque queremos acabar com o sofrimento que nos consome  porque precisamos de descansar mas  tambem  porque nos deixamos enredar pela trama de Dostoievski  Ah  quem me dera poder dize lo sem soar tao mal  Porque o preconceito dos livros nao se esgota na ma literatura  tambem os bons livros captam olhares de soslaio  E este e um desses casos  O meu conselho  Esquecam isso tudo  Se ainda nao conhecem o drama de Raskolnikov e procuram uma historia que vos arrebate do principio ao fim  preparem se  este pode ser o livro que procuram  Mas ficam desde ja avisados  que e um caminho sem retorno e nem sequer vos prometo que vos va deixar mais felizes  E possivel  sim  que esta experiencia vos leve a questionar o mundo que vos rodeia  o que  para mim  e sempre uma mais valia  E sim  ja sinto falta de Raskolnikov  Sim  sim  o criminoso  Sinto falta do criminoso  Genial no  Very slow paced so read with lot of time in hand  It will be worth the time spent  A classic which wrings you out as it investigated social injustice  poverty  human callousness  and motivations for crime  and inner consequences of having transgressed horribly   gut wrenching  A masterpiece  I m embarrassed to say that I tried to wade through the Brothers K  but gave up  Now I think the main reason for that was a shoddy translation  Pevear and Volokhonsky have done a great job with this one  I look forward to reading their translations of the Idiot and Brothers K  Highly recommended   I ll be honest here  I am no genius  but  I do gravitate toward the classics because I think they re less likely to be a waste of my time  When I read this about a year ago I d tried to read it once before and stopped about a quarter of the way  This time I pushed through that barrier and wow  Yes the story works on many levels but you re free to enjoy it as a thriller  which it is  I heartily recommend it  A real page turner  Crime and Punishment is a compelling look at the human psyche  A master storyteller  Dostoyevsky provokes the reader to explore traditions and complex beliefs  Crime and Punishment is a classical masterpiece that may be revisited for its profound themes and spiritual revelations of mankind s suffering amid poverty and temptation  Reading this book for the second time I really got a lot more out of it  Also  reading this book in the context of all of Dostoevsky s earlier work  especially Notes from Underground  shone a bright light on the inner meaning of the book  Although I feel like The Gambler was the dishwater leftover after Dostoevsky worked on Crime and Punishment every day  I hope it enhances my understanding of The Idiot like Notes from Underground helped with Crime and Punishment At different points I was reminded of my two favorite books while reading this one  Ulysses and Lolita  I know Joyce was a fan of Dostoevsky but Nabokov openly mocked him  I can t help but think that Nabokov was just mad at himself for taking so much from him stylistically  I was reminded of Joyce because both authors created protagonists who were semi autobiographical who held beliefs that ran counter to the author s beliefs  Dostoevsky has Raskolnikov and Joyce has Daedalus  As for the similarities to Lolita  the showdown with Svidrigailov was remarkably similar to Humbert Humbert s showdown with Clare Quilty  Nabokov often poked fun at Dostoevsky s pulpy over dramatic plots involving murders and prostitutes  but Nabokov use the same type of plots  albeit under the guise of satirizing Dostoevsky  Reading this book I often had to pause to admire how elegantly it was designed     Don t kill old bitches that piss you off  God will make you fall in love with a whore  Trust me  I wrote a book about it     Dostoevsky  Seriously  this book was really good  A book born out of the gutters of hell amid the volcanic lava of suffering  pain   anguish Classics like these come one in a millenium  Absolutely fantastic  I read it twice  Great book  Who is not enthralled by the opening lines  describing Rashkonlikov s wish to avoid his landlady  This is the tale of the rootless urban student intellectual per se and a Christian analysis of conscience and guilt also shows a very wry perception of how the argument  the aim justifies the means  is sinful and leads to disaster  Not only is much of Dostoyevsky s prescient about the forthcoming Communist distopia  he also had no illusions about America  The comic gortesque element fo Dostoyevsky should not be overlooked  as in Svidrigailov s declaration that he is going to America as a description of impending suicide  An all time classic  nevertheless very easy to read   I wasn t expecting to get sucked into this book so quickly  My mom had gotten me a Barnes and Noble gift card  and on an Ambien induced Christmas e shopping spree on Christmas Eve Crime and Punishment ended up in my cart  I had heard vaguely about the story  but did not know too much  I always considered books like 1984  Brave New World  and The Great Gatsby as some of my favorite classics  I can now add Crime and Punishment to the list   The book opens as Raskolnikov is in hardship as a struggling student  He has been pawning stuff to the local pawnbroker lady  and begins to ruminate on thoughts of murdering her  Through an entire 100 introductory pages he ruminates more and more until slowly and inevitably  he murders the pawnbroker and the sister  and quickly escapes the scene  It seems for awhile that he has committed the perfect crime  Except for the effects on his health  Always in a state of paranoia and high anxiety  he is unable to act normal for the rest of the novel  His mother and sister end up paying him a visit  and he can t bear to stand them  In his mind  he is justified in his murder because he has rid society of a selfish louse  He feels no guilt except for the effect on his closest family  There s a lot to get into this story  and I m not going to get into it here  As I ve read in other reviews  there are a few flaws  A tendency for melodrama  and a certain confusion with Russian names  Like Raskol Raskolnikov  Ivana Petrovich Petrovich Mushkin  etc  I of course exaggerate the names but it s about as confusing  Luckily this edition includes a handy character guide  Now  that s what I m talkin  about  Dostoyevski nin ustalik eseri diyebilecegimiz bir kitap Gorunurdeki hikaye yoksul bir gencin borclu oldugu bir kadini oldurmesi Kitabin derinine indiginizde ise felsefik bir tartismayla yuzyuze kaliyorsunuz Kitapta ozellikle uzerinde durulan konu  Halk tarafindan benimsenmis kahramanlarin isledigi cinayet olmuyor hatta mukafatlandiriliyorlar ama siradan bir insanin suc islemesi asla kabul gormuyor Dostoyevski kitap icinde sik sik siradan olanin ve siradan olmayanin tanimlarini yaparak bizi de olay uzerinde detaylica dusunmeye sevk ediyor Yazar sucu irdeliyor ve sucun kisisel bir ahlak probleminden cok toplumun belli deger yargilarinin cignenmesi seklinde ortaya ciktigini savunuyor Ayni zamanda Raskolnikov un yaptigi yardimlari da kitabin merkezine tasiyarak salt iyi ya da salt kotu insanlarin olamayacagini vurgulamaya calisiyor Gercekten derin felsefesini cozmek icin birden fazla okunmasi gereken bir kitap Ya se sabe que el lector  como el cinefilo y muchas otras categorias de consumidor de cultura  funciona por comparacion  Eso no significa que la comparativa se buena  Solo que es  simple y llanamente  inevitable  En mi caso  la lectura de Crimen y castigo se ha visto completamente condicionada por el libro que estuvo antes entre mis manos  Vida y destino de Vassili Grossman  Mientras a Grossman no le perdonaba ciertos deslices de extension injustificada  lo de Dostoievsky seguro que consta en los anales de la literatura como un ejemplo de depuracion y transparencia Lo primero que sorprende al abordar Crimen y castigo es descubrir que el estilo de Dostoievsky es mucho menos barroco y abigarrado de lo que podria esperarse de un autor de su epoca  increiblemente menos culterano y opaco que Grossman  mas contemporaneo   A partir de ahi  todo es una delicia  la estructura de la novela  que podria aquejarse del formato  serial   es totalmente apasionante  Cada capitulo se resuelve como un atomo independiente del resto pero con poderosas fuerzas invisibles que los unen de forma adictiva y hacen avanzar el cuerpo total a un ritmo pausado  contemplativo  pero nunca aburrido Los personajes  pese a deberle demasiado a las leyes de la dramaturgia clasica  la madre sufrida  la hermana dispuesta al sacrificio  el amigo de moralidad inquebrantable   muestran unas entranas intrincadas y ponzonosas que acaban por redondear sus caracteres  la madre que opta por la ceguera ante el drama del hijo  la hermana que elige el amor en contra de la facilidad  el amigo que vislumbra el drama en los ojos de Raskolnikov   Pero si hay un personaje que se lleva la palma  es precisamente Raskolnikov  un SER HUMANO en mayusculas con toda la carga de contradiccion que eso implica  Es Crimen y castigo no solo el retrato genial del sentimiento de culpa  como suele decirse  sino  sobre todo  una diseccion pluscuamperfecta de las contradicciones de todo ser humano  el querer y no poder  el creerse mejor de lo que en realidad se es  el no poder sobrellevar el peso de las consecuencias de tus propias acciones    La dramatica realidad de darse cuenta  muy a lo Herman Hesse  que no todos somos iguales y que la muerte de un inferior puede beneficiar a un superior Aqui  y en muchos otros aspectos  entronca Crimen y Castigo con la maravillosa Los Miserables de Victor Hugo  Los puntos de contacto entre ambas obras son numerosos y evidentes  sentimiento de culpa  enfrentamiento contra el estado  personaje de policia como manifestacion de la conciencia   Pero  sobre todo  si en algo se parecen las obras de Dostoievsky y Hugo es en la capacidad de ambos para tomarle el pulso a la cara menos amable de su epoca  Mas alla de los personajes y la trama  Crimen y castigo se destapa como un retablo hiper realista de la sociedad rusa de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX  con especial detallismo hacia las capas sociales menos favorecidas  prostitutas  borrachos y personajes que viven al borde de la indigencia se trenzan en una trama que extrae de estos substratos sociales la verdadera carne humana  I ve read this book in Italy and in Italian language when I was studying to become a medical doctor  It took me 13 days to finish it and one exam that I didn t prepare in time because of this book  It was worth it  i loved this book so much i couldn t put it down  i read it walking to and from work   and every free second i had  the daily torment of Raskolnikov s character is enought to torture any reader as well   it s so well written and the misery is so unbelievably real  it s basically a story of guilt  punishment and the prospect and movement towards redemption    Perhaps the most challenging read of my life  and one of the most important  Lo maravilloso de este libro es que cualquiera puede leerlo  Es interesante  apasionante  y tiene tantos ingredientes  que todos pueden aprovechar mucho de l  Yo lo le completo  sin hacer trampa cuando era una pre adolescente  y no se me olvidan muchos detalles que me ensearon tantas cosas  Es un retrato de la sociedad  de la cultura  del sufrimiento de los pobres  de la avaricia  de la naturaleza humana  Es una maravilla de novela que me encant an cuando no estaba preparada intelectualmente para absorber todo lo que ofreca  I m on a Dostoevsky kick right now  Previously got about half way through with The Idiot which he wrote in 1868  Read The Brothers Karamozov a few years ago  Maybe the best book ever written   A wonderful book  Loved it and was challenged all the same  The last few lines offered a wonderful  fulfilling conclusion to a rather excruciating journey  life had stepped into the place of theory   but that is the beginning of a new story the story of the gradual renewal of a man  the story of his gradual regeneration  of his passing from one world into another  of his initiation into a new unknown life  But  assez cause    read this book yourself   Sin duda una de las obras que me ha hecho sentir diversas emociones  calvideos  tristeza  enojo  desesperacion  vivia lo que Raskolnikov  su forma hipocondriaca durante toda esa miseria y sufrimiento  definitivamente una serie de tragedias al rededor de la vida de este personaje tan singular  esta segunda vez que lo he leido quedo impregnado la maravillosa historia de este hombre que despues de tantas penurias logra cobrar nuevo sentido a la vida misma     Another brilliant book  after committing double murder  Raskolnikov takes the reader through an emotionally psychological roller coaster of turmoil  anguish and fear  It was thoroughly brilliant and really easy to get into and stay with to its conclusion  Russian works have a reputation for being hard reading  but i have read several Russian Classics and can definitely say that this is not true of a great many of them  I will be reading more by Dostoyevsky   I read this book very slowly  over the course of a few weeks  No other book has presented me with the concept of guilt in quite this way  It s like waking up from a bad dream in which you ve killed someone  and for the rest of the day you have this inexplicable feeling of dread  That s the feeling of guilt this book left with me  Incredible read  It s hard to comment a novel like this  It s just perfect  amazing  It s so well written that you never realize you re reading such a great number of pages This novel bends the time   I am surprised by how much I am enjoying it  My son recommended it to me and I kept putting it off due to the size and style of the writing    lots of run on sentences  as well as paragraphs  However  I love historical and period books  and never read Dostoevsky  so I finally jumped into it about six weeks ago  I really like it  When I got into it  I found it quite thrilling  actually  It s just not a quick ready  that s all    I did not bow down to you  I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity  In Dostoyevsky s novels  I tumble head over heels in the swing between personal redemption and demise  I am always thinking that  crime  is part of human being  it is partly attached to our existence  No one can deny being dominated by the evils and the sins  even in a split second  We are all greedy when our current holdings can no longer satiate our aggrandizing appetites  we are all grumpy when things go beyond our controls and deviate from our expectations  we are all envious when rewards are bestowed to those who  in every aspect  perform far better than us  And once we are dominated by such  sins   we might step further to commit crimes  As long as crimes are committed  what left unrealized is our  punishment   There are many kinds of punishments  physical or mental  What matters is not the form of punishments  but the fact that punishments have already been taken  Here  I recall a well known saying by Lu Xun  a notable writer in China   Break out in silence or perish in it   It is in fact true as we can derive from Raskonikov  the protagonist  In the endless  irresistible and oppressed silence of hiding his murder  Raskonikov can only escape being torn from inside and suffering from delirious state by admitting his crime  he eventually breaks out   Otherwise he may live in the abiding shadow of his crime and become insane  without self surrender he would perish in the silence  But here  in this novel   crime  and  punishment  are very different from our common conceptions  Raskonikov s  crime  is not that he murders Alyona Ivanovna and her timid sister Lizaveta  but his arrogance in placing himself above his fellow men and thus is not bound by the rules of society  Likewise  the  punishment  is his deeply felt  unexpected from the standpoint of him  guilt over what he has done Beyond doubt that Raskonikov is intelligent  but he is also exceedingly arrogant  As spoken by himself  To go wrong in one s own way is better then to go right in someone else s  His perception about the world is much interesting  if we analyze it from the standpoint of Kant  Raskonikov s fundamental character alienates him from human society  His pride and intellectualism lead him to disdain the rest of humanity as merely fit to perpetuate the species  In contrast  he believes his part of an elite  superman  class and can consequently transgress accepted moral standards for higher purposes  such as the total human well beings  Notably  it is a very utilitarian perspective  Raskonikov deems the sacrifice of others  interests  even the unalienable rights of life  liberty and property  is necessary to fulfill the entire good of the majority  As opposed to him  Kant reasons that human are not instruments that can be used to maximize the utility of the society  And this is because  as Kant thinks  human are rational beings  It is such ability to reason that distinguishes us from other creatures in the world   They don t have the ability of reasoning to determine their own minds so that they cannot act freely in the intellectual world   Therefore  we find a exceedingly sharp contrast between Raskonikov s utilitarian recognition of the world and Kant s libertarian approach to unveil the world  And I am personally inclined to accept Kant s view because I regard human as respectable beings  We deserve dignity  Hence it is delightful for me to read that  in the end  Raskonikov s realization of his love toward Sonya transcend his ingrained contempt of humanity Raskonikov s relationships with other character do much to illuminate his personality and understanding of himself  Although he cares about Razumikhin  Pulcheria Alexandrovna  and Dunya  he is so constrained in his mean and skeptical outlook that he is often unappreciative of their attempts to help him  He turns to Sonya as a fellow transgressor of social norms  but he fails to recognize that her sin is much different from his  while she truly sacrifices herself for the sake of others  he essentially commits his crime for his own sake alone  Svidrigoliv is a very enigmatic guy in this novel and you can hardly find his traces and minds  Although he is a despicable and sneaky individual  Svidrigoliv possesses the ability to accept that he cannot conform the reality to meet his deepest desires  In this regard  he functions as a foil of Raskonikov  who only partially admit the idiosyncrasy of his idealized  superman  identity  After all  though Raskonikov regards himself as Napoleon  he eventually falls into the lines and rows of common people  It is nothing wrong or worthy of spite to be a common boy  it is okay for you to put much demand on yourself but not too many expectations In crime and punishment  I have witnessed the redemption of Raskonikov and the suicide of Svidrigoliv  To me  this book bears this out  redemption or demise  break out or perish  This book is one of the best books I ve read in my life Dostoyevsky describes people a lot in his books  so this tends to be tedious  but if you like Tolkien and Shakespeare and you d never came to be tired with the Iliad  you ll love this book  It s a wonderful  wonderful book  I love it from the first sentence of Part 1 all the way to the last page of Part 6 The epilogue  however  is something I take issue with It s suddenly  and this starts becoming apparent somewhere in Part 5 or 4  I think  starts looking as if Dostoevsky is writing a long winded religious tract that pretty much says  life sucks  but with Jesus     But then again  I must confess I m not a huge fan of the  salvation  part of stories  I m more into pure tragedies like Oedipus  No salvation for Oedipus  at least not in Oedipus Rex   just sorrow  tragedy  and blindness  That s my kinda thing  It s a fairly satisfying Epilogue all the same  though  I mean what a downer  after about a year of suffering through hard labour  Raskolnikov was brutally murdered in the church by a convict  would be  y know  I suppose given the circumstances  he needs to be saved  there s no other way for the ending to be good This is the second Dostoevsky book I ve read that had a rather poor ending  Perfection on paper up until the very end  where it seems to fall apart   I m referring to his book  book The Adolescent 5700  But I wouldn t at ALL un recommend this simply because of the ending  The story is exciting  the prose is wonderful  and there are some very quotable moments in it  I m glad I read it outside of a class so that I can enjoy it  but I would love to take a Russian Lit class to look further into this marvelous work  This is an absolute classic  and after reading this I understand why  The quality of Dostoievski s writing is like listening to Jimi Hendrix playing his guitar for hours  The way he gives us the story was wonderful  remember this with the chapter of the crime   Raskolnikov turned into my favorite character after this  he knocked Edmond Dantes out of the number one   the guilt eats him inside and he suffers immensely throughout the story   I won t say anymore  just read this book PLEASE  Gia du nhu the nay  ban la mot nguoi kiet xuat  ban biet ro rang rang minh se giup do duoc rat nhieu nguoi

akin to drinking from a firehouse and he s been criticized for being a writer of melodrama and cliche  And yet that is what makes the book so interesting to me  It s fascinating to make the attempt to discover how Dostoyevsky manages to make us care and how he essentially pulls us through hundreds of pages through the trick of mystery and suspense  I could feel him toying with the lessons he learned from Victor Hugo while in prison  thinking to himself in a true Engineer s fashion   yeah  this will get them  I think that this book is best explained by drawing parallels between hypnosis  Specifically  I m referred to the fractionation technique of taking subjects in and out of deeper and deeper trances  comparable to his gradual increase in paragraph length   the dissociative technique of attributing key statements to others  comparable to the epistolary nature of the early books of the novel  and the response anticipation of making someone wait for key information  comparable to prolonged  repetitive discussions between Raskolnikov and the inspector and the general theme of waiting to be discovered   In summary  I believe from my reading of this  The Brother s and Notes that Dostoyevsky s prose style is that of a verbal hypnotist  One thing that stands out in my mind now that I m reflecting back after several years is the dream with the beating of the horse and the man that kept saying   I own it  it s my property   And maybe this is a small complaint that I have  This dreams seems to be an allusion to an argument against capitalism and in favor of an impending political revolution but how can the theme of crime and punishment intermesh with a general political theme of that time such as anti capitalism  It s also interesting how he made me care so much for Raskolnikov  This novel does an excellent job of describing the ideas behind ambition  even misguided  petty ambition   Marvelous Masterpiece  assez cause   as Dosty would exclaim  You know  I m not a great one for symbolism  actually I kind of suck at it  but this book had such obvious symbolism in it that it made me smile  because I actually got it    It starts with Rodya s dreams really  doesn t it  The most obvious one to me was the dream about the poor mare who had to sacrifice herself for the men who were too impatient to wait  Not that it was a mare  not a stallion  and to me this sort of shows how women are usually sacrificing themselves for men  just as Rodya believes that Dunya is sacrificing herself for Rodya by marrying Luzhin  The dream is also brought up when Rodya talks to Marmeladov  He says that  Sonya  has to sell her body to earn a living for their entire family  The dream is also a pretty blatant warning for the impending murder  Then there was the cross which Sonya gave Rodya  and in a biblical manor  while going to the police station  he falls to his knees while carrying the cross  rather like Jesus did when he was made to carry his cross up the hill to his death and fell in the middle of the town square  Sonya funnily enough had carried the cross for him up until then that is which implies that in a biblical  Jesus like way  she is suffering for him  Sonya and Lizaveta  Rodya s victim  had exchanged crosses and become spiritual sisters  and the cross was orginally Lizaveta s   so Sonya carries her  sister s  cross  the cross of her friend and Rodya s innocent  carefree victim  whom poor old Rodya had never intended to murder   Aha  there Tyrone  I wrote a review  a rather rushed one  but I still did it   Never felt so much like a criminal as when I was reading this     This book is so effective and it is one of my favorite books  I strongly recommend you to read it  It has lots of true points about life  You will see how bad is it to lose your way  your goals about life  Raskolnikov is regretting about lots of things but also he knows what he regrets saves his life  So  he is confused and has lots of complicated questions about life  He is against to the system  It is a deep story  deep book  deep language  Dostoyevsky did an amazing job again  One of the most suspenseful and intriguing classics I ve ever read  At once a murder mystery and an in depth psychological exploration  this book is full of vivid scenes and deep  well rounded characters  A great place to start exploring the Russian masters  and an essential classic in general  Liubimata mi kniga  Finally read this classic and it was worth reading  Often painful descriptions of the suffering of the main character  who commits a double murder  and others  but gripping in its telling   This was my first Dostoyevsky and it made me ask for more  A very human and psychological character portrayal of a sinner  The German translation of the title   sin and atonement  is a better fit  I found this book stripped in the trash at the bookstore where I work and idly picked it out  Was I ever in for a ride  This book is INTENSE  I read it within 24 hours and I was in a psychotic depression for a week afterward  Sometimes I would just start crying for no reason  This book is only for those of strong mind and body  E un romanzo che legge e scava nell animo umano in maniera delicata e prepotente al tempo stesso  Pone il lettore di fronte alle scelte compiute dal protagonista e ai suoi tormenti  Al termine della lettura rimane un senso di compiutezza  Such a bracing exploration of self aggrandizing psychosis  Raskolnikov is a pleasure to view from afar  because if I got close to him I d feel wrong all over  He s misdirected  maladjusted  and ego centric  and all together not likable  But  oh  how much fun to watch him go down  And yet  I somehow pity him  The first time I read a novel from the criminal s point of view and it touched me so much that it changed how I think about protagonists and antagonists   Then I figured out  Sonia       that power is given only to him who dares to stoop and seize it  There s only one thing that matters  just one thing  you have to dare  Then a certain idea popped into my head for the first time in my life  an idea nobody had ever thought of before me  I suddenly realized  clear as day  that not a single soul had so far dared  and would not dare to bypass all this nonsense  simply take it all by the tail and shake the hell out of it  I    I wanted to dare  and I killed     I only wanted to dare  Sonia that s the whole reason  Crime and Punishment explores the morality and consequences of crime  Does the end justify the means  Raskolnikov submerges himself in his own orchestrated turmoil and anguish over the murders he committed and by doing so  alienates himself from the people who care for him the most  Pride and ego centrism rule over him throughout the story even as he is clearly overcome by guilt  In the end  it is the love that he so fervently pushed away that saves his wretched soul  I found myself unable to put the book down  especially when Dostoyevsky depicted Raskolnikov s internal turbulent anxiety as it manifested into his fits of delirium  It reminded me of the real feeling one gets while in the middle of a nightmare that feels freakishly palpable Although a long read  it is a very engaging one  I highly recommend this classic  One of my favorite books  a very interesting look into the psychology of a killer  Can be a bit dry and long  but work through it and you ll be richly rewarded  Probably the closest I ve ever come to understanding how a murderer would think  Scarily enough  I had dreams about offing people after this book  After finishing this book I felt I was not the same person any more  not just intellectually but rather something in the depth of my psyche had changed The characters are very well developed   I could relate to almost all of the major ones on on one level or another  The mood  the atmosphere and the narrative are all beyond almost anything I have ever encountered in other works of fiction   The novel is set in St  Petersburg  Russia  in the mid 1860s  Meet the star of Crime and Punishment  a young  good looking ex student  as he s coming out of his crummy little room  His name is Raskolnikov and he s thinking of doing something really  really bad  and even has a plan  He s talking to himself  and doesn t think he s really capable of doing the mysterious bad deed  and isn t even sure he wants to  Still  he s actually doing a practice run  as I speak He gets to the pawnbroker s house  Her name is Alyona Ivanovna  and she s a mean old lady  who lives with her half sister Lizaveta  who is mentally challenged and  unlike her sister  a very sweet person  Raskolnikov pawns his father s watch  and it becomes clear that the bad thing he wants to do is   murder  He wants to kill Alyona and steal her money  But he s not sure if he can  should  or will go through with it On his way back home  he goes to a bar and meets Marmeladov  an unemployed drunk  and hears his sad story  Marmeladov is married to Katerina  Katerina has three young kids from a previous marriage  and Marmeladov has an eighteen year old daughter  Sonia  from his previous marriage  Since Marmeladov is a drunk  and money is tight  Katerina made Sonia start selling sex for money  and now Sonia lives by herself  because the other tenants in the Marmeladov s building didn t want a prostitute living there  Eventually  Raskolnikov takes Marmeladov home  Want to find out more  Well you ll have to read the book for yourself  Trust me it s creepy but definitely a page turner  No worries  author Dostoevsky knows how to keep you intrigued  Still a classic after all these years  I found it much more enjoyable to read when it was not assigned school reading  I also recommend reading it with someone else for interesting discussion    An excellent and entertaining analysis of the human mind  its emotions  and insanity  In this way it actually reminded me of Catch 22  I would frequently note to myself while reading that the overwhelming detail regarding the way every character ticks  thinks  and exists is phenomenal  This book is a classic and for good reason  Quite simply one of the greatest psychological studies in literature  im my humble opinion at any rate  I ve read it only twice  but I m sure if I live another twenty five years and don t go nuts  I ll get it read another half dozen times  I find it preferable to what many consider Dostoyevsky s masterpiece  The Brothers Karamazov  as I find there are sections that are completely unnecessary  such as the drawn out section with the gang of kids  Maybe I m thick  and don t see the relevance  Anyone who can enlighten me  please let me know  I think this book is one the greatest books I have read so far  It depicts psychology in a way that is incredibly amazing  Moreover  It depicts sociology and how the structure of society affects the people who live in it It Is an amazing book  The book changes how I look at things  It changes my perspective on specific things Even though the story has its ups and downs  happy and sad moments but the end proves that confession can cure all feelings of guilt  The Ending is not what it is expected to be  not a shadow of a clue  I never expected to have a happy ending to such a mad and sad book  Rodya is mentally ill  I think   which is obvious   and that his illness is schizophrenia  In simple words  he has two personalties  Sometimes  I admire him for being so intelligent and so heroic but other times I don t like him at all as he gets so delirium and so crazy  Sometimes  Rodya reminds of the Gollum in the book The Hobbit hehehehehe Warning  the first 200 pages are very good but not WOW  The Stunning part is after the first 200 pages where it really astonishes me  IT begins with Part Three till the last word in the book  It is kind of detective novel but not based on clues and concrete evidence  rather on psychological analysis which I like the most as being interested in the filed  Overigens moet ik hierbij wel vermelden dat ik niet deze uitgave heb gelezen  maar een Nederlandse vertaling door Jan Meyer  een uitgave van de Russische Bibliotheek  En laat me bij deze zeggen dat het bij Russische Literatuur van niet te onderschatten belang is dat je een goede vertaling te pakken krijgt  Zo heb ik hier voor mij een ontzettende goedkope vertaling van  De Dubbelganger   ook Dostojevski  liggen die niet te lezen is  Het is alsof je met een volstrekt andere schrijver te maken hebt Maar goed  Even nog kort over het boek  op de achterflap wordt het  een van de beroemdste detectiveromans uit de wereldliteratuur  genoemd  maar ik weet niet of ik het daar wel mee eens ben  de hoofdzaak van  Misdaad en straf   anders dan de titel doet vernoemen  is in mijn lezing niet zo zeer de misdaad en het oplossen daarvan  zoals dat bij detectiveromans meestal het geval is  Centraal staat eerder de psychologie van de moordenaar die uiterst fijnmazig wordt uitgeplozen  wij leren zijn karakter kennen en krijgen vanuit zijn eigen mond  en die van anderen  zijn theorieen uiteengezet die hem tot het doen van zijn daad hebben geleidt Heel kort door de bocht heeft Raskolnikow een soort romantische theorie  hij wordt meerdere malen niet onwillekeurig een  Schiller  genoemd  die de mensen in twee groepen verdeeld  de geniale wet makende elite en het slaafse gepeupel  waarvan de elite een beduidend kleinere groep is die figuren zoals Napoleon  Raskolnikow zijn grote held  bevat  De geniale  wetmakende elite kan  gezien zij de groep zijn die de wetten maken  deze zelf niet werkelijk overtreden  bij het begaan van wat door het gepeupel als midaden wordt gezien  komt het niet eens in hun geniale   of krankzinnige   is de vraag die Dostojevski ons wil doen laten stellen  ziekte  koorts en waanbeelden zijn constant terugkerende motieven en thema s  geesten op dat wat zij doen verkeerd is  Zij zijn   om mij maar in eventjes onvermijdelijk in een Nietzschiaans vocabulaire uit te drukken   voorbij goed   kwaad Raskolnikow wil graag tot deze elite behoren en besluit hierdoor een  oude woekeraarster  waar niemand wat aan heeft en die iedereen alleen maar leed veroorzaakt over de kling te jagen als een soort test  Raskolnikow noemt het meerdere keren letterlijk  een test    Hij heeft prachtige morele rechtvaardigingen waarom de moord niet verkeerd zou zijn  rechtvaardigingen die hij overigens nooit los laat  Er gaan echter iets flink verkeerd  Raskolnikow wordt gedwongen een onschuldige bijstander te vermoorden en zijn geweten begint hem te parten te spelen  Wij worden door Dostojevski in Raskolnikows geest uitgenodigd terwijl hij aan zichzelf probeert te bewijzen dat hij tot de genialen behoort  tot zijn grote ergernis echter bewijst hij zichzelf echter het tegendeel en blijkt hij toch tot de niet geniale kudden te behoren  Interessant is dat zelfs wanneer hij zich uiteindelijk aangeeft en hij zich dus gerechtelijk onderwerpt aan de rechtvaardigheid van de kudde  hij nog steeds innerlijk vasthoudt aan zijn heersersmoraal  slechts in het epiloog treedt hij tot de kudde toe en wordt hij herboren  Hoe  Nou  niet door zichzelf te overtuigen met allerlei ingewikkelde morele en wetenschappelijke bewijsvoeringen en gevolgtrekkingen  maar door de Liefde  natuurlijk  met een hoofdletter   En wat waren het eigenlijk allemaal  al die angsten van het verleden  Alles  zelf zijn misdaad  zelfs het vonnis en de verbanning leken hem nu in de eerste opwelling iets uiterlijks  iets vreemds  zelfs bijna een feit dat niet met hem gebeurd was  Hij was       niet in staat alnge tijd bij voortduring over iets bepaalds na te denken of zijn gedachten op iets te concentreren  hij zou op dit ogenblik ook geen bewuste beslissingen kunnen nemen  hij voelde alleen maar  Het leven was in plaats gekomen van de dialectiek  en in zijn bewustzijn moest hij nu iets geheel anders uitwerken  En ja  dat vind ik mooi gezegd  dat van het leven dat in de plaats van de dialectiek is gekomen  Door de liefde  Raskolnikow is een karakter dat mij waarschijnlijk nog lang bij zal blijven  mede omdat ik mijzelf in bepaalde aspecten van zijn karakter herken  met name de neiging om maar te blijven malen in  de dialectiek  en soms vergeten te leven  Na het lezen van  Misdaad en straf  heb ik  net als bij het lezen van  De gebroeders Karamazov   wederom het gevoel alsof Dostojewski mij een een waardevolle levensles heeft geleerd  Bedankt  Fjodor  En  tot de

takes Raskonikolv into his moral anguish over the thought of and the killing of the old pawn broker is simply amazing work  Peering into the suppressed times of the 1800 s in Russia is one reason I like Dostoyevsky s work  One of the greatest books I have ever read  A must read for anyone  Crime and Punishment  485  1866   by Fyodor Dostoevsky is the first book I have read by the author and the third by a Russian  It contributes towards fulfilling the Year of Russian Literature objective  A lot has been said about how great this book is  it is on almost every  Best Books  list including my reading challenge list   the Hundred Books to be Read in Five Years  It has been reviewed so much that there possibly is nothing more to add  However  like Leo Tolstoy s War and Peace  and all my reviews here on this blog  I will attempt to put down how I understood the book  not how it has generally been received Crime and Punishment introduced me to the oft quoted statement or insinuation that the Russians are  the world s hardest writers   Perhaps one could also include the Germans  In C P  Dostoevsky takes the reader on a mental or psychological tour of the thought processes  the minutest details  of decision making  of creating or establishing reasons to influence  positively or negatively  responsibility taking  of the arduous workings of the conscience and how guilt or otherwise is established  psychologically  and how the latter could have physical effects on the victim or the perpetrator continue http   freduagyeman blogspot com 2013    Odiig khurtel unshaagui

musings  moves deftly and passionately and never loses steam  as Dostoevsky sometimes tends to do in other writings  Did you know that Colombo was based on the detective in this book  It s so good  but sometimes you can get lost in it  at least I did  It reminds me alot of Les Mes  with is kind  non judgemental perspective of Sonia  Dounia  and even Raskolinkov  Ever wonder what its like to be

    Raskolnikov  a St  Petersburg  Russia  university drop out commits perhaps literature s most famous crime  Thereafter  the perpetrator engages in a psychological cat and mouse game with a cunning and adept detective assigned to the case  There are many other sub plots  Totally self absorbed  Raskolnikov wanders through endless mental analysis and self justification  while at the same time  doing much good to those within his circle  He is  therefore  a bit of an enigma  Dostoyevsky paints his protagonist not so much as a wicked  black hearted  immoral  person  but rather as a disturbed  amoral  one  In his many mind games  Raskolnikov asks a cogent question  How can Napoleon bring fame and emulation to himself by killing millions  while he  Raskolnikov  is judged and castigated for doing the same thing on a much smaller scale  Do great men have license to forge their own moral codes  Though Raskolnikov never quite feels guilt for his dastardly act  he willingly submits to a punishment imposed by his society  Ultimately  there is redemption  This is a great philosophical psychological novel which poses many probing personal societal questions  My only complaint with Dostoyevsky in Crime and Punishment  which I also had with his novel The Idiot   is that the author engages in excessive tiresome  sometimes mindless  dialogue between his characters  much of which is off track and  I think  needless  Nevertheless  this is a great novel and a very engaging read     ny   tbrk mn wly k lrjl ldhyn yfDlwn lthshm w ltHTm  l  lstslm    w ynZrwn DHkyn l  jldyhm shryT   n

incomparable to any other writer   Just read C P for the second time  Rereading this masterpiece and analyzing it even more deeply has truly brought it to life for me  It s dark plot and characters are initially very depressing and give the novel a downtrodden and at times hopeless aura  however Dostoevsky provides a message behind these unfortunates that trumps their greatest vices  There is always freedom to change  No matter how terrible and unspeakable your sins  no matter who you are or who you have been you can transcend it  For me  this is the ultimate message of hope  and Dostoevsky nails it through his characters an storyline   This is one of my favorite classics  There are so many powerful messages in this book  which become especially interesting if you are familiar with different philosophies like nihilism  existentialism  and the Hegelian superman theory   Conviertase en un sol y todo el mundo lo vera  Al sol le basta existir  ser lo que es  A must read  Difficult to get through the first time  especially if it s your first Penguin Classic  but your persistence will pay off  The second time I read this book I enjoyed it thoroughly  then I realised why this is one of the greatest books ever written   This has got to be one of the darkest books I have every read  It s scary and disturbing but don t let that dissuade you from reading it  Dostoyevsky is one of those authors who flawlessly captures the characters thoughts and mental state on paper  Dostoyevsky easily ranks among the titan s of Russian literature for the simple way the suspense is allowed to build up and how Raskolnikov changes throughout the story  Raskolnikov s moral state is akin to ethical nihilism  the effect of his over reasoning the situation  Moral s hold no ground when put up against soulless reason and so he commits crimes he knows are wrong but cannot understand why  This is not a light read but I would recommend it to anyone over fifteen years of age who is mature enough to handle some pretty graphic content  khl mjr zwn jyy shrw  myshh khh yh fkhr myd srG adm    chh bkhwy chh nh b dsh dygh  dy nyst drgyry rskhlnykhf  dlyl awrdn bry khryy khh mykhnh w

 here meaning general awesomeness that combines the elements of history  philosophy and high readability to make books that are both thought provoking and enjoyable  Granted  I have only read three of the Russian big uns  War and Peace  Anna Karenina  and now Crime and Punishment  but I intend to rectify this shortly with The Brothers Karamazov and The Idiot  Now  I don t want to go blazing with too much excitement into the land of Tsars and vodka  and then just ending up with a load of disappointment like I got from some of the Aussie authors I was counting on this year  but I have honestly liked every Russian novel I ve read so far  big and small This may seem like a very odd comparison to make  but Crime and Punishment has made me feel much more ready to write my review of Stormdancer  One of my main points I wanted to make about the Japanese steampunk was to do with the massive overload of Japanese words that had me pulling up google every few minutes and resulted in a loss of excitement and appreciation for the story  But I was reluctant to say  this book is too Japanese  because I sound exactly like a typical silly uncultured westerner who isn t interested in learning about other ways of life  However  Crime and Punishment really proves that it isn t me being deliberately ignorant I knew only what I d got from Tolstoy about nineteenth century Russian society and people when I started this book  about as much as I knew about Japan from reading Manga when I started Stormdancer  The difference is that Dostoyevsky took me on an educational   but also gripping   journey around the backstreets and drinking dens of St Petersburg that told me about the nitty gritty details of life in Russia for those less fortunate   drunks  prostitutes  the poor   and I felt I had a very vivid portrait of this time and culture without once having to use google  I had a recent comment on one of my reviews basically saying I owed it to the author to do a little research before I comment on the novel  that it wasn t the author s responsibility to provide all the information  Look  in the end  I prefer a book that can stand up on its own without requiring additional material to have it make sense  I just do  And Crime and Punishment delivers that  It s educational without feeling like one lengthy info dump  and it s philosophical without being a mindfuck Raskolnikov is a great protagonist  he really is  His head is all over the place and he constantly struggles with what he believes in  his conscience and his desire to get what he wants  The reader is pulled so deep inside the dark depths of his mind that it s hard to avoid becoming completely absorbed in the story  He is at times nasty  at others funny  and at others pitiful  Dostoyevsky has created one extremely well rounded and complex character  Crime and Punishment shows the human capacity for evil  but also for shame and remorse  And this latter is the real  punishment  for Raskolnikov when he is driven near to insanity by his guilt I don t really know how best to fully articulate my feelings for Crime and Punishment  I don t give many five star ratings and I rarely feel this strongly about what I ve read  I actually had a bloody dream about it  Speaking of dreams  I want to use this one example of Dostoyevsky s ability to engage the reader so thoroughly  I read one particular scene in the book that made me seriously distressed  I was furious  on the verge of tears  I was like a child who wants to jump inside the TV and make everything better    and then Raskolnikov awakes to discover it was just a dream  I swear that my sigh of relief fully eclipsed his  But that s how far into this story I became  how much I really cared about it  That doesn t happen often  Dark  brooding  and cold  this Russian masterpiece rationalizes the mind and intent of a killer  Sweeping you into the guilt ridden complexities of human nature gone awry  Dostoevsky will have you cringing and creeping through your days as you try to detach yourself from the labyrinth esque paths of both mind and soul  Chilling and phenomenal   I was talking to a Russian friend the other day  and was shocked to hear her say the following words Raskolnikov s house and the house where was written  Crime and punishment  is close to my work    Yes  Dostoyevsky based the story on the St  Petersburg he knew   how could I not have researched it  I haven t been to Russia  but I d like to visit these places if I get the chance  Is this common knowledge  fellow Dostoyevsky fans A couple of relevant links St  Petersburg in the footsteps of RaskolnikovMap with markers identifying key sites from the novelJanuary 18  2016 I will need a couple of days to digest this book a bit more before I am able to attempt to write a review   But for now  5 stars   I m not sure if there is a better book  Well  The Brothers Karamazov might be    Still  after reading it a second time  and 12 years later  I am astonished by just how amazing a book this is  and how well it stands up to time  I doubt if anyone could have anything new to say about this classic from nineteenth century Russia  In a word it is superb  I d say it was Dostoevsky masterpiece among a plethora of incredible works from him  As far as Russian authors go  he rules supreme as far as I am concerned  Sometimes I even wish I could read Russian so that I could revisit works such as this in their original language  Oh   these Russians  First Leo Tolstoy  and now    Fyodor Dostoevsky  the  master story teller  Shook me  Consciously live the suffering  slavery   and know thy freedom  It took me 650 pages of Crime and Punishment to understand what i myself quoted  without being aware of the existence of this gem of a book  to a friend few months back Loved it   I started this book because a son was reading it before the school year started  He finished it when I had just barely started  and my reading languished as I read other books in my queue  Part of my delay was some debate over which translation to read   Once I got going again in it  I found it very interesting  and lost all fear that I was reading the  wrong  translation There are so many classics that I have not read   until now  this was one of them  Reading a summary of a book just doesn t convey the depth of thought and feeling found in the original  although I did find the character summary  included in the Kindle version  useful in keeping track of who was who  I am delighted that the translation was good enough that I forgot that I was reading a translation I think I need to start a Russian shelf  This book was very intense  In fact  I had to stop reading it before I went to sleep because of the anxiety and tension on each page  I read  by a professor of Russian lit that Dostoevsky was nothing but a good mystery writer  that once you ve read his books all the tension and power is removed from the experience upon a second reading  I don t think I am qualified to argue with that statement but I feel such a statement ignores the psychological spiritual reflection his books force on a reader  Dostoevsky was a spiritually tormented man  hungering for righteousness  and thirsting for Godly truth   all the while  seriously neglecting and mistreating his own family   I read this in high school  This book is excellent  a good read for those who have not yet got into Dostoevsky  A great psycological thriller that follows the downfall of a young man caught up in the idealism and social theories of the day  Amazingly vivid and lucid scenes full of emotion  As always Dostoevsky takes you deep into the heart of mankind to see what we really are made of  Like his other novels  Crime and Punishment debates the changing philosophical ideas of the era  Socialism  Nihilism  Utilitarianism  and Existentialism are all portrayed in major characters  The anti hero character Raskilnikov serves as the main thread of the story unlike other Dostoevsky novels were there are many main threads  The question here is if this anti hero can be saved from his damnation  from his own pride  and can a man be forgiven  This is a thriller  You won t put it down before you finish it but it also leaves your emotions  sympathies and empathies all over the place  A must read especially for lovers of Dambudzo Marechera  If Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky himself suddenly were to rise from his grave and stand before me  I would bow and kiss his feet with delight and happiness  and thank him for writing Crime and Punishment  And then I would say   but I was never able to believe that generous and noble souled young man would   or even could   kill that old woman   One might think that the reader s incredulity about a major premise would seriously damage the novel  Instead  this tension of doubt seems to have made the novel more powerful   and Raskolnikov s psychological punishment is all the more spot on believable  This is my all time favorite novel  Tense  dense  crazily interwoven  satirical  excruciating in its scenes of guilt  cruelty  shame  and all manner of human misery   yet at times extremely funny   above all  Crime and Punishment is saturated with deep love for human beings in all our particulars  Here was an author who knew the lot of humans   illness  poverty  addiction  obsession  difficult relationships  sin   suffering   and also kindness  generosity  integrity  inner strength  forbearance  forgiveness  sacrificial love  The character development is wonderfully complex  My overwhelming impression  this book sets out to marry   and to invite us to believe in the marriage  of opposites at odds with one another   woman and man  head and heart  unbeliever and believer   without either of them losing their individuality  their integrity  or even  fully  their disagreement with one other  It challenges me  personally  to love radically  and gives me hope for the possibility of reconciliation where none seems possible  Long on my to read list  as almost all of the Russian literary cannon is   Dostoevsky definitely delivers  The psychology and philosophical argument behind Raskolnikov s crime is complex  but somehow the story unfolds in a very clear and straightforward manner  There is definitely something dated and something inherently Russian about this novel  but I don t think it suffers as a result  Kaut kur dzili mani laikam slepjas krievu dvesele  jo reti kurs darbs mani spej aizkert tik loti  cik to ir izdevies izdarit krievu klasikas

While not among my very favorites  one of the best books I have read   I really find myself at a loss for words in describing the impression this novel left on me  It is at once shocking yet strangely real  Dostoevsky s compelling commentary on the human mind powerfully depicts our everyday struggles  It was through this novel that I learned to appreciate the eulogy credited to Dostoevsky as one with an impressive understanding of the human psyche   The only book that I ve ever read at the same time as I was reading the Cliff Notes  This book required me to really try and understand exactly what was going on  but I found the themes of this book quite interesting  From the question of whether or not their really were people who could committ crimes without repurcussions   conscience to redemption through suffering  this book had it all  Great  great book  Dostoyevsky takes you into a criminal s psyche and the slow unraveling of his state of mind  It is engaging  introspective  and you are left with a heavy mind full of personal philosophical analysis of human nature in general  This was excellent and a much easier read than I expected  I had read The Brothers Karamazov in high school and remembered that being very dense  This wasn t at all  just a few difficult parts  Edna ot nai zavladiavashchite knigi  koito niakoga s m chel  Naistina ne ochakvakh da mi kharesa tolkova

was love at the first chapter  No spoilers  but the end was a bit anticlimactic  though not enough to significantly damage the book s effect  At first I felt really guilty for empathizing with a criminal  When reading  Les Miserables  I wasn t feeling so anxious for Jean Valjean not to get caught somehow as I was for Raskolnikov Of course this book goes right to my  favorites list   After all  I love miserable  crazy people    Tout Dostoievsky est a lire mais il demande du courage et de l investissement  C est tres noir  ce livre descend aux trefonds de l humanite et c est derangeant  Une histoire de crime et de remords   Great book  It felt like an immense journey of reason that Raskolnikov underwent  I enjoyed the ending especially  because he realized he was being born again  That is a true freedom of humanity  As a Catholic  this is one of my favorite books of all time  Ha  I can t even begin to imagine how someone could have written this on a deadline  An intelligent  meditative diatribe against the numerous hypocrisies in modern society  an insightful dialogue revolving around the subjectivity of morality and how it dictates human nature  and an all round entertaining thriller  One of the best books I ve ever read  Murder   torment   retribution   resurrection  These are the themes of Dostoyevsky s CRIME AND PUNISHMENT  And this is a book I have avoided reading for decades  fearing it would be dull and difficult to comprehend  I was wrong  This is a magnificent epic of life prior to the Russian Revolution and one man s mistake  The descriptions of life in Russia at that time are precise and heart wrenching  The poverty  the squalor  the inability to rise above your standing in life and  worst of all  the descriptions of starving children being forced to  dance  for a few rubles so their parents and siblings won t starve  It s a bleak situation and yet the narrative and characters are often amusing and always fascinating  despite their lot I listened to the audio book version and Anthony Heald  the narrator on this particular version  was absolutely superb  If there were Oscars for book narration  he should have received one for this  He did every character  including the female ones  and you never had to guess who was speaking the dialogue because he adapted his voice so smoothly from one character to another  Simply outstanding   This is my favorite book  I have lots of those  but this is my favorite  penance  book  It s punishment and redemption wrapped in a thousand pages  Watching Rasky  that s my knick name for him  go mad when he doesn t even  shouldn t even  need to drives me crazy  but then he has to pay for the sin  In college  I remember the teachers say that there is a relationship between Raski s jail time and the Lord s salvation   I always thought that was a shit comparison  Anyway  need to repent for a sin  read this book and be REDEEMED  Un arscin di spazioIl 23 Aprile 1849 la polizia dello zar Nicola I arresta a San Pietroburgo trentaquattro membri del circolo Petracevskij  L accusa  attivita sovversiva e cospirazione  Fra i nomi degli arrestati figura anche quello di Fedor Michajlovic Dostoevskij  che afferma di aver frequentato il circolo  ma per motivi connessi alla sua attivita di scrittore  Tanto basta all ottuso regime per considerare il prigioniero particolarmente pericoloso al punto che fra le ventuno condanne a morte pronunciate dal tribunale c e anche quella di Dostoevskij  La sentenza  grazie alla benevolenza dello zar  sara commutata in quattro anni di lavori forzati nella fortezza di Omsk in Siberia e nel successivo arruolamento forzato nell esercito come soldato semplice Il  bagno penale  e un esperienza che segna profondamente lo spirito di Dostoevskij  in particolare la condizione di trovarsi  lui nobile  in mezzo a comuni delinquenti  per la maggioranza di bassa lega sociale e di scarsa cultura  Ma l abisso culturale che divideva lo scrittore dagli altri prigionieri era assai piu profondo  Dostoevskij era proiettato verso l occidente  padrone di idee completamente nuove e rivoluzionare  mentre nell esilio entra in contatto per la prima volta con l anima popolare russa  in modo inappellabile  diretto e profondo  Questa  convivenza forzata  sara per lui fonte di arricchimento  condizione che gli consentira di descrivere meglio i personaggi delle sue opere successive L esperienza dell esilio e della reclusione e facilmente individuabile come la radice  il quid pluris che porto alla nascita di una delle maggiori opere dostoevskiane  Delitto e Castigo  o piu correttamente Il Delitto e la Pena  in cui si legge un diretto riferimento alla celeberrima opera di Cesare Beccaria  Questo errore di trasposizione deriva dai curiosi natali della prima traduzione italiana del 1889  che fu fatta non utilizzando il testo russo  ma quello della traduzione francese di cinque anni prima  il cui titolo era Le Crime e le Chatiment  Il traduttore francese Derely  non avendo colto il riferimento al titolo di Beccaria  scelse il termine chatiment per la traduzione del russo nakazanie  che equivaleva sia per  castigo  che per  pena   Ma se per il francese puo valere questa ambivalenza terminologica  la stessa cosa non si puo dire per l italiano Il fatto potrebbe apparire irrilevante  ma non e proprio cosi  Il tema cardine del romanzo Il Delitto e la Pena e infatti il passaggio dalla pena al castigo  come affermato dallo stesso Dostoevskij in una lettera del 1865 Molti scelgono quest opera come primo approccio alla letteratura russa che  per un assurdo pregiudizio  viene considerata come ostica e arida  in poche parole  una vera e propria prova di coraggio per lo sprovveduto lettore  Ma al lettore  novello o veterano che sia  e consigliabile spogliarsi di ogni altro ricordo letterario  evitare di affrontare il testo cercando di improvvisarsi psicologo o sociologo e tentare di mettersi nei panni dei pietroburghesi che nell autunno del 1865 lessero per la prima volta il primo capitolo di Delitto e Castigo Proprio un fatto di cronaca dell epoca spinge Dostoevskij a una riscrittura della prima bozza del suo romanzo  mettendo i propri lettori davanti a un fatto realmente accaduto qualche tempo prima  l uccisione di un usuraio in tempo di crisi economica  A questo dato viene poi fornito uno spessore che non e solo mera cronaca criminale  ma assume le sembianze di un indagine sociale  il ritratto di una citta e dei suoi abitanti   atto di accusa e indicazione di riscatto   Al centro di tutto questo si trova il personaggio dello studente assassino  i suoi moventi  la sua reale pena  interiore e esteriore  l isolamento dagli affetti  la lacerazione della coscienza  il conflitto psicologico Commettere un omicidio efferato e far finta che non sia successo niente  Rimuovere totalmente l accaduto o incominciare un inevitabile analisi dei motivi che hanno spinto al delitto  scandagliando e sminuzzando il proprio spirito  Infatti  solo attraversando di nuovo l inferno si puo tentare di intravedere una via d uscita  una rinascita  si puo ritornare  a rivedere le stelle   E  proprio questo isolamento  questa convivenza forzata con la propria coscienza e la consapevolezza dell impossibilita di vivere senza il contatto con gli altri  che spinge infine Rodion Raskolnikov  il protagonista  alla sua confessione Delitto e Castigo e interprete di un nuovo modo di raccontare  Dostoevskij utilizza la terza persona  guidando l evolversi delle vicende  ma lasciando la parola solo ed esclusivamente ai suoi protagonisti  rendendo loro giustizia  dotandoli di vita propria  Il risultato e un romanzo polifonico  di straordinario realismo  violento nel suo impatto emotivo I personaggi principali sono essenzialmente due  Raskolnikov  mente brillante  ex studente costretto a vivere nell indigenza e assassino  e Sonja  ragazza dallo spirito puro costretta a prostituirsi per mantenere la propria famiglia in miseria  Le vittime  una vecchia e maligna usuraia e sua sorella Lizaveta  morta per pura e sfortunata coincidenza  sbiadiscono di fronte al loro uccisore  diventano pallide e insignificanti  dei  pidocchi  come vengono descritte dallo stesso Raskolnikov Pier Paolo Pasolini individuo in Raskolnikov l embrione dell idea del superuomo che Nietzsche elaborera nel 1881  anno in cui Dostoevskij muore  ma quest ultimo sconfessera quello che l altro esaltera In questa ottica appare chiara la scelta di uccidere  Raskolnikov  infatti  spiega come il mondo sembrerebbe essere diviso in due categorie inalienabili  gli uomini ordinari e quelli straordinari  Nel primo caso si identifica la maggior parte dell umanita  il cui unico scopo e vivere e procreare  mentre della seconda categoria farebbero parte tutte le menti illuminati  i grandi pensatori e i grandi condottieri  la cui coscienza rende lecito qualsiasi delitto essi possano compiere  a patto che i moventi siano nobili  Infatti a un esimio scienziato come Newton sarebbe stato perdonato il sacrificio di qualche vita  se questo fosse stato determinante per la diffusione delle proprie conoscenze  indispensabili all umanita intera Raskolnikov  dal canto suo  si sente un dominatore  aspirante a napoleoniche imprese  e per questo puo uccidere una vecchia che presta denaro per usura  Da questo denaro egli potra sostenere grandi progetti  risolvendo non solo i propri problemi  ma quelli di molte altre persone meritevoli  Inizialmente  quindi  crede di compiere un gesto nobile  uccidere la vecchia sara semplice e non sara un peso per la coscienza  in quanto un superuomo e fornito di attitudini naturali atte a scavalcare questo  patetico ostacolo  Invece  pur avendo compiuto un delitto perfetto grazie anche all assistenza della fortuna  pian piano desiderera inconsciamente di essere smascherato e provera una vera e propria liberazione quando potra confessare la propria colpa Nessuno lo ha visto brandire l accetta contro le vittime  nessuno lo ha visto scappare  Tuttavia incomincera a sentirsi male  a provare un incontrollabile rimorso per cio che ha compiuto  a temere di essere scoperto in qualunque momento e in preda a un incurabile febbre celebrale sara ossessionato da continue allucinazioni  Risucchiato da un vortice di disperazione e paura e solo con se stesso  e intimorito da tutto  cancella indizi  tenta di nascondere le prove  cerca di beffare la ragione e l assennatezza  In un delirio di onnipotenza arriva anche a sfidare la stessa polizia  scisso  diviso  dilaniato dal proprio atto barbarico  come d altronde dimostra anche il suo nome    da una parte sembra voler sfidare le leggi del mondo  ma dall altra desidera pagare la propria colpa senza sconti di pena  Il lettore lo insegue  lo accantona  lo giudica  lo aiuta a rialzarsi  vinto anch esso dalla follia del personaggio  che nel suo peregrinare nei quartieri poveri di San Pietroburgo conosce un mondo di relitti umani  in cui la sua degradazione morale si specchia e si riconosce  Solo nel momento in cui la sensazione di essere un superuomo iniziera a vacillare  Raskolnikov trovera il vero coraggio  quello di confessare il delitto commesso Nessuno dei protagonisti di Delitto e Castigo risulta fine a se stesso  ma ognuno simboleggia una qualita dall animo  Raskolnikov e la mente umana in cui le passioni e l istinto soverchiano e diventano estranei alla ragione  Il  tarantolato  Rodion e solo l esasperazione di un malessere  che lo rende misantropo  disadattato  Come molti altri personaggi di Dostoevskij manifesta una serie infinita di sintomi  febbre  epilessia  schizofrenia  follia  come giustificazione per tutte le piu malsane perversioni che il buon senso puo partorire  Una forma di esorcismo  che ancora una volta contrappone il bene al male  senza avere la facolta e il privilegio di saperli distinguere Raskolnikov  dopo l omicidio compiuto nella prima parte del romanzo  vive la propria degenerazione in uno stato di irrazionalita e di paranoia  rifiutando inconsciamente l amore della razionalita e della ragione  ma cercando sempre di raggiungere i confini  i limiti estremi di quello che e in grado di fare e quello che per lui risulta per natura inaccessibile Pier Paolo Pasolini nella sua analisi all opera  vede in Raskolnikov un moderno Edipo  turbato dallo sfrenato affetto proferitogli dalla madre e dalla sorella Dunja  Il protagonista si trova incatenato a questo amore  a cui si aggiungono gli obblighi verso la propria famiglia che  per mantenerlo agli studi universitari  opera innumerevoli sacrifici  L omicidio della vecchia usuraia sarebbe per Raskolnikov un estremo tentativo di eliminare l onnipresente e  asfissiante  presenza materna  simbolo di tutti gli obblighi umilianti a cui e sottoposto  il riproporsi continuo del destino a cui sa di non potersi sottrarre Tuttavia l omicidio si rivelera totalmente vano  in quanto la famiglia di Raskolnikov piombera a San Pietroburgo e il protagonista si trovera a dover intraprendere la propria a voluta  via crucis  verso l atto finale Sonja  invece  la dolcissima presenza femminile del romanzo  dai toni sottomessi e onirici  ci viene descritta come la figura chiave dello svolgersi delle vicende  Il compito affidatole dall autore e quello di spargere amore e speranza  Ragazzina appena diciottenne dalla presenza timida e umile  e la portatrice della piu elevata moralita di tutto il libro e aiutera Raskolnikov ad avvicinarsi alla fede  Non e un caso  infatti  che Dostoevskij renda una prostituta portatrice del messaggio divino  Sonja non fara nulla di straordinario  ma il suo incondizionato amore per Raskolnikov  il suo credo incrollabile nella Provvidenza e la sua totale purezza saranno determinanti per stravolgere completamente il corso degli eventi Il Vangelo e menzionato nel romanzo solo due volte  accompagnato sempre dalla presenza della ragazza  la prima volta quando il protagonista chiede a Sonja di leggergli il passo della resurrezione di Lazzaro  vicenda parallela alla morte e rinascita spirituale di Raskolnikov  e una seconda volta  ormai nell epilogo  quando il giovane  esiliato nel penitenziario  ritrova accanto a se lo stesso Vangelo e  anche senza aprirlo  capisce che l amore di Sonja lo obbliga ad abbracciare la fede Attorno alle vicende dei due protagonisti si snodano una serie di storie personali  di intrighi  di personaggi che arricchiscono all inverosimile un racconto gia di per se un capolavoro  Non svolgono ruoli da poco la sorella di Raskolnikov  Dunja  anch ella divisa da sentimenti contrastanti  ovvero l affetto per il fratello  le amorevoli attenzioni della madre e la necessita pratica di concedersi a un  demone  del capitalismo  ancora c e Razumichin il devoto e fedelissimo amico del protagonista  simboleggiante l assennatezza e la ragione  e l infido Svidrigajlov ossessionato dal proprio passato oscuro  costantemente accompagnato dall ombra di due delitti e dalle accuse di pedofilia  infine  Porfirij il cervellotico procuratore che ha in mano l indagine del delitto e i Marmeladov  la famiglia di Sonja  all apice della degradazione umana rintracciabile nella Pietroburgo di meta ottocento Tuttavia nessuno di questi personaggi e univocamente buono o cattivo  sano di mente o totalmente folle  non c e una divisione netta dei caratteri  ogni comportamento appare ambiguo  confuso  e ogni ritratto iniziale evapora  si ricompone  modificandosi a seconda degli stati d animo  delle circostanze  delle casualita  E anche l evocativa San Pietroburgo e soggiogata da questo mosaico acquatico e poliedrico  Teatro delle vicende narrate  ci viene offerta attraverso descrizioni che ai nostri occhi la rendono ben diversa e senza dubbio piu misera della splendida capitale della Russia zarista che siamo abituati a conoscere L insostenibile pena spinge Raskolnikov ad affrontare il castigo  senza dimenticare il fondamentale ruolo svolto dall atteggiamento di Sonja  L attimo decisivo che inverte il destino di Raskolnikov e infatti proprio il momento in cui lui le rivela la colpa e lei  candidamente  gliene chiede la ragione  Alle giustificazioni brillanti di filosofia e richiami storici che Raskolnikov  sempre meno convinto  offre a Sonja si contrappone la reazione di lei  genuina  istintiva  concreta  pura  La scena non appare lineare o logica  ma ci viene descritta da Dostoevskij in maniera quasi caotica  dove alla parola di Rodion si contrappone l emozione di Sonja  Se prima di questo avvenimento la narrazione aveva un ritmo  dopo il colloquio dei due giovani il ritmo accelera  si fa imprudente e impetuoso e i fatti cominciano a precipitare  Fino alla conclusione finale  tormentata prima e successivamente liberatoria In chiusura Dostoevskij annuncia un seguito atto ad approfondire il passaggio di Raskolnikov alla sua nuova vita   Ma qui comincia un altra storia  la storia del rinnovamento graduale di un uomo  la storia della sua rigenerazione  del passaggio graduale da un mondo a un altro  della presa di coscienza di una nuova realta fin li totalmente sconosciuta  Potrebbe essere il tema di una nuova narrazione  ma il nostro racconto attuale ha termine   Quel seguito non ci sara mai  Tuttavia non e difficile capire che corso potrebbe aver avuto la rinascita di Rodion Raskolnikov  Un po  come quello di un condannato a morte che  un ora prima di morire  pensa che se gli toccasse di vivere su un alta cima tanto stretta da poterci appoggiare solo i piedi  con intorno solo abissi  oscurita eterna  solitudine e tempesta  e scegliere di rimanere cosi  in un arscin di spazio  sceglierebbe di vivere in quel modo piuttosto che morire subito  Per mille anni  In eterno   Vivere come che sia  ma vivere    E questa e la verita  A definite must read  My first Dostoyevsky book and definitely not my last  what can I say  It s THE perfect book  I have read quite a few classics  but this is my favorite  The characters struggles are intriguing  and the choices they make illuminating in terms of development of both plot and individuals  I have read it several times for pleasure and enjoyed it greatly     I read Dostoevsky s  The Idiot  many years ago and hated it  I in fact hated it so much  I needed to put over thirty years between that reading and this more recent one of  Crime and Punishment   While I m sorry I waited as long as I did  at least I came back to Dostoevsky and was able to revise my general opinion of his talents I have to say that I believe    whatever my experience with  The Idiot     Dostoevsky to be a far superior writer to Leo Tolstoy   Crime and Punishment  is a true work of genius  and I don t use that word frivolously  The plot is fairly straightforward  the characters are neatly and convincingly drawn  the setting itself is as much a  character  as the people Why do I suggest that  Crime and Punishment  is a work of genius  One reason  the story and its resolution will stay with you long after you turn the last page Of course  the same might be said of  American Psycho   But here  we re talking about a man with a conscience    and therein lies the rub A word about the translation    Don t make the mistake of picking up Constance Garnett s Russian English translation of this work or any other  She worked much too quickly and much too haphazardly  and I sometimes had to scratch my head and wonder whether she was truly a native English speaker  Instead  look for the more recent translation by the married pair  Richard Pevear  American  and Larissa Volokhonsky  Russian   They indeed know what they re doing    and apparently do it fully conscious of the fact that they re bringing the Russian classics to a non Russian reading public RRB04 16 11Brooklyn  NY  USA This novel  about an poor arrogant young student in St  Petersburg Russia  is a masterpiece  Though at times Dostoevsky can be a bit wordy in his descriptions  much can be learned about what Russian life might have been like back in his day  His characters are multi dimensional and there is much  pathos  in them  This is one trait I enjoy about Dostoevsky in general  A wonderfully tragic  yet ultimately redemptive story   I read this book over a week on the oregon coast   Raskolnikov is a great character in all of literature   his fits  weaknesses  melancholy  ideas  held me captivated to the end   which was very good in my opinion    a story that will shock  open  reveal  and veil the minds eye with many interesting intersections    I learned to save the money I steal in a secret spot    mike seely and the acid tong  2As the title states  this book falls under the crime genre  Dostoevsky was an absolutely revolutionary writer  who created the archetype for crafty literary police officers  This novel follows a young Russian student who must fight with the guilt of killing an innocent woman and search for the true meaning of life and suffering  This book opened my eyes to the world of crime novels and film  Although it has been translated from it s original Russian language  the flow of the novel is seemingly effortless  One could read it for hours without looking at the clock  I not only found it an entertaining book  but it s powerful message about inner suffering and how we deal with guilt hit me right in the heart  It causes one to think about human psychology where guilt comes from  The main character was one whom I despised and felt bad for at the same time  It is a lengthy book and can grow a tad bit boring in the beginning when the characters are all being introduced  but is overall an interesting book  Whattay deep profound study of human psychology  The protagonist Roskolnikov  s views and his inclination towards crime seem to me to be ironic towards unnatural structure of society and not stemming from his own moral views  He protests against all the sufferings and pain in the world by prostrating his own views of right and wrong  His article on the right of exceptional people to transgress laws and to even shed blood is very much parallel to Napoleon s view of he being  above all others   The story though painfully revolving around the same plot without much progress however keeps the reader on the hook with just the right amount of suspense  I would rate this story 4 stars as I really really liked it  For those who think its a drag  keep it saved till winters and have it daily with a cup of coffee in those long dreary winter rainy days    The resulting picture is sometimes monstrous  but the setting and the whole process of the presentation sometimes happen to be so probable  and with details so subtle  unexpected  yet artistically consistent with the whole fullness of the picture  that even the dreamer himself would be unable to invent them in reality  After reading an abridged version of this book  I finally have my hands on a translation by Michael Scammel  Delves deep into the hows  whats and whys of human life  I think I m slowly beginning to understand the  Raskolnikov effect   why sometimes people go to great lengths to achieve closure   Certainly one of the most memorable books I have read in recent years  Many  classic  novels just don t grab my interest for long  This is the exception  Absolutely incredible  It is no surprise that this novel has remained relevant into the 21st century  This is the Dostoevsky novel that is the most accessible to the modern reader  I have already read this  and I DO love Dostoyevsky s writing so I figured I would try this as an audiobook  since it was free at Downpour  Will I give it four stars as I did before  NO  this time it gets five   Where to start  With the easy stuff  The narration by by Anthony Heald was superb  Some characters cough  some characters have a special evil laugh  Attention was taken to deliver a stupendous performance  I felt I was at a theater  This is a case where the narration is the icing on a delicious cake  an interesting cake that intrigues and is delicious  A narrator can influence how we  the listeners  interpret the personalities of characters and the importance of events  I felt that the written words perfectly matched the narrator s inflections  Some characters are at times very irritating  The narration drove this home perfectly  THEN there is a switch in tone and you begin to see how intelligent that creep really is  I am speaking of the investigating lawyer  Wow  as the story unfolds this character and others come alive  They have depth  Not one person is simple  People are complicated  and my praise for this book focuses primarily on how Dostoyevsky draws his characters  It takes a while to know them  just as it does with real people  People are complicated and Dostoyevsky s characters are all complicated  and so they become real people  If you are a cool  collected and self assured person not interested in analyzing human behavior  you might differ with my judgment and say the characters are ridiculously emotional  crazy  neurotic  I say they are real people  His characters reflect the behavior of you and I  That is what I say When you listen you see where people live  and it is not a pretty picture  You know that painting by Chagall of a twisted bed up in the garret  That is what is delivered  but with words  Life in St  Petersburg in the 1860s  when this novel first came out  1866   Dostoyevsky writes about what he knows You also clearly see that this novel was written as a monthly installment for a magazine  Each month s installment grabs your interest  keeps you hanging and at the end you simply are compelled to read the next installment  What will happen  Dostoyevsky delivers not only character analysis but also a page turner  Somebody gets killed  Someone is murdered  Drownings  Parties  Marriages  People run over  A lot happens  and this is not what usually attracts me to a book  but I loved it  I wish contemporary writers could write page turners as exciting as this Dostoyevsky even presents religion in a manner I can swallow  You get a page turner  You get character analysis  and you get psychological and philosophical knots to untwist  When you commit a crime  how is punishment delivered  Probably the best novel I have ever

writing this  A review  Such a little pitiful thing compared to the book  I ponder also  pondered  rather  while I was reading it  rereading it  read it in Russian in my teens   I pondered   no  I was trying to understand it from the height of my almost forty years  again  what the book was about  And it struck me as very simple  Hence the love for it  perhaps  and the many hearts it has touched  It s about human nature  The uncertainty of it all  the seeking  the searching  the contemplating  and  ultimately  finding love  Because there is nothing else  only love  That s all we seek  To be  resurrected by love   Besides  take it from a Russian  yes  I was born and raised in Russia   this particular translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky beats all previous versions  The language  Oh  the language  the nuances  the colors  the tones  the dialogue  Everything is preserved  It s as close to Russian as you will get it in English  So read it  If you haven t yet  read it  it s a masterpiece  It will touch you on a level you thought was not possible  At least I thought it was not possible  and it touched me  The human suffering  all of it  in one book  How is that even possible  It is  Somehow  I hold the book and I still can t believe what I m holding  As to the story itself   Russia  St  Petersburg  A poor student  A scholar  A shabby pitiful closet he lives in  In poverty  no  in complete destitution  That is Rodion Raskolnikov  He occupies his time by planning to murder a pawn broker  Alyona Ivanovna  an old hag  an insignificant  louse   as he calls her  Now  because you might be unfamiliar with that happens next  which is hard to imagine  given the publicity of the story  but still   I will withhold the plot and let you discover it on your own  In that case  i case you haven t read it or don t know what it s about  WARNING  do not read the foreword  It will spoil the story for you  but do read it after you re done  It s got great insights and facts about both the book and the author  Anyway  I m getting distracted  The book is  in fact  about precisely the things it spells out in its title  Crime and punishment  What it means  to commit a crime  what is crime  what is the punishment for it  and what it means to endure it  There are many chance encounters that will pull Raskolnikov this way or the other in his journey  and that is life  It s what happens to us  every day  We think we know  we think we figured it out  then life comes at us and fools us  The beauty of the book perhaps is in this  Life hasn t changed much  In that  it reads fresh  there is no feeling of it being written in the nineteenth century  I know I will be coming back to this book again  and again  and again  And I envy you  if you will read it for the first time  because I wish I could do it again  Best of all Russian Literature  best of all Dostoyevsky  Gripping and exciting to the modern eye  despite being over a century old  Very few books preserve their intensity or relate ability over that span of time  This book is wonderful  Dostoyevsky  instead of narrating a person s life  makes us live it by etching his characters profoundly well  that each of the persons we come across are discussed in various depths of multitude which is without saying that there is not a single hero or a single villain in this classic  Crime and Punishment  Though  I felt a little bit let down with the translation of David McDuff  which I think is just a reason for me to read the same novel from another translator  Dostoyevsky is  by no means  a master story teller and to some extent a psycho analyst who never fails to portray or precisely introduce your heart to yourself   Scintillating in all aspect    For some reason they seem to only have Crime in Punishment in Spanish  weird  Anyhow  this has long been a favorite of mine  I tend to favor tragedies over comedies because tragedies generally give you more to think about and learn from than comedies  I enjoy reading light  fun  stuff  but then I forget about it  Tragedies  and whatever wisdom they offer  tend to stay with me Anyhow  Crime and Punishment is not a tragedy  it actually has a redemptive ending  But I love how it deals with the  modern  issues of nineteenth century St  Petersburg  and that the issues of poverty  education  marriage  women s rights  prostitution  science suffering  and religion are still just as relevant today  Raskolnikov  despite being a cold blooded murderer  ends up being someone you sympathize with and relate to  He s someone whose very nature is split between the selfish  modern man  and the compassionate christian who wants to alleviate other people s suffering It s really good  Capolavoro assoluto  pieno di temi interessanti e spunti di riflessione  Psicologico e psicanalitico  ma molto ben strutturato come trama  svolgimento  personaggi e descrizione  Piu di una persona mi ha detto che l ha sempre evitato perche spaventata dalla sua mole  io l ho letto in ebook  ma in formato cartaceo siamo sulle 650 pagine   e lungo si  ma anche scorrevolissimo e coinvolgente     lo consiglio vivamente a chiunque piaccia la lettura  Timeless book  I can t really express what I learned from this book  but it s very touching and powerful  and it really makes you think of yourself in relation to the world around you  Everyone should read this book  Un universo emozionale  questo di Dostoevskij  denso di scrittura appassionata  calda e rutilante  in continuo movimento  ricco di personalita e personaggi di diverse estrazioni sociali che  incrociando le loro storie  accompagnati dalle loro disgrazie  seguiti dai loro destini  si prestano a rappresentare le riflessioni dell autore con palpabile ardore  Slow moving  dense and thought provoking  This is a disturbing tale of a descent into immorality and the subsequent repercussions arising from the central character  Rakolnikov s actions  Set in pre revolutionary Russia this book is heavy on decay  poverty and hopelessness  Don t know If I would say I enjoyed it but I am glad I read it  I will read it again one day  What would it be like to murder  How could you justify it to yourself  And if you actually decided to do it could you steel your convictions all the way through and resolve  when it was all over  that you acted rightly  Would you torment yourself for this moral transgression  or would you become paranoid that your  crime  would be found out This is my first book by Dostoevsky and  knowing his reputation as a Russian mogul of literature  I was very surprised how simply he told this story  I hardly had recourse to a dictionary  there were few esoteric references to Russian history  and the story was told directly without any obscurantism or attempts to keep the reader in the dark  The greatest hurdle was in getting straight the various names of characters  e g  Rodion Romanovich  Raskolnikov  and Rodya are all the same character  Sofya   Sonia  Pyotor Petrovich   Luzhin  and the name Ivanovna is not a surname and does not denote familial ties to other Ivanovnas  This caused some confusion The story centers around Raskolnikov s  crime  and his grappling with the consequences of its fallout  He is a split character  bipolar  who alternatively belauds and condemns his actions  firstly  as evidence of superiority over the human race  he calls others  louses   and  secondly  as stupid  foolish  and rash  He spends much of the book not in a moral purgatory between the rightness and wrongness of his crime  but in paranoia over his  crime  being found out  Paranoia  delirium  and physical illness all further obscure his thoughts and perceptions  does Zosimov know he s guilty  or is he imagining it  or did he give away too much by his words  or was he too eager in feigning innocence  did that draw attention I don t tend to write in the margins of non fiction books very often  but with this I found myself furiously scratching in pejoratives and exclamation marks throughout  The book got a rise out of me  and I think that evidence enough for the quality of Dostoevsky s writing   Yeah  it s depressing as hell  But what a read  And what a dilemma  Is it OK to kill someone who is perceived as evil if the result is something that will eventually help all of mankind  Who the hell makes that judgement anyway  An overlooked classic   I read it in High School and it has stayed with me  and haunted me  ever since  BeautifulBeautifulthis is one of those books that once you finish you immediately want to recommend to someone else  this is a tragedy  romance  suspense and thrilling drama but more importantly it is a statement of psychology  this is a must read and I will definitely be reAding Dostoevsky s other works  Strangely hypnotic and compelling yet slightly disturbing and claustrophobic read  A good reminder why crime doesn t pay  because even if the law doesn t punish you your own mind surely will  Although written in the 19th century  it felt oddly contemporary with its scenes  dialogues and universal themes of suffering the consequences of your actions  guilt  poverty induced misery  etc  the colour yellow will never be the same to me again   Smogu li ia perestupit  ili ne smogu  Osmelius  li nagnut sia i vziat   ili net Ne vsegda cheloveku  chtoby pochuvstvovat  sebia chelovekom neobkhodimo zhit

pleasant read but very telling of human nature   at times something lost in translation but a good read Impressions from Dostoyevsky have remained with me throughout my life  for the good and the bad  His eldritch realism and psychological insight strikes me as the most authentic not only for its time but for the future  Most of all  he exhibits the dark morbid human urge to self destruct  an urge which often has no reason  if the icy and often gothic corners of pre revolution St Petersburg is not enough of a reason   The most enduring image for me  Marmeladov  Often I would sit drinking alone in hovels in the Far East that could have been plucked from a novel of Dosotoyevsky s  and would recall this lowly alcoholic civil servant  knowing in my heart I was on the same path of doom but nevertheless became morbidly cheerful and jocular before and as all the madness ensued  It was like I gloated in my own misery  In this way Dostoyevsky is all the more convincing  I lived the humiliation and spiritual purgatory of being a real life Marmeladov  though I m happy to have experienced something of redemption  On the subject of redemption  Crime and Punishment is something of an anomaly with Dostoyevsky because Raskolnikof finds his  though this has always seemed to me a rather arbitrary and forced ending to the work which is overshadowed and possibly made impotent by the ominosity and turmoil of the preceding chapters  It s a pity I read translation  but I feel nothing in spirit is lost  Dostoyevsky is one of those rare life changing writers  because his themes are still pressing  no matter how they are delivered  Realistic  he is also controversial  dealing with the paedophile  a subject skirted by most in the 19th century  in Svidrigailov  a character who is equally terrifying but more repugnant than Raskolnikof  What could be more dramatic than Svidrigailov s fate  What could be more spooky than his matter of fact accounts of supernatural experiences  When I first read it gave me the goosebumps  Yes  dostoyevsky has it all  and St Petersburg is transmogrified symbolically into the human mind  so that  probably for the worse  you never know what might be unmasked within its chambers   a genious work  you can t juge crimes the same way after you finish reading this one   a crime may be a panishment   it makes you try to find if a killer can be innocent    a real crazy amazing work   Dostoyevsky masterfully teaches the power of guilt in Crime and Punishment  It lets you read the mind of a criminal  kind of creepy but totally fascinating  I love the overall message of the book  which I won t disclose  or I would spoil the whole thing   Dostojewski befand sich 1865 im Ausland und hatte sich finanziell fast wegen seiner Spielsucht ruiniert  Er bat seinen Verleger um Vorschuss fur einen Roman  Allerdings musste er das nachste Buch dann innerhalb von reichlich einem Jahr fertig stellen  Da ihm die Zeit weg lief  schrieb er zwischenzeitlich in sage und schreibe 26 Tagen  Der Spieler  um sich anschliessend wieder in Ruhe seinem oben genannten Roman zu widmen  Er wurde ein Beststeller  Der Roman ist einen Vergleich zu Patrick Susskinds  Das Parfum  wert  Die Romanhelden sind sich im Vielem ahnlich  Oh my god  What a novel  What themes  What study of human conscience and society  What great realization of our self crucifixion at the hands of our own consciences  Wow  Don t even get me started on Dostoyevsky  Dostoevsky   He puts the greatest and most tragic parts of the human soul in words that you cannot ever recover from  The man was a literary God  and there s a reason readers are still getting orgasmic over his writing  Crime and Punishment is an examination of human nature  addressing themes such as crime and punishment  duh   love and hate  innocence and experience  good and evil  bravery and cowardice  wealth and poverty and social class  There are a lot of themes woven together here and the story takes a long time to tell  That was my only problem with the book  I felt like the beginning was strong and then the middle was longer than it needed to be  before an ending that was just right  The feel of the story is somewhat similar to Catcher in the Rye in that you follow the main character closely as he makes a serious of odd and seemingly unreasonable choices  There are many powerful scenes scattered throughout the book that made me stop and think about philosophy  morality and human nature Deservedly a classic  We all read with our life experiences and world views clouding a clear interpretation of works of fiction   and thus  an unbiased view is impossible   now that disclaimer is out of the way I can continue with my very subjective opinion on this masterpiece  The author is brilliant  and the his work  Moving  thought provoking and incredibly frustrating  It s the kind of book I had to discuss with all of my unwilling friends  I had to hash out what the book was making me think and how frustrated I became with the selfish egotistical main character  But unlike so many novels I ve read  the ending was utterly satisfying and like a breath of fresh air  I almost want to label this book as a work disproving our very barbaric theory of evolution with no God  For without God  Rodya s actions are justified and there is no clear argument against his murdering the pawn broker  although there is one against her sister Beautiful  10 5 stars     Another one of my all time favorites  Lots of philosophy and theology  Lots of characters with confusing names  Lots of poverty and depravity  Lots of redemption and pages that make you cry  I love  love  love the detective and Sonia  Reading this book is a spiritual experience in itself  And it s set in mother Russia     This is one intelligent book It starts out as a crime novel  with the murderer plotting and executing his grand scheme  And then it changes   it isn t really about how the murderer evades the police  although that s part of it  It s about the ideology that led him to commit the crime  the psychology of a criminal struggling with what he did  and how isolation can lead to some very bad things  All the characters are incredibly complex  and even the minor characters are intriguing  But more than anything else  this is a story about redemption You might think there is a problem when you can say that you identify with a fictional Russian murderer  but that is the situation I find myself in  No  I haven t killed anyone and I don t plan to  What I see in Raskolnikov is his schism between his intelligent  ambitious side and his selfless compassion  He is the physical representation of the idea that humans are not all good or all bad  but rather complex creatures that cannot be judged  He may be a murderer  but he gives away his last penny to a poor family he hardly knows  He both loves and hates his family   love for their support and unconditional affection and hatred for the reminder of how he isn t who they think he is  He becomes physically ill with fear and guilt and repents the murder  then turns around and says it isn t a crime in the first place  Sure  it s extreme  but don t we all lie to ourselves sometimes  We never want to admit that what we did is wrong  and even if we do  we come up with a justification for it  We re human  Dostoevsky is able to capture that in all his characters  all of whom are incredibly complex  They are not all realistic  a few are complete extremes   but they all reflect facets of the human consciousness This is one of the best books I have ever read  Not only does it have a lot of value as a reflection of humans and as a story of redemption  it is just a plain good story on it s own  What more can you ask for  Oh  Dostoevsky characters and their gorgeous thirst for suffering   I would have said Russians  not just these characters  but I know even less about actual Russians   This was a hard book to read  making you feel a murderer s desperation right up to the end  Like a mini  and more unpleasant  Brothers Karamazov  it doesn t present a mere argument  but wants you to  waterski across the surface  and the grace and the fierce joy will seep into your bones instead of just your brains  Sounds like it might have gotten into Nietzsche s bones  referencing the dream of the beaten horse  the afterword in my book has this footnote   Not only art  but also life  imitates art  Friedrich Nietzsche  who admired Dostoyevsky immensely  and especially Crime and Punishment  in his last conscious act before he collapsed in a coma in the streets of Turin and into the insanity that lasted the rest of his life  threw his arms around the neck of a horse a cabby was belaboring with the whip  See W  J  Kaufmann  Nietzsche  Cleveland and New York  Meridian Books  1962  p  57  If only it had gotten more into Albert Camus  Do you believe in god YesDo you believe in my god NoBoomI ve read Catcher In The Rye  so every person who tries to do good in this depraved world is demagogic phony BoomI was molested during my childhood  the experience made me cold blooded  not like a vampire but a socio psycho path BoomI love my country BoomGovernments have their vile business to tend to  so they need to shoot down an aircraft with 300 innocent people as if missing airplanes weren t enough   they seem to have some special grudge against Malaysian Airlines Boom So is murder only for phlegmatic philistines  who have lost their ability to empathize with their fellow human beings  Che Guevara was a well read man  who empathized with the poor but he did execute quiet a few people for war crimes  BoomRodya wasn t capricious   callous enough for the task though  He lacked  courage of conviction   he wasn t a bigot which made him question the authenticity of his own theories  One ought be priggish if planning to commit murder so as to be immune from the  pangs of conscience  Are ideas of a better world which subjectively depends on one s prejudices   an excuse enough that gives one the right to kill people  They maybe terrorists for some but freedom fighters for others  depending only upon one s perspective  Are we only searching for an excuse to kill  so as to assuage some deep seated lust for blood  Is our purpose as human beings of benevolence  gratitude   love or is this nature just prompted by conceit  Is it human nature to do bad  while it takes special efforts for one to do good  Is lacking the wits to commit crime  which is nothing but protests against an unjust society  a manifestation of growing submissiveness among people  Does the ability to perceive evil makes me evil as well  Dostoevsky mocked this nihilistic attitude which was proliferating among the newer generations but at the same time he himself agrees with some of their ideas as he concurs to morality but not propriety This book is an exploration into the abyss of human conscience Those who prefer their principles over their happiness  they refuse to be happy outside the conditions they seem to have attached to their happiness  CamusI don t know if I m using this out of context but what Camus means here is that if killing people makes Rodya feel like Napoleon   gives some sort of purpose to his life  He should do it  But he met Sonya who pushed him further to purgatory  on his journey of religious redemption  Personally the ideas of suffering and sin seem ancient to me  though they were exactly what Dostoevsky was aiming at  As Rodya realized his love for Sonya  he found purpose in his existence and a renewed empathy for the world which he had lost in cynicism  His love for Sonya had made him confess in the first place  of which he was unaware at the time and only after seeing her intense suffering which had at first attracted him to her  was he finally able get over his pride I also read parts of A Calendar of Wisdom    a few months ago  This is a collection of quotes chosen by Tolstoy on which he felt one should base their life  He gives the idea that living an ascetic life is the only way one can have a clear conscience  It is definitely easier to succumb to Camus  while ideas of a better world   way of life which came out of spiritual experiences that Tolstoy   Dostoevsky had seem rigid   to some extent even alien  but then its only our choices and their consequence that define the essence of life   This book just grows on you  There s so much in it  it has to be read several times to even begin to appreciate its scope  And I get so much out of each reading  A true classic of literature  I have re read this book leading up to the Winter Solstice almost every year since High School  It is the most realistic description of Major Depressive Disorder in modern literature that I ve encountered  I feel like this is something that I should have read years ago in school  Though I am not sure I would have appreciated it as much then  Looking into the psyche of each of the characters in the story is absolutely amazing  I read this book long ago  still in my teens   left a powerful impact on my mind  I barely remember the details  so I am looking forward to reading it again  Hardly have time to read these days  though  so don t know when I will manage to finish it  But read the foreword describing his life  and believe me I had a lump in my throat  and the only reason I didn t cry was because as a man I am not used to expressing my emotions  Maybe with age  one s empathy and emotionality does increase  The story of a young man who commits an absolutely inane murder  and then spends the rest of his life in piteous agony for it   the story is really very touching  The message is  no matter what you do to escape punishment from authorities  no matter how successful you are in that  your conscience will still extract a full and exact retribution for your sins   I first read this book at 16  which was my first foray into Russian literature and ignited a passion for the genre that sticks with me  In many ways you could say that this book set me on the path that ultimately led to a degree in Russian language and six fantastic months in St  Petersburg  which I still cherish  I tend to come back to this novel every few years and never cease to discover new aspects of the characters and their story  I must say  however  that with each read Svidrigailov becomes more and more enigmatic  although his fever dreams towards the end of the book are some of my favourite passages  Fantastically woven and one of the best examples of Dostoevsky s style This translation is a bit odd  though  from a native English speaker s perspective  No doubt it captures much better the actual rhythm of the Russian  of which I ve only read excerpts  and is more idiomatic  but at times I think the translation in trying to stay authentic to that voice makes the story more difficult to read and comprehend  Translation is always a tricky business  and this is a really interesting exploration of those issues  but ultimately sacrifices fluidity for accuracy   Dostoevsky has never disappointed me  and neither has a translation by Pevear Volokhonsky  This is likely the most popular  or shall we say  widely known  book of Dostoevksy s  and whereas it doesn t strike me down quite as well as his masterpiece The Brothers Karamzov  the conclusion of this novel had me weeping for Raskolinkov  Dostoevsky  and for myself  Although I m not sure if that s going to make immediate sense  Like with all of his stories  the moral and philosophical implications are astounding  Here we have the plight of a character  the young intellectual  torn by the results of reason and the emotional nature of the man  There are no answers here  everything is simply torn apart in opposite directions in a series of unsure moments  This is what makes existentialist literature  the uncertainty of a modern world in which we find the simplicities of black and white  those things that made myth a long time ago  now slowly fading away  aside from in fairy tales  kid s stories  a variety of religious situations etc   suddenly struck down by a torrent of possibilities  Man has  once again  dug himself a deep grave  a certain aspect of Rushdie s  The Satanic Verses  on faith over reason comes to mind        But it s not just that  it s a great novel all by itself  Characters  poetry  artistry and a narrative that can only be of Dostoevsky s pen       It is becoming all too clear to me that anyone that even attempts to knock Fyodor s work should likely be lined up and shot  I realise that books that are often forced upon children in High School are difficult to read with an unbiased eye  and with frauds like  The Great Gatsby  lying around  I can t blame everyone   Yet  I wasn t lucky enough to be given such great literature to read for school  For anyone that has removed this book from their future read list because of its history in schooling  just give it that last chance  It s a slow start that builds up slowly  but that last three hundred pages had been drooling over the edge of a hotel lobby armchair        I read David Magarshack s translation in the mid 1980s in undergraduate studies  required text  But I had an extremely difficult time finishing this novel  Raskolnikov is no  Superman   He is a cowering  deeply disturbed individual  His murderous crimes are heinous  His dreams while asleep are crying out to him like blood from the ground where he had slain his victims  He is pursued by the law  A young woman visits him in prison  his only connection to purest love  After long await   i  Crime and punishment   i  has been finished  I have to say that I m a fan   i  Crime and Punishment   i  is easily one of the best books I ve read in a while  I m glad I was recommended to read this Anyways  the basic plot line is Rodion Raskolnikov is a very attractive  yet poor man  who desperately needs some money  Between nights in Taverns  he gets a letter from his mother saying that his sister is getting married to a government official  and that the entire family will be moving to St  Petersburg  where he is living  making him more desperate for money  He ends up killing an old pawn broker and her sister for some belongings and spare change  The rest is plot summary This was really intriguing to me  not only because it was an interesting book  but because Dostoevsky put his own experience into the story  in a way  His last second recall from a firing line   which makes the book much more real  My favorite part of the book was his nightmare about the Mule  where a drunken crowd beats up and kills a defenseless Mule  It was terrible and it brought a side of Raskolnikov that we didn t see  Genuinely Terrified  The one quote that stuck with me was  blockquote  I used to analyze myself down to the last thread  used to compare myself with others  recalled all the smallest glances  smiles and words of those to whom I d tried to be frank  interpreted everything in a bad light  laughed viciously at my attempts  to be like the rest   and suddenly  in the midst of my laughing  I d give way to sadness  fall into ludicrous despondency and once again start the whole process all over again   in short  I went round and round like a squirrel on a wheel     blockquote This was because it was at a really good part of the book and the quality of the quote at the time it was presented was outstanding  It made me think for a little bit  somI decided it was the perfect quote to put in here Overall   i  Crime and Punishment   i  was a very good read  and I ll enjoy more work from him  I d give the book a 10 10  A wonderful book with amazing psychological depth  As with Leo Tolstoy  you feel that you know all of the characters intimately  so  while you may dislike a specific character  you fully understand why they are the way they are and what motivates their actions  In general I would say this book is best to read when you re younger   there s such a strong feeling of angst and anger throughout the book that I think you really need to be in that mindset to connect with the characters  A great book for highschool students really I would imagine that this book  like many books that have been translated  will vary depending on the translation  therefore finding a good translation is key  Personally  I really liked this edition though  It is striking how much you relate with this main character  And so I began wondering who I was to kill  being in Raskolnikov s situation   there are similarities you know  so a big  thumbs up  for affordable education systems  But then again I know I ain t no Napoleon type of person    I would probably shit myself  and go home  dirty trousers and all    so no worries  landlord Jan     An important thing you ll learn from this book is that revolutionaries don t know their history  Take note of that Have fun with this book  You ll finish it in no time  It is both rational and irrational  funny  exciting and even boring when it has to be  But above all it is a piece so perfectly well written  it makes you stop in awe for a moment everytime you get to a new chapter PS  Is it me or did  Petersburg  seem to be as big as my home town   which is pathetically small  Psat recenzi na ruskou klasiku  je jako psat

even with such high expectations  the book was an amazing read  often disturbing and depressing  It made made me think a lot  These are some of my thoughts 1  Human psychology and life in general  including those incredibly random circumstances  can lead one to such a miserable state that you are prone to commit mistakes or even crimes  Chaos theory  Or simply mental disorder  brain damage  2  Some mistakes can ruin your life  especially because of the shame you feel before your loved ones  For me  this constitutes the punishment  the pain you inflict in your dear ones   Let my life go  if only my dear ones may be happy   This sacrifice for those that are close to you is always present 3  It is delicious the way Dostoyevsky glances through the clash between right and wrong  and the law of man  i e  the law of the powerful  of those that succeed and write their own history  4  The book must have made a big impact when it was released and afterwards  Like many have pointed out  it may have influenced Freud s work in psychology  I can also see a very close link with Frankl s idea that  Men can get used to anything  and that we aim for something bigger than us   he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea  for a hope  even for a fancy    Truman Capote must also have read this book  Read count  1 I went through a heavy Russian phase and this was  obviously  a part of that  What a book  Profoundly philosophical  framing the deepest questions we have about ourselves in fictional format  Kind of a must read  I think  I hated this book in high school and probably only read the cliff notes but 30  yrs later I decided to try again and I am so pleased that I did  Its obvious to me as a teenager I did not understand this book because now I think its really interesting and actually want to dive back in again    if only I had the time and there weren t so many other books I want to read  I enjoyed this book  Perhaps it is a good idea to read this at a time when you are not feeling blue  indeed  it is no feel good book  But it is incredibly well written and I found the development of Raskolnikov s character expert to say the least  If psychology is even the slightest bit interesting to you  read this book  It is immensely fascinating  A compelling classic  a page turner with deep layersSometimes I m intimidated before I start old classics  The novel may not speak as directly as a contemporary work  one say  However  Crime and Punishment doesn t fall at all in this category  It is a page turner like any good best seller  But it also speaks at many different layers  and that s what  I think  makes it a classic  The main character  Raskolnikov  embodies the whole process of guilt in the few months that novel covers  But it s also a representation of much more  He s a person of its time  with all the impact that Napoleon had on the youth during the 19th Century  He also represents the process of the child growing up and falling in love  He symbolizes the  Bon Sauvage  falling in disgrace and learning that real freedom comes mainly from social immersion  This novel is much more than I can probably express  A very recommended read  this french edition is small and good  It has a a moderate number of footnotes that put 19th Century Russia in context  The extras of this edition are also helpful  The original and still the most compelling of the psychological crime dramas  It works on so many different levels from the sociological motives for crime to the reasons for Christian redemption  By now I have read most of Dostoyevsky s grand works  but I had purposely left what is perhaps his most well known for last  since I sometimes have this tendency to leave  what I think can be  the best for last  especially with authors that I m a fan of  I can safely say I have deeply enjoyed reading all of his novels  and that this was no exception  although I would reserve the title of best for  The Brothers Karamazov   However  I can understand why so many people deem this as his best  It is perhaps the perfect balance of a swift  endlessly entertaining plot and a complex psychological study of characters  or of THE character  our deeply tortured Raskolnikov  I ve read some other reviews which complain of its slowness or lack of action  or perhaps that Dostoyevsky s prose meanders too much into the characters s thoughts and states of mind  to them I d recommend to stay away from his other novels then  because they would probably find them even more exasperating in this sense  Once Raskolnikov sets out to do what he so much ponders about in the first pages  I found it very hard to put down  Indeed  I finished the second half of this rather long book in one sitting  so engrossed was I in the authour s description of the character s mind  his sudden changes of mood  his delusion  his absorbing encounters with the detective Porfiry  who somewhat reminded me of  Homicide  s Pempleton  a tv show cop known for his interrogation skills   Razumikhin s faithfulness and abject friendship  Sonya s pure heartedness despite the life she was pushed to live  the utter disgrace of Marmeladov s entire family in fact  ruined by liquor  the mysterious  voluptuous and vile Svidrigailov and his strange good deeds  Katerina Ivanovna clutching at the last remnants of her dignity in despair  Raskolnikov s dream of the beaten horse that still lingers in my mind  and in short  everything I simply cannot recommend this book enough  especially for lovers of psychological studies   This is my most favourite book in the world  Just is  I m not going to discuss it  because someone will come along and argue with me  And I m not going to argue about my favourite book  Intense and gripping right from the start  It almost reads like a mystery novel  not because you don t know whodunnit  but because you don t quite understand why  and this propels you to the end of this marvelous book that tries to portray the psyche of a human being that violates a social and legal boundary  and finds himself lonely and persecuted as he tries to hide his dirty little secret   Be warned  this is full of spoilers My love for slow  philosophical novels has braught me to reading another of the Russian classics  viz  Crime   Punishment  My expectations were high  this being a highly celebrated all time classic and all  but they were met We get to peek in the mind of Raskolnikov  and quite thoroughly I might add  Dostoyevsky could very well have lived these thoughts and crimes himself  so meticulously and passionate are the descriptions of Raskolnikov s contemplations and feverish dreams  The disharmony of his soul jumps off the page and immediately provokes genuine feelings of pity for the murderer  Not in a cheap  enforcing way  but as a natural response to the objective description  Moreover  much is ambiguous and uncertain in the book  For example  one can argue if Raskolnikov s illness has caused him to think and act so extremely  or if it s the other way around  As another example  even the most evil seeming character Svidrigailov seems to have moments of compassion  like when he dreams of taking care of the five year old girl  and how he lets Doenja leave his house after she aimed the gun at him  after which he takes his own life That s something I love about this book  there s no straightforward line to follow from begin to end  neither is it so much about the plot  Everything revolves forming an opinion about the persons and their deeds  challenging you to evaluate your own ethical values as well Something else that really spoke to me is how the typical noble people of society are depicted as fake and pretentious  most obviously through the dispicable person of Loesjin  The most depraved of people on the other hand  are  generally  treated with more respect  They may act cruelly and selfishly often  but at least they are driven to it by poverty and misery and don t polish up their deeds with nice words and customs like the noble do  They  at least  are  real   This  I believe  is one of the reasons why it s not only easy to forgive Raskolnikov for his crime  but frequently even respect him as an ethical individual  that is to see him as a hero  He saves the whores  the drunks and what not  and throws money around to do so like some Robin Hood figure  while loathing  and incidentally killing  the more privileged This book was written in a time where Nietzsche announced what he believed to be the death of God and where Kierkegaard struggled with how to view faith with nihilism trying to lure him to the dark side  and this book fits right in  Raskolnikov  and Svidrigailov even more so  has no faith in God  although he is in conflict about it from time to time  This once again marks him as an interesting  not definitely completely ill or evil person who deserves at least some degree of pity  His essay also closely resembles the distinction Nietzsche made between Ubermensch and the common people  and Kierkegaard s comparison of the massively reproducing plebe and intellectually superior persons in some of his darker passages  1  And what an essay it is  the theory makes  at least some  sense in a strictly rational way and is highly interesting and elaborately put  Yet  there s more to ethics than sheer rationality and theory  and one might consider Raskolnikov mentally ill  narcissism comes to mind  because of his extremity in this regard  Then again  if the reasoning is sound  on what ground can we reject these ideas  One might refer to  the law  or  an ethical common sense   but that brings us back to the core question in Raskolnikov s Godless  fundamentally nihilistic view  if he is one of the superior individuals  those grounds would not be valid for rejection  Who s to say his extreme beliefs and deeds won t indeed lead to a better world as has been the case more often with exceptional people  It s a beautiful discussion Although I think this book is brilliant  there are of course some things I disliked  Most of all  sadly  the ending  The epilogue was mostly redundant as a whole as far as I m concerned  since its high pace was unfitting and its contents relatively unnecessary  but the actual ending is simply bad in my opinion  Luckily this is not a very big deal since in a book such as this the plot is not the main objective  furthermore it s easy to look at the epilogue as an optional appendix  Still  it s worth mentioning and a shame  However  I should also add that the dream about the epidemic of tiny creatures who have a will of their own and infect people with egocentrism  so to speak  adds very nicely to the philosophical main theme of the book Furthermore there have been some silences between people and some gestures and meetings that felt a bit unrealistic  but nothing to complain extensively about To conclude  I would like to give my opinion on Raskolnikov  his crime and punishment  and especially on his theory and its relation to his illness Personally  I think some people are born with a sufficient lack of empathy to be capable of killing  and some of them even are attracted to the extremity of it  Raskolnikov however  does not seem to belong to this group of psychopaths  His suffering  his need for a theoretical basis to finally commit the act as a means to an idealistic end instead of just out of curiosity  seems to point in a different direction  Personally I think his nihilistic view combined with the suffering and the inequality and suffering he has witnessed in his life have moved him  he happens to be a rational and intelligent type of person  to extreme thinking  Here s where it becomes interesting however  Your typical psychopath would probably have committed the crime without having to go through all this  However  many people of Raskolnikov s intellect could arrive at this theory and world view  but would not even come close to actually performing the associated deeds  The fact that Raskolnikov does cross this line tells me his mind is not what one would call normal  Moreover there are the psychosomatic fevers that make plausible that this is indeed the case  So  in my opinion  he is one of those few people who is predisposed to  go mad   instead of being mad to begin with  and circumstance did in fact trigger this behaviour ultimately Once again this makes him a charming victim with whom it is easy to have pity Wonderfully complex and inspiring  indeed a masterpiece  I read this again after a number of decades  I had forgotten a lot of it  what I remembered the most were the cat and mouse interactions between detective Petrovich and Raskolnikov What struck me on this second read was the way in which so much is viewed from the point of view of Raskolnikov  We are often inside his head  privy to his thoughts This interior view was often tension provoking  in tune with Raskolnikov s building anxiety I had wondered a couple of times  while reading  about any relationship between Dostoevsky and Poe  After I finished  I found this in Wikipedia   Fyodor Dostoevsky called Poe  an enormously talented writer  and favorably reviewed Poe s detective stories  The character Porfiry Petrovich in Dostoevsky s novel  Crime and Punishment  was influenced by Dupin    Dupin being Poe s detective  Adiga s  White Tiger  also came to mind as I read  although that story had a different outcome  Nonetheless  it has been called  the Indian Crime and Punishment  I also thought about Dostoevsky and Dickens  those eighteenth century novelists  In fact  Dostoevsky apparently interviewed Dickens  in London  in 1862  One interesting point of similarity between them is the original twelve month serialized publication schedule of  Crime and Punishment   which compares with the frequent publication of Dickens  novels in serial form I kept a character list at hand  as I had for Tolstoy s  Anna Karenina    I also had access to an excellent map of Saint Petersburg of the time  with references to places important in  Crime and Punishment   Both of these aids helped a lot while reading the book  I LOVED this book  Being inside the mind of a killer  who has enough of a conscience to wonder if he should turn himself in  is really fascinating  Now and then  you actually find yourself rooting for him in a way  It s crazy  lrwy  lwqt lly qrth bh kn Dyq  wlnfsy  knt llsfl  knt mqrh l w tzdd lnfsy  sw  lkn lrwy  mn   Zm mqrt  ftHt ly lbb  l  dwstwysfky  Hmd llh ny shry Glb  mlh  ltSwr lnfsy blrwy   lHbk  byn lshkhSyt  lHy  lm yshy  wltfSyl mfj    Not to be taken in a sarcastic or ironic tone  But this book can be accurately summarized by its title if only read in the perspective of someone who has finished it  Very far from an easy read  but worth the effort  Whether you enjoy reading or not the message that can be found among these pages is brilliant  Reading between the lines wouldn t hurt either  There is much to find in the human mind  Yet its vastness makes it hard for anyone to locate their answers  We make rash decisions without further thinking of the consequences  We are our own worst enemies  and you punish yourself internally for the crimes that betray you externally  Exceptional  extraordinary  exemplary  In Poland  every high school student has to read this book  And I have to say it s no mistake  I still can t believe that I spent two days doing nothing but reading it  I love it because of the psychological side to it  It s kind of funny how Raskolnikov kills two women  but his thoughts  his insane thoughts  are pretty much the thoughts of every person  For some people the fact that the crime is commited in the beginning of the book is Dostoyevsky s mistake  But for me  the things that happened after the crime were the most interesting  The only thing I didn t enjoy was the ending   it ruined exactly everything  But still  my rating is 5 stars because after reading the book  it s not the ending I remember   it s the story  There is no way for me to give this book anything but 5 stars  There were things i disliked about it  but regardless it is a pretty impressive read Let me give some of the things i liked about it it plays on some of the same themes as my favorite book   Les Miserables   In fact  it seems to me that this is actually just the Russian version of that story  If you take the fact that both crimes were committed because of a society blind to the needs of its people  an upper class that ignores the pleas of the lower class  and a justice system that is blind to all but the letter of the law  then these books share many parallels and similarities  i love stories about redemption in any form One quote i LOVED toward the end    Vague and aimless anxiety in the present  and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing that was all that lay before him   This quote could have come from so many great works of literature  Les Miserables  Death of a Salesman  Grapes of Wrath  There were a few doozies like this  I loved the idea that pervaded in the end  similar to Grapes of Wrath  that in the end the only thing that can save us is love and finding meaning in life  The author offered some interesting discussions at the end about the difference between the existential and faith based interpretations of this book  I really enjoyed those  though they were very brief The chapter just before during  and after the murder is some of the most white knuckled prose i ve ever read  The tension was so great that i had to put the book down a few times and catch my breath  i found myself saying  DON T DO IT MAN   a few times while reading     amazing stuff Some of the things i didn t enjoy The names are so confusing as to be totally distracting  Each character has 2 or 3 names they go by  The author switches between those names freely  and no explanation is given  I spoke to my sister in law about this  she was a missionary in Russia  and she confirmed that these are basically nicknames  However  not knowing this little Russian tidbit i was VERY confused for a good portion of the beginning  I don t know if it s just this translation that i read  but as some of the characters talked they inserted  he he he  a lot  as to imply  i assume  that they were being facetious or condescending or something because they were giggling as they talk  However  it was in there so much that it sounded bizarre in my inner dialogue and a few of the characters seemed to me like the Joker from Batman was talking  I know it sounds like a weird complaint  but it was real the story starts out quickly  then meanders a bit in the middle with all the  these dudes want to marry my sister   stuff  after the tense first chapters it made me slow down and almost stop reading  i m glad  though  that i stuck it out In the end  i m glad i read this book  i am sure that some of its meaning will become more clear to me as i search through what i read over the years  i look forward to reading  the Brothers Karamazov   but i hope i can keep the names straight  Ce roman a bouleverse mes idees  a tout change dans ma maniere de penser  Il est ce genre de livres dont je vais parler longtemps et sans cesse  Je vais rien dire maintenant a son propos  je veux encore laisser mes penses penetrer les evenements et les personnages que je vais Jamais jamais jamais oublier    Dostoyevsky had impressed me immensely in  The Idiot   His style of story telling was utterly grasping  even though he frequently digressed from the topic at hand to discuss unrelated philosophies which might have been more applicable in the Russian society of his times but were still interesting enough to stir the contemporary reader into thought  So it was with high hopes that I picked up this book   hailed as the greatest of Dostoyevsky s novels The inception of the story was in a time when the Russians were facing a society divided between the thought schools of socialism and nihilism  On one hand was the idea of a society that was communal  where every one would live for the society as a whole  working for the benefit of every comrade  On the other hand were the nihilists who defied all authority and believed in their own right to make their life better by any necessary means  Dostoyevsky is supposedly inspired into the concept by the happenings around him when certain members of the intelligentsia abused their power to reason The book begins with an immediate focus on the protagonist and the narration sticks to him throughout without any change in the vantage point  The book relays the emotional tumult that the protagonist goes through in his views regarding what a crime is and who the concept of crime applies to  The emotional uncertainty and the nagging moral conscience are real enough to relate to on a much lower level  The various characters throwing light on how a human brain works and why it reasons as it does  The visions of grandeur that one is better than the crowd around him  The craving to prove himself in some way  The hesitation of  the first step  and the belief in a justification beyond  All these are very clearly expressed in either the discussions among the characters or the subauditions of the protagonist  Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov finally gives in to the physical strain that the mental harassment puts him under  But his final salvation comes from Sofya  a religious girl forced into prostitution because of poverty  Utterly symbolic of the corruption that has crept into the thoughts of the educated middle classes of every society where the rightfulness of a person is judged by his profession and social status The plot was gripping beyond comparison  There were times towards the middle and the end of the story when I simply could not help turning page after page  pushing back my sleep till after another chapter  then yet another chapter  The character building was nothing short of brilliant  The unnecessary details left out  The story ran as smoothly as conceivable Crime And Punishment exceeded it s reputation  An excellent read to say the least  Dostoyevsky impressed again and I will surely pick up another work of his before long  One of my favorite books  All the characters feel real and are memorable  especially Raskolnikov as he is an example of a troubled and conflicted character done right  Dostoevsky is a master of combining prose with philosophy  The book is just great and shows why Dostoevsky is considered the founder of modern existentialism  I love this book because the story is amazing  The reader feels atracted by the difficult story of Raskolnikov  that sometimes you feel a deep shame and sadness for this killer  Also  we analyse the psycology of the human being  and finally we understand what a big is the punishment of our own consciousness  the repentance   This has been my favorite book since I read it my Senior year of high school and it s really the book that got me into reading  I honestly think the brilliance of Dostoevsky s character analysis is unmatched by any author since  The depth to which he was able to develop and understand his characters is unbelievable Part of the reason I love this book is that it causes the reader to relate to characters who are repulsive when you take a step back  but Dostoevsky does such a brilliant job of keeping the reader engaged that you never get a moment and step back and realize what you re relating to  Before long  you understand and relate to Raskolnikov s casuistry  Perhaps the greatest feat of this novel is that Dostoevsky emphasizes that Raskolnikov is not in his proper state of mind and is sick throughout the whole story  Simply to develop such a deep character is merit for greatness  but then to understand him well enough to narrate his actions in sickness  That is incredible I could write for ages about this book  It really will change the way you think if you let it  The intense psychological pressure from Raskolnikov Main Character  is something I can empathize  I feel like I m Raskolnikov  I projected myself as him  His hysteric symptoms  hypochondrias  thought processes  suffering and disgust  Identification really played a big part here  To emphatize a murderer  and to find yourself to having that kind of capacity to do the same  At some very clear point  our minds meet  And I am not surprised  Every single time I watch the News from the Television and read from the newspapers  I feel the same way Raskolnikov felt for the pawnbroker  Pure  very reasonable disgust  To exterminate all the corrupt politicians and criminals or any of that sort   one must shed blood  Skulls are thick  Words don t work  The violence is necessary  One life in exchange for millions  Would that hurt the world that much  Though violence was necessary  what kind of peace would transpire from it Click here to read a faint literary attempt to save the worldRaskolnikov thinks that Napoleon was the greatest superman  He believes that Napoleon wouldn t have had a problem committing murder and that he would not be feeling any guilt at all over the matter  being able to accomplish goals for his principle and for the benefit of others  To commit crime by principle The antihero  Raskolnikov  driven by that ideal suffered from tremendous symptoms  Even my stomach reacted when I was reading this book  If you would just step into his shoes  you ll somehow experience that mind melting psychological tension The book shows how dangerous it is to think of yourself as an Overman as Nietzsche coined it  or an Extraordinary man as Sir Fyodor coined it  more or less  they re the same  Those who where born extraordinary carry the burden of the awareness of such principle In the end  would he submit himself with dignity and taking complete responsibility for whatever he had done Conscience  to submit to it  is a divine attribute of the strong  And to surrender  sometimes  is the bravest thing a human being can ever do Another thing  the way Dostoyevsky used Dreams in all his writings especially in this book  gave me goosebumps  The dream distortion was vividly displayed for understanding  The mechanisms of wish fulfillment and symbolism were really showed in each of his character s dreams  Freud must have been really influenced much by Sir Fyodor  Freud even stated that the book The Karamazov Brothers Dostovevky s last novel  contained all Psychology and that it was the Most Magnificent Novel Ever Written   I am now wondering why Sir Fyodor s books were not discussed in our Psychology Classes  I haven t even heard of his name  Seriously  how come Dostoyesky s writings primarily deal deeply with the darkest corners of human nature  What lurks beneath our skulls  is it of infinite depth  Can human nature alone  possibly reach that extent of doing such things or was there a God given impetus or something from a Higher source  I love this booK                          This guy has such a great sense of humor and he s so crazy    I can t get enough   Un des romans qui m a le plus marque  When I first saw that it was well over 500 pages  I was a little nervous  But jesus  I almost feel like it wasn t enough for such an amazing  well woven  brilliant story And to think about the times he published in  Dostoevsky was crazzzyyy  Be sure to read to the very end     Yes  yes  yes on all the social psychology of the times stuff  But I m further convinced that Dostoevsky was the first real existentialist  I d only read The Brothers Karamazov and Notes from the Underground previously   I also would say that  given Russia s peculiar position in both  East  and  West   it really makes sense how a brilliant writer like Dostoevsky can explicate modernist themes so effectively  but without the Romantic drivel or social realism of some of his European contemporaries   Bizim de edebiyyatdan chox xoshumuz gelir  menim de  arvadimin da  arvadimin lap hedsiz

have to re read every few years  Dostoevsky is verbose  and I love it  I learned that there are women in the world who are so isolated from the world that they resort to screaming  It breaks my heart  It amazes me how he  and writers of his era in particular  were able to create such complex  interweaving threads with just the use of pen and paper  No wonder so many of them were such recluses   My first book from this author  Nice book  Really interesting It was so exciting seeing how the main character turns into a   dead   one  It s a psychological book  Someone told me you have to struggle to read classic books like this one because they are boring but I never thought so while I was reading it  It wasn t boring  It kept you alive while he killed the two ladies and how he gets crazy You ll always pay for your sins and maybe in two lives  not just in one  Dostojevskis ir cilveka dveseles pazinejs eksperts  Turklat gramata uzdotais jautajums  Vai ir tada cilveka grupa  talantigie

transgress moral laws in order to achieve greatness  commits two murders  One he has planned out  the other occurs when he is discovered in the act  The novel takes the reader through Raskolnikov s various mental stages as he comes to realize his mistake  After the murders  he immediately becomes sick  both a mental and physical illness  He struggles with the idea that if he was a special individual  then he should feel no remorse for killing the two women  Yet  he does  thus making him one of the commoners and thus making him a sinner  The novel gains complexity when Raskolnikov meets and falls in love with Sonya  a young  religious prostitute  One of the most touching scenes in the novel is when Raskolnikov asks Sonya to read the story of the raising of Lazarus to him  Raskolnikov wishes to be reborn  to return from the land of the morally dead  One of the great images of the novel comes from Hugo  Raskolnikov remembers a book he read in which a man would rather stand on a small ledge for thousands of years and live rather than die   To live  to live    At the end of the novel  he has two choices  as Svidraigalov puts it   to either kill himself or turn himself in  Svidraigalov kills himself  because he cannot deal with the actions he has committed  which include the supposed murders of his wife and servant  Raskolnikov  at the end of the novel  turns himself in  In the Epilogue  we find Raskolnikov in a hard labor camp in Siberia  while he has had trouble dealing with his punishment  the last image the reader gets is him realizing his love for Sonya and kneeling at her feet   I first read this in college and re read it last year  I remember it as a quick and psychologically interesting read  It was interesting this time around  but it was also painful  like a gruesome car wreck that you do not want to look at  Good  but I don t think I will re read it again for awhile  I m not sure which edition of this book I read  but I had to read it for ap english in high school  like everyone else   The day I got it  I read the first chapter  my assignment  and then all the rest  I never put it down  And then I read it all again as the chapters were assigned  I love this book  I reread this in the new translation  and in conjunction with the corresponding part of the Joseph Frank Dostoevsky biopic  It was the only major Dostoevsky that I hadn t read since high school  Robert Louis Stevenson said that reading it is like enduring an illness  and I think that s a pretty apt metaphor for what makes this book so powerful and important  He does such a masterful job of putting you inside Raskolnikov s tormented head that you end up enduring a goodly portion of his anguish and redemption in your own right  It s not necessarily always pleasant  but it s compelling nonetheless  This was a fabulous book  I cannot believe I waiting so long to read it  Very well developed characters   I feel like they are friends I will miss  Dealt with social issues still relevant in today s world  but much different that the British literature  It was a nice change  I was very pleasantly surprised  Now for War   Peace  Sigmund Freud said  Dostoevsky cannot be understood without psychoanalysis   he illustrates it himself in every character and every sentence   Freud regarded Dostoevsky as one of the greatest literary psycologists in history  second only to Shakespeare  As a psychoanalyst  Freud attempted to unearth and identify the myriad of submerged voices and desires in the unconscience of his patients  Crime and Punishment mirrors this process by probing the multiple and often contradictory motivations in the mind of the lead character  Raskolnikov   I read half of two different translations in Spanish of this book  the first book I received as a present had about 200 pages missing  so I went and get another edition to keep reading   and the translation makes a difference  Haunting exploration of the mind of a criminal quite sure of his intellectual capability  Raskolnikov is a very complex character  capable of showing kindness to a poor family  while plotting a murder in cold blood  just because the world deserves him  Wonderful book  today i was talking to my work colleague  she s like early 50 s and extremely russian and i think a bit of a drunk  anyway we talked books and i was like  I   i m jealous you re able to read things like dostoyevsky and watch tarkovsky films in the original language  it s total bullshit   she did this nice giggle and smile thing she does and started talking about accidentally changing the settings on her new laptop because she was blotto and doesn t understand app permissions security so she will probably bring it in for me to look over in my lunch break  that s cool by me we re kind of not busy at the moment  i am reading berserk manga in my lunch breaks but hey i do that all the time anyway  anyway this is a good book  first boring 400 pages are more than balanced by the amazing last 200 pages  probs the finest expression of existential writin  around  i like to think of myself secretly as a razumikhin but i may actually be svidrigailov  wanna make out with dunya  ciao One of my all time favorite books  This book is so well written  you feel what the characters are feeling  I went from being fearful to drained to broken and back again  Powerful story  Always will be a top favorite   UPDATE  I m done  I m in withdrawal from gross  dingy 1860s St  Petersburg  Russia  This becomes one of my favorite books of all time  People never change  Some of the observations FD makes about annoying dickheads and whiney women are spot on  There are some scenes from this that are gonna stay with me forever  A couple Svidagailoff ones  Mean Pyotr Petrovich  That damn dream about the horse  I can t get over how many balls Dostoyevsky gets into play at the beginning and how he deftly keeps them all juggling around  some in the foreground  some in the back  Then he drops them at the perfect  craziest times  A stranger on a street  A knock on a door  The story takes place over a pretty short amount of time so it s easy to follow  It s also MUCH easier to read than Moby Dick if you re looking to take on a 3 inch tall piece of classic lit AND GET THIS        For those that don t already know  I am obsessed  OBSESSED with the TV show Columbo  It s in my top 5 of all time  So imagine my surprise when a certain detective enters into the narrative  Seth and I BOTH came to the same realization on our own  This dude is Peter Falk  Soooooooo once I finish C P I am farting around on Wikipedia and wouldya looky there  Down at the bottom of the page it says how the creator of Columbo  William Link  based Columbo on the detective      Ha ha ha  HA HA HA  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Spoiler The epilogue is kinda bizarre  If it didn t exist I wonder if I woulda liked the book even better  It s almost a little anticlimactic  We find out Raskolnikov s punishment and it doesn t seem too bad  Though I suppose that s the point   that the internal struggle is far worse than anything doled out in Siberia  Right before the epilogue I was pleading  PLEADING   Please don t confess       So busted out in tears at the end of the last chapter  Gotta hand it to FD for making me have so much sympathy for a dude that hacks people in half with an axe 2 3rds of the way done  It just keeps getting better and blacker and Russian er  Remember Dr  CHilton  Hannibal Lecter s old friend he ll be having for dinner at the end   Well  that dude is narrating this audiobook and it is such a blast listening  He does all different voices  not in an annoying way   I especially love the old lady pawnbroker voice  And Marmolotov   Her stockings  Her STOCKINGS I have sold for drink  I recommend to EVERYONE  I am so entertained  And so disturbed  There s a dream sequence fairly early on that is the single most horrifying passage I have ever experienced  Ever  Might have been some tears involved  It ruined that entire day  But it s worth it Doo it  If you start now you might catch up to me if you are a speed reader  St  Petersburg beckons  Crime and Punishment is a pulsating thriller  It is incredibly entertaining  extremely fast paced and a pleasure to read  I ve probably never shared as much anguish at the plight of a character as I had with the protagonist  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  probably the best name I ve encountered in literature   Would you kill someone if given a chance albeit that someone be a vile and evil person  I get all the greater good argument but can we really take someone s life  Can a good person get away with committing a vile act  especially from his own conscience  Dealing partly with these questions  Dostoyevsky does a wonderful job in showing us the psyche of a murderer  He describes Raskolnikov s turmoil exhaustively giving us an exact view of his tormented mind  He eliminates the  who did it  part of a murder thriller but the  why did he do it  and  will he get caught  part of the plot keep the reader intrigued  In my opinion  Dostoyevsky s greatness lies in the bond he establishes between the reader and his characters  I know I should probably be repulsed by Raskolnikov because of his appalling and disgusting crime  Yet  I can t  I actually like him and care for him dearly  I want him to escape from the clutches of the law  be free from any punishment  I want his suffering to end even at the expense of morality There are so many places where the novel kicks up a gear and inches towards perfection  I particularly loved the build up to the murder which had so many close calls as the protagonist makes a lot of impromptu decisions  showing his lack of preparation  The exchanges between Rodion and the police detective  Porfiry Petrovich  another alliteration  keep the reader on the edge of his seat as the detective tries to get a confession from the protagonist This is probably the most captivating classic I ve ever read  Dostoevsky s ability to portray humanity so realistically is a testament to his genius  I am in awe and just can t wait to read his other books  Dark and depressing  however beautiful   In my opinion  Dostoyevsky is unsurpassed master of the written word His entire work fascinates me  Crime and Punishment  is realistic  psychological novel with social  philosophical and crime elements  This is a novel about a single human character  Facing the social reality  in the poor area of St  Petersburg  but also individual psychic reality of a poor student and his struggle to survive in desperate circumstances The theme and the idea of the novel are contained in the title  the double murder that Raskoljnikov performs and the following punishment  more psychological than physical   That physical punishment contains the idea   the man is punishing and torturing himself more than society can does  There is no excuse for a murder committed  because every life is worth  For me  it is a masterpiece  I love psychological novels and this one was perfect Although the book focuses on the crime  you cannot say there is nothing more  There is love  there is politics  there is the city I highly recommend it  I finally finished Crime and Punishment  I should have read it in high school  but I think the reason I didn t was because that edition s translation wasn t very good  It was just too dry  Reading this edition went very smoothly  It held my interest to the end  Months go by between the crime and the legal punishment  but in those months you see that the legal punishment was no match for Raskolnikov s personal punishment  He suffered physically and mentally until you wish he would just give himself up  You feel his pain  I recommend this book to everyone who failed to read it in high school  I read this at a time in my life when I was somewhat disillusioned and had begun to question many things I had been taught  Indeed I was unsure how I felt about a lot of things  This book hit me particularly hard and made we sit back and examine myself as objectively as possible  It also opened a door into self growth and maturity  Crime and Punishment is much more  it is worldview  Give yourself the opportunity to check your reality and belief systems without paying a fortune to a Psychiatrist or exposing yourself to the criticism of some other stranger  The only stranger that may get involved is you   the you that resides just out of your conscious thought  Don t be afraid to examine your views  and please add this classic to your must read list   Come into the mind of a man down troughten by poverty  in the rich Crime and Punishment  The strange views of a murderer and the life that he lives while in the guilt of his conscience It took me a while to read this novel  however  when I was finished I grew to love it even more  This and The Wind Up Bird Chronicle are the only two books that have given me nightmares  That s probably the most unique thing I can add to what s already been said about Crime and Punishment  right  I spent mealtimes at the dining center during my first semester of college devouring a crumbling paperback edition of this book that I d picked up near campus in a musty San Francisco esque used book shop  I drank in Raskolnikov s delirium every evening over greasy grilled cheese  and incidentally  missed most of the pre party socializing that would happen during communal meals  Well worth it  Although the extra 10 pounds weren t    The Russians were born storytellers so the audible versions of Russian classics are totally compelling  I ve always wanted to read C   P but to have it read to me by a most talented actor was sublime  Next Up  Anna Karenina  I m an aritst   love working while I m listening    Geek alert  I read this on my own time for fun as a graduate student in order to understand the Russian Philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin s book  Problems of Dostoevsky s Poetics   I didn t expect to like it as much as I did  This book is one of the best in the Russian tradition  Dostoyevsky is a master and understands the depths of the human psyche  A gripping story and perhaps one of the most memorable protagonists in literature  Cuando empece a leerlo cada hoja se me hacia eterna pero es un libro que poco a poco te iba atrapando  Si bien se me hizo pesado  tengo que decir que cada minuto de mi vida que ocupe en leerlo no fue perdido sino que gane mucho porque es magnifico y profundo  Rodion Raskolnikov  como protagonista  es un personaje que por momentos odie y por otros ame  el camino de redencion de el para mi es bastante contradictorio y puede abarcar muchisimos puntos de vista  o por lo menos asi lo veo yo  Crimen y Castigo realmente es una historia que muestra no solo el asesinato que cometio Raskolnikov sino los distintos  crimenes  que cada uno de los personajes a cometido  ya sea Sonia  ya sea Svidrigailov  y como cada uno de ellos tendra su castigo  El sufrimiento presente en todo momento es como el hilo que ata entre si a los personajes pero sobretodo el reconocimiento mutuo del sufrimiento se ve en la relacion entre Sonia y Raskolnikov  A este panorama oscuro se le suma la descripcion de una San Petersburgo oscura y desalentadora Sonia es un personaje tan puro de alma que sera una de las piezas claves para la redencion de Rodion Igualmente de importantes son Dunia y su madre que reciben todas las hostilidades que Rodion expresa por su nervios y estado constante de alteracion  El dilema etico y religioso de Raskolnikov esta lleno de idas y vueltas en su pensamiento  ya que  a pesar de que al principio de la historia dice que es por el bien de la sociedad que realizara el asesinato  su enfermedad y estado febril son formas en las que su sentimiento de culpa sale a flote y en las que parece que se entrevieran deseos de entregarse a la policia todo el tiempo pero no por tranquilidad sino como una forma en la que el protagonista busca limpiar su alma  Con respecto a los otros personajes  debo decir que Razumikin  el amigo de Raskolnikov  es mi favorito  porque en todo momento muestra su amor incondicional por el y una pura amistad presente en todo momento Aunque hay muchisimo que decir con respecto a este libro  sobre la religion  la relacion con Dios  por ejemplo  espero poder explicar la magnifica obra y que vale la pena leer  valio la pena el sacrificio de cada parte con paginas interminables y llenas de nombres impronunciables Parte del final me sorprendio porque esperaba que algunas cosas no fueran asi  Todos los personajes finalmente llegan a tener su  castigo  y es una muestra de que es inevitable que paguemos por los distintos  crimenes  o mas bien dicho pecados o errores que las humanos cometemos en la vida  Crime and punishment is an epic to itself  The characters move in such a fluid and languid fashion  never becoming patronising  forever staying real  A masterpiece  which deserves a place on the front book shelf  OMG OMG THIS BOOK OMG I LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR LONG ASS NAMES SO MUCH IT BORDERS ON OBSESSION  Raskolnikov  that little bitch ahah  D Razumikhin  best friend ever   Oh and Svidrigailov   And his spiders     3 Dunya kicked ass and Sonya was adorable  3 Great stuff    But that is the beginning of a new story  the story of the gradual renewal of a man  the story of his gradual regeneration  of his passing from one world into another  of his initiation into a new unknown life  That might be the subject of a new story  but our present story is ended  I actually LOVED this ending  how there is hope and a new life Dostoevsky is brilliant in taking an idea and discussing it all through the novel  I love his ways and conversations   This was a really good book  His characters were great to watch and the ideas throughout the book were incredible  There is a struggle with guilt  human strength  and will inside the main character that was very true to life  His crime haunted him throughout no matter how justified he thought he was  A worthwhile read  Una novela tremenda  intensa  impresionante  En un contexto de frio  las miserias materiales y espirituales se exponen constantemente en torno al viaje entre la razon y la locura de su protagonista luego de haber cometido un asesinato En un relato excelente pero extrano a la vez  su lectura angustia profundamente  pero es muy dificil es muy dificil abandonarlo una vez iniciado  This is a tentative five because there were some parts that I quite frankly wanted to rip out of the book  If I have to read another monologue  so help me    But the characters and the intensity of the emotion alone got this a five  Well done  Dostoevsky   Ikinci defada bile yine hayran ediyor  Bir suclunun psikolojisini cok akici aktariyor  Bir de hicbir karakteri siyah veya beyaz degil  Neredeyse her karakter gri  Iyi karakterli ama suclu iki insani da en sonda kavusmasi guzel  There are plenty of reveiws of this book out there  so I m not going to really give one  I ll just say that I loved this book  I thought it was going to be a dry  difficult read  but I didn t find it so at all I suggest you read the names aloud just so you get used to them Favorite character  MarmeladovMost memorable scenes   I won t give anything away 1  Dancing children  screaming wife2  The act 3  The minute that Razumahin remembered for the rest of his life 4  The stolen roubles Wow  Without a doubt  one of the most important works of the 19th century  with themes that are still crucially relevant today  A strong exploration of derivations of order and morality and the fallout that occurs when one chooses to be the locus of both  Dostoevsky  I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship  I will not post a review  I do not want to influence anyone by repeating how OBVIOUSLY FREAKING FANTASTIC OF A MIND INCEPTION this book really is So I ll just tell you this All low reviews come from people who could not muster the will to finish the book  Don t be one one of them      High expectations have been exceeded  It was the best read of 2013 I couldn t hold my tears  I have read a fair number of novels with a wide variety of characters and without fail  whether the character is anywhere from a young British girl to a tribal African chief  to a time travelling alien  I managed to find a way to identify with the main character at a certain level  Hero or anti hero  I always seem to meld my own identity with our hero to empathize with them What s unique about this book is that never for a moment could I empathize with Rodion Raskolnikov  I didn t like him from the beginning  When he committed his crimes  I liked him less and all the way through as he pronounced his judgements on the people around him  I liked him less and less  Whether he was right or wrong in his judgements  he never  to me  had the right to judge others  his own state being so deplorable The novel itself was surprisingly modern  I looked up twice when it was written  both times not believing it  One character was talking about behavioral psychology  while another was talking about getting fat in his office job and thinking about joining a gym  A gym  in the 19th century  So  the nature of crime  Crime is bad  People who commit crimes must feel bad  People who commit crimes must be punished for said crimes  There is no    acceptable way to commit a crime  except perhaps to protest an unjust law  a topic not covered in this book  The rest is again and interesting period piece that takes you back to 19th century Russia and makes you a resident    it s time travel at its best  Very enjoyable from cover to cover  except for that damned Rodion Raskolnikov  I reread this during a recent trip to St  Petersburg  Sometimes classics that I ve read long ago disappoint   not this  Though it was written back at the time of the U S  civil war  it feels psychologically very contemporary  Dostoyevsky s portrait of Raskolnikov remains intense and chilling  I was fortunate enough to see the house that is supposedly the scene of the crime in St  Petersburg and  even these so many years later  I think that the book evokes the atmosphere of the city and neighborhood  I only wonder what it was like at the actual time of writing    jbny fyh dwr

qb   I m currently reading this book during breaks I have in between classes  It s a great book  but at first I absolutely hated it  I couldn t see where the author was going with something that seemed pointless at the time  Right around the time of the murder though  that s when this book became much better  yes  he murders the lady  it says so right on the back  no spoilers there   It s been interesting to watch the psyschological break down of Raskolnikov I may change this review slightly after I finish the book No pense que iba a amar tanto este libro  Dostoievski con demasiada razon eres el padre de la novela psicologica  la volveria a leer una y mil veces mas  Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky is a classic Russian novel I decided to cross off my  should have read in high school  list  It is  by today s standards  wordy  but I expect wordiness in nineteenth century literature and I enjoy getting into characters with detail and depth  Crime and Punishment is primarily the story of a young student named Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  who kills an old pawnbroker and her sister for a variety of reasons  He is quite poor and becomes desperate when he learns that his sister  Avdotya Romanovna  is engaged to marry a wealthy man  Raskolnikov believes his sister is marrying someone unworthy of her for money and plans to help her family  including him  through their difficult financial situation  He thinks of the murder as an act that will rid the world of an unethical individual  but I saw this more as a rationalization than a reason for the crime  All this happens early in the story  The book is  for the most part  the story of his psychological reaction to his crime  Although the book centers on the murder of the pawnbroker  it is not the only moral issue covered  The novel includes the story of a drunk  Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov  who dies  leaving his family in a desperate situation    Semyon s daughter  Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova   who turns to prostitution to help support her family    and Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin  Avdotya s former fiance who attempts to frame Sofia Marmeladova for a theft she hadn t committed  All these stories show events that present moral conflicts  even if the actions were not technically illegal in nineteenth century Russia  And there is also  Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov  a wealthy  former employer of Avdotya who apparently murdered his wife  Marfa Petrovna Svidrigailova  So the plot covers more than one crime and more than one punishment  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys classics and likes to read psychological studies of human behavior  As with Tolstoy s work  the names can be a little confusing  There are a number of internet sites including Wikipedia that can help keep the characters straight Steve Lindahl   Author of Motherless Soul  If u want to know a person thoroughly  you must go slowly and carefully  so as to avoid mistakes and prejudices which are always difficult to correct or eradicate afterwards  Rodion Romanovich Rosalnikov  a character that baffled and moved me to the extreme didn t want to get stuck in mediocrity  He was perturbed and furious because of various reasons  He was famished  people around him were idiots and poverty stricken and who live and die without leaving any mark  had to discontinue his education  his family s selfless sacrifice for his well being  All these disturbing reflections stirred the monstrous thoughts in him  He believed ordinary people and extra ordinary people have one thing uncommon  Extra ordinary people  dare  to do new things  He too wanted to  dare  and put an end to all his misery  I deduce that all of them not only great one s but also those who diverge ever so slightly from the beaten track those that is who are just barely capable of saying something new must by their nature  inevitably be criminals in a greater or less degree naturally  Rosalnikov  Rosalnikov was not a revolutionary  but he wanted to prove himself he was not a beaten man  He wanted to prove himself he was not one among the  ordinary    It is like murdering the vile old woman to test himself without any premeditated exactness about robbing or killing He had his own views to explain his deed  Paragraphs from the novel that struck me the most on his motives and views   I believe  by law of nature  people are divided into two categories   into a lower  of ordinary people   that is  Into material serving only for reproduction of its own kind and into people properly speaking that is  those who have the gift or talent of saying or doing something new in their sphere  Rosalnikov  A kind of theory the same sort of thing which makes me for example consider that a single piece of wrong doing is allowable  if the chief aim is good  One single evil and a hundred good deeds   Power is given only to man who dares stoop and take it There is only one thing needed  Dare    Rosalnikov  It is disastrous to have a broad mind without special genius   Napoleon had a terrible fascination for him or rather  what particularly attracted him was the fact that so many men of genius had not heeded the isolated misdeed but marched straight over it without reflection  Arkady Svidrigaylov to Avadotya Ranovna Indeed it was a beautiful stifling and nerve  wrenching experience to know the pain and mental torture a murderer might experience  I have even thought if the very author himself have murdered someone to etch out the minute of details regarding the psychological aspects  The delirious talks  incoherent dreams  nightmares  path less errands  social inertness  fear of being conspicuous   all these minutest if details had been beautifully crafted in this poignant tale of a person trying to rise above the suppression Crime and Punishment also explains us the suffering of the downtrodden people of Czarist Russia  It tells the story of a time where people are considered lucky to have a bread crumb every 3 or 4 days  It tells the story of people with shattered dreams and life  On the whole  it is a story that takes you to 19th century Russia with horse cabs  congested rickety houses and buildings  people with tattered clothes  teen girls in flesh market and not at school  hungry children and mothers begging in the streets  How lucky are we  We become sad of even most trivial of things  This is real life people  All the characters were unique and exceptional  They all will be etched into my heart  I was moved beyond senses  A true masterpiece  Dostoevesky is a indeed a doyen in literature    Go at once  this instant  stand at the cross roads first bow down and kiss the earth you have desecrated then bow to the whole world  to the four corners of the earth  and say aloud to the whole world    I am a murderer     Sofya Semenovna to Rosalnilov 5 stars on 5   gautam There are great books and Crime and Punishment  this book was so intense that you could feel the delirium of the character the literary snob in me felt a real sense of achievement in reading this book  i set it myself as a bit of a challenge while i was living in japan and felt my brain turning to mush  once i d stopped tripping over the russian names  i became absorbed in the story  i do like a good old tale of morals and crossing the line  Brilliant  I still prefer Constance Garnet s translations  she has the tone of the time  I felt very clever because when Columbo came out  I caught the resemblance to C D s detective  later  Peter Falk talked about this   Harrowing and yet oddly fun at the same time Ellie NYC O personagem principal  apesar de professor de linguas  e um homem extremamente pobre e que vive angustiado pela sombra de se tornar alguem melhor ou fazer algo importante  Ele divide o homem em ordinario e extraordinario  numa tentativa de explicar a quebra das regras em prol do avanco humano Seguindo este preceito   fazer algo que mude a sociedade ou em prol dela   o personagem planeja  em meio a uma luta consigo  a morte de uma agiota e  finalmente  cumpre o Antes de fugir da cena do crime  porem  Raskolnikov tambem comete  a contragosto  levado

chega a usufruir deste ganho  e sentindo se arrependido enterra as sob uma pedra Apos tal fato e seus desfechos  o romance relata de maneira detalhista os dramas psicologicos sofridos pelo autor do homicidio  toda a sua saga  sofrimento e arrependimento Diversas historias se desenvolvem de maneira paralela a principal  entre elas um romance da irma do personagem Raskolnikov e as relacoes do personagem com Sonia Apesar de investigar Raskolnikov  a policia termina por prender um inocente que se intitulou culpado por uma razao pessoal  bem explicado no livro   Entretanto  o personagem por fim confessa o crime que cometera  A confissao deveu se  principalmente  a enorme influencia de Sonia  que  antes disso  compartilha com Raskolnikov algumas leituras do Novo Testamento Por fim  Raskolnikov e preso  Porem  devido a sua confissao  arrependimento e otimo antecedentes  sua pena acaba por ser reduzida a oito anos em uma cadeia na Siberia  Durante tal periodo  Sonia  personagem que a partir de certo momento segue Raskolnikov em todas as situacoes  manteve se muito presente  servindo ate mesmo de mensageira a sua familia em Sao Petesburgo  Qualsiasi parola recensoria riguardo a questo romanzo  o dovrei chiamarlo trattato filosofico romanzato   sarebbe inutile Mi limito a dire che grazie a Dostojevsky ho potuto scoprire ed apprezzare gli straordinari proverbi russi Uno su tutti   Cento conigli non fanno un cavallo  I don t know really know how to rate this  It s like reading something that is objectively good in all senses  While I ve always believed all things to be subjective  I feel like Crime and Punishment is objectively good and my opinion is moot  It s good  Read it  Period   Best work of fiction I ve ever read  Dostoevsky penetrates the mind of the unhardened criminal  showing the struggle of a man who thought that he was great enough to not feel guilt  But even that struggle is no match for repentance and grace  Fantastic  My first Dostoevsky and it did not disappoint  I also was impressed with the translation  Garnett   as I had heard it was not good  but it seemed quite good to me  I also can relate to Raskolnikov  we both had to hold a secret from our family for a long period of time  and it ate us away inside  When we came clean  it felt wonderful  While I found this novel disconcerting at times  I really enjoyed it  There were many thought provoking ideas  and many sociological implications  as I discuss in my blog post that I ve put below http   jackofallbooks wordpress com 2    5 stars  not enough  One of my fav  Masterpiece  Personally  I would not be intimidated by the length of this book  or if you have heard of any spoilers  The psychologically focused epic exemplifies the role of guilt in someone who commits a crime  The interesting thing is that there are multiple characters  some of whom experience guilt  and some of whom do not  each who do ethically impure things  Of course the worst  if you are ranking these matters  would be murder  and Raskolnikov and his guilty ambivalence is the main focus of the novel  Varias cosas me gustan de esta novela y de Dostoievsky en general  la descripcion de los impulsos incontrolables que dirigen a las personas  la variedad y complejidad de sus personalidades y lo absorbente de la prosa  que transmite una sensacion de ansiedad permanente  mn lrwyt ly tGyr nZr  lnsn w tzydh  mq w shffy   Perhaps the best book ever written  I really enjoyed this book  Even though I didn t like the characters I was compelled to read on as I wanted to find out the outcome  It was a challenging read but worth it  I want to read the rest but I need a holiday in a quiet place  Raskolnikovs kval i samband med att han ska morda en gammal gumma  Mycket lasvard och en otrolig skildring av manniskans natur  One of the best books I have ever read  There were tastes of Nihilism  Existentialism  and even divinity in this novel  It s the story of man s descent into evil  and his attempt at redemption  A must read  10 out of 5 stars  Read for second time  Possibly the greatest novel ever  Top 3 all time for me  Six stars Crime and Punishment was my far my favorite book in AP English Literature  loved that class   The character of Raskolnikov is both sympathetic and relatable  His murder of the pawnbroker  though heinous at face value  is a moral conundrum that Dostoevsky handles deftly and philosophically  Where other authors might have written a book about the concealment of a character s wrongdoing  Dostoevsky takes the opportunity to explore the moral and ethical questions surrounding Frederich Nietzsche s ubermensch  Ultimately  Crime and Punishment is a literary success in terms of style  content and philosophy  The Pevear and Volokonsky translation  which was the one I read  is true to Dostoevky s original style  the translators have managed to strike the perfect balance between literal and stylistic translation   This is my favorite book of all time  However  it wasn t until my second time reading it that I discovered just how funny and lovable it really is  Beneath the grimness  a bright hilarity  Crime e Castigo pode nao ser o melhor livro de sempre  mas e incontornavel que se trata de uma obra de referencia e por isso mesmo de leitura obrigatoria Raskolnikov e um jovem que  para dar seguimento a sua vida academica  foi viver para Sao Petersburgo  Orfao de pai  e com a ajuda da mae e da irma que vai subsistindo  Apesar disso  a sua vida nao e facil  O mau humor aliado ao mau temperamento passam a ser uma constante  aliando ainda a sua falta de disponibilidade para fazer amigos  o resultado e o abandono dos estudos Dedica se entao a deambular pelas ruas  a pensar na vida e nos grandes icones da historia  como por exemplo Napoleao   revoltando se com o mundo que o rodeia   Os fins justificam os meios  e algo que parece dominar lhe as ideias  Muitos sao os dilemas com que a sua mente se debate  muitas as dores de cabeca e a consequencia e o desleixo na sua imagem parecendo um mendigo  Em boa verdade apenas fala com Nastassia e Razumikhin  uma criada do predio que habita e um ex colega de faculdade Estas pequenas linhas  naturalmente nao chegam para o descrever  porque e uma personagem muito mais complexa capaz de pensar o mal  mas tambem  quando menos se espera  capaz de ser solidario ao ponto de entregar todo o seu dinheiro a uma desconhecida em apuros  achando se com capacidade para organizar o mundo a sua maneira Conforme o titulo do livro propoe  havera um crime ao qual Raskolnikov esta associado  A morte de uma velha agiota e de sua irma  vitimas de assassinato  e o colocar em pratica desse plano pensado ao mais pequeno pormenor ate ao momento de o por em pratica  Mas a vida e cheia de surpresas e nem tudo aconteceu conforme planeado  Raskolnikov  sente se fraco  delira  recupera  torna a delirar  Comecou o castigo A qualidade da descricao de uma personagem que ja tinha lido em O Jogador  e aqui ainda muito mais evidente  Dostoievski tem a capacidade de entrar na mente das suas personagens de uma forma que esta alcance de muito poucos  E esse para mim um dos grandes pontos altos da sua escrita Com Raskolnikov este trabalho e primoroso  A forma como descreve os momentos em que o seu personagem luta contra os seus dilemas sozinho  quando reencontra a familia ou nos interrogatorios de policia e sublime  Numa palavra   apaixonante  Quando voltar ao autor  gostaria de ler O Idiota  por isso se me quiserem oferecer uma prenda   Por ultimo uma breve mas justa  referencia para a excelente traducao da obra  Acho que esta muito bem escrito e por isso mesmo nao queria deixar passar em branco Termino este post da forma como comecei  Leitura Obrigatoria Pags  510Ref  ISBN  978 972 23 2722 0Editora  Editorial Presencahttp   conspiracaodasletras blogspot     I m sorry les miserable  but your have been abdicated from your throne  This book is so far the best novel I have ever read  and the intriguing thing is I do not know why Perhaps its the nihilism in Raskolnikov s thoughts  or the utilitarian dilemma whether the fact that killing a wretched old hag would promote greater overall happiness justifies such an act   But again if you were napoleon on the verge of greatness only stymied by such an pest wouldn t you destroy it     what am I thinking of  these ideas will drive me mad  the mere thought is ridiculous   yet why do they reside   In the end we all have to suffer  only through suffering can we gain atonement from our sin  But suffering is not laying in prison for years to come   it is neither the psychological turbulence attributed to one s atrocities  nor the physical pain in all its shades and colours  The genesis of The brothers Karamazov best sum up suffering  much as hell  is simply  the suffering from being unable to love  a price that both Raskolnikov and Sonia have to pay in atonement  adm h z chy my trsnd  z an chh an h

intensely  Raskolnikov is an intelligent and extremely poor student living in Russia who murders a pawnbroker and her sister  As I read this I struggled to place where I stood on his guilt  Either way I of course think murder is wrong and should be punished  but what continues to puzzle me is if it was justifiable or not  I feel like I am constantly learning something new about how humans react to such a tragic crime every time I reread this book  Whether it was intended or not  I believe Dostovesky makes mental illness better understood through the character Raskolnikov  Obviously  something is wrong with him given that he premeditated the murders of the two women but you understand down to the most finite detail why he did it  Crime and Punishment is one of my all time favorite books  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in psychology  Russian literature and or classic novels   One of the greatest books I have ever read  Captures a tormented soul and his road to salvation  The torment  the agony  the paranoia of sin is all elegantly captured in this haunting story  But love is captured as well  There are sections in there that will stay with you the rest of your life  PS I have lost my original copy and if someone wants to get me one then please be my guest  best book ever this was one of my first forays into literature and it s been pretty much downhill ever since  if you want to discover what really good writing is then this is where you find it  this book was labored over and it shows  i am putting off reading the brothers karamazov until i am an old man  because i need to look forward to something THAT GOOD  I ve heard there are translations much better than Pervear s  If anyone comes across this and knows of a better translation  please let me know  My initial response to Dostoyevski s powerful Crime and Punishment was that the novel had an unorthodox style compared to other literary greats of its time  something that could easily dissatisfy many readers not familiar to Dostoyevski s works  To name only a few oddities of style in Crime and Punishment  the most significant are that  i  about half the book consists out of pure dialogue  which occasionally obstructs the author from adding vivid descriptions of St  Petersburg in mid 19th century   ii  paragraphs may go up to four pages long  unbroken  and  iii  the book is charged with philosophical theories and deep character study  Above all  the novel is explicit and gruesome  vividly describing the poverty that reigned over the city  and also giving us the famous  grisly and finely detailed account of Raskolnikov s double murder at the start of the novel  Crime and Punishment is an  ugly  book  and it appears much too modern for its time  the writing almost seems to mirror the rotten state of Raskolnikov s mind  as well as the destitution and madness of St  Petersburg s slums  Then again  the book  amongst others  marks the departure of realism in literature  and introduces the theories of idealism in novels  Dostoyevski is obviously more interested in the study of the character rather than his surroundings  Crime and Punishment is a study of guilt  It is the story of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  a destitute ex student who commits a random murder for no apparent reason  From there on  we follow him through the slums of St  Petersburg  we watch him encounter friends and foes  however hard he tries to avoid all sorts of company   We also gradually see how his conscience and guilt start to grow near the end of the book  he initially felt no remorse for his crime   and finally  how he is forced to choose between either  i  suicide  or  ii  turning himself in  in order to destroy his swelling torment  We are given fine examples of both options throughout the novel  Svidrigailov s suicide comes to mind   and it is to our surprise that Raskolnikov eventually chooses imprisonment over suicide  By either ending his life or receiving his severe punishment  he could destroy his mental suffering  In the beginning of the novel  we  the readers  are confused by the killings  since it offers no reasons behind it  We are  however  eventually given a theory  crazy as it may be  as to why Raskolnikov murdered the pawnbroken and her half sister  which serves as a huge explanation to the nature of the murder  But surely his environment  poverty and relations with evil men have also something to do with it  Raskolnikov loathes the evil nature of men and women  and sees this wickedness in almost everyone  most of them driven by greed  We have Petrovich  police investigator  who cares only for himself and his job  and brings many suspects of crime  through torture and psychological games  into madness  Then we have Luzhin  fiance to Raskolnikov s sister  obsessed with power and money  he desires marriages with destitute women not only to have control over them  but also because they only consume little money   Svidrigailov  on the other hand  is a morally crippled and disgusting pervert  and  it is hinted at  a pedophile   And finally  we have the pawnbroker  who  in Raskolnikov s mind   robs  money from the poor  and is therefore considered immoral  These four mentioned characters present the evils of different social circles  and are therefore a motivation for Raskolnikov to act against the cruel  crumbling  both physically and mentally  society  It is only in Sonya  a poor prostitute who gives all of her money away to her downtrodden family  that Raskolnikov sees a human being  and finally falls in love with  Crime and Punishment is a novel of great power and raw emotion  For me it stands out  along with War and Peace  albeit being extremely different to Dostoyevski s work   as the greatest study on the human psychology  nh lfkhr n tqr  ldwswyfsky w khSwS  mlh lkbyr   hdh kn thny ktb  qr  lh b d  lmskyn  w lkn lktb lDkhm lwl w ldhy knt w jl qrth l dyd mn lmrt nZr lHjmh w nZr

n ykhbrw dwstwyfsky b ny Hbh  E  da ieri sera che avrei dovuto scrivere qualche parola su  Delitto e Castigo   Prima di tutto  come tutti i libri che per me hanno significato qualcosa oltre alla semplice commozione temporanea dopo averli terminati  questo romanzo e stato il Titano contro il quale ho lottato costruendo la peggiore delle barricate  issando una caterva di pregiudizi  mobilitando la noia e la puerile convinzione che fosse solo la storia di un delitto e di un castigo qualunque  che oltre al furore e alla vergogna del protagonista non avrei trovato un bel niente  Solo nomi russi  incomprensibili  irripetibili  Era capitato con Marquez  era capitato con Hugo  qualsiasi cosa mi avessero consigliato la distruggevo a pura inezia  se piaceva a tutti allora doveva essere davvero stupido  e poi si sa che il tempo e il miglior cemento e gonfia e irrigidisce i nomi rendendoli piu grandi di quanto non siano effettivamente stati  Questo mi dicevo  e tuttavia volevo leggere il romanzo  perche e uno di quelli che  si deve leggere   tutti lo conoscono  tutti lo avevano letto per formarsi un opinione  L edizione del libro che comprai risale al 2006  Sono passati 5 anni pieni senza che io riuscissi ad andare oltre pagina 200  Sono tuttavia sempre stata certa che le cose arrivano proprio al momento giusto  che a volte coincide con quello piu sbagliato  per permetterti di vedere oltre l abisso che ti attanaglia uno spiraglio di salvezza e beatitudine  Cosi stavolta intrapresi di nuovo la lettura del romanzo  quasi ossessionata giunsi dalla prima sera a pagina 100  Al mattino dopo ero a pagina 200  La sera a pagina 350  Ci vollero circa 3 giorni per completarlo  molto meno per rendermi conto di quanto Raskolnikov mi assomigliasse  Questa e la storia di un ragazzo che vede il mondo diviso tra grandi uomini e pidocchi  I grandi uomini sfuggono alla legge  e per far valere le loro idee sono legittimati anche a compiere azioni cruente  All inizio della vicenda Fedor ci fa credere che sia per la fame  per non pesare sulla famiglia  per poter continuare gli studi che Raskolnikov uccide una strozzina  e sfortunatamente anche la sorella della vecchia  che si trovo in casa durante l avvenimento dell omicidio  dopo circa 400 pagina sappiamo che lo fece solo per dimostrare a se stesso di poter essere un Napoleone  non un pidocchio  Ma nel doverselo dimostrare  e nel rendersi conto che avesse compiuto un azione non di certo mastodontica egli cade in uno stato malsano di incubo  preda dei nervi e della malattia  a tratti infervorato e intrattabile e in altri mite e docile da esser penoso  ma sempre preservando i suoi modi arcigni e un senso di distacco assoluto dalle cose e dalle persone  Finche non fa la conoscenza di Sonia  una ragazza costretta a vendere il suo corpo per sostenere le spese della sua famiglia sventurata  timida e sventurata  dal viso angelico e infantile e dal cuore grande  Non c e malizia in lei  non c e disprezzo verso coloro che l hanno costretta al disonore  e diciamo  la donna angelo e cammina vestita di stracci  E  quanto di piu lontano dall immagine di una Beatrice per come l ambiente l ha resa miserabile  ma ancora piu per questo la sua bonta e la sua fede incorruttibile spiccano sulla lordura  contrapponendosi all ateismo e alle teorie malsane di Raskolnikov  Sonia salva Raskolnikov  convincendolo prima a confessare il misfatto  e poi ad accettare la sua sorte  i lavori forzati  e soprattutto il pentimento  Non c e un attimo in cui si dubiti che i due si amino e siano destinati a un avvenire insieme  ma e solo nell ultima pagina che lui si rende conto che non ci sono altre alternative  e finalmente si spoglia del dolore e della vergogna di essere uno qualunque e decide di amare la vita  e Sonia  Ci sono cosi tanti richiami a cio che sto provando che il mio cuore accelerava all impazzata leggendo le vicende descritte nell opera  E  una di quelle volte in cui ringrazio fermamente la mia buona stella d avermi donato una passione tanto rara quale la lettura  di non avere a noia le storie d altri che spesso nemmeno sono state per davvero  Questo romanzo sono sicura  mi aiutera a cambiare  e a accettare la mia croce   I asked my mom once how come i have such an unusual name  since normal Croatian name is Sanja  not Sonja  She said that she read it somewhere and liked it At back then i didn t notice that one of the book shelves in out living room was reserved for all works by Dostojevsky And the  when i was 16  we had to read it for a class assignment  and  well  some people still call me   Lady Marmalade   Amazing book  anyway  Stunning treatment of guilt love and redemption A book that will stay with you all your life  Dostoyevsky s genius is his religious neutrality   he does not preach  he shows  Crime and Punishment is not a story of   Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive  it is a series of erratic rides on the Japanese Shinkansen  Dostoyevsky drives his readers directly to the heart s beating muscle  rigorously delineating the intimate and methodical yet fighting and fleeing inception of each and every one of the protagonist s thoughts  My mind is still panting from the read  I once bet myself that I couldn t read this book  Then the dilemma was  should I go on and finish it and win the bet or stop and win the bet I decided that  since I d started  I would go on  I made myself carry on  I picked it up when I didn t want to and pushed through it The result was that I am chuffed that I got to the end  Chuffed that I read such a story in my lifetime and amazed that anyone could write in that way  This is the kind of book people talk about when they talk about a book that makes you think  I still think about it and I read it many  many years ago      What s to say that hasn t been said  It took me three attempts to get going at this  and I read it straight over a break from college  and then had problems interfacing with people in the real world  Powerful stuff   I first read Crime and Punishment during my first serious reading binge  It was the summer between my freshmen and sophomore year of college  I was single  and working as a janitor  Sadly  I had managed to escape high school without a shred of literacy  and was beyond ignorant at the time  I had heard of the book  of course  and vaguely thought of it as a kind of companion to War and Peace  But when I opened up to the first page  I couldn t have had less of an idea what to expect I was stunned  No book from that summer ended up making a bigger impression on me  In addition to this work  I had managed to bluster my way through Nietzsche s Thus Spoke Zarathustra  Freud s On the Interpretation of Dreams  and Toltoy s War and Peace  Needless to say  almost everything of value went sailing over my head  But when I put down C   P  I was at least left with the feeling of awe  and the certain knowledge that I had experienced something truly great  The raw emotional power of the book was enough for me at the time  Raskolnikov s dream with the horse  his exquisitely detailed mental states that accompanied his murder and attending guilt  the suicidal hallucinations of Svidrigailov  they burned themselves deep into my memory As a result  I m much relieved that I took the time to go through this book once more  Now  many literature binges later  I have some hope of understanding what Dostoyevsky was trying to get across It strikes me that Crime and Punishment  when evaluated as strictly a novel  is not necessarily first rate  There is little actual suspense  as the reader is continually clued in to what will occur through blatant foreshadowing  And Dostoyevsky s characters would be downright cartoonish if they weren t so tortured  The single minded and obsessive Roskolnikov almost seems like a cardboard cutout in comparison to more balanced  nuanced  and human characters like Tolstoy s Pierre  His actions are always just so  his thoughts always run just so  In a word  he is two dimensional But that s the thing about Dostoyevsky  he wasn t writing novels  His works are sui generis  His books are like intellectual playgrounds where he could allegorize and develop his philosophy and perspective  He uses the crime novel genera to explore the question of free will  sin  and redemption  he takes stock characters from French fiction and turns them on their heads  to reveal the underpinning worldview that they represent  In the longwinded conversations his characters indulge in  he explores political philosophy  the nature of goodness  and the purpose of human life  But unlike Plato s dialogues  the conversations are not just vehicles  The personalities and actions of his characters illustrate the ideas that they represent  resulting in a plot that is part allegory  part philosophy  and part prophecy  Extraordinary as all of this intellectual play is  that s not even the best part  Dostoyevsky s emotional drive  his ceaseless insistence  and his powerful symbolism make his books moving in their own special way  One experiences all of the drama of Dostoyevsky s own autobiographical journey  through utopian hope in human reason  to intense suffering and nihilistic despair  to biting scorn and isolation  and finally to peace through faith in the Gospels  Dostoyevsky knows  perhaps better than anybody  how important it is that one not only think ideas  but feel them  His books recreate this intense emotional struggle  Like Dante  he treads a course into the lowest pit a man can sink  into the highest happiness he can achieve  A must read for anyone interested in theories of ethics    Nietzschean in particular  As usual  I agree with Dostoevsky s characters more than I agree with Dostoevsky s authorial interpretation or intended message  C P is the brightest star in the galaxy of Dostoyevsky  This book states the mental trauma a youth faces after committing a murder  Throughout this novel he tries to defend his crime before admitting it at last  This book contains literature and philosophy of supreme class  I ll admit  it took me a bit to warm up to the book  Raskolnikov was a bit off putting from the very start  But I am very glad I gave the book a chance The plot is fairly straightforward  and though Dostoevsky dives off into side stories now and then  those same stories tend to make it back into the main plot at some point  Every character we met has his own voice  Dostoevsky s ability to breath life into his characters moved them from flat strangers into people that are recognizable and archetypes without being caricatures  These characters speak from their hearts and temperaments  and each different from the other This isn t just a psychological thriller  this is a story of profound religions connections and ideals  Raskolnikov s crime merely sets the stage  the real story is the hearts and souls of the characters and Raskolnikov s long road to redemption  Among other things  this is a story about the pride that causes men to fall  and keeps them in that state  unable to admit to their own wrong doing and the wounds they have inflicted upon others and themselves  Loyalty  family duty  honor  the meaning of courage  despair  madness  broken hearts and contrite souls  Dostoevsky fits more themes into one simple plot line then I had thought possible  and does it so deftly I didn t notice until I pulled back and thought about the book  It s a long story  those Russians know how to write  But this isn t a deterrent in the slightest  in fact I found myself wishing for just a bit more at the end  Highly recommended  Brilliant piece of work about the inner struggles of a thinking man   an intellectual  I won t say much  lest I spoil it  but I will say this   read it before reading anything else   I was deeply affected by this book and I am so glad that I read it finally  I believe it will stay with me for my lifetime  I see here on GoodReads that many people are still reading it and loving it every day after close to 150 years since first publication  Truly amazing  Fyodor Dostoyevsky has a wonderful style of writing  His characters are made so real and they are all of  them certainly  characters   I was able to visualize each character clearly thanks to Dostoyevsky s explicit descriptions of facial features  hair  clothes  and mannerisms   sounds and even smells     I will write only briefly in summary about the book  This was my first truly Russian novel  in English translation  and this for me was also a learning experience about the Russian people of the time  circa 1866  and of their lives with a few things political  social and economical going on then sewn into the story  For the protagonist Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov  this was a time of awfully dire poverty  I did have a little difficulty in reading it at first  The way Russian names work was challenging for me   as I suppose it would be for most non Russians  The problem I am told with first names in Russian is that people use endless diminutive forms and also will switch from informal name to formal name frequently as it is in this novel  I went in without a cheat sheet or study guide but eventually learned who was talking  often in never ending pontification  to whom  I read analysis after elsewhere about the significance of Dostoyevsky s character names but that is over analyzed IMO  Yes Dostoyevsky s characters can really talk   a lot  Raz as I call him  or Razumihkin  or formally Dmitry Prokofitch  delivers many times over  the mother of all monologues   The police inspector Porfiry Petrovitch comes in at a close second  Russians of that time  I learned  seem to like to talk     view spoiler   As I made my way through the novel I came across a chapter that at the time seemed to be superfluous  The chapter was the one about the wake dinner given for Marmeladov by his consumptive widow Dunya  Bor ing  But as we all come to learn  the wake chapter was a vital part of the story  Its importance becomes shockingly evident as events unfold in subsequent chapters  Without the wake party we would not have learned of the shallow and despicable liar Pyotr Petrovitch is and of the mock trial he conducts to pin a theft of money on poor Sonya  or of Svidrigailov s chance spying of Rodya s confession to Sonya  Katerina Ivanova s death from consumption on the very day of her husband s funeral is a coincidental tragedy that also happens in this part  What is kind of funny though is that the wake is ultimately a disaster  Everyone gets drunk  It is funny because it is so much like a wake or two that I have attended with dysfunctional family  Moving on    The careful weaving of plot is what makes Crime and Punishment so masterful  But the interweaving of the lives of its players with Rodion Romanovitch that meet to form the whole of this tragedy is what is equally ingenious  From the accidental death of the broken down Marmeladov  happened upon by our highly intellectual and psychologically complex protagonist  to the murder s   and the detective s pursuit of the murderer  and the interrogation of Rodya by Porfiry Petrovitch who eventually accuses him directly  Part VI Chapter II   to the death of the lonely and underappreciated Katernia Ivanova  the love shared between Sonia and Rodya  the battle for Dunya s affections  the suicide of Svidrigailov  the admission of guilt  and after Rodya s incarceration  the death of his mother and it all came together in a surprising and shocking yet satisfying way  Nothing given away  only hints at what may come  Nearly perfectly complete in the end   Did anybody notice that there was no funeral for the pawnbroker Alyona or her sister Lizaveta Ivanova  Was there no mention of it   This was Dostoyevsk ys portrayal of a murderer   one with a complex profile who plotted and planned and executed  imperfect as it was   a robbery   murder   a grudge murder   that by sheer luck went un prosecuted  And one that weighed so heavily on the conscience of our protagonist that he finally   even after learning of the death of the one and only witness that could have turned him in  Svidrigailov  went forth begrudgingly to confess probably only after perceived pressure from his sister and from the unspoken wishes of the saintly former prostitute Sonia  now chaste  whom Rodya deeply loves and of his mother too  It is interesting to note that Rodya hadn t a sliver of remorse or did he care that the wrong man  the painter  took credit for his crime  Maybe he was even jealous  In many ways I think that so many things Rodya does are just a way to get attention   that he was desperately lonely   and even maybe even it is a sadistic game for Rodya  He is terribly narcissistic of course  He was perplexed and he tried to rationalize that his murderous deeds if committed by Napoleon i e   the storming of Toulon  would have been celebrated  Maybe he is also a sociopath  Razkolnikov s view of those around him was that of prince and pauper  But in the end he showed compassion for he asked that Razumihkin  his true blue friend  look after his sister and mother during his incarceration  I had a few favorite chapters  The scene when Razkolnikov is at wits end and goes to turn himself in at the police station to Porfiry  Part IV Chapter V  but it gets interrupted and thrown off by the painter s shocking and unplanned admission of guilt is one of the story s best  I was on the edge of my chair the whole time  I couldn t put the book down  The interplay between accuser and accused just loaded and oozing with tension as Rodya phases in and out of believing he is finished and Porfiry homes in on his target  This battle that Raskolnikov has within himself is ongoing throughout  He is constantly wrestling with thoughts of destiny  of good and evil  right and wrong and about his purpose and mostly about the injustice that is his miserable life  Sounds like a mid life crisis to me  Crime and Punishment is ultimately a story of love  The love of family   especially that unbreakable bond between mother and son and the love of one s own community   of one s fellow man  and of what one man Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov was willing to stoop to to protect that  I give this novel my highest accolades  It is undeniably a masterpiece    hide spoiler   All the people who gave crime and punishment just one star should be transported to some distant planet which supports life and stupidity  I learned so much from this book that it s hard to review it  Just a ton of wonderful techniques coming together to describe a bunch of amazingly unique characters  I really loved it  And I can jump up and down a little thinking I ve taken down  alone  another of the  Big  novels that I managed to elude during a long education   This book focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  an impoverished ex student in St  Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker s money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime  while ridding the world of a worthless parasite  He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things  and even have the right to do them  Several times throughout the novel  Raskolnikov justifies his actions by connecting himself mentally with Napoleon Bonaparte  believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose this book is well return by one of the most important authors in the history of lit  A brilliant literary masterpiece  I can say it is definetly within my top 5 favorite novels  if not my favorite novel  Dostoevsky masterfully portrays psychology and raw emotion in this work of art  An idea possesses Raskolnikov  He believes there are supermen  Newton s and Napoleon s  who transcend ordinary men and women  who can act without moral constraint to judge evil and levy punishment  and to determine whether he belongs to this superior race  he kills the greedy and usurious pawn broker  But unlike Napoleon in Austerlitz he doesn t execute his plan coldly and tactically  Rather  he nauseatingly dreams his way into a double murder  the pawnbroker s sister having returned because he tarried  And  the sight of blood terrifies him to the extend his hands could not stop trembling  He discovers that he isn t upright or courageous  that he could not transcend the law  and that he is just a louse  a member of the inferior class  St  PetersburgCrime and Punishment showcases Raskolnikov s contradictory actions and emotions and reveals a split psyche fighting for wholeness  He despises others but dreams about saving the world  After reading his mother s letter about his sister s misfortune  he sheds tears but also sneers  He gives the little he has to help the Marmeladovs but then regrets helping them  He kills the pawnbroker to prove an idea but takes her money and valuables  He avoids the head detective Porfiry s questions in the first interview but in the second falls upon the man  The psychological tensions grasp the reader and move the story forward Fyodor DostoevskyRaskolnikov s punishment begins not in Siberia after the verdict  but immediately after killing the pawnbroker  his irritability  nervousness  suspiciousness  delusion  and mania tormenting an already fragile psyche  not allowing him to eat  drink  sleep  work or socialize  and pressing him to hide in his coffin like apartment trying to curl up under his blanket  feverish and delusional and escape from reality  His conscience torments and implicates him even before the law does so  Only through Sonya s help and guidance could he find strength to confess his crime  This novel s conclusion reveals that Dostoyevsky rejected any social system that tries to replace the jagged path of life with linear reason and save people from their predicament  Although his moral heavy handedness in Raskolnikov s repentance and redemption seemed to scar the artistry of the mental battle  Crime and Punishment is psychological novel at its best   I love the morals and metaphors and concepts of this classic  Beautiful religiously tied story that has some really wonderful subplots   Showcased in On the Classics and Disney Book Tag  Read for school 12th grade  Just wonderful  Really gripping and a page turner  The intellectual discussions about whether killing can be legitimate  the almost Lady Macbeth feeling after the deed  the one to one encounters full of hints and unsaid threats or thoughts   all were totally engaging and intriguing  I can t believe that it has taken so long for me to come round to reading this book  Fantastic  A beautiful book in so many ways  A haunting look at the folly of man s pride and the consequences that must befall such exultant pride  as well as a beautiful glimpse at the greatness of God s grace and his ability to redeem even the most exultant of sinners and bring their lives in subjection to Him  Also a powerful argument for human worth and dignity Rating  4 5 5 Stars   Excellent  Fyodor Dostoevsky s Crime and Punishment is the first Russian novel I have read  Perhaps my favorite genre to read is True Crime  However  I have not read many fiction books that center around a crime Though there are only a few chapters in the book that are edge of your seat suspenseful  I found myself gripped by Dostoevsky s exploration of the psychology of a killer  On the back of Vintage Classics  Pevear Volokhonsky edition  the summary says that Crime and Punishment   implicates even the most innocent reader in its enormities   I definitely found this to be true  Also on the back   It is a preternaturally acute investigation of the forces that impel a man toward sin  suffering  and grace   Dostoevsky shows that people are complex  Therefore  their motivations  which drive them to do the things they do  are complex  Though the many characters with Russian names can make the book difficult to read  each of these characters are needed to demonstrate the complexity of motives that dwell within the heart of people The plot of Crime and Punishment is moved forward primarily through the dialogue of complex characters  Adding this to the setting of 1860 s Russia  some chapters can be tough to work through  However  those who persevere  I believe  will be rewarded with a beautiful novel dealing with the complexity of humans and their actions and their need for redemption By the way  I am not ashamed to admit that I used Spark Notes to help explain some of the background to the novel  Readers might find it helpful  as I did  to read a few chapters and then check out the Spark Note summaries of those chapters   If you are going to murder someone  you d better confess to the crime quickly as the guilt will rapidly make you insane  Assuming you are a thoughtfull intellectual like the odd and complex hero of this novel  Or better still  don t commit the deed at all  A fascinating exploration of guilt  redemption and the degrading effects of poverty  It is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time Easily one of the best books I ve ever read  I would like to thank Dostoevsky for making me more grateful that in no point in the history of the world I have lived in Russia  I love the message and themes of this book  However  i did not love the amount of pages dedicated to nonsense rumblings  The book could be reduced by 50  and still hold the same message and impact   The most incredible book I ve ever read  The ending nearly brought me to tears  I never expected such closure from Dostoyevsky  This is apparently the latest entry into what has inadvertently become an attempt to read at least one classic of Russian literature a year  I didn t plan it that way  but there you have it  My first exposure to this novel was as a senior in high school  my now sadly departed English teacher and I were sifting through the closet o  English stuff for one old tome or another when we came upon a box of this novel  which had apparently once been part of the curriculum   You d like this   she said to my seventeen year old self   it has blood and guts  I don t remember being that bloodthirsty and I probably would have been dismayed that the blood and guts amounted to about five pages but considering that s five pages more than  Silas Marner  sported  the idea of  any port in a storm  might have applied But what a mess those scant few pages of blood and guts create  Given the title and the event that drives most of the themes that reside here  you d think that it was an early version of the detective story  a psychological game of wits between hunter and prey  And it is  to some extent  But like in Dickens   Bleak House   the mystery stuff almost seems to exist as a side plot while Dostoyevsky deals more with the consequences and ramifications of the act itself  both internally and externally  mostly internally  as no one seems too broken up that the old lady is dead  The core of the novel concerns ex student Raskolnikov  who decides one day that he s tired of being a poor student and he d be a lot more use to the world if he killed some old lady and took her money  especially as she isn t contributing much to the world at large  Well  murder seems to be much like a certain kind of potato chip  as you can t do just one and before he knows it there are two dead people  which should be a problem except that no evidence exists to connect him to it  giving him potentially the perfect crime  All he has to do is stay cool until the police lay off  and not arouse suspicion at all  which should be easy as long as he s not stressed  Except  oh look  his mother and sister are here for a visit  With her jerk of a future husband  Maybe it would just be easier to confess If this book was six hundred pages of some guy trying not to get caught for a murder he s already committed  it would probably be a tough slog but Dostoyevsky seems to understand that life isn t about one thing  In a sense the novel becomes a tapestry twisting in the wind  where some elements become more exposed than others depending on the chapter and the travails of his sister or best friend or the random family with the drunk dad and prostitute daughter are just as important as the main action  It gets a feel for the flow and rhythm of everyday life  of trying to exist putting one foot in front of the other  showing how life is hard under normal circumstances  and really hard when you ve got some stray blood on your conscience  It s the weaving of the threads  as Raskolnikov stumbles through St Petersburg slowly unraveling while everyone feels bad that he s unraveling but can t imagine it would have anything to do with the two dead ladies  In that sense he becomes a figure wandering in the distance even when seen close up  a weighted shadow that pulls all the action in toward himself  even when he s desperate not to be seen  Except  as twitchy and slightly crazy  everyone is starting to notice him It sounds more humorous than you d expect for a serious Russian novel and what surprised me was how for a book that deals with weighty themes  there s a number of bits that are striking in their subtle comedy  When his sister and mother arrive  it s a moment out of a sitcom and his early interactions with the police are a thing of beauty  as he basically tells them that he did it  but they assume that since he s admitting he was the most likely person to do it  he couldn t be the guy  Yet it can turn on a dime and break your heart or horrify you  One woman s death from the end stages of consumption as she goes out of her mind and then basically disintegrates on the page is terrifying in how the book never blinks  focusing unerringly on her suffering in what amounts to a long camera take  revealing a number of people standing around helplessly while also coming together to see someone out of this world  Raskolnikov s interactions with card carrying lady of the night Sonya are extraordinarily touching  including one brief flicker of a moment where she grabs his hands and you realize how alienated these two people are and how much they care for each other because of it  Even a lengthy scene leading up to someone s suicide is carried by an elegant and airy sense of finality  with Dostoyevsky weaving those giant blocks of text into something that feels almost minimalistic  and precise for it But it s the murder and the handling of the investigation that s going to be the draw for a lot of people and the few scenes that feature Raskolnikov and smarter than the average detective Porfiry are exhilarating in their drawn out tension  as the two of them dance around each other in a game of  I know that you know that I know that you know   the detective fairly sure he has his man but without any way of proving it he s forced to engage in circular debates to try and trick a confession out of him  Meanwhile  Raskolnikov does things like talk about his theory on how  great men  like his boy Napoleon are allowed to do horrible things like murder useless people because it gives them a chance to go on and do greater things that only they are capable of  there s a great  Hark  A Vagrant  strip where Raskolnikov is confronted with an article he once wrote titled something along the lines of  Murdering Old Ladies  An OK Thing   and gradually becoming unglued while the police start to run out of suspects  amusingly  19th century Russian policework does not involve just beating up people until someone confesses  although maybe that happens offscreen       someone does eventually confess  however  Some people may feel the subplots and other plots dilute the impact of the main event  although I think it all falls into the same weave  Still  there are moments where two characters are having a discussion that feels like a sign should light up above them saying  This is allegorical   and for a good portion of the beginning no one is capable of answering any simple question without it turning into a pages long story about something that is probably didactic  Other people  myself  included  may have trouble keeping the main cast of characters straight  While it s a cliche that Russian novels are notorious for everyone having more than one name  that s totally the case here and a quick perusal of a character sheet may be necessary  and a continual refresher wouldn t hurt  as not only are people referred to by vastly different names throughout the book  often in the same scene  a few characters are fairly similar long names and sometimes it s hard to tell if you re talking to the suitor who s a condescending jerk or the one who s the potential murderer But there are moments  especially as it barrels toward the conclusion  where the book feels like a pressure cooker full of trapped electricity  Where the screws are turned  where it seems that Raskolnikov is thisclose to giving in and confessing  or someone reveals something they ve heard unexpectedly  where kindness comes from people who don t seem capable of it  where suffering is dismissed as part of life  and embraced as necessary to enjoy life  When the culmination arrives  it feels like a relief at having been so tightly wound for so long and in that sense the epilogue almost feels like a letdown  a peek past the end credits when the ending was perfect as it was  But to stop before that misses the point of the novel  It s not to see someone get punished  but to see someone suffer and in that suffering see them understand what they were missing from life  And in that realization understand that life isn t doing whatever you want but what needs to be done  a graceful acceptance that might deprive us of a visceral denouement but reveals something more purer  we re not alone in this  and if we are  it s our own fault  There s hands everywhere  and if someone can t be pulled down into the fire with you  they ll wait patiently until you have the strength to crawl out  Dostoievski puso la literatura y en un nivel casi inalcanzable  digna de ser leida y revisada  en crimen y castigo su novela mas ambiciosa donde ahonda en los rasgos psicologicos de los personajes  su miseria  su indefendible culpa  Esta novela es insuperable  el mismo autor supuso un punto en donde Raskolnikov no pudo llevarlo a las siguientes novelas que escribio despues de esta  He aqui un libro importante para el universo literario que debemos leer para entender como diria Stefan Zweig el alma humana  I know this book is a difficult read  but once I learned to frame it properly  as a philosophical disproof of the prevailing philosophies of Dostoevsky s time  it really  opened up  for me   I love this book  Before I read it  I was pretty convinced that there were no good classic russian writers    That was so long ago  and I m thankful to this novel because it opened my eyes P  S  I did not read this particular book  but russian one which isn t in database here  There is russian translation of rewiew below this line Ia liubliu etu knigu  Pered tem  kak ia prochital eio  ia byl vpolne ser iozno uveren  chto nikakikh takikh khoroshikh russkikh klassikov v prirode ne sushchestvuet    Eto

otzyva    perevod etikh strok na angliiskii  This is not a great book if you are looking for fast moving action packed thrill  but the conversation in it and the mentality of the book is brilliant  One of my favorite  It might be helpful when reading it to take notes on characters names becuase many of them had slimarlery strange Russian names and it was difficult for me to remember who was who until I read a good protion of the story   Ma qui gia comincia una nuova storia  la storia del graduale rinnovarsi di un uomo  la storia della sua graduale rigenerazione  del suo graduale passaggio da un mondo in un altro  dei suoi progressi nella conoscenza di una nuova realta  fino allora completamente ignota   Finest character sketch with the reader privy to the memories  thoughts  actions and reactions of poverty  social despair   physical sickness that lead to not able to keep a job which led to poverty   physical sickness  social  sickness and when the book  like a symphony  reached its height  a physically and mentally sick man preyed on a vulnerable pawn lady  man vs  woman  for whatever money she kept in her apartment  Nothing ever goes smoothly in one of this guy s novels  The implications of this novel though it was written more than a century ago still echo today as a major thread that corrodes our social health and fairness today  Life still sucks pretty badly sometimes  It s difficult to say in how many and in what ways I thoroughly enjoyed this novel  I ll start by saying that it s one of those that I imagine the more times you read it  the more you grasp it and love it  While initially the three tiered names of the characters can be elusive and confusing  you eventually catch on and become completely immersed in more than just Raskolnikov s addled mind  While much of the novel is spent running through the paranoia of a mind pushed to the brink and then consequence of murder  there is far more to the story that I did not know about and was not expecting  Indeed  I found the characters of Svidrigailov and Luzhin incredibly curious  and I often found myself wondering if they were truly as depraved as they initially appeared to be  or was it all in Raskolnikov s head  I cannot decide how I felt about the final few paragraphs of the novel and the turn in the character  which almost  ALMOST  felt like a cop out in a big Hollywood kind of way  Other than this issue  the story is intensely deep and emotional  and particularly the first half leaves you often cringing or gasping  and there are a few other scenes later in the novel which add to that feeling  Bizarrely  though  I have to confess that I did not feel much attachment to any of the characters  for they all had their qualities which made them  at times  very one note  I have read that Dostoevsky writes in an idealist sense  and you can see that here  especially with characters like Sonia and Katerina Ivanova  Dostoevsky s heavy religious beliefs also come out to play with the progression of the story  However  the symoblism and imagery all remain vivid and apparent and absolutely worth the reading  It leaves you thinking for days beyond  I think I d like to come back to it in a few year s time  and see how my thoughts have changed  So glad I ve had this recommended to me many times over  and now  I pass that on to you  Well  this made me think  but that s a good thing  right  Raskolnikov frustrated me    why did he do this  When would he confess  WOuld he ever feel remorse  My questions were all answered  and I made my peace with him  I loved the minor characters  Sonya  Porfiry  Dunya   I read the women s stories were added to this plot  and I appreciated it  The scenes with Porfiry reminded me of  Law and Order  at its best  What wonderful ideas were discussed and argued  I think Sonya will lead Raskolnikov to redemption  but as Dostoevsky says   But that is the beginning of another story   A temporal yet eternal classic  One sees Dostoyevsky at his best as he delves into the psychology of criminal and the notions of crime  The classic is a journey into the world of the mind  Reality spills into nightmares  dreams pervade reality  You rise and fall  see and feel  cry and chide with the characters  A must in all bookshelves especially the ones who love psycho analyzing the human mind  One of my all time favourites  Awesome  It s sort of incredible how far off the rails Dostoevsky flies with this novel s last sentence  Up until that point  Crime and Punishment is an amazing book  Taut  suspenseful  and packed with memorable characters  it s a fun read that s faster than it s often given credit for  it s also  of course  written with the reader s brain in mind  dropping in moral dilemmas and philosophical quandaries with confidence and ease  Raskolnikov s nihilism feels so real  but so does his desire to do some good for the world  and so does his pull between the two polarized emotions  It s an astonishing work up until that very end  that very last line  but then Dostoevsky has to turn it into a message novel  at the expense of pretty much everything that came before it  The character shatters  the complexity vanishes in favor of an easy out Still five stars  but that s just a free one   I absolutely loved Crime and Punishment  It is a story about a murderer who tries to defy his conscience in order to surpass the law and prove that he is an extraordinary man  like his idol  Napoleon  who he believed was a genius  and therefore was not bound by societal restrictions   However  he ultimately realizes he does not fall into this category and that eventually guilt overrides will  I love how Dostoevsky shows that the true punishment of a crime is not one that society impels on us  but one of our own   the mental torment  guilt  and paranoia that is part of the human conscience  I found myself asking so many questions as I was reading  which was unusual because I knew who the murderer was just from the first few pages  One of my favorite things about this novel was the psychological game both Raskolnikov  the main character  and the reader go through as the side plots unfold and all somehow tie back together in the end  Every time I picked up Crime and Punishment  I was completely immersed in Raskolnikov s world  I could picture everything vividly and I felt like I was on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the story   hating Raskolnikov one moment  and feeling sorry for him the next  It was like a soap opera  This book is fantastic  I would recommend it to everyone  I hope I will read it one day in Russian  but I am so happy I chose to read it this summer  Un grande  immenso ed incredibile romanzo  In  Delitto e Castigo  Dostoevskij riversa tutto il proprio genio il quale non verte solo sull ambito letterario  ma si avvale anche di profonde conoscenze filosofiche  politiche  psicologiche e sociali Sono molto orgogliosa di questa lettura  dopo un inizio zoppicante e complicato stavo quasi per gettare la spugna  pensavo  ma e possibile che questo tanto decantato romanzo sia tutto qui    non ho ceduto alla voglia che avevo di uscire da quelle atmosfere cupe e soffocanti e mi sono imposta di finirlo  Questa sensazione di costrizione alla lettura e pero durata poco  anzi pochissimo  E  stato impossibile per me resistere al richiamo febbrile di queste pagine che si sono susseguite con una curiosita e morbosita poche volte provata soprattutto in una lettura definita  classica   niente di piu sbagliato nel descrivere quest opera E  una di quelle letture che non possono lasciarti indifferente  che volente o nolente una volta portata a termine ti lascia il cervello sottosopra e la voglia di rovesciare tutte le tue convinzioni per dimostrare che nulla nella vita e statico e inerte  In  Delitto e Castigo  si rappresenta la natura dell animo umano nei suoi istinti piu estremi  eternamente in bilico tra il bene e il male  fra giusto e sbagliato  dubbi rappresentati perfettamente dal popolo russo soggetto ideale per simboleggiare questa umanita variegata  Una girandola di ubriachi  pazzi  idioti  suicidi  miserabili e lussuriosi animano una fosca San Pietroburgo oppressa da un afa che traspira attraverso le pagine e ti soffoca  evento chiave dell intero romanzo e un duplice omicidio per mano di Raskolnikov che avviene nelle primissime pagine e che vede come vittime una vecchia usuraia e sua sorella E  lecito uccidere una persona per fini superiori  Raskolnikov  imbevuto di idee superomistiche  ne e fermamente convinto  parte dal presupposto che gli uomini si dividano in due categorie  quella inferiore  gli uomini comuni  cioe  per cosi dire  il materiale che serve unicamente per la procreazione di altri esseri simili a se  e gli uomini veri e propri  aventi cioe il dono o la capacita di dire nel loro ambiente una parola nuova  In nome di questa differenza di genere  gli uomini di valore possono commettere ogni sorta di delitti e trasgredire la legge al contrario di quelli comuni che sono tenuti all obbedienza e al rispetto delle regole  Ci porta l esempio di Napoleone  al quale sono state perdonate le guerre  le stragi affinche perseguisse i suoi obiettivi  e giustificabile tutto cio  Chi ci da il diritto di giudicare quali scopi sono condannabili    Secondo me  se le scoperte di Keplero e di Newton  per qualche combinazione  in nessuna maniera avessero potuto divenir note agli uomini altrimenti che col sacrificio della vita di uno  di dieci  di cento persone e via dicendo  che impacciassero quella scoperta  o che si fossero messe sulla sua strada come un ostacolo  allora Newton avrebbe avuto il diritto  e sarebbe perfin stato in obbligo    di eliminare quelle dieci o cento persone  per far note le sue scoperte a tutta l umanita   L introspezione psicologica e talmente profonda che e impossibile non trovarsi d accordo con queste riflessioni  e sta qui tutto il genio di Dostoevskij che in mette in scena la rappresentazioni delle piu intime e sordide pulsioni dell animo umano  Ogni personaggio rappresenta non solo un carattere ma un idea Sonja  personificazione dell amore  Svidrigailov  lussurioso e abbietto  Razumichin che rappresenta il buon senso e la lealta  c e la famiglia Marmeladov a raffigurare l umanita piu misera e sciagurata  La costruzione della trama e lineare e perfetta verso un crescendo di angoscia e disperazione  Il protagonista Raskolnikov  attorno alla cui figura ruota tutto un mondo di uomini disperati  puri  gretti  meschini  oppure lucidi  perversi o giusti  e megalomane e spietato ma la sua enorme sofferenza  fa si che si senta pieta per lui e si speri nella sua espiazione L epilogo e meravigliosamente triste quanto ideale perche non c e delitto senza castigo Un libro che lascia turbati e scossi dalla profondita e verita delle vicende narrate  un capolavoro che tutti dovrebbero leggere e che non puo lasciare indifferenti Amo Dostoevskij  con tutto il cuore  Delitto e Castigo  per me e stato una conferma nei suoi riguardi  per voi  se siete ancora dei profani  spero sia l inizio di un nuovo amore  A primeira vez que li Crime e Castigo eu devia ter uns dezesseis para dezessete anos  porque foi no periodo entre fazer o vestibular e comecar a faculdade   o que so aconteceu no segundo semestre      e foi paixao a primeira vista  Eu me lembro muito bem da sensacao de espanto  fascinio e encantamento desse primeiro contato e devo dizer que numa releitura  a historia nao perde nada de sua forca Publicada em 1866   um ano antes do primeiro volume de O Capital de Marx   ainda e um livro atual  que ecoa com nossas proprias crencas e experiencias  uma obra prima de um escritor que praticamente so escreveu obras primas  grande mesmo entre os maiores classicos que o genio humano foi capaz de produzir Alem de tudo  ao contrario do criterio de alguns criticos que parecem considerar que a qualidade de uma obra e diretamente proporcional a dificuldade de compreensao e hermetismo da narrativa  Crime e Castigo tem uma linguagem extremamente fluida  sendo acessivel e aberto a uma miriade de interpretacoes  O fato de Dostoievski ter escrito esse calhamaco as pressas  premido por dividas e editores   e ainda assim ter feito uma das melhores pecas literarias de que se tem noticia   e so a cereja do bolo Agora conheca Raskolnikov  o protagonista deste calhamaco  Um jovem que abandonou os estudos   ex estudante  nas palavras do autor  a despeito de ser considerado inteligente   ate genial em sua propria consideracao    vivendo miseravelmente num lugar e numa epoca em que essa e regra  nao excecao Raskolnikov vive entre extremos  neurotico em momentos  apatico em outros  cheio de energia e planos e em seguida prostrado e deprimido  Enquanto caminha sem direcao pelas ruas de Sao Petersburgo  coleciona outras historias de tristeza   como a de Marmeladov  cuja filha foi obrigada pela madrasta a se prostituir para poder prover a familia  ou a de sua propria irma  Dounia  que se obrigou a trabalhar para os Svidrigailov a despeito do chefe da familia assedia la  uma vez que teve de pedir dinheiro emprestado a ele para poder ajudar o proprio Raskolnikov Preso entre o desejo de ajudar  de fazer a diferenca e sua propria incapacidade de levar a cabo um projeto  o jovem cria teorias que possam lhe dar a coragem de tomar uma atitude extrema  partindo do principio de que o mundo esta dividido entre pessoas ordinarias  a quem cabem as leis e a obediencia e as extraordinarias  que nao estavam sujeitas as convencoes sociais Sustentado pela conviccao de que e uma dessas pessoas extraordinarias e apos algumas tentativas frustradas  Raskolnikov visita a velha usuraria Alyona Ivanovna e racha o cranio da velha a machadadas para entao roubar seu dinheiro e com ele poder afinal ser o altruista a que aspirava Nao demora contudo para que Raskolnikov perceba que nao e uma pessoa extraordinaria a quem tudo e permitido ainda que suas intencoes sejam boas  A culpa e esmagadora o suficiente para que ele adoeca  chegando a beira da loucura  ate encontrar expiacao atraves de Sonia  a filha prostituta de Marmeladov A despeito do homicidio de Alyona  e da irma desta  que chega em momento inoportuno   Raskolnikov e genuinamente bom  Ele tem suas muitas falhas  inclusive de carater  e e ridiculamente ingenuo  mas a despeito do sangue em suas maos  ele e inocente Nao inocente do assassinato que comete  claro   e pelo qual tem de assumir a responsabilidade ou perder a propria sanidade    mas inocente do mundo  Dostoievski criou nele um personagem que e contraditorio  crivel e com que somos capazes de nos identificar a despeito de seus feitos  de seus crimes E nao se trata apenas de Raskolnikov  De uma forma geral  todos os personagens do romance tem sua importancia  seu momento de triunfo   e suas proprias tragedias  E  se nao ha finais felizes  resta ao menos esperanca  As a Dostoevsky virgin  my mind   soul was thoroughly pounded  lacerated  and left gaping open  It s a long journey with Raskolnikov  but one that I never found dull   If you have never read Russian literature  prepare yourself  Yes  the names are tricky  but get over it  Fyodor gets you wrapped into the World of the main character and you really do feel like you are going to go crazy by the end of the book  It s a fun read if you take the time to enjoy the mind games that are played with you  the characters  and the Russian people  This is my all time favorite book ever  I ve read it three times  and I have never found a book so compelling  Yes  the main story of murder is interesting  but it is the rest of the story that really catches my attention  Sonia  her family  and Raskolnikoff s need for redemption are wonderful  Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyAudio CDPublished 1991 by Audio Adventures  first published 1866  Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind    Epilogue Raskolnikov is born in Dostoevsky s mind and he ll become the image of the modern hero  or the post modern hero   Beyond the Romantic hero  where individual thoughts  forgetting faiths  religions  etc   leads toward winning results  Raskolnikov s character is beyond the will of power  beyond the good and the evil  he is looking for life without theories  Crime and Punishment s alchemy  Dostoevsky gathers together his characters to create a scene where people  like chemical substances  react involving a transformation  Crime and Punishment reflects the classical elements  Earth  Water  Air  and Fire An idea  Raskolnikov is the image of the Earth  Sonia suggests Water  Razumihkin Air  and Crime Fire Crime working as Fire is an element that destroy  change  and it s the root of a new life  Razumihkin is the element who brings freshness to the other characters  and works like the air intruding in a stifling room  Sonia suggests water   more heavy than air  Like Razumihkin Sonia brings cleanness  and works like the water of a river carrying Raskolnikov towards a new life  as before  without theories  Raskolnikov reminds Earth  Dostoevsky was an adherent to the current  pocvennicestvo   a word coming from  pocva   which means soil or earth   The main idea of pocvennicestvo was the bond between pocva   earth and Russian people  a bond with the return to popular principles rooted in the soil   It took forever to finish it but absolutely worth every single minute of my time reading this book   This book should be a rite of passage for everyone at that coming of age point in their life  It reminds you to hold back the reins of your ego  because you re not as important as you might think you are I m grateful that I encountered this book as a teenager  As an adult  it d just be weird  That s how I felt reading Camus and Hugo  Like I was ten years too old to be listening to something so petty and childish  Probably the best book I have ever read  Although it s nearly impossible for an avid reader to pick a favorite  I would say this one certainly sits very high at the top of my list  Yet another epic tale of sin and redemption  this one keeps you on the edge of your seat  I read it in college and I remember not wanting to even go to sleep  Just wanted to keep reading  It s extremely detailed and fluid  so vivid that you can actually visualize the scenes as they take place  Makes a very strong emotional impact  For anyone who is a lover of books I recommend reading this at some point in your lifetime   Dostoievski es lo maximo    Tengo que darme el tiempo para escribir una resena en forma  por ahora acabo de terminarlo y estoy conmovida y emocionada  Es increible lo moderno que es  al final el heroe de el libro empieza por asesinar a dos personas sin arrepentirse  y de ahi todo lo que ocurre es Dostoievski en su mas puro estado  lo amooooo    Tengo que escribir algo mas tranquila  estoy cansada y es medio tarde  asi que mejor me voy a dormir   Immoral deeds doesn t always guarantee the decimation of a person s overall moral fiber  The bad act itself is the definition of what exists or had existed  General forgiveness is never guaranteed for the offender  but sympathy goes a long way  It always amazes me how violence begets such an optimistic twist  We all screw up  some worst then others  it just sucks to be the victim because you can t screw up like the guy who screwed you over and then be forgiven or sympathized  Plus  this translation is pretty solid  Bellissimo    Un libro che offre tantissimi spunti di riflessione e che mi ha lasciato carica di emozioni contrastanti  E  stata una lettura quasi dolorosa  divorata con brama  e dalla quale non riuscivo a staccare gli occhi  Il finale prima dell epilogo e stato un colpo al cuore  da una parte ci sono rimasta malissimo  e il primo Dostoevskij che leggo e l avrei preferito piu cinico e cattivo  Cio nonostante questo romanzo e un capolavoro    I read perhaps six other books between starting and finishing this one  but not because it was a slow read  It called for no distractions  The characters all have flaws  and rationalize them away as virtues  They aren t the cliched  tragic flaws   either  making very real characters  Dostoevsky is impressive in his demonstration of the merits and downfalls of various philosophies  6 5   v Muy buena  Rodion Rodion pudiste ser millonario   v jajaj Short and sweet    My favorite book of all time    Crime and Punishment  makes thinking about philosophical puzzles fun  can an evil deed be evil if it leads to a greater good  Should the insane be held accountable for their actions  I d put this in the top ten novels I ve enjoyed reading  it s fantastic I didn t give the novel 5 stars because I wish the epilogue didn t exist  I feel that it simplifies the novel s resolution  and mostly takes away from Sonya s character   view spoiler   I love how  at the end of the novel  Sonya asserts herself over Raskolnikov  She refuses to be emotionally and verbally bullied by him and commands him to his salvation confession  She becomes one dimensional in the epilogue when she follows him to Siberia because she treats all criminals with the same compassion  I wish he d have left us simply with the knowledge that  by the end of the novel  she d gained independence  Instead  the epilogue renders her into pure goodness and selflessness and takes away some of the sad  dark and beautiful sides to her    hide spoiler   This has been my favorite book since I was 17  It won t speak to everyone  and I wouldn t recommend it to everyone  The main character  a poor student living away from his family in the city  is driven by destructive hubris and acts on impulses that feel very real to me  Even as a teenager  my heart ached for him and even more so now when I recognize how long lifetime regrets really last  His lapses in judgement change the course of his life  but love redeems anything and everything   I don t recommend locking yourself in a room and reading this until you feel as though the walls are closing in on you  Yes  it was uncomfortable to get through  All of the characters present a dark air of morose shame  They all lack dignity and awareness in empathy  sympathy  direct and naturally understood human tendencies  But in the end  its that darkness  hidden in between the characters own understanding in their self destruction  that creates an all too questionable tinge of familiarity  One time  I had a boyfriend who became obsessed with this book  He grew a beard and started carrying an axe around  I was a little worried  but it was wintertime and my house had two fire places and he cut a lot of wood for me  I loved this book by the first chapter  back in my senior year  because instead of the tired who dunnit set up in novels  here you have the lead character  basically explaining that he is the murderer of this story and he s going about things afterwards  trying not to be caught  I remember thinking  how friggin  intelligent this guy  to write the story this way  All I can say  is even if the names throw you off and the length  it s one of those books that once you ve read it to the end  you won t have regretted it  I had to read it for school  but I ended up loving doing the homework for it because it had me totally entranced the trials this man went through  An awesome read and one I will share with my son   Taxi Driver  The Catcher in the Rye  and Black Swan all chronicle the main character s descent into madness  However  Crime and Punishment is the best of the lot  I love the way Raskolnikov rationalizes his increasingly indefensible actions   Un gran libro  estudia totalmente el alma de un hombre y te deja sentir la angustia y soberbia que nos acecha  aside from the crime in question  there isn t much action in this book  it s a study of internal guilt  consisting mainly of raskolnikov s inner monologue  and it s a mark of dostoevsky s skill that  crime and punishment  is still riveting  Dostoyevsky reveals the possibility of inducing a moral nature in even the worst crime committers  who are also humans themselves  I was intrigued when reading how a character s jail sentence was reduced from serving lifetime to merely a few years  This book was eye opening and made me question whether or not we ought to value rehabilitation over retribution of the imprisoned  and what is truly the most productive optimized option for society in general  which is to balance both aspects of punishment  I read this book like 8 years ago in high school and love it  I had to put it up b c it s one of my favorites  I m a realistically happy person  but I love the character development  the irony  the sadness  and the misery of it all  Must read  After finishing this classic I was saying to myself when is the next book that tells me what happens later  And then it hit me that this was written in the 1800s  Great book that has endured time   I just re read Crime and Punishment  but this time I read the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky  They are award winning translators for a very good reason  I appreciate their footnotes  explaining what is lost in translation  particulalry play on words  use of rhyme and significance of names   I loved this book  I had to read it over the summer for a course I m taking  and thoroughly enjoyed it  Dostoyevsky follows Raskolnikov s moral journey as he deals with the repercussions of his arrogant crime  but not in an overly preachy or even emotional way  That objectivity in the face of an incredibly complex dilemma allowed Dostoyevsky to establish themes in all of the book s many layers  and I am positive that my class s discussion of it hardly scratched the surface of all there is to glean from this amazing work  Two women are hacked to death with an axe and some valuables stolen from their apartment  The killer  Rodion Raskolnikov  is at first trapped in the apartment when two men knock at the door and refuse to go away  After a suspenseful few minutes Raskolnikov manages to escape unseen  The mystery then becomes not who did it  because most of the book is written from the killer s point of view  but which of two forces will ultimately be his undoing  the police or his dark  deranged mind that leads him to alternately wander the streets at night or hold up in his claustrophobic apartment while suffering fever  fainting and fantastic dreams After the murder  which takes place in mid nineteenth century St  Petersburg  Russia  Raskolnikov s mother and beautiful sister Dunya arrive from the country followed by the sister s manipulative fiancee who Raskolnikov insults at their first meeting  Raskolnikov s sister is also pursued by a lecherous former employer bent on having Dunya one way or the other  Soon a casual alcoholic acquaintance of Raskolnikov dies and sends his family into hysterics while the drunk s self effacing daughter  who has become a prostitute to support the family  catches Raskolnikov s eye In this edition s foreword  translator Richard Pevear compares the book to the Hindu parable of the blind men describing an elephant each by touching a different part  and indeed the subplots mentioned above head in different directions all held together by Raskolnikov  So rather than explore all of Dostoevsky s complex characters  his overlapping themes  historical and literary allusions  let s look at the book simply as a murder story Even though we know whodunit  the murder investigation and the exploration of Raskolnikov s psyche is anything but straightforward  A handsome young man in his early 20s  Raskolnikov is an impoverished  sickly former law student dressed in rags  He lives in a garret or tiny flat and is afraid to run into his landlady because he s behind on the rent  He develops a scheme to kill and rob an elderly pawnbroker which he does early in the novel  He also kills the pawnbroker s sister who drops in unexpectedly  The crime accomplished  the majority of the book focuses on the punishment which takes place largely in Raskolnikov s head While he may regret the crime for what it may cost him  he doesn t regret taking the life of someone he considers worthless  Getting rid of the miserable crone was a favor to society  The sister simply became  in modern vernacular  collateral damage  Taking a view that separates mankind into the  ordinary and the extraordinary  Raskolnikov feels he is above most men and that the extraordinary ones may transcend conventional morality if the betterment of society is at stake  As it quickly becomes obvious  Raskolnikov is far from a level headed polemic  Either his wacky moral beliefs are not enough to assuage his seeping guilt  or he s on the verge of madness and all bets based on logic  even a twisted one  are off  As mentioned  he wanders the streets having extended conversations with himself about his crime  his pursuers and a strange notion that since he s committed a crime he is now free to do good deeds for others  for society  But even when he donates some of his limited money  he seems to reinforce his appearance of derangement Hot on Raskolnikov s trail is Porfiry Petrovich  a police detective who seems to understand the complex psychological aspects of the young man s motivations  A pudgy official of 35  his method of dealing with Raskolnikov is essentially to give him enough rope as the crime cliche says  but perhaps this method was not as commonplace when the book was published in 1866  In a masterful scene slightly beyond the halfway point of the book  Raskolnikov is summoned to Petrovich s office where the detective lays out  in theoretical terms  what a perfectly solved murder case might involve  while he professes to be an awkward investigator     suppose there is evidence sir    he tells Raskolnikov  but evidence  my dear  is mostly double ended  and I am an investigator and therefore  I confess  a weak man  I would like to present my investigation with  so to speak  mathematical clarity  I would like to get a hold of a piece of evidence that s something like two times two is four  Something like direct and indisputable proof  But if I were to lock him  a suspect  up at the wrong time  even though I m sure it was him  I might well deprive myself of the means of his further incrimination  Petrovich even admits his interrogation techniques are clumsy  but he uses a telling metaphor  Tell me  really  who among all the accused  even the most cloddish peasant doesn t know  for instance  that they  investigators  will first lull him with unrelated questions  to use your happy expression  and then suddenly stun him right on the head  with an axe    Again talking theoretically  Petrovich tells Raskolnikov that in some cases letting a suspect think that he knows his inner secrets and that he  the suspect  is being followed day and night will push the suspected person into making fatal mistakes Although Petrovich seems to be talking abstractedly  his message unnerves Raskolnikov to the point where he tells himself he d like to  hurl himself at Porfiry and strangle him on the spot   Near the climax of the scene  Raskolnikov pounds his fist on the table and shouts   Don t taunt me  I won t have it  The case against Raskolnikov is not assured  however  compounded by another person s confessing to the crime and the possibility that Raskolnikov may be completely loony so that the  cat and mouse game   Petrovich s words  proceeds with unexpected turns throughout the novel If anything in this book sounds familiar  it s because mystery and suspense writers have had nearly 150 years to read Dostoevsky and benefit from his insights  copy his style or simply lift ideas  The book is filled with what has become standard detective story fare  the killer returning to the scene of the crime  a protracted search for the best place to hide the loot  paranoia over being followed  frantic attempts to remove all blood stains  confiding the crime in secret to a girlfriend  a hooker with a heart of gold   the criminal s belief that he s somehow entitled to his plunder and a detective seeking a confession  Petrovich s roundabout interrogation of Raskolnikov sounds remarkably like the bumbling yet savvy Lieutenant Columbo  Peter Falk  from the TV series of the 1970s and 80s It would be a mistake to call this the original hardboiled detective book  but the mood and the settings are decidedly grim  The characters populate cramped  oppressive rooms decorated with faded  pealing wallpaper and frayed furniture  Many are dressed in ragged clothes  have little or no money and  with a few exceptions  bleak prospects  Suspicion  shame and fear are common and the dirty city streets are filled with falling down drunks  One particularly dark scene describes a horse being beaten to death in the street in front of cheering onlookers when it fails to pull an intentionally overloaded wagon Raskolnikov s extended  abstract inner dialogs can become a little mind numbing  and complicating the read is the custom of Russians to be called by their last names sometimes  or their first two names  or sometimes a nickname  Within the same paragraph a character can be referred to by several different names  a challenge to English speaking readers  These issues aside  it s easy to see why this novel is a towering classic  It s a powerful story  with complex characters  a strong emotional  and intellectual base  and an engrossing blueprint for the crime novels that followed it           E book notes This print version of the novel has many useful footnotes explaining aspects of Russian culture and language  historical and geographical references  plus relevant elements of the author s background  It also contains a foreword by one of the two renown translators and a useful character list with a guide to pronunciation of the names This novel also appears in an e book collection of all of the author s work  translated by Constance Garnett  that was available for the Kindle  All of the novels were combined in the file  making the percentage read gage and word search all but useless  According to the Amazon Web site  Dostoevsky s books  also translated by Garnett  are now available separately  and free Cinema notes According to imdb com  there are no fewer than 30 Crime and Punishment films  many produced in other countries  The most recent US production was a 2002 film starring Vanessa Redgrave  John Hurt and Crispin Glover  A 1935 version starred Edward Arnold as Porfiry Petrovich and Peter Lorre as Raskolnikov  Crime   PunishmentVery complex characters  passionate  interesting  I somehow related to each on a personal level  Author did a great job at portraying people as most are  neither fully good or fully evil  Glad I read it  ghy bry m pysh myyd khh frd nshnsy r my bynym khh mshhdh anh mmkhn st dr m thr dshth bshd w Hty qbl z ynkhh ykh khlm b hm Hrf bznym bTrf w khshydh my shwym  I read this book towards the end of my senior year in high school as a required reading  and this is the only required reading I enjoyed  This book introduced me to the idea of nihilism which I was completely unfamiliar with  I remember a debate we had in class about when it was  right  to kill  and no one was in agreement  Written in the Russian tradition  the translated work brings the feeling and emotion in a raw form so that the reader takes on the feelings of the character  the time period  and the mood of the book  It was some time ago that I read this but it s in my top five favourite books  My impression of it was as if watching a movie that was in colour but barely  i e   the colours were muted  I will soon read it again  This book  3333333  Classics  is a big word for artworks that are widely recognized by expertise  in another words  amateurs need to be educated before they can fully appreciate it  Russian literature classics are especially the case as they have a reputation of being  long and boring   probably a reputation gained from  War and Peace    Therefore  it took me certain amount of courage to start reading Dostoyevsky and I m glad I did  Crime and Punishment  is a  classic  that most people can understand and enjoy  It is a psychological thriller of how a murderer struggled with his conscience  Dostoevsky told us that nothing could defeat conscience  not reasons  not laws and not even God  No matter who you are and how  logical  your action was  conscience will haunt you until the ultimate redemption  The  I know you know that I know you know  mind game between Raskolnikov and Zamyotov was intriguing  Yet  the psychological transformation of our hero  or anti hero  Raskolnikov is just incredible  Those years of exile in Siberia didn t break Dostoevsky but only enriched his experiences   Jag tyckte att det var en valdigt intressant bok  Det ar en fascinerande resa genom Raskolnikovs angerfulla resa efter att ha begatt ett mord  Boken ar valdigt lang  men vard all den tid den tar   Extraordinarily well done in every way  In turn highly dramatic and phenomenally suspenseful  I find it difficult to decide whether this or  The Brothers Karamazov   both of which offer exciting story lines and unforgettable characters  is the greater literary achievement by Dostoyevsky  But of the two I d say that this is the more easily accessible  Un capolavoro assoluto E  lungo  in varie parti e pesantissimo  ma superati gli ostacoli diventa un libro fantastico Consiglio a tutti di non saltare lo scritto finale di Pasolini  non so in quali edizioni e presente    che e interessante e aiuta a comprendere meglio la psicologia del protagonista principale Poi  che dire   e bellissimo  Non posso far altro che ringraziare infinitamente l amico che me l ha regalato  Incredible  Features the most realistic murder scene of all time and then explores the nature of good and evil and Nietzschen ideas of the superman  By the end it s beautiful and heart breaking   It is not often that a great work lives up to its hype  but this book  God  this book is absolutely brilliant  This is hardly a book about the story  The simple plot of which  could have easily fit in a mere hundred pages  or maybe even less  Instead it explores human psychology  the inner workings of the mind of a criminal  of a man who doesn t necessarily think like the rest of us I did not take to the characters immediately  but I do feel a connection to Raskolnikov  our protagonist   I don t particularly agree with him everywhere  and he is specially insufferable  but when he says something that I do agree with  it hits all the right points As for the women in this book  they are very powerful  They have a quiet strength  and the moments when this strength is shown were possibly my favourites The characters that bothered me the most were the police  namely Porfiry  From a standpoint view  Raskolnikov s idea of his crime doesn t bother me in the least  it wasn t a human being I killed  it was a principle But how can the very people who are supposed to be focused on helping the public  concentrate more on the criminals themselves  What is this idea of letting a criminal run loose  because then he will make a mistake at some point and bam  you ll have him for good  Yes  you ll have the criminal for good  but isn t it the victims that should matter more  In fact this seems to be a theme in the book  Nobody gives a shit about any victims of any crime   I no longer suck at the pronunciation of Russian names   Okay  that s a lie  I suck less    I now more firmly believe that the more intelligent you are  the more miserable you will be  unless something as fleeting  or perhaps as powerful as love makes itself known to you   Lessons learned  ALWAYS  ALWAYS pick up a Pevear and Volokhonsky translation  It s a hard book to review  The reason being it s written so intellectually  that one would need to re read it over a period of time  And every time you do that  it won t fail to refresh your outlook towards the human character or existentialism  You are missing out on some fantastic work if you have happened to ignore this writer and his books  The story primarily focuses on Raskolnikov  a young student who murders his old pawnbroker and then gets spiraled into suffering  mental trauma eventually leading to confession and redemption  However  the book has so much more  I felt that the way the supporting characters crawl from being really external  to Raskolnikov and to his mind  on to becoming an integral part of the entire story  has been beautifully brought by the writer  Porfiry and Raskolnikov s interactions never failed to provoke  absorb and mentally stimulate me  And neither did the commentary  the conflicts within a person s mind  So accurate  rich and well written  The story is simple  yet not so easy to imbibe What I really failed to understand from the climax was that Raskolnikov ends up confessing  considering the fact it would eventually redeem him of his torment and act  The entire premise based on the fact that  suffering is a must  had got me really gripped  But his belief  whilst in Siberia  of not being able to get away with the murder and confessing to it  unlike Napoleon  and other superlative men  was his  mere crime   But would that mean that he admitted to the fact the he was in the category of ordinary men and not the superior race  the theory he himself had published  If no  then it disappoints me  Islenen sucun oncesinde degerli gayeleriniz olabilir  suc islendikten sonra ic dunyanizda ne gibi duygulara maruz kalacaginiz mechuldur  Actually  I m not a fan of realism  but this book is an exception  All this monotony  misery and depression of all characters kills the will to live  The infinite number of pages where nothing happens     But I can identify with Raskolnikov  understand him  sympathize with him  It gives a whole new aspect of crime and punishment  Anyone can recognize themselves at least in one part of this phenomenal novel  Love this book  Gripping  I first started this novel during my senior year of high school  I only now  over a decade later  picked it up again and finally finished it  I am glad I waited  Dostoyevsky s classic novel is worth the more serious treatment of a voluntary read  Dostoyevsky uses a young  naive protagonist to explore the nature of conscience and morality and take a rusty axe head repeatedly to the skull of the nihilism sweeping Russia at the time Raskolnikov is an impoverished  depression prone college dropout living in Petersburg  Crime and Punishment was published in 1866 and takes place contemporaneously  Desperate for money and convinced that some people  including Napoleon and  not surprisingly  himself  are above moral prohibitions on harming others  Raskolnikov decides to kill a miserly pawnbroker  He rationalizes that the benefit to the world from the good the money will allow him to do more than outweighs the harm to the world from the death of the old woman The bulk of the novel focuses on Raskolnikov s inner turmoil and tortured emotional journey after the murder  Raskolnikov s sister  his friend  and the daughter of a man he met by chance see him through his despair  It has to be incredibly difficult to write a novel without action to use as a crutch  but Dostoyevsky does so masterfully  This novel will leave you thinking long after you put it down and has made it on to the short list of novels that I can point to as forming an important part of my personal philosophy  The Orchard Keeper by Cormac McCarthy being another  One word of warning  the English translation produced a readable prose  but Russian naming conventions remain and a single character will be referred to by several different names at different times My edition was translated by Constance Garnett and includes an introduction by Joseph Frank that discusses Dostoyevsky s process in writing it and tries to give it a context within the Russia of that time  4 5This book was fascinating  The depth  complexity and variety of characters alongside a nicely done narration make this book exceptional  Actually  the main reason why i decided to write this  review  was just to emphasize that Porfiry Petrovich is one of the most interesting  smart and cunning characters that I ve ever come across in any book I ve read  The conversations between him and Raskolnikov are each a piece of art  However  the last page of this book completely changed everything for me  I was so glad that  finally  a main character has no romantic interest for anyone whatsoever  The whole vibe of the book was changed in just one page out of 500  Putting that aside  this book is phenomenal and I d recommend it to anyone interested in something smart  beautiful and mindblowing   now this is one hell of a book the main character opens the book by being sick and listening to this old woman nag at him  she doesn t stop  She s mean  A real Witch  In a moment of passion he grabs a candle stick and kills her She s dead   he runs out and leaves a mess everywhere  CSI would destroy him   then all of a sudden no one catches him   he cant  believe it   he has to live with his guilt He gets away with the crime This book is sick  its so awesome   Probably one of my favorite books    I d say a masterpiece  Iniziato due anni fa e mai completato  non per motivi letterari  ma esclusivamente personali  La vita a volte impone delle distrazioni   Che dire  Splendido Dostoevskij  come sempre  Inconfondibile stile  approfondimento della psiche umana in tutte le sue sfaccettature piu folli  doppie e imprevedibilmente incoerenti    Scorrevole e  semplice  rispetto al tomone dei Karamazov con cui l ho imparato a conoscere quasi quattro anni fa  Piu che altro  meno personaggi e meno diramazioni nelle vicende  Forse per questo ancora piu godibile  perche mi ha permesso di appropriarmene appieno  Dostoevsky s Crime and Punishment is a shockingly intimate tale of a murder and a murderer  Raskolnikov is a man seemingly on the brink of madness as he plots and carries out a grisly killing  Although he evades the police  Raskolnikov s dark deed weighs heavily on him  The aftermath of his crime takes the young man on a journey through the range of human emotion and experience  Good and evil  guilt and redemption  agony and joy  this novel is an invitation to explore and question many of the ideas and judgments we take for granted If you enjoy pondering the grey areas of life and the thorny end of morality  this book covers it extremely well  After reading Tolstoy s enriching portrayal of St Petersburg in the 19th century  it was engrossing to read about the grittier side of Russian society    Videoresena aqui Todos los veranos me propongo un reto en lo que a lecturas se refiere  Bueno  no todos  puede que este ano haya sido el primero  pero  que mas da  Por lo general suelo decir lo tipico de  este verano aprovechare para leer mucho mas de lo que he podido leer durante el curso   Sin embargo  estas vacaciones la cosa cambio  Dado que gran parte de mi tiempo libre iba a pasarlo metida en la biblioteca  estudiando para recuperar las asignaturas que me habian quedado para septiembre  el tema de la lectura estaba un poco mas complicado  Lo unico que se me ocurrio ante tal panorama fue  no retarme a leer tropecientos mil libros  sino a comenzar Crimen y castigo de Dostoievski y acabarlo antes de la llegada del otono La edicion con la que yo contaba era del Circulo de Lectores del ano de Maria Castana  lo que implicaba que las letras eran minusculas y que el interlineado todavia no habia sido descubierto  Lejos de echarme para atras estos pequenos detalles  me entraron mas ganas de leerlo  de demostrarme que podia con un tocho asi  Sin embargo  y ahora es cuando me quito el poco merito que tiene leer al senor Friodor   todo fue coser y cantar  muy en contra de que pensaba en un principio Si bien la primera parte  hay seis en total  se me hizo algo pesada  fue pasara a la segunda y sentir una urgencia irrefrenable por saber que pasaba a continuacion  por conocer cual iba a ser el siguiente movimiento de Raskolnikov  Y es que  a pesar de lo minusculas que podrian ser las letras y de lo extenso del libro  la historia que narra atrapa casi desde el primer hachazo que el protagonista le da a la vieja usurera  Dostoievski traza una senda a traves de las distintas fases emocionales y psicologicas que Rodia atraviesa tras llevar a cabo el asesinato  y lo hace de manera magistral  como solo un genio sabe hacerlo Crimen y castigo no es un libro en el cual vayamos a encontrarnos con una trama digna de novela negra  desde el principio se sabe quien  como y cuando ha llevado a cabo el asesinato  Lo que Crimen y castigo hace es conducirnos a traves de la psicologia de un personaje extremadamente misantropo con unos aires de grandeza que ve como poco a poco su talento se va consumiendo entre las cuatro paredes de la ruinosa habitacion que alquila con el poco dinero que sus madre y hermana pueden mandarle  El castigo al que hace referencia el titulo no es otro que el castigo que el mismo Raskolnikov se impone de manera inconsciente  la sensacion de nerviosismo  de desprecio  de confusion que tiene en todo momento  la necesidad de autoconvencerse de que todo va bien  de que no tiene nada que temer aunque sabe que el mas leve indicio puede llevarlo directo al fracaso Pero no todo queda en el protagonista  en torno a el giran otros personajes de igual complejidad  cada uno con sus propias cargas y pesares  Sonia  Razumijin  Dunia    y Svidigrailov  Este ultimo aparece casi al final de la novela y desempena un papel decisivo en ella  Es el antagonista que no llega a ser del todo malvado  hasta sus actos resultan humanos si nos paramos a reflexionar sobre ellos  sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta cual es su final y lo amargo de este La verdad es que me alegro de haberme propuesto leer este libro antes del 21 de septiembre  aunque haya apurado hasta el dia antes   porque Crimen y castigo es una obra redonda  se mire por donde se mire  Like the Colossos of Rhodes   Crime and Punishment  is a giant that straddles two shores   the enlightened romanticism of the Napoleonic era  and the terror of Nietzche s Ubermann inherent in the theories of the early twentieth century totalitarian regimes  Both are encapsulated in the central character  Raskolinkov  Deprived by circumstance and deluded by theory  he commits murder  The crime shatters his world view  Raskolnikov is a broken man  broken in spirit  broken in mind  nearly broken in body  and broken away from society  The misery and poverty of mid century St Petersburg is an appropriate setting for the exploration of  at times  perverse humanity  its propensity for wrong doing  its weakness and folly  and its dire need for redemption  Hope resides with the minor female characters who  despite their vulnerability and social inferiority  have the strength of character  faith  emotional resilience and moral discernment to rise above their difficulties and bring about a satisfying resolution  Alongside the passionate Dounia  and the long suffering Sonya  are presented two of the most despicable  and brilliantly created  villains  against whom the reader is able to assess Raskolnikov and his crime  The plot rambles  but is compelling and thought provoking in terms of its psychology  its drama  its humour and its pathos  Most outstanding of all is the compassion which lies at the novel s heart  and it is this quality which makes  Crime and Punishment  a fulfilling read  Se tivesse que fazer um top5  este livro estaria por la  assim como mais 20  o que seria ridiculo num top5  Sou um confesso apreciador de literatura Russa  este esta perto da perfeicao  Se classificasse um livro pelo prazer que da  este esta muito perto da perfeicao  This translation is a spectacular improvement on the Signet Classic edition I read long ago  The prose is more fluid  and the characters really come alive  To me the best part was that the humor that really shines through in this edition  balancing out the dark themes of manipulation and redemption  this book portrays man s suffering when faced and tormented with his own sin so well  i had a hard time getting through it but the painstaking time that the author took to spell out the intimate torment that the main character faces is amazing  he decribes it so succinctly is quite outstanding  Stirring detective story with an inverted role  readers are told the murderer s psyche as the cops conduct investigation  The story implies clash between extreme idealism and social norm  as well as cold rationality against compassion in the murderer s mind  In 19th century St Petersburg  a former law student commits a violent crime  motivating that his crime is justified  and laws don t apply for  more than ordinary people   He then becomes tormented by guilt and nightmares  as he slowly realizes that he s only an ordinary man and did wrong  A great psychological novel  with excellent dialogues between Raskolnikov and inspector Porfiry Petrovich  the main investigator  Ne denli zorlu bir ise girismek istiyorum  ama ayni zamanda da ne denli bos seylerden korkuyorum   sf 2 Butun sorun  toplumsal durum ve ona bagli geleneklerden kaynaklaniyordu   sf 507  Excelente novela del maestro ruso Fedor D  Con un crimen y una culpabilidad  un hombre se ve cercado por su propio remordimiento  Al leer el libro notaras cierto aire parecido al crimen de Christian Slatter  quien fue inculpado de un asesinato parecido  un hecho real   Libro altamente recomendable  A classic from the russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky  that makes you imagine the time of the age that this book was written  dramatic and hard to think how Raskolnikov   the principal character  lived at Saint Petersburg with his elevated poorness and his desperate situation Just a good russian classic  This book was my introduction to Russian authors   talk about jumping right in  Dark and moody  it explores the big questions of right and wrong and dealing with guilt  It s still one of my favorite books  but I haven t revisited in a long time and time might have changed that opinion  I doubt it

I read it  but now I m thinking I ll probably buy it for my personal library  This book is suspenseful and clever  and I can see why it s a classic  The internal monologues are interesting  unlike in some other Russian classics    cough cough   Dr Zhivago   cough    Dostoevsky s insight into the human mind is lasting and insightful  It is one of the classic put on the top of the must read books  I read it in College and gained lessons that I have retained throughout my life  I am rereading it and see things in a different light  Life is like that  Fydor has captured in his writing the true essence of the fragil nature of the human soul and his inability to deal with the perfect crime  Through the unfolding of the story he shows us how our own character  our soul  will handle the our moral decay  We will punish ourselves if given enough rope  By far the best piece of classic literature I have read till date   My edition is published by Bantam  paperback 472 pgSTIRRING  HOWEVER    one of the most depressing  dark and tedious reads ever Read again in 2009    same response as first read in 1966  ugh No modern thriller  psychological or criminal  TV or novel  can match the imprint and study of self examination that Raskolnikov s struggle will leave behind in the imagination of the reader   In Crime and Punishment  Fyodor Dostoyevsky explores the vagaries of a human mind  such as those that can drive a man to unimagined levels of insanity  The story s protagonist is a young University student called  Raskolnikov who believes that it is for ordinary men to live a life of submission  extraordinary men like him can commit any crime as long as it serves the greater good of the society  His overweening sense of pride is crushed to bits when he falls into an endless cycle of poverty with no one to help but an old friend called Razumihin  He is in this fragile mental state when he decides to murder an old pawnbroker who he compares to a louse and in his mind  he ll be serving the humanity by eliminating her  It is a coincidence then that he ends up murdering her half sister  too  Later in the story  even as he tries  he s not able to square with the ignominy of the brutal crime  He falls sick and is in constant delirium  to the extent of disowning his family and friends  And while he is languishing in guilt and shame  the police investigators begin to suspect him  a few of them even start to follow his movements  In the words of one of the characters   Do you understand  sir  do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn     for every man must have somewhere to turn     In the end  the protagonist has nowhere to turn  not even himself  question is  will he confess his crime  Will he finally find his peace  Crime and Punishment is a wonderful novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it  Dostoyevsky s novels are considered one of the best in existentialist literature  and I totally agree with that   Balzo in piedi e lo guardo tremando  ma subito  in quello stesso istante  capi tutto  Nei suoi occhi brillo una felicita infinita  capi  e per lei non ci fu piu alcun dubbio  egli l amava  l amava immensamente  alla fine  quel momento tanto atteso era arrivato     Mi sembra che il Dosto si distingua dagli altri per una caratteristica in particolare  la sua abilita nel parlare dell uomo  Cosa voglio dire  Mi riferisco alla sua sua capacita di presentarcelo cosi  inserito in un discorso  contestualizzato   sistemato  in maniera del tutto convincente e tale da farti chiudere il libro perfettamente soddisfatto  E  se questo e un aspetto che gia colpisce con forza incredibile nelle Memorie  trovo che sia questo il libro dove la sua maestria si manifesta apertamente  Raskolnikov  Sonja  Svidrigajlov sono drammi che esplodono con la precisione di bombe a orologeria  e con una potenza tale da imprimersi nella memoria per sempre  Leggetelo  um livro que nos prende ate ao fim  Nao se sabe que fim nos espera e que destino aguarda Rodia e outras personagens igualmente cativante  Aconselho vivamente pelo texto historia e otima traducao pelo menos da minha edicao de 1966  Don t do it Raskolnikov  Amazing just how readable this 200 year old book is  which is certainly a change from what I was expecting after reading 18th century British novels  To anyone who wants to pick up one of the Russian classics  but who s in doubt whether they will have a genuinely good time reading it or if it will be a purely academic exercise  I say don t hesitate  Although it is not a summer read  so maybe wait until autumn  E Sonha que coloca a pergunta definitiva para Raskolnikov  como viver depois de tamanho crime  Ate entao o protagonista nao tinha se dado conta de que ao comer o crime definitivo  tirar a vida de alguem  a vida moral se tornava impossivel  Ha um momento que ele critica duramente Svidrigailov por ter escutado uma conversa intima por tras da parede e este ri  como poderia ter direito de criticar um pecado menor quem tinha cometido o maior de todos  Um desnorteado Raskolnikov parecia nao perceber que ao se dar o direito de cometer um unico crime tinha aberto sua vida para todos os demonios e que jamais teria paz com suas propria consciencia Lembrei de um ensaio memoravel de Chesterton sobre MacBeth  Raskolnikov tambem se deixara levar pela maior das tentacoes  se permitir um unico ato vil  a remocao de um unico obstaculo  e depois seguir sua vida como se nada tivesse acontecido  retomando um caminho de moralidade  Chesterton observava que isso era uma ilusao  que ao abrir o caminho para o mal nao havia como manda lo de volta como se nada tivesse acontecido  que a tentacao de abrir essa porta novamente seria cada vez mais forte  Alerta Spoiler  Tanto para Chesterton  como para Dostoievsky  o unico caminho para retomar a sanidade depois de um crime capital era o arrependimento cristao  Alguem pode achar que e um arrependido Raskolnikov que se entrega a policia  mas nao e verdade  Ele o faz a contragosto  empurrado por Sonha e Dunia  e so quer se livrar daquele estado que o esta destruindo  Permanece acreditando que a velha usuraria era apenas uma pulga que merecia aquele destino  E so no epilogo  em um cena memoravel com Sonha  que se permite contemplar a verdade e sente a dor de seu crime  E ali que o arrependimento entra na vida de Raskolnikov e como Dostoievsky narra  nasce um homen novo  Nao e imediato  havera sete anos pela frente para uma reconstrucao  mas ele nao estara sozinho  tera sempre Sonha a seu lado para manter suas forcas  It s tough realizing that you re not as special as you think are  and that s what this book was all about for me  One of the great books that could never be turned into a movie because so much of it happens just in the protagonist s head  Not necessarily an easy read  but definitely necessary reading  I absolutely love this book  I know that may seem a bit weird  but when I first read it I couldn t believe how  sucked in  I got  I started rationalizing the murder in my mind and then I knew I was completely nuts  One of the best books ever written  Just brilliant  That is all   Crime and Punishment is a great book which I ve learned that things may not be as it seems  You can t judge people without trying to see from their perspective and doing empathy  The main character Raskolnikov is a great example for this  Everybody should read this book  especially the lawyers  judges and people who want to be one of them in the future  Come dovuta premessa devo dire che il mio sara soltanto un personalissimo commento che non ha nessunissima pretesa di essere un esauriente descrizione di questo libro  Non sarei proprio capace di parlarne  seriamente   Quindi quello che ho voluto fare e stato buttare giu due righe su quella che e secondo me la genesi di Delitto e castigo Questa genesi si lega nella mia immaginazione ad una figura mitologica chiamata Urizen  opera del genio di William Blake  Forse e stato proprio il cattolicesimo non religioso di Delitto e castigo a suggerirmi queste profane origini mitologiche  E  insomma  mi sono immaginata il demiurgo Urizen tra le sue reti e i suoi compassi  dapprima col compasso aveva delineato i limiti dell umano  poi con le reti gli umani li aveva proprio pescati  per non dire intrappolati  Non per cattiveria  essendo lui il demiurgo  il mondo l ha dovuto creare e agli uomini ha dovuto dare la ragione  in fondo  il suo nome si legge anche come  Your reason   oltre che essere molto somigliante a horizon  che sia proprio la nostra ragione dunque il nostro limite  il nostro orizzonte  Quando Urizen si immagino per la prima volta questo suo nome molto probabilmente gli venne in mente come una premonizione un uomo in particolare  di nome Raskolnikov  Infatti  quell uomo in futuro avrebbe tentato di chinarsi per raggiungere il potere  avrebbe cercato di non immaginarselo proprio quell orizzonte limitato     dalla ragione avrebbe ricavato logiche solo sue  idee cosi forti da spingere oltre  da divenire ossessioni  A questo punto per Urizen il gioco era fatto  Aveva premonito la vita del figlio  e nel momento stesso in cui la folgorazione gli aveva reso tutto chiaro  invece di iniziare a plasmare qualcosa come la felicita  decise che l uomo avrebbe avuto bisogno d altro  Quindi  dopo aver accantonato quella sostanza chiara fatta di beate ignoranze e di troppo lievi e poco consapevoli soddisfazioni  si volto senza alcun dubbio verso il suo scaffale prediletto  ne trasse un libro che parlava proprio di quell uomo  e lo getto giu nel mondo  Trattavasi proprio di Delitto e castigo  Nel momento in cui lo fece non condanno l uomo a perdere la serenita che doveva essere plasmata al posto del libro  La sua scelta significo la speranza che egli riponeva in una sfida  che qualcuno si sforzasse a superare lui  il suo nome  e perfino se stesso  Leggerlo  quindi  oltre che una preziosa opportunita  e un dovere umano   I m trying to go back and review some of my favorites from years past  I sort of hate reviewing my favorites because I never feel like I do them any justice  Crime and Punishment is one of those  What I love about Dostoevsky is that he digs into the depths of human nature  mankind s failings and capabilities of redemption  Like many of his novels  self examination and personal struggle become a key element in Crime and Punishment  Crime and Punishment examines one man s decision to murder and his ultimate punishment for it  While on the surface this may seem a simplistic premise  there is much to the protagonist s struggle  After Raskolnikov kills an old pawnbroker  he is thrust into a world of both psychological and spiritual anguish  Although believing that his deed will benefit humanity  the act actually takes a different course  and becomes a basis for Raskolnikov s isolation from his family and friends  and his ultimate inner turmoil  The atmosphere of Crime and Punishment is both crime drama and psychological thriller  as part of the story is the main character trying to evade detection from his crime  but there are also deep philosophical lessons about man s ability to reform after such a heinous  callous act  Raskolnikov s fall from the depths of society  physically  emotionally  spiritually   is essentially his punishment Dostoevsky often paints his characters in a true  and sometimes ugly  light  What gives the book an authentic feel is that this is a fallible  sinful protagonist who has the potential to change  There are also some despicable characters out to test and pull down the protagonist  Sonya  a young girl who is forced to prostitute to support her family  becomes the symbol of purity and a saving grace to Raskolikov  Over all  Crime and Punishment is a deep and complex novel  one that makes you think deeply about the nature of sin and redemption  It is also an exceptional psychological crime novel  superbly written  and well deserving of its classic status   Which is my favorite  Crime and Punishment or Adolescent   deep sigh  I don t know  I love Dostoevsky more than any other Russian writer because his women characters are intelligent and interesting  They have depth that many male novelists can t capture  He s also a master of relationships  There s history you can feel between characters  families and friendships  tensions and hatred long in the making   Just finished my first encounter with Dostojevskij What an extremely well written and interesting novel  Dostojevskij s incomparable ability to show the interchangeable human mind blew me away already at the first page  His rich descriptions of the filthy and horrific Skt  Petersborg made my nostrils flare with disgust and my brain dissolve in literary bliss  Raskolnikov  a depressed  isolated and poor former student plays with the thoughts of murder and robbery  An elderly pawn shop owner who embodies all the disgusting characteristics of the human race evokes his anger and hunger for fairness in the world  Hence  he plans the perfect murder   both to rid the world of a nuisance  but also to rob her shop and get the financial means to restore a reasonable lifestyle  As the murder is no secret and is implied from the very first page  this crime novel is not about the mystery of revealing the murderer  but a mystery of the nature of crime and murder and the mystery of the human mind and mankinds ability to commit horrible deeds What keeps the reader ever intrigued and on his toes are the lively and dramatic dialogues  dense descriptions of the question of guilt and sanity and naturally the question  Will he be caught  Dostojevskij does not try to separate good from evil  nor does he try to condemn Raskolnikov s actions  He merely describes the nature of humanity when put to the ultimate test  And he does it so well  Throughout the novel  you can easily feel that Dotojevskij himself has had to explore his own relationship with crime and its effects on man  As a young man he was due to illegal political ideas sentenced to death  Only in the very last moment  when some of his friends already had the noose around their necks  they were pardoned and sent to Siberia for years  In his work you detect comments on the inhumane toying with others  lives that in some instances caused insanity for members of his group  In Siberia  Dostojevskij befriended criminals of all sorts and his great insight in their minds and reasoning  enriches his take on Raskolnikov s inner battle Crime and Punishment has been a great introduction to Dostojevskij s work and will not be the only of his novels that I will enjoy hours reading  Get reading  mn rw  lrwyt bl lm    dwstwyfsky m mryD nfsy w  bqry lyktb hyk rwy

Raskolnikov s motivation  Dostoyevsky exposes the psychology of the unconscious long before Freud  Reading this was a torture I couldn t get away from  Woke up this morning at 4 30 just to finish reading it  Great expose of the human nature  Who is not a criminal in this novel  Every character is nuanced with both good and evil sides  Who in this earth cannot identify with the main character  To be human and not read Dostoyevsky is to miss out   LOVED this book  It s a book many people read in school  but I did not have the pleasure and now having read it I m sure at that young age it would have been lost on me  I appreciated the writing and the struggled which the main character faces throughout   One of the best novels I have ever read  Dostoyevsky takes you into the mind of a young man who murders two women and is not sure why  Was it because he needed the money one of the women   a loan shark   kept  Was it because he felt that he was of the class of men who had the right to kill for the good of humanity  Or did he just do it for kicks  I found a lot of similarities between Raskolnikoff and Levin  from Tolstoy s Anna Karenina  in terms of their journey from secularism to religion  This is no doubt reflective of the journey of Dostoyevsky himself This enthralling journey through the mind of an anti social criminal is worth every ounce of praise that has been heaped on it s already weighty legacy  This is a must read classic  It explores the mind of the kind hearted Raskolnikov and his psychological journey to hell amidst poverty and corruption  I found this book riveting and difficult to put down  Dostoevsky describes the emotions of his characters in such way  it makes the reader actually feel what the characters are going through  This is Dostoevsky s greatest masterpiece and definitely a book everyone should read   What an engaging  powerful  and intellectually gripping tale of a man who is willing to experiment an idea on the human race  Yet  what follows this act of malice is not a search for empirical evidence  but rather  a rudimentary probing of the human conscience  Doestovsky does literature and his readers a great service with Crime and Punishment  Read and be amazed    The real culprit is a theorist  a bookworm  who  in a tentative kind of way  has done a more than bold thing    The man in question has forgotten to cut off evidence  and in order to work out a theory  has killed two persons  He has committed a murder  and yet he has not known how to take possession of the pelf   he has committed a murder and yet continues to look upon himself as a righteous man    Porphyrius PetrovichThe Crime and Punishment revolves around the character of Rodion Raskolnikov  an ex student who murdered an old money lender  Alena  and her younger sister servant  Elizabeth  It is a crime story  but what Dostoevsky discloses in every chapter are not evidences and clues that lead the investigator to trace the criminal  What he explores is something within us  the individual and the depth of the human nature and soul  its rationalities and irrationalities  its sanities and insanities  The crime could simply refer to the  murder   and the apparent punishment could be Rodion s incarceration and his labour to Siberia  But the novel also suggests that the main crime is not the  act itself  but the theory that rationalizes the act  Rodion believed he was making a rational act  despite his main motive was vague  He was doing a great service to humanity by killing a despicable money lender  He was trudging the path to greatness by having the courage to transgress the norms  in similar fashion how Napoleon and other great people had violated what commonly called as normal  Rodion was making an experiment of his theory and of himself With this  Dostoevsky dramatically poses the question about the relation between morality and rationality  Socrates Plato has framed that what is rational is moral  that  ignorance is the root and stem of all evil   Yet the novel suggests otherwise  It shows that what is  rational  could not necessarily mean  moral   what is rational could not mean human  What is rational could be a mere pretension of knowing the answer  The novel evokes that theoretical explanations may sound plausible but it could not grasp everything  it could have left behind something  which perhaps the most essential  Dostoevsky shows that theoretical explanations have inadequately grasped the whole of Rodion s experience  his real punishment  The theories merely explained that the murder was committed out of his poverty or of his psychological condition  They could not take into account the gravity of Rodion s suffering condition  They could not conceptualize how he was aware of his madness  His arbitrary movements  cunning decisions  convulsions  nervousness  anxieties  these conditions spoke on their own  as Rodion s body could not lie  Yet  the theories did not speak about them  it did not articulate how he felt severed from the whole mankind  The theories were silent about his guilt The theories could not redeem Rodion  What saved him was not his reason  for the reason s end point for all we know is nihilistic  In its search for foundation it realizes that it is grounded in nothing  Its end point is undergroundman s self destruction  or Karamasov s  everything is permitted   or Svidrigailoff s heroic acceptance of fate on his suicide  Who saved him was Sophia Semenovna who provided Rodion new life  alluding to how Christ resurrected Lazarus  She s like the Karamasov s Alyosha  Her character emanates naive  pure  and unconditional love  She is the antithesis of reason  as unlike Rodion she is not an intellectual  She meagerly learned how tho read  and yet her acts provided what Rodion s reason could not provide  Her love accepted what is rationally condemnable  Her love spoke of the beauty of life as it grew not from affluence but from lack  not from joy but from pain  a love that sprang from a point when it was unreasonable to love  What saved Rodion was not love of Sophia but Sophia s love Her love brings us hope  a way  perhaps an antidote against the nihilism of reason  Sophia have shown that when the time the  love of wisdom  could no longer speak  it is the  wisdom of love  that must act in silence   Best ever book I ve read       So far    This is not one of those books which provide answers for the questions thrown at you  but instigates questions in yourself and let you run looking for answers  Few which are still in my head  are as follows Will it make a difference if the bloodshed is for greater good or higher purposes Will we still admit our crime out of heartfelt repentance or at least feel guilty  when there is no evidence to prove us as guilty and when the most ignoble criminals and rascals are walking this earth without any remorse Will the belief protect and absolve us Will love bring the deliverance Damn    Too many questions already  May you and I find answers in our ways  This book is one of the most emotionally stirring books I have ever read  I loved it and will read it over every few years  It is definitely one that I could get more out of at each reading  Una novela psicologica como las que me gustan  reconozco que puede parecer lenta pero cada personaje y parte de la historia tiene mucho sentido aunque no lo parezca  En mi opinion la mitad de la obra transcurre en San Petersburgo y la otra mitad en la cabeza de Raskolnikof  En ese sentido no es una novela muy policial Independiente de la tesis de Raskolnikof  lo que ejemplifica Dostoievski es la accion de la culpa y el remordimiento  Yo cometo un crimen  se que esta accion tiene una consecuencia o varias consecuencias y estas consecuencias de alguna u otra forma se desencadenan  Tambien es una buena lectura historicamente hablando porque es la Rusia de mediados del siglo XIX  hay varios detalles en el relato que nos dan luces de como vivian y como pensaban   One of the books that I felt I had to read after the paucity of literature that I could consume in graduate school  it took me a while to get into Dostoevsky s tale of the decisions that can push someone to step outside the accepted boundaries of society  It really wasn t until I reached the inspector s monologue at the police station that I could full see Dostoevsky s genius  I wonder what this would be like in the Russian  There was a time when I would have shoved this book aside after reading the first few pages because it is not as action packed like some fantasy stories  This book  however  provides deep insight to the conflict ongoing within Raskolnikov s mind  His mind is split between doing the right thing for himself or doing the right doing for the everyone else  Being an intelligent man  this story does not use cliche thoughts or feelings for Raskolnikov at times that they wee expected to used  and the unpredictability in his mind gives a good twist on the story  The very first classic I LOVE You gotta read it  It mightn t be that attractive at first but it s amazing  I promise   You ll find yourself crying and smiling  And guess what  it has a happy ending   I am finally finished with my summer of Russian literature reading list   in winter   a year and half later  I thought this to be very Russian and appropriate  This was by far the best of the  Big 4   Great  active voice translation  Crime and Punishment is one of the best books I ve ever read  It s one of those rare books that I will probably carry around with me for the rest of my life because it changed the way I look at some aspects of life  The harrowing account of crime and guilt that encompasses most of the narrative is unforgettable  Dostoevsky shows an incredible understanding of human psychology  particularly as it relates to sin and guilt  I found myself relating to feelings I go through when I make mistakes in life  albeit to a much lesser degree  Some critics have argued that no literary work makes a stronger case for the existence of Deity  and I agree that Dostoevsky makes an extremely compelling case here  The dialogue between Raskolnikov and several other notable characters  particularly the detective chasing him  is a real strength in the novel  It s one of those books that s just compulsively readable  where I just couldn t wait to see how it would end  DAMN l dry b y  ql ktb dwstwyfsky hdhh lrwy     hl ktbh b ql lmjrm  m b ql lskyr  m ktbh b ql lmHqq  m lSdyq  m lTbyb  m l m  m l kht  m

cringe  from a Starbucks coffee cup I thought no longer had coffee in it and had stuffed into my bag   my bus stop book  my break book  my hospital book   my home book  my procrastination book  my so distracting me from everything else book  my got to finish now book     my WOW book  Well  it was more than just a physical journey with this book  it was enlightening in many ways Crime and Punishment proved to be a superb read  and more  Instantly  I was struck by the thoughts and eccentricities of the central character  Raskolnikov  I found myself falling asleep     with the character as he slept  during a very early morning train ride I had   pondering while he pondered  questioning while he questioned  and even experiencing the agony of a nightmare that led me to sob  As the consequences of what Raskolnikov does unfolds in the book  so too do we discover the many layers and meanings to him and his actions Dostoyevsky skilfully divulges the thoughts and beliefs  conscious and subconscious  of his characters in such a way that we are moved by them     moved to reflect  moved to consider  moved to be repelled  moved to sympathise  moved to empathise  It s so human  real and raw   the thoughts and the characters  but there s much edible food for thought  Not only are we privy to the thoughts of the central character  Raskolnikov  but also the people who he meets  who are with him and who are not with him  Through these vantage points  we gain new and different insights  about Raskolnikov  and the characters themselves   interesting and complex in their own right  The subject matter seems  at face value  not a strikingly original concept  a man commits a crime  I could easily say what   but you know what  why should I spoil anything   But Dostoyevsky manages to create a strikingly original novel  It even sounds heinous  the subject matter  but it s a novel that never condones  but proves to be deep  very deep  It s an exploration of why he did what he did  and it s repercussions  for himself and those around him  It s an exploration of individuality and conflict within the individual  It s an exploration of suffering  Even amongst the characters  interesting ideas are discussed and challenged  The book reeks of intelligent and thought provoking insights     it reeks   here I m using the word in the most positive sense  if that s allowable  I found the novel to be a compelling read from beginning to end  It made such an impression on me  I was underlining  and writing notes along its margins incessantly   It s incredible that Dostoyevsky manages to convey such depth and intrigue when nothing much is happening but a man is wandering the streets or is cramped in an unpleasant closet like room  for example  in fact  it would be interesting to find out how much of the book takes place in this setting   50     Not to say that nothing happens in the novel  Not at all  There is a crime committed  that shakes one  and involves others  There are consequences  complications  and agendas  There are sub plots  which rather than distracting us from the central plot  build on it  Such engaging human interactions that seem so real  It s about one character  but it s also about many others  Because of the novel s multi dimensional and humanistic portrayal of characters and events  I felt I could relate and became attached in some way or another  Crime and Punishment is a book that is certainly a worthy read  I really liked it  Note  I read the Vintage Classics edition of this novel  which is touted to be the best translation available in English  and I found it very good  so I recommend this version  which also comes with helpful annotations   But I don t recommend reading the little blurb at the back of the book   be warned  it spoils it for you  and after finishing the novel  is much too simplistic and basically misses the point   not as a patient  but as a medical student  This book was incredibly intellectual  with a psychological twist and true emotional rather than solely psychological depth  It kept me guessing  and it was brilliantly bounded  i would recommend this book greatly I have not been a great reader of the classics  Moby Dick and a bit of Chaucer and Shakespeare are about it  Then I read Crime and Punishment last year  And I thought   this is what a great book is   If nothing else  it is a great psychological thriller  But it is so much more than that  To me it was about the Gospels laid out in the excruciating pain of real life  I m now reading The Idiot and trying hard not to compare the two books  This is an incredible read  It is an amazing work by a genius   The plot is fascinating and the end is surprising   definitely a classic    To go wrong in one s own way is better then to go right in someone else s  I have been giving a lot of thought to this novel lately  Despite the three years that have gone by since reading Crime and Punishment  three years in which I ve read some outstanding literature  joined Goodreads and written just over 100 reviews of the books I ve journeyed through  Dostoevsky s novel still resides on it s throne as my personal favorite novel  No other web of words  brushstrokes or music melody has ever struck me so deeply and consumed me so completely as this book did  The author s collection of works as a whole has left such a mark on my soul that I felt it necessary to permanently affix his likeness on my arm  Over a century has passed since its initial publication  yet Dostoevsky s message is still as poignant today as it was when it was first inked onto paper  Crime and Punishment features an immensely engaging blend of intrigue  philosophy  political  social  moral and religious commentary  that all thread together to create a masterpiece of literature that captures the deep  raw core of the human condition when it is at it s most gruesome and vulnerable  The exquisite literary genius of the novel evoked a strong emotional resonance in me and the timing of my reading was just right to forever wed me to my love of books Initially envisioned as two separate novels  one following the inner turmoil of a murderer and the other chronicling the melancholic destruction of a family due to a flighty  alcoholic patriarch  Dostoevsky deftly weaves together a multitude of unforgettable characters as they interplay through their tangle of plotlines  There are some incredible scenes that will forever haunt and delight me in my memory  such as the narrow escape from the scene of the crime which had me holding my breath in anxious anticipation  the darkly comical disaster of the funeral feast  or the emotionally charged and grim meeting between Dunya and the vile Svidrigailov  Each character is carefully balanced with their foil  each character is written with their own unique style of speech and language  and the novel seems to tie every thread together with such perfection and care as it churns forward  raining destruction on the lives of it s characters to bring them toward their own personal redemption or demise  This was a book that I was unable to put down as the words flowed from their pages to deep within my heart  Dostoevsky brilliantly straps the reader to the emotional states of his characters and is able to create seamless transitions between scenes or from the minds of one character to the next by riding the wings of an emotion  Most often this emotion is guilt  and the murder scene and it s feverish follow up is so expertly crafted that the reader feels they must share in Raskolnikov s guilty burden  During the course of reading this book  I was overwhelmed by a crushing sense of guilt that was disconnected to any of my own actions  Yet  had police officers confronted me at any given moment  I would have held out my hands in surrender since I was so burdened by the guilty residue of the novel  What further linked me to the book was Raskolnikov s illness following his crime  Maybe it wasn t the novel taking root in my soul  perhaps it was due to the cold fall weather that was creeping in at the time  or perhaps it was due to my lack of sleep and early rising to embark on 10 12hr shifts in an unheated factory where I would work away amidst a cloud of aluminum dust  but I felt feverish and ill alongside Raskolnikov and his fever dreams  I don t think I felt well again until after finishing the book I believe I read Crime and Punishment at the ideal moment in my life  I had spent the summer going through several of Dostoevsky s other novels and falling madly in love with his writing  Then my whole life was uprooted  At the time I began C P  I had moved across the state away from all my friends  family  and everything I knew and recognized  to live in Holland with my brand new baby daughter and work in a factory that could easily serve for a modern day sequel to Sinclair s The Jungle  Looking back  I think I can see why I so easily soaked up Raskolnikov s feelings  Dostoevsky shows how we are a product of our choices  and it is how we deal with our consequences that makes us who we are  I was placed in the new situation because of choices I had made  like choosing to skip class to smoke and read by the river  and Raskolnikov was faced with the guilt of his own actions  It was the most dramatic shift in my life and I am not a person who enjoys change  yet here I was without a familiar face and nobody to talk to  Crime and Punishment was there in my hand every morning and night as I walked between my home and car  like a friend holding my hand to comfort and encourage me in my exhaustion  It rode shotgun on my hour commutes like a faithful companion  and was the friendly face in which I could take refuge in on my breaks  When stripped of all I knew  there was literature to keep me sane and give me something to hold on to as my world spiraled out of control around me  my daughter was also a tether of sanity for me  but fatherhood was still new and intimidating at the time   Dostoevsky and his beautiful words became my friend and my passion  and in my solitude  because  let s face it  I was very much an oddball in that factory and it took awhile to find my place there  I plunged myself deep into books  something I am very thankful for and feel that all the strangeness and loneliness of the existence is washed away by the glow I feel from grappling with my favorite authors  Then I discovered Goodreads and you all became incredibly dear to me  I don t think I would have survived my time in that dark pit without you all  so  from the bottom of my heart  thank you I apologize that this isn t really much of a review  I m very excited for  this review  as it was seeing this GR friend  one of which I hold in the highest regard and am always incredibly impressed by  reading Crime and Punishment that brought back a flood of memories of my times with the book as if I were Proust with his madeleines  I highly recommend this novel  and firmly stand by my choice of it as my favorite  Recently  I had to make a list for work of my top 5 favorite books  which was difficult to do  damn near impossible  but I realized how simple it was to put a book down in the  1 slot  I have read some incredible books since  Hunger  my love of which stems from the similarities to Dostoevsky I noticed in the book   Gravity s Rainbow  or To the Lighthouse to name a few  yet nothing has ever left as deep of an impact on me as a reader and as a human being as this book  This is a fantastic book about the human spirit  about our deepest  darkest impulses  and shows that our own inner consciousness can dish out a far greater punishment than any legal system can  Now I need to sleep and sober up 5 5  I did not bow down to you  I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity   It s almost impossible to write a review of this book that is worthy of it  I feel like I ve come across quite a few writers who understand human nature well and write really believable characters by just getting into their heads   but no one quite does it like Dostoevsky  to the extent that I would read before bed and dream about Rodya  and wake up almost sure that I had killed a person  and I would be torn between being horrified and loathing myself  and thinking I did right  Only there were also about a hundred different emotions he experienced between the two black and white ones I mentioned  Dostoevsky s psychological insight into the protagonist is unbelievable  I was going to write that you can t help but feel pity for Rodya while also hating him  but the truth is you don t get a choice  because after a while you are Rodya  and that s the best way I can describe this book  Also  his exchanges with the investigator Porfiry were some of the best parts of the book  and always had me on the edge of my seat  or reading chair  to be precise    Masterpiece Accept suffering and achieve atonement through it  You  ll find only few novels like this in the world literature An Absolute Classic Novel ever remembered Crime and Punishment Holy smokes  What a book  The character of Roskolnikov will be sticking with me for a long time to come   The story of a troubled protagonist who murders an old pawnbroker for a philosophy  Raskolnikov is a profound insight into the mind of a madman and of the dynamics of pain that all humans share  It is one of Fyodor Dostoevsky  s greatest novels  OBRA MAESTRAEn un principio puede echar para atras su extension  y su tematica psicologica  pero fue un total disfrute  Si te consigue atrapar la historia principal  sera un placer ver el universo que rodea al protagonista  Es un estudio psicologico de un crimen  Raskolnikov decide matar a una vieja prestamista  avara y malvada  segun su opinion  es un piojo para la sociedad  Es un crimen meditado  esta  etica logica y razonada  recuerda a Nietzsche   que el protagonista intenta justificar moralmente  Este es el tema central  pero a raiz de aqui surgen varios argumentos  personajes y situaciones enriquecedoras  Para mi tiene gran importancia los personajes femeninos de su hermana  y su amiga prostituta  su papel es fundamental en Raskolnikov  Toda la novela es una lucha de ideales y sentimientos analizados psicologicamente  sin olvidar la critica social de su tiempo  Hay grandes descripciones  y excelentes dialogos  de diferentes tematicas  filosofica  religiosa  moral  social  o de los mas nobles sentimientos  Es una novela imprescindible  y totalmente recomendable  It was bitter cold last night  The trip from work to the kitchen was uneventful enough  I prepared soup and awaited my wife  After dinner  I placed Sonny Rollins  9 11 Concert on the stereo and sat down with the last 52 pages of Crime and Punishment  the greatest testament I can afford the novel conclusion is that for 25 minutes I didn t hear any jazz  only Dostoevsky s denouement I read the edition included here  Works of Fyodor Dostoevsky  Crime and Punishment  The Idiot  The Brothers Karamazov  The Gambler  The Devils  The Adolescent   more  translated by Constance Garnett  My understanding is that there may be better translations  but one could hardly argue with this one  I didn t read it in Russian and I ll still rave about the prose   three instances in particular  First  there was a scene where Raskolnikov steps into a tavern and a fellow starts talking to him  One sentence and I knew the fellow was very drunk  though not a slurred word on the page  It was at least a paragraph before Dostoevsky mentions it  Ok  so perhaps I should have led a more sheltered life  but how can a single sentence of dialogue convey a man s state of mind so clearly that I got it immediately  Brilliant Second  a few chapters later Raskolnikov left his dwelling voicing internally complete and utter indignation about the contents of a letter  Sometimes the voicing was not so internal  so that passersby turned to look at him  The pace of the next few paragraphs was perfect  Doestoevsky only wrote what Raskolnikov was thinking  yet we get the the quick steps  the hand gesture  the mumbling  The reader might not have had the same indignant reaction to the letter  but there could be no mistaking Raskolnikov Third  there was a conversation between Raskolnikov and a young woman  I don t want to write any spoilers   where the silence of the gaps in conversation was palpable  and I felt myself straining to hear when they whispered  It was almost as if you could hear the characters breathing  though Dostoevsky never alluded to it  Raskolnikov paced the floor and I swear I could hear the floor boards creak    again not a mention from Dostoevsky  How was he able to convey this mood just with words   and those words not directly convey the mood expressed Others will write of the story itself  I couldn t turn the pages quickly enough because I needed to know what happened next  I didn t want it to end   At first I wasn t sure whether this novel would be for me  it starts rather slowly  But by the time I had read the first hundred pages or so I had become really invested in it An enquiry into the nature of  crime   and what falls under this banner  as well as a demonstration of how the human spirit deals with guilt   Crime and Punishment  is definitely now one of my favourite classics   One of the books that changed my life  A lot of exposition  but the characters felt so real that I was emotionally distraught for days after I finished the book  Something about Dostoyevsky s novels makes me want to discover St  Petersburg  where most of his novels are set  For those of you who might be afraid of Russian literature because of the long  hard to pronounce names  this is a great novel for you  I ve read a few things from Dostoevsky and he is clear and understandable  Written in 1917  Crime and Punishment follows impoverished university drop out  Raskolnikov  as he murders and robs a pawnbroker and her sister  then has to suffer under the consequences of his actions  Raskolnikov is quite possibly the world s worst criminal and that is kind of Dostoevsky s point  The crime occurs in the beginning of the story and we watch the character unravel under the guilt of it all  There was no physical evidence tying him to the crime  He could have gotten away with it if he had kept his cool  but instead  Raskolnikov seemed to sabotage himself over and over  behaving nervous and guilty  getting defensive  failing to come forward to the police right away with his involvement with the pawnbroker  raving about the crime while suffering from fever  But Raskolnikov s actions support Dostoevsky s belief that people who are basically good will suffer more from their conscience than the actual punishment itself  Is Raskolnikov a good person  He killed two women with an ax and stole from them  On the other hand  when his scoundrel of a drinking buddy dies  leaving a sick wife and several children behind  he gives the widow most of his cash  He also seems to have genuine affection for his sister and saves her from making a mistake of a marriage for the sake of security  He even falls in love with a kind hearted prostitute  someone whom many men would not consider worthy of love  Overall  I give Crime and Punishment   Plot   3 1 2

Blunt  Sonia   Michael Sheen  Detective Petrovich   Tom Hardy  Razumihin  An interesting novel  hard to put down A masterpiece  I didn t like the story as much as I liked The Brothers Karamazov  but the level of psychological insight in this book is incredible  I love to encounter characters that are supposed to be villians that I can identify with  I think the first time this happened to me consciously was in A Clockwork Orange  but that didn t happen with this book  I didn t identify with Raskolnikov  despite the high level of access to his psychological workings  But I ve been learning lately that sometimes more interesting than an instant connection of identification is the process of beating your head against someone that you want to understand  but simply never can  Great book with plenty for the contemplative mind to feast on  and plenty of action to keep the blood flowing  ok it was a bit of a head nodder at times but not too often   I had this pegged as a 4 star until the brilliant and beautiful epilogue  SPOILERSPOILERSSPOILERS  I really did not expect a happy ending from the general tone of hopelessness  Plenty of underlying themes came to light in retrospect as well  Overall a fantastic work of art  I can already see myself reading it again  An excellent book that spoke about human nature  Rodion was to bad to his resurrection to be good  He changed his mind   I loved this book  The turmoil of the character and how Dostoevsky takes you through every thought and move of his characters  I loved how the story moved along and how it unfolded  Definitely a favorite   mlmH  lnsny  fryd  mn nw h Another classic that stuck with me years after reading it  Highly recommended  It depicts the psychological power of guilt and shame that lingers with a man forced to deal with the consequences of his actions  It is a powerful story pulls the reader through the main character s journey from crime to redemption  Beautiful  Seria ocioso anadir algo acerca la maestria narrativa del gigante ruso  su mirada fina para desentranar las razones y exigencias del alma  su capacidad de construir atmosferas y estados de animo  la paciencia para hacernos conocer el tormento de un hombre hasta volvernos participe de el  etc Lo esencial de Crimen y castigo es la angustia de un hombre que quiere saberse extraordinario  su necesidad de someter al espiritu a fuerzas que lo sobrepasan porque la necesidad pesa mas que la razon  Durante 700 maravillosas paginas seguimos las cavilaciones de Raskolnikov  la sensacion que tiene de estar tragicamente destinado al asesinato de una vieja usurera  la culpa que sobreviene y el terror de no saber que hacer con esa carga  El protagonista es un personaje interesante porque sus razonamientos estan fuera de la etica  No le importa si matar es bueno o malo  sino lo que le probara  si puede hacerlo y vivir con ello  significara que es un hombre destinado a la grandeza  Dice El hombre extraordinario tiene derecho  no oficialmente  sino por si mismo  a autorizar su conciencia a franquear ciertos obstaculos  en el caso de exigirlo asi la realidad de su idea Sin embargo  de lo que me interesa hablar aqui no es del desarrollo de la novela  sino del final  Narrado vertiginosamente en algo como 30 o 40 paginas  resulta que Raskolnikov decide confesar y entregarse a la policia  Asi lo hace y lo sentencian a 7 anos en Siberia  donde se da cuenta de que ama a Sonia y ese amor sera su salvacion  La decepcion fue mi primera respuesta a la conclusion que nuestro camarada ruso decidio para Crimen y castigo  Sin embargo  un par de dias despues de terminar el libro las ideas se asentaron un poco y hoy me parece que ese es un final tremendo  veladamente terrible Si  Raskolnikov confiesa  pero no esta arrepentido y lo lamenta  Sabe que arrepentirse seria glorioso  asi sentiria que merece el castigo de estar en prision y confiaria en que ese aislamiento y el someterse a duras tareas fisicas son castigos que limpian poco a poco su culpa  Pero no es el caso  el castigo no le traera calma sino desasosiego  Si todavia el destino le hubiera proporcionado el arrepentimiento torturador que destroza el corazon  el arrepentimiento cuyos tormentos son de tal naturaleza que hacen que un hombre se ahorque o se arroje al agua para librarse de el   Oh  entonces lo habria acogido con alegria  Sufrir y llorar es vivir aun  Pero el no se arrepentia de su crimen Si esta en la carcel es solo porque la sociedad y sus convenciones lo aplastaron  El titubeo es la falla de caracter de Raskolnikov  Hacia el final de la novela  este tiene perfectamente claro que el no es un hombre extraordinario porque duda  Dudo de si le correspondian esos tamanos  de si debia o no asesinar a la anciana  de si entregarse o no  Los dioses le extirpan la duda a aquellos que han elegido para la grandeza  Sus espiritus pueden turbarse o no con sus propios actos  esos hombres pueden  y Raskolnikov esta convencido de que asi es  experimentar sufrimiento por lo que el Destino los ha llamado a hacer  nada de eso importa  Cuando tengan que ejecutar el asesinato  el bombardeo  la toma de un imperio  no dudaran un segundo en hacerlo  Eso es el tormento fundamental de Raskolnikov  saberse ordinario  Peor aun  confirmarse ordinario  El sospecha que no esta destinado a grandes cosas  pero esto le provoca una ansiedad insoportable  a tal grado que echa mano de razonamientos cuidadosamente elucubrados para convencerse de lo contrario  Pero la verdad no puede ser enganada por la inteligencia  Por esto es que resultan tan obscuras un par de reflexiones hacia el final de la novela Otro pensamiento lo torturaba tambien   Por que no se habia suicidado   Era tan dificil vencer el sentimiento de amor por la vida Mas titubeo  mas duda  En varias ocasiones Raskolnikov juega con la idea del suicido  pero todas las veces termina descartandola con un pretexto distinto  dignidad  honor  responsabilidad  Lo que intenta evadir es la confrontacion con su propia mortalidad  Es decir  los hombres extraordinarios trascenderan por sus hazanas  por ser instrumentos de lo divino para manifestarse  poco importa que su cuerpo fisico muera porque su espiritu permanecera por el resto del tiempo  A Raskolnikov le palpita la certeza de que este no sera su caso  otra vez el presentimiento de que el esta en la categoria de los hombres comunes  de los que tienen que buscar la felicidad en el matrimonio  en la paternidad  en las nimiedades cotidianas  Se sabe dentro de los que tienen que  intentar  ser felices en esta vida porque una vez muertos nadie los recordara Esto se encadena con otra declaracion que en principio parece un triunfo pero en realidad es la derrota definitiva  En las ultimas tres paginas de la novela  Raskolnikov es iluminado por una revelacion que  por rapida y repentina  se siente forzada  Sonia lo visita y al tomar sus manos y mirar sus ojos se siente de pronto enamorado y encuentra en ese amor su redencion  Piensa en lo afortunado que es y en lo cortos que se haran los dias en la carcel ahora que ama En aquella primera alegria del retorno a la vida  todo  incluso su crimen  hasta su condena y su deportacion a Siberia se le aparecia como un hecho exterior  extrano  parecia casi dudar de que aquello hubiera ocurrido  La vida habia sustituido al razonamiento E inmediatamente despues toma los Evangelios que Sonia le dejo y que no habia tocado hasta ese momento  El  el hombre que antes habia sentenciado con firmeza Hay que razonar seriamente y ver las cosas en su verdadero aspecto  en lugar de llorar como un nino y ponerlo todo en manos de Dios Es el fracaso del hombre que se sabe menor  prescindible  ordinario  Por primera vez  Raskolnikov se niega a razonar porque intuye que la conclusion sera insoportable  Y entonces cede  se somete  pondera la vida sobre la grandeza y se dispone a confiar en que otro  Dios  se encargara de la trascendencia de su alma  Raskolnikov esta derrotado  el mundo no comprendera nunca la prueba a la que quiso someter su espiritu y el es demasiado cobarde para enfrentar el resultado fallido de esa prueba y su consecuencia logica  Asi que decide forzar a su espiritu a creer en Dios  la muleta de los enanos que no estan llamados a la grandeza pues solo lo divino puede negar a lo divino http   placeresdeshonestos wordpress     definitely one of my favourite books   I think this was the first book I read that I really became a part of  The book is so well written that I honestly felt like it was my thoughts and my actions  It is extremely powerful and incredibly dynamic   A six star book  Great  capital G  Why the heck is there an audiobook  This one s one of those books you go back and read a sentence or a paragraph 5 times over and smile and the structure  Deep  yet pulls you long and leaves you  saturated   Classic in every sense of the word  probably my favorite  classic  to date   Dostoyevsky can do no wrong in my opinion  Another dark and sad Russian tale  Life was tough but there was always the damp  dark flat to go back to with the samovar   time for tea and reflection  Murder is committed fairly early on and Raskolnikov then ties himself in knots trying to justify the act   This book in transporting and  if read carefully  can expose our own pessimism about humanity  Dostoevsky manages to construct a world where mercy is demonstrated through punishment  and no crime transpires with impunity  since the conscience is an indefatigable judge  presiding over each character s thoughts and actions   This is my favorite book of all time  Rodion Ramonovitch Raskalnikov is a great character  whether  in your eyes  he is good or he is bad  I  personally  loved him and sympathized with him throughout the story  I hated people he hated  like Luzhin and the pawnbroker  and I loved people he loved  like Dunya and Sonya  Dostoevsky was marvelous with this work  Now on to The Brothers Karamazov  This is considered a timeless classic for good reason  It brilliantly blends  big  themes of crime  guilt  redemption and suffering with a brisk story of suspense and intrigue  It was published in 1866 but feels more relevant today than many works of contemporary fiction  The Pevear translation makes it a relatively easy read   It took me about a month to read which slowed down my goals for the year  However it made me realize that I had skipped over really great novels and I will now pursue the classics and longer novels instead of quick reads  This book is amazing  beautiful  it makes you think about the nature of men and why things happen why they do  IT is also a great study of the culture of Russia during the 19th century   With this book  I had a conversion experience  an epiphany  I first read it in high school on my own  outside of any class assignment or coursework  I remember thinking that that this was it  life and literature like what is found within the covers of this book are worth devoting my life to and I am proud to say that I have a career that keeps me involved with literature still   I teach   From Raskolnikov I learned that one can actually play Dodge Ball with the Cosmos   As Bulgakov puts it in the book  Master and the Margharita    One has to read only a few pages of Dostoyevsky s book to know its been written by a craftsman  Dostoyevsky has painted a landscape depicting the romantic miserableness of a struggling youth and garnished it with self abandon  He shows Petersburg in all its wretchedness  in it s decrepit imagery of everyday plebeians and its gnawing intellectual movement in the times of drudgery  The protagonist s fleeting sanity can be seen in his hazy thoughts as he wonders and tries to confront the vanishing awareness of his life  And no  it has nothing to do with the crime that he committed that took it away  The whole novel is built around the the real object of the crime and it s beauty comes from what was left unsaid Rodya was a extraordinarily intelligent and burnt person   singed everywhere one could think of   till it shackled him so much  so immaculately and so pinchingly that he thought of nothing else but breaking through the numbness that was induced by his suffocating surrounding that tried to strap his intellect from truly finding itself  The youthful awareness of  nothing  takes on a character in this novel   view spoiler  Rodya recollected every ounce of his education  his infirmity his intelligence and his handsomeness and decided to break into something and commit a crime because   it can perhaps extricate him and the society from something appalling  But  by the time he tried to commit the crime  his awareness had ceased to exist   he was in a delirium which became permanent   He was in that high state that makes us see all things allegorical and ideal and but essentially nothing  He relapsed into sanity at very remote moments when he peeked into the silent certainty of disdain and blind misunderstanding of the society and when he searched for the  meaning of his crime  Solitude ceased to exist for him  He couldn t find it in any company   not even Sonya s   someone who was ostracized by the society in a different but intrinsically compatible manner  He saw the vain veils that everyone has put on to religionlize or give some name to the suffering   he had nothing at all to seek his solace in  The universe was a constant nauseating happening Can anyone write in such plain words and brand the revolting youth and the numbness and nothingness into as a being  Dostoyevsky has done exactly that  As the book progresses  we see Ryoda display an ideology with a strange understanding of the milieu  This book is a moving and poignant painting nothingness and of a youth and who broke a code of the society yet remained so definitely above reproach   hide spoiler   Oh my gosh  Also  Razumichin is life  HANDS DOWN Este foi um dos melhores livros que li    pecou apenas pelo excesso de discricao em algumas partes que nao o exigiam  Em certos capitulos nao se retira muito partido para a historia sendo simplesmente um pouco de  adereco  ao livro  O conteudo do livro e porem excelente  com uma beleza estilistica entusiasmante e viciante  A grande vontade do leitor para saber o fim vai sendo cada vez maior  sendo que passando as 250 paginas o ritmo da leitura comeca a ser cada vez mais rapido  Li o livro em 3 semanas e creio que todos o devem ler  Cheio de misterio  de perturbacao que nos atinge a nos mesmos  cheio de questoes ao nivel da filosofia e cheio de cultura no que compete ao seculo XIX  Simplesmente fantastico  5 estrelas  I know there s a whole lot of subversive meaning in this book  I also know I m not patient enough to look it up  nor to read a book about a book while reading a book  What I do know is that this whopper of a tome is actually kinda gripping and fast paced in its own quiet way  And I appreciate that  it s rare that classics are actually page turners that are a joy to read   knt hdhh lrwy  hy  wl  qr  ly fy l db lrwsy  l  lTlq  w yDan Hd  qrty l wl  fy l db lklsyky l wrwby  lm  kd  lmHh  thn tjwly fy m rD lktb b mWn qbl  sbw yn Ht  hr

even calling the guy I fancied Raskolnikov    he seemed mysterious and daring  Now I am finding the main character harsh and depressing  I think Dostoevsky knew what he was talking about  This is an amazing Novel  I am absolutely in love with it and recommend everyone to read this book  It is absolutely wonderful and this is a type of book you want to keep forever and re read  At first  I wasn t confident I was going to enjoy this book but I was so wrong  Fyodor Dostoyevsky is an incredible author and I am looking forward to read many more of his books  Another book I read in high school  Most people I ve talked to seemed to say they didn t like it as much as I did  but I doubt that I ve talked to that many people about it  because it s an amazing book  I think Dostoevsky can be tough to get through  probably b c he was a complete genius  I want to read his other books  I ve heard so many people say that his books are their favorites Anyway this book was pretty amazing  It had a plot and ideas in it that at the time I had never encountered  and it was all presented so fascinatingly  The ending surprised me but I guess it shouldn t have  Anyway it s an amazing character study  life study  idea study  I found myself casting it for a film  I m sure it s been done  But maybe not well   My favorite book  I spent days walking around in a haze after reading this book  my brain alive with thoughts  That is exactly what a book ought to make you do  Did I mention that this is my most favorite book  ever   Tare buna perspectiva a vietii imperiale rusesti mn hdhh lrwy  lkhld

authors in modern history  If you like love Tolstoy as much as I do  then sit down and read Crime and Punishment  Dostoyevsky distinguishes genius from madness  and dreams from reality seamlessly but with enormous imagination  You re taken to the heights of axe murdering to the gulags in Siberia within one book  I can t give this story enough praise   Nao ha palavras para falar neste livro  E necessario le lo  There are books  whose very size  intimidates you  and yet  you do have to read it  because your favourite celebrity ever  for me that was Daniel Radcliffe  has read it as early as when he was 16  So  to do away with that feeling of incompetence  you pick up a book like this one and start reading it Crime and Punishment  where do I even start  It s long  yes  it seems to go on forever  true  but it is ONE hell of a book you simply can t keep down  While reading it  you re simply not you  You re Raskolnikov  who is full of bitter madness towards a world he sees crumbling before his eyes  full of exploitation  misery and despair  You re Sonia  who is forced to prostitute herself to feed her family and whose only consolation is the Bible  You re the crazy  funny  drunk Razumikhin who finds it easy to fall in love and who suspects nothing  The best part of the book is how Dostoyevsky is this completely different person who is narrating the story to you and as he does  he has little comments on his own characters and the incidents in the novel  something  that makes you feel he doesn t really always side up with what his characters are doing  What I loved and what haunts me still about the book is its narration  Seriously  there s nothing MUCH in the story itself  It s just how it has been told  This book  above all others I have ever read  made me feel how powerful and wonderful almost ANYTHING can sound if the narration is right and how there s philosophy and poetry hidden in the most mundane and day to day activities of human life  music hidden in misery and a sweet artistic charm in sadness  too  A book to die for  Crime and Punishment is something I will HIGHLY recommend  I finally finished Crime and Punishment this evening  I have loved this book and have discovered an author I would like to explore further This is a highly readable novel focusing on the psychological reaction of a murderer after his crime  As I ve said before I was shocked that the murder was so graphic in a classic  but the murder itself was such a small part of the novel  Like in  The Red Room  the guilt and suffering is overwhelming  and we are drawn into Raskolnikov s private turmoil  The supporting characters are all well developed and hold their own stories alongside the main story of the novel  I particularly Sonia  she reminded me of a character from a Dickens  novel  someone of a low position who is given a voice  but like Dickens Dostoevsky felt the need to make her into a kind hearted tart I ve read and loved a few other Russian classics  such as War and Peace  but have struggled with the various names used for each of the characters  this I didn t find such an issue in this novel as there isn t too much variety in the names used for each character and also the smaller number of characters featured in this novel  I think this might be my favourite read of the year   Calling this a  novel  alone would not do enough justice to this profound work  It s not a novel  It s an experience  Fedor Mikhailovich izvestnyi master preparirovat  liudskie dushi i iskat  otvety na izvechnye voprosy  tipa   Tvar  li Ia drozhashchaia ili pravo imeiu Siuzhet opisyvat  ne budu  sami ego znaete  I was holding my breath until the very end  One of the best novels about the human condition ever written  What more can you say  One of my favorite books of all time  When I turn the last page  I only want to start over from the beginning  I cannot think of another author who has stirred my soul as Dostoevsky has   I picked up Crime and Punishment on a friends suggestion  I figured that at 26  it was about time I grew up and stopped avoiding the classics  and he thought it d be the easiest read for a casual reader like myself He was right  Crime and Punishment is timeless  I ve never loved and hated a protagonist at the same time quite like I did Raskolnikov  His inner turmoil is the centrepiece of this work  Though morbid  through committing the highest crime imaginable  he discovered that he was not the person he thought he was   and he suffers as he finds out just who he is and what he really wants  Dostoyevsky s chosen narrative style is just completely perfect for this purpose And that s just the beginning  There s so much going on in this book from so many characters  all of which are fleshed out on their own and play a crucial role in the narrative  I ve never read another book that all comes together so perfectly well PS  I read the Sidney Monas translation  which is not very popular  I highly recommend it  if you can get your hands on it  It s very good   Crime and Punishment  is Fyodor Dostoevsky s classic of sin  guilt  punishment  and forgiveness  Following Rodion Raskolnikov  one of the most morally ambiguous antiheroes written in literature  the novel is a engrossing character study of this intellectual murderer as he commits a gruesome crime against an elderly pawnbroker   which leads to a gradual descent in psychological deterioration and overwhelming guilt  Dostoevsky affirms himself as a master of the human condition with his dark pathos and disarming prose     Que importaba que dentro de ocho anos solo tuviera el treinta y dos y pudiese de nuevo comenzar su vida   Para que vivir   A que aspirar   Por que esforzarse   Vivir para existir  Pero mil veces ya antes habia estado el dispuesto a dar su vida por una idea  por una ilusion  hasta por un ensueno  La simple existencia siempre habia significado poca cosa par a el  siempre anhelo mas  Acaso por la sola fuerza de su deseo hubo de sentirse entonces un hombre al que le estaba permitido mas que a los demas   Masterpiece  Raskolnikov commits a most heinous murder of his pawnbroker  Lizaveta  and concocts a theory of the Extraordinary Man in history who is allowed to commit even murder for the greater good of mankind  It is only after his arrest and struggle with his own conscience that he comes to see the ways of his error and wish to repent and achieve salvation while in exile in Siberia  Raskolnikov abandons his Nietschean theories for the humility of Christ  This was Dostoyevsky s most sensational novel written like many of his works over a period of time in the weekly Russian newspapers  keeping ordinary Russians spellbound like some nineteenth century soap opera  When I enlisted in the Army  I entered as a translator with the hopes of being assigned Russian so I could re read this in the original  Instead  I was selected to learn Korean  Cest la merde  Brilliant ideas from a man who is far advanced in thought for his time  Explores themes that some would deem  uncomfortable  and brings the reader on a stunning journey fraught with thrilling  almost nail biting anxiety as viewed in the mind of a genius   hnk lkthyr lltHdth  nh fy hdhh lrwy   km  nWy  rGb b d  qrth ywman m lkn s ktfy lan blt lyq  l  lklmt l khyr  mnh  wlkn hn tbd  qSW un  khr   qS  tjdWd nsn shyy an b d

una palabra  que no solo los grandes hombres  sino aquellos que se elevan  por poco que sea  por encima del nivel medio  y que son capaces de decir algo nuevo  son por naturaleza  e incluso inevitablemente  criminales  en un grado variable  como es natural  Si no lo fueran  les seria dificil salir de la rutina  No quieren permanecer en ella  y yo creo que no lo deben hacer    F  Dostoievski A beautiful but dark story about human depravity  It brings to mind Romans 3   Their throat is an open grave  they use their tongues to deceive  The venom of asps is under their lips  Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness  Their feet are swift to shed blood  in their paths are ruin and misery  and the way of peace they have not known  There is no fear of God before their eyes   It s a gritty tale of the poverty stricken Raskolnikov who commits murder early on and battles internally with the overpowering guilt of the crime  The characters and their interaction with each other are so well developed it s engrossing  The tense scene of the reading of the Lazarus miracle is sticking with me  Is there any redemption or hope to be found here  Great book  for the mind There is a reason that this is one of the most famous books ever written  it is amazing from start to finish  The first section of the book is as thrilling as the last section is devilishly paranoid  Porfiry Porfirovich is the most hilarious detective you will ever read about  Dark  deep and interesting  I thought this novel may be the death of me  but I finally finished  It is not for the weak at heart and takes some commitment  I d comment on it more directly  but I have a feeling I may need to read it again to get everything I may have missed in this particular translation   Oh what a book  I couldn t put it down  I ve thought of it a thousand times  It allows you into the mind of someone moral and accessible and then leads you along through the thought processes and justifications of a terrible crime  It s just fascinating  I honestly never would have picked this book up on my own  It was recommended by a friend and I took a chance  I really enjoyed it  There was so much internal struggle  that I never got bored  I am surprised to say that I loved it  and would even consider reading it again  Though I have to say that it was really the experience of reading it WITH my students as I taught my first ever AP class and then discovering David Matual s article   In Defense of the Epilogue  that really helped me fall in love with this book  Think something is wrong here as  Leo  was not Dostoevsky s first name but it was Tolstoy s  However trusting that this book is the genuine article and there has been some mistake here   I read the Garnett translation last year as an e book long after my high school reading  and could remember practically nothing   obviously I wasn t ready for it then  To me it is the first of Dostoevsky s great novels  not only because of the interest in the Raskolnikov theory of criminal rights  but for its contrast with Svidrigailov  who practised more than Raskolnikov preached but nonetheless committed suicide despite wealth  arrogance and the freedom to do as he liked The description of the alcoholic is perhaps the best in all literature  with an understanding that penetrates to the heart of this unfortunate condition  I am a so called  recovering alcoholic  so know something about this  Overall this is a book about conscience and its slow  grinding working on the guilty human personality  I am not sure that it is true of a lot of criminals  and Dostoevsky portrays some of these in his quasi fictional House of the Dead   some people just lack the conscience to feel bad about what other people find quite deplorable behaviour  In my thriller about Russia The Russian Idea  that includes discussion of Dostoevsky  the villains are well and truly beyond this sort of thing   but I try to keep an open mind about it The true heroine of this book  Sonia  is a wonderful human being  I have read this all the way through twice and skimmed it a few times  like most classics  there is a mass of propaganda spewed over what this book is and isn t supposed to mean  the themes  and the motivations of the main characters  Luckily  Dostoyevsky tells such a raw and engrossing tale with a memorable cast  that it dwarfs its hype  I expected this to be a chore when I first read it  but after page 33 it flew by and I was sneaking it around at work   Non sono all altezza di parlare di questo capolavoro  ma lo faccio comunque  Perche  Perche questo libro mi ha cambiato Non ho mai letto molto prima di questo libro  Accidenti  Non leggevo nulla  Per me leggere e sempre stata un enorme perdita di tempo finche nelle mie mani non e arrivato il caro Fyodor Non so quale forza astrale mi spinse a chiedere disperatamente a mio padre di comprarmi la versione modalita  mattone   Un volume spaventoso che malgrado l aspetto nefasto mi avvinse  Due anni fa circa se non di piu sarebbe stato il mio primo grande MATTONE di libro  una sorta di ostacolo da valicare per dimostrare a me stesso di essere    no  vabbeh  Volevo leggerlo  semplicemente Feci bene  benissimo  La miglior cosa di sempre Cosa avrei fatto senza Delitto e Castigo  Senza Rodion Sarei rimasto un ameba  Si  un ameba Questo libro mi ha iniziato alla lettura  Lo lessi la prima volta in 4 giorni senza capire nulla della parte psicoanalitica  ma la storia mi aveva assorbito l anima e non riuscivo a capire come lo scrittore riuscisse a descrivere cosi magnificamente ogni cosa  Ci provai anche io  fallendo  Ovviamente Successivamente  il senso di colpa per non aver colto qualcosa  a very deep unexplicable feeling  mi porto a rileggerlo e ne rimasi fulminato  Durante la prima lettura ero riuscito a travisare talmente tante cose che neanche sapevo se ne potessere fraintendere cosi tante in 677 pagine Solo in quel momento io capii la GRANDEZZA  Questo libro mi ha portato a leggere molte altre cose soprattutto filosofia  ma anche classici  Fu cosi che mi innamorai dei classici e un mondo si apri ai miei occhi Non capisco come la gente si permetta di vivere senza aver letto questo libro  sto enfatizzando Con mia gioia assoluta pochi giorni fa ho dovuto  meglio  potuto  dato che non ne vedevo l ora  rileggerlo per scuola e ho avuto la possibilita di soddisfare questa mia propensione all affermazione di me e  nonostante avessi letto e riletto quel libro  solo dopo essermi ritrovato a dare spiegazioni alla gioventu a me circostante ho capito altre cose sulla storia  sui personaggi  su Dostoevskij Amo questo libro perche e un continuo insegnamento  In evoluzione nella storia  Eterno  a questo punto ci starebbe bene un  amen   ma non ho capito dove questo mio commento voleva andare a parare  forse da nessuna parte  Volevo compiacermi  volevo pensare ad alta voce   EXCELENTE NOVELA PSICOLOGICA  NUESTRO PERSONAJE PRINCIPAL QUE SE VE SUMIDO EN LA DESESPERACION Y LAS CONTRACCIONES MENTALES QUE LO VAN ARROJANDO CADA VEZ MAS EN UN MUNDO QUE BORDEA LA LOCURA Y QUE AL MISMO TIEMPO QUE LAS IDEAS COMIENZAN COMO FICCIONES AL TOMAR RUMBO LA ACCION ESTAS FICCIONES TOMAN UN TINTE REAL Y APARECE EL ASESINATO  TANTO DE LA USURERA DE SU ACREEDORA COMO DE LA HERMANA DE LA MISMA  IGUAL QUE UN INVITADO INESPERADO A LA HORA DE DORMIR  FASCINANTE PIEZA LITERARIA  DISFRUTE MUCHO LEERLA   y lytny kntu trb  Phenomenal exploration of the human condition A stunning examination into the mind of a murderer and also into mankinds removal of God from society  Dark  twisted  and corrupting  Dostoevsky s masterpiece is a must read for every person who has ever been interested in the subject of crime  and examination of one s soul      bambaska bir sey yon verdi ellerime  bir an once ogrenmek istedigim bir sey vardi  Ben de herkes gibi bir bit miydim  yoksa bir insan mi  Onume cikan engeli asabilir miydim  asamaz miydim  Egilip iktidari yerden almaya cesaret edebilecek miydim  edemeyecek miydim  Titreyen bir yaratik miydim  yoksa haklari olan biri mi     I was so impressed with this book  You feel the muggy sticky oppressive heat and are pulled through the agony of a person who not only has a conscience but who s pride is battered  I can t add much to the thousands of scholars out there but put that collecters edition of Twilight down and pick this book up  you ll be glad you did  Wonderful book  Amazing descriptions of a St Petersburg from another time which can still be found there today and a story with a challenging moral question at its heart  A book that genuinely makes you think   At first  I hated this book with a passion  It took me a very long time to get into it and I struggled immensely at the density of the words  I didn t understand that this was a product of the madness of the protagonist an upon this realisation  I found myself flying through the book with abetter understanding of the plot and the characters  either that  or I bought a poor translation   I think the book offers fascinating insights into post Emancipation Russia and I enjoyed the philosophical digressions  Well worth a read  through this i hav started my journey with russian literature    the best book i have ever read     Masterful   A psychological debauchery of ideas  emotions and hypochondria that will drive the reader mad  if not witless  It provides access into the mind of a criminal who doesn t consider his act a crime  and thus feel no remorse for it  Makes you think and wonder  What is crime  really  And does punitive action really appease a guilty conscience  The main character is at the same time the narrator  which made it a bit confusing  for me  at the start of the story  There is a lot of narration and monologue  and shifts frequently between reality and imagination  All the characters in the story play intriguing roles that build up the protagonist s mental derangement  and later help resolve his inner conflict  It is amazing how this book is still as relevant to present day society as it was at the time of its first publication  which was ages ago  I should say this is a must read piece of work as it is highly thought provoking and somewhat entertaining  These Russian lit classics are truly goodreads  Truly a masterpiece and the foundation of existentialism  Dostoyevky s theme  as carried out by Roskolnikov  that there are only followers or criminals resonates throughout human history  And  that in examining criminals  or perhaps more specifically  crime   there exists either those who have successfully transformed society  for better or worse  or those who are merely petty criminals I recommend this as an introduction to  a  Dostoyevksy and  b  existentialism  This book was a rough read  Unfortunately  I left the USSR too early to get a good education  so I had to read this book in English  But even in English  you can feel Radion s torment  I often found myself siding with Radion  even in his most demented mind  I found the police chief to be the enemy  Dostoyevsky is a good friggin  writer   Oh my  Even though I d read the novel  and not even that long ago  reading this translation was like reading the book for the first time  Incredibly un daunting  and achingly beautiful   Sometimes I feel like I am a Dostoyevsky character  Dostoevsky masterfully enters psychology  morality  philosophy all in an intensely interesting murder story  choosing a narrative style which is intimately tied to said murderer s conscious  Here my love of Dostoevsky began   3 Reading this was much less of an ordeal than I was expecting  Dostoyevsky often gets put in the same basket as Kafka  but as far as I can make out he has far more in common with fellow Russian authors like Gogol and Bulgakov  Given how the whole book revolves around the guilty conscience of protagonist Raskolnikov following his murder of an old lady for reasons of personal ideology I can see why Dostoyevsky is commonly associated with existentialism  but ultimately I think C P is better off taken at face value  without all the baggage associated with that philosophy  A brilliantly rich black comedy  I m sure Dostoyevsky will be thrilled to discover I awarded  Crime and Punishment  five stars  The philosophy is brilliant  but the writing itself  at times  is lackluster  I typically want my author to love language as much as I do  The brevity  and what amounts to a style of no verbal beauty  at least in English lol   but only the simplest use of words possible to express an undeniable intellectual elegance and power  I m certain  was purposeful  About all that yellow  If the idea is to replicate the beating of the horse in Raskolnikov s dream  it is a brilliant note or joke  My inclination is to think it is an overbearing metaphor  about which  as a reader  I cannot help but feel a little insulted  Brilliant or insulting  I have no idea  The end I found to be a little disappointing  but genius  all in all  Whoa        stupendo classico ognuno di noi lo deve avere nella sua libreria lo stato d animo del protagonista descritto dall autore in maniera ineccepibile tutti i suoi rimorsi rancori scelte e la scoperta dell amore per Sonia anche lei dalla vita provata ma sempre pronta ad affrontarla con piu

psychological and social journey through a conflicted man s psyche  A big draggy from time to time  but it s also purposefully so at times  making you really understand how bogged down in guilt the

assentada todos os livros que temos em espera e de ter tido oportunidade de conhecer alguns autores mais cedo e este  meus caros leitores  e um desses momentos  Depois de tantos anos de ter ouvido falar de Fiodor Dostoievski e de o ter abordado por alto em aulas de Filosofia e Sociologia  finalmente chegou o momento de ler uma das suas obras de referencia que  estou mais que convencida  foi o primeiro de muitos livros deste autor ha de me passar pelas maos Com um olhar incisivo sobre a natureza humana  Dostoievski acompanha o drama de Raskolnikov em Petersburgo  um jovem que mata uma velha agiota e a sua irma num episodio delirante  Mais do que narrar o percurso que o protagonista percorre numa luta consigo mesmo  Dostoievski expoe nos uma personagem solida e coerente que  mais do que tridimensional  e dotada de alma e de consciencia  tema o qual e explorado de forma muito curiosa e cativante por Antonio Damasio e David Lodge  numa tentativa de compreender o processo pelo qual os autores passam para dotar as suas personagens de um enorme realismo e humanismo   mas este tema fica para mais tarde  Complexo  sensivel  autentico  Raskolnikov luta com os seus fantasmas desde o momento em que pondera a hipotese de matar a velha numa tentativa de melhorar a sua vida ao lhe roubar o dinheiro que fazia ao se aproveitar da miseria alheia  E curioso perceber como o castigo do protagonista comeca ainda antes de cometer o crime  o que reflecte claramente a presenca de uma consciencia e da capacidade de distinguir o bem do mal  e como a sua penitencia aumenta exponencialmente de dia para dia  Ao longo do tempo  e a cada virar de pagina  o autor explora esta luta interior e partilha connosco todos e quaisquer motivos para tanta dor  Afinal  qual foi a causa do crime e com que luta Raskolnikov depois de o cometer  Vive arrependido por ter tirado duas vidas ou vive apavorado por ser descoberto  Enquanto coloca a personagem a desesperar por uma solucao numa perspectiva  micro   o autor consegue nitidamente gerar duvidas na mente dos leitores de forma mais lata  E a exposicao da sensibilidade da natureza humana em todo o seu esplendor Num contexto social altamente sensivel  o protagonista carrega a sua cruz sozinho enquanto tenta sobreviver parcamente na Petersburgo do seculo XIX  cenario o qual acaba por adquirir qualidades de uma personagem  pode ser visto como a causa  e nao apenas contexto  para o crime cometido e como companhia do nosso protagonista enquanto deambula pelas suas ruas a procura de uma solucao  Neste devaneio  enquanto se perde no seu dilema  vamos conhecendo a sua familia e amigos de forma gradual  o que atribui solidez e realismo a toda a narrativa  vamos conhecendo as pessoas e as suas historias a medida que Raskolnikov as procura  sendo esse contacto o momento de introducao de novas personagens Em poucas palavras   Crime e castigo  e um livro apaixonante que deve ser lido com olhar critico para ser devidamente apreciado  As minhas proximas leituras serao  sem sombra de duvida  obras deste autor  que e reconhecido pela sua capacidade de expor tao delicada e  ainda assim  cruamente  a natureza do Homem  tSf

protagonista Raskolnikov que es uno de los mas interesantes que haya leido  This book hurt my brain  I was troubled and confused by the contridictory actions of the main character  the frenetic writing style  and the confounding Russian names  It took me months to read  I m exhausted  I have suffered  And I am finally free  I absolutely fell for Dostoievsky s writing   Crime and Punishment  seems to me like a perfect novel to catch a glimpse of Russian literature  Compelling  aesthetically pleasant and thought provoking   Crime and punishment considered by many as the magnum opus of Dostoevsky  graphically essays the tragic tale of murder  guilt  suffering and redemption  unfolding in an utmost dismal setting of St  Petersburg of the mid 19th century The central character of the story is Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoff   a man with little means oftener found lost in reverie gets possessed with an idea  a theory of his own about   extraordinary men being above the law   and in order to bring    new thoughts    into the society they have a moral license or authority to even deprive a man from his basic right to live   He then sets out to put his theory into practice and as a consequence murders an old woman  The story gyrates around this murder  Through raskolnikoff Dostoevsky provides an in depth exploration of the psychology of a criminal  The inner world of Raskolnikoff  with all of its doubts  deleria  second guessing  fear  and despair  is the heart of the story  Dostoevsky does not lay emphasis on the actual repercussions of the murder but the way the murder forces Raskolnikoff to deal with tormenting guilt  Indeed  by focusing so little on Raskolnikoff s imprisonment  he seems to suggest that the actual punishment by law is much less terrible than the stress and anxiety of trying to avoid this punishment  Further through the portrayal of extreme guilt  suffering accompanied with love Dostoevsky paves the way for raskolnikoff s redemption from the crime committedNot only raskolnikoff but other characters especially the soft and timid Sonia  the beautiful and strong willed Dounia  the quite enigmatic Svidrigailoff   the shrewd and astute magistrate Porphyrius are also very eloquently painted by the author  The novel has all the ingredients of an engrossing read   Great men smash laws  Smash old ways in order to create new ones Great men are not afraid to be criminals  This is the short cut that an intelligent student wrote about a theory he was expounding   referring to extraordinary men being above the law  since in their brilliance they think  new thoughts  and so contribute to society Anyhow  He then sets out to prove his theory by murdering an old pawnbroker and her sister Some words that toughed my feelings   I killed only a filthy money lender A louse I m only going to confess because I am a cowered  A mediocrity   I have not killed any children I have not raped any young women I am not part of any advanced army   separating children from their mothers wives from their husbands What Dostoevsky is really trying to reveal is not the crime its self or the punishment that the criminal deserves from the law   but indeed it s the psychological analysis that goes beyond the crime which torturing the murderer which evokes his humanity and make him either to confess his crime or become simply insane  What I really love about this novel is that Dostoevsky is trying to reveal something about the human condition which is   The more we intellectualize  the more imprisoned we become   It might be twenty years since last read C P  I thought I knew this book  but now it seems I knew nothing  I reread it now because I was interested in the character of Svidrigailov  having just renewed an acquaintance with Banville s Axel Vander  Is it just grey hairs that opened my eyes to Dostoevsky s novel this time  I don t know  I m still processing it  But it was well worth rereading again  everytime i remember this book  it also remind me of The Trial by Franz Kafka The feeling I got from reading this is that Dostoyevsky no doubt had a painfully revealing understanding of human nature and its mind s psychology  And whether or not it is a fact to be frowned upon  I identified with his lead character all too well     From the beginning to the end you watch as psychological forces eat away at the thoughts and actions of their victim causing him to finally confess to the hideous crime he has committed  The story is basically the struggle between Raskolnikov s theory and his conscience which make him confess to his crime  Dostoevsky s genius is in describing how Raskolnikov struggles in his thoughts and actions  His thoughts become increasingly disjointed and desperate and his actions show that he has an increasing need to escape the uncertainty of being convicted  to talk about the crime  to confess  and to suffer for his crime  It is even at times humorous the extent to which Raskolnikov at times becomes confused in his bungled yet undiscovered crime  My favorite book of all time  A great story of redemption  In the novel Namesake  Ashok s grandfather tells him to always  trust the Russians   Damn good advice he gives him there  Every piece of Russian literature I have read till now is adequate proof  and this novel just reaffirms this belief  What irks me though is that  it took me so long to discover Dostoyevsky  Anyway  now that I did discover him  I plan on reading every thing he has ever written   Same pinch Tarun  he he The novel depicts the journey of Raskolnikov  the main protagonist  After losing his position in the university due to lack of funds  he becomes a prey to all the new ideas floating around in Russia at that time  He thinks that he can rationalize murder  and not feel any guilt and the whole book focuses on this journey from arrogance to repentance  Dostoyevsky is deliberate in his criticism of hyper rationalism  He also successfully explores other themes like women sacrificing themselves for their family  Dounia and Sonya   and the hypocrisy of individuals in letting them do so  Dounia s mother and the Marmeladovas   Along with Raskolnikov  he has also done a good job in developing other characters  Svidrigailov especially  was a very very interesting character  almost as much as Raskolnikov himself   Loved the cat and mouse games between Rodia  that s Raskolnikov  and the police inspector and the dreams and the meaning behind them After all this praise perhaps it s not logical of me to whine about the names  But I plan on doing so anyway  Why is a person mentioned as Razmikhin in one scene an as Dmitri Prokofich in another  Is it not enough to have teeth shattering names in the first place  But  no  they have to have 3 part names  and nick names too  So a person is called Luzhin in one scene  Pyotr Petrovich in another  try to say that 5 times quickly   Also  out so all the numerous Russian names out here  one character has to be named Zametoff and another Zosimoff  One is called  Porfiry Petrovich another Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin  Also  this book can really use an editor  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED though  totally worth the hard work and patience   Protagonist is very well drawn  Memorable characters  Interesting take on human condition and  new age  philosophy  I wish the editor of the edition I read wasn t so heavy on the footnotes  some parts even referred to events that hadn t happened yet in the book fucking brilliant  duh mami  i feel like anything i say about this book is going to be redundant  read it   Todos los veranos me propongo un reto en lo que a lecturas se refiere  Bueno  no todos  puede que este ano haya sido el primero  pero  que mas da  Por lo general suelo decir lo tipico de  este verano aprovechare para leer mucho mas de lo que he podido leer durante el curso  Sin embargo  estas vacaciones la cosa cambio  Dado que gran parte de mi tiempo libre iba a pasarlo metida en la biblioteca  estudiando para recuperar las asignaturas que me habian quedado para septiembre  el tema de la lectura estaba un poco mas complicado  Lo unico que se me ocurrio ante tal panorama fue  no retarme a leer tropecientos mil libros  sino a comenzar Crimen y castigo de Dostoievski y acabarlo antes de la llegada del otono La edicion con la que yo contaba era del Circulo de Lectores del ano de Maria Castana  lo que implicaba que las letras eran minusculas y que el interlineado todavia no habia sido descubierto  Lejos de echarme para atras estos pequenos detalles  me entraron mas ganas de leerlo  de demostrarme que podia con un tocho asi  Sin embargo  y ahora es cuando me quito el poco merito que tiene leer al senor Friodor   todo fue coser y cantar  muy en contra de que pensaba en un principio Si bien la primera parte  hay seis en total  se me hizo algo pesada  fue pasara a la segunda y sentir una urgencia irrefrenable por saber que pasaba a continuacion  por conocer cual iba a ser el siguiente movimiento de Raskolnikov  Y es que  a pesar de lo minusculas que podrian ser las letras y de lo extenso del libro  la historia que narra atrapa casi desde el primer hachazo que el protagonista le da a la vieja usurera  Dostoievski traza una senda a traves de las distintas fases emocionales y psicologicas que Rodia atraviesa tras llevar a cabo el asesinato  y lo hace de manera magistral  como solo un genio sabe hacerlo Crimen y castigo no es un libro en el cual vayamos a encontrarnos con una trama digna de novela negra  desde el principio se sabe quien  como y cuando ha llevado a cabo el asesinato  Lo que Crimen y castigo hace es conducirnos a traves de la psicologia de un personaje extremadamente misantropo con unos aires de grandeza que ve como poco a poco su talento se va consumiendo entre las cuatro paredes de la ruinosa habitacion que alquila con el poco dinero que sus madre y hermana pueden mandarle  El castigo al que hace referencia el titulo no es otro que el castigo que el mismo Raskolnikov se impone de manera inconsciente  la sensacion de nerviosismo  de desprecio  de confusion que tiene en todo momento  la necesidad de autoconvencerse de que todo va bien  de que no tiene nada que temer aunque sabe que el mas leve indicio puede llevarlo directo al fracaso Pero no todo queda en el protagonista  en torno a el giran otros personajes de igual complejidad  cada uno con sus propias cargas y pesares  Sonia  Razumijin  Dunia    y Svidigrailov  Este ultimo aparece casi al final de la novela y desempena un papel decisivo en ella  Es el antagonista que no llega a ser del todo malvado  hasta sus actos resultan humanos si nos paramos a reflexionar sobre ellos  sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta cual es su final y lo amargo de este La verdad es que me alegro de haberme propuesto leer este libro antes del 21 de septiembre  aunque haya apurado hasta el dia antes   porque Crimen y castigo es una obra redonda  se mire por donde se mire  Absolute Classic    not to be missed  I read this book about a year ago and it still  haunts  me  It was a real life changing book  Doestoyevski makes you look at evil and good in it s blackest and whitest  and come to terms with it within the same person  My mind wouldn t quit on this one   although Pete saw it MUCH deeper  I will be reading it again someday  Alright  it might not have been this copy  but the book was amazing  So intense and extremely well written  I love a good classic  and this definitely qualifies as an amazing classic  Everybody should read it  It s a classic for a reason  lktb ldhy j lny  kwn f l km knt  ryd  n  kwn    tjbrt  mm kl lqwnyyn    rGm  ny drst  lm lqnwn wlkn b d  n qr t ljrymh wl qb  yqnt b n kl m qr th   flydhhb l  ljHym

and Punishment is an in depth exploration of what it means to be an unstable young intellectual with all the makings of greatness   and none of the emotional maturity to attain it  This theme speaks to my generation and at least the previous two American generations More than that  the book has it all  crime  philosophy  love  comedy  drama  suspense  historical perspective  Dostoyevsky took a picture of St  Petersburg and made an incredible story  I will avoid and spoilers and say to any lovers of literature  I can t recommend this book enough   ilk basta on yargili oldugum fakat daha sonra beni icine ceken defalarca okunabilecek muhtesem bir eser   One of the deepest analysis about human nature  Dostoyevsky portrayed a tormented being  compelled by his inner drives and desires to commit murder because he felt in a superior position  It was like getting inside Raskolnikov s very complex soul and get involved in the moral questioning he maintains throughout the book  This was one of the books that made me think differently  it s a masterpiece all along  I positively adore this book  It is quite possibly my favourite book in the entire world  an impressive feat The perspective in this book was amazingly done  Through the prose  the madness of Raskolnikov became very real and relatable  it almost seemed as if you were going mad along with him  The description of his room was something that provided depth for his madness  Svidrigailov s madness  though of a different flavour  was also convincing The only character who I had a problem with was Sonya  She and Raskolnikov didn t spend that much time together  it seemed  before she decided to go to Siberia with him  I suppose there just wasn t much to leave   Raskolnikov had told her  harshly  how what she was doing was in vain  how there wasn t a future in St  Petersburg for her  It still seems odd that she would follow him to Siberia  but in the moment with the way it was written  it didn t seem odd at all There was a religious theme in the book  but I felt that that was actually very secondary to the main message of the book  The main message  to me  seemed to be an exploration of guilt on the human mind  It was more that Raskolnikov had to be forgiven by himself and Sonya   someone he cared about  In the book  Sonya seems to turn him to religion  but I don t think that that was the main message  or at least not how I chose to interpret it I think Dostoevsky is an excellent writer  not that that is a very controversial opinion  His style is  of course  a bit melodramatic  but that s to be expected  He is  after all  Dostoevsky  The first one I read from Dostoyevsky  I was only 14 and it was the age where doubting in everything started to flourish in me  I do think that the book added a lot to my charachter  Every time I reread it  the cruelest and striking part was the dream with the horse   Shiver goes down my spine even if I think at it      A book that was incredibly impactful upon me and my journey to Orthodoxy in college  I was in many ways nervous to return  Just as wonderful the second time  although I d forgotten how very Dostoevskian it was   my memory had glossed over those parts  her 3 yilda bir yeniden I love dostoyevsky s work  He is one of the greatest author s in history  He takes you for an exhilarating journey through the human psychi and opens your awareness to the effect of thoughts and experiences on human behavior  A must read for psych majors  A true classic    I would  however  recommend reading the Pevear Volokhonsky translation  Pevear and Volokhonsky are a husband and wife team  they have also translated Anna Karenina  also excellent  and The Brothers Karamazov  on my to read list   Few books I will read twice  This is the second time I read this book and still find Dostoyevsky s insight into human behavior exceptional  Last week I started reading a novel by Dostoevsky and I couldn t stop reading  So gripping  well written and full of tension  It is an intriguing plot  with no obvious outcome though it is clear that doom lies ahead  One is closely connected to the psychology of the main character and one goes up and down with his hopes and despair  Crime and Punishment did put Dostoevsky at the forefront of Russian writers when it appeared in 1866 and rightly so  It is one of the most famous and influential novels in world literature and I do now understand why  Though it has been written 150 years ago  the story will get under your skin and will fill your mind rapidly   I read this book for a 6 week Sierra College class on Dostoevsky  It s considered a classic in literature and requires a great deal of thought and discussion to understand the plot  characters and dozens of twists and turns the story takes  One of the darkest books ever written and a great look into the misery suffered by the Russian lower classes during the populist uprisings of the 1850 s  Great book but very difficult to read  Read three times  Will read again  Not a lot happens and yet a lot happens  It s a tragedy and a comedy  Raskolnikov is rich and impoverished  an intellectual and an idiot  Great ending   Hace mas de un ano que guardaba este libro en mi biblioteca  Sentia que no estaba preparado aun  y razon no me faltaba  Es dificil condensar las ideas y ensenanzas que el gran Dostoievski dejo en este libro  mostrando la psiquis humana de una forma increible   asi como tambien los sentimientos que expreso  desde aquella experiencia propia en Siberia   Es un libro muy duro  sirve para entender como era la epoca de la Rusia zarista  pero al mismo tiempo sirve para entender a nuestra sociedad actualmente  Las clases baja y media  sumamente estresadas y con muchos menos privilegios que la clase acomodada  pasan por la ignominia de quebrantar la ley como consecuencia de esto   En el libro Raskolnikov justifico el hecho de matar a la usurera diciendo que habia matado a un  parasito   a causa del mal que habia causado por su avaricia   y al ser un librepensador  no queria alejarse de su teoria de que existian personas  comunes  y otras que no lo eran  las que debian desobedecer la ley para cumplir con sus objetivos  segun el   nobles    Realizando aquel asesinato  trataba de encontrar a que categoria pertenecia  descubriendo que el no era mas que una persona  comun   y mas adelante  redimiendose de sus pecados con Sofia Semionovna  encontro una nueva vida  notese el valor existencial que Dostoievski le otorgo a la religion   En fin  un libro que deja incontables ensenanzas y que nos pone a pensar hasta el punto de dejarnos asombrados  At the first glance  a title such as  crime and punishment  could catch the attention of the reader and then it brings to the mind the simple interrogative question that what is the crime and what is the punishment afterwards  by which Fyodor Dostoyevsky introduces his novel to us  This point should be admitted that we are not presented with kind of a straightforward novel  one that we clearly know the motives that drive the crime and the exact punishment of it  Crime and Punishment is a story about sort of a moral dilemma and a confession which twists the reader s mind in many directions and at the very end we could hardly say this is the first and the last interpretation of this novel  Rodion Raskolnikov  the novel s protagonist  commits two murders based on his theory that in some particular instances  particular persons who are intellectually higher than common people  have the right to kill worthless persons on utilitarian grounds  After committing murder he goes through a hard emotional and mental crisis and becomes more and more alienated from society  We may think because Rasklinkove has an intellectual character and this is in itself kind of a burden on his shoulder and consummates him so extensive that then just the very act of putting his theory to the test could unload him emotionally and psychologically  but if we base our analysis upon this explanation  then how could we explain Raskolinkov s confession in police station when there doesn t exist any fact and evidence against him  And then what s the function of his mysterious and ironical confessions to different persons at different intervals  Are we granted by novel s discourse to suppose that his confession has a religious function generally speaking  confession has deep roots in religious beliefs and it has been recommended in different religions  But it also could be investigated psychologically and since there are different readings for this novel  it is more logical to consider this viewpoint too and explain these confessions on the basis of both of them  i e  psychological and religious vantage point The religious analysis of Raskolinkov s confessionNearly right from the beginning we know Rasklinkove doesn t believe in God and all through the novel he challenges his friends  beliefs at different opportunities  At different hysterical moments  he struggles to confess his crime to different persons  but he fails to articulate himself clearly until the moment he confesses clearly and completely to Sonia  who is a person with common religious beliefs  Actually  the true cause of this trust in Sonia is not because she is religious  but because she is good natured and could bear and accept others  beliefs which are rather different with her own  as it was mentioned before  Raskolinkov is an atheist  a utilitarian one  who also during a conversation with Sonia mocks her belief in God and wants to challenge her beliefs so that she understands that even sacrificing herself forsake of her family is a great sin at the end of the novel  to Sonia  he explains   Did I murder that old woman  I murdered myself  not her         I t was the devil that killed the old woman  not I   and Sonia says to him  Go at once  this very minute  stand at the cross roads  bow down  first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud   I am a murderer   Then God will send you life again   after hearing these remarks  Raskolinkove says  You mean Siberia  Sonia  I must give myself up   and Sonia answers  Suffer and expiate your sin by it  that s what you must do   after changing these words with Sonia he immediately goes to police station to confess his crime but he suddenly and unexpectedly gets informed that Svidrigailov has shot himself  so shocked by this news  he leaves there without confessing and sees Sonia with kind of a  look of poignant agony  of despair  in her face   at front of himself and for the second time goes to the police station and confesses to his crime Although through the trial s process he says to the judge that repentance was the reason for his confession  but the same day that he goes to police station to confess  he says to his sister  Dounia   I am going at once to give myself up  But I don t know why         This indicates that he still doesn t consider the act of murdering as a crime and justifies it on utilitarian grounds  at the end of the novel  at the epilogue  we perceive that he still considers himself innocent and the narrator represents us with his state of conscience    Oh  how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself        But he judged himself severely  and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past         Even when he finally begins reading the bible which Sonia gave him at his request for it in the prison  there is not any evidence that he s faith in God  He takes the bible up MECHANICALLY  as if he is encountered with an inevitable process by which rebellious souls gets surrounded to the common sense reasons for reading bible  or for believing God  So for another time  we are represented with a metamorphosed version of Darwin s theory of the  survival of the fittest   that here the fittest is defined and conditioned by common sense or governmental authority  Although based upon the novel s discourse  it seems psychological function of confession is more powerful than the religious one and could be traced word by word through whole of the work  but it seems that novel s discourse s created an alloy in which it is difficult to separate the psychological from religious material  On the whole  it s felt that reading the novel just from a unique viewpoint turns all the faculties and powerful points of the it into a wasted effort and destroys all the hopes to claim that as a great one  This religious aspect of novel in some ways could be connected with the psychological aspect in such a manner that there is room to claim that the whole episodes concerned with religious beliefs are contrived in a way that at the end we could interpret the protagonist s mental struggle to confess mostly as a psychological one The psychological function of Raskolinkov s confessionIt must be a wonderful trust to know that it was discovering the significant role of confession that gave birth to Sigmund Freud s Psychoanalysis  Freud noticed that those patients who speak to another person about their private dreams  memories and problems get their mental health very sooner than others Crime and punishment is also mainly the story of confession  and this confession as the focal point of the story could be twisted in many different ways  Reading between the lines  the reader comes to this conclusion that what flows under the surface of these all incidents and dialogues of characters  is the manipulation of a criminal psych Psychologically speaking  our protagonist is a smooth and intellectual criminal  an alienated youth  a melancholy and poverty stricken ex student  who is capable of killing to regenerate himself  anew  This regeneration begins during the very time when Raskolinkov passes his time mostly in a silent and dark garret  when he has nothing to eat  and little by little gets the most dangerous impressions of a solitary and secluded life  the dangerous idea of becoming a superman  At last he plans a detailed crime to kill the old pawnbroker woman  After committing the crime  he justifies his crime on utilitarian grounds but this is just a temporary excuse not a potent one  which at intervals calms his mental struggle down for a short time  It is fear that like the cerebrospinal fluid flows in the backbone of the novel and in long time moves the story along  This fear dominates the novel and is the major drive which causes our smooth criminal to confess  Raskolinkov  at the end is a new human who has been regenerated from this fear  He is sort of a criminal who at the time of going to the pawnbroker woman s house  avoids strangers  looks and always suspects his friends of knowing his secret  He interprets the mimic of others  face as a sign of being caught in a hidden trap  What causes this kind of thought is the psych of our criminal who lives in an omniscient state  He thinks all the world know his secret  so he goes to different peoples and speaks of his secret in a fractured language to test their knowledge  and sometimes to unload his mental pressure  We learn at the end of the novel that if he delays to confession  it is because he can t stand himself have been stripped of that glorious cover of that specific pride which is the main cover of a wretched person like him in rages  When he becomes sure that there is not enough evidence against him and the persons who know him as criminal never betray him  he finally confess at police station and maybe because this is again fear which drives him to confess  When he gets informed of Svidrigailov s suicide  the fear of death becomes more tangible and this is the very moment which he finally confesses to his crime  Meanwhile  Porfiry  the intelligent attorney  asks Raskolinkov why he doesn t confess and says to him   Why  is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of         Ach  hang it   Here we are represented with another drive of confession  As it was already mentioned  Raskolinkov is a rebellious young man  one who is against the conventional standards of social life  so he makes great strives to show his disgust at social labels by which his hesitance to confession may causes for himself  It s possible to analyze his confession as a glitzy show of his morality as an atheist murderer who accepts the failure of his theory and ideals  one who confesses just because of the fear of being considered as a timid man by persons who know his secret  At another time  Profiry irritates Raskilonkov by involving him in speaking about the murder and at the end he says to Raskilonkov that your confession eventually comes out naturally and this is the master key of that door which leads us to the philosophy of the confession in novel  So confession is inevitable and the criminal s psych at any condition needs it to live a new life  the very life at the other side of the prison s wall which awaits Raskolinkov and what if he avoids confession and lives with his secret at the bottom of his heart  Besides it s very hard to stand this secret  it s also impossible for a human being to be indifference to the interior mental struggle of himself herself and does it possible to live in such a way  9 1 11   I m not sure how many times I ve read this novel  but the first time was my senior year in high school  I loved it then and I love it now  but I think for entirely different reasons  I m currently reading it again and I still like it and I always hope that my students understand how awesome it is I can t remember when I finished it  but I still love it  I am going to commit classics blasphemy and say that I think it is flawed  but really  the writing and the imagination and the iconic characters really put it way above most other literature I have ever read  anyway  I m torn between loving the delightful and kind Razumihin and the cheerfully and openly corrupt Svirigailov  I like all the characters  but these are my faves  This classic delivers great philosophical meat as I expected from Dostoyevsky  It was a pleasant surprise to find this contained some white knuckle  heart pounding suspenseful moments as well  Probably the first time I ve felt that way reading a classic   Delitto e Castigo e uno dei piu celebri scritti della letteratura mondiale e le ragioni sono infinite  Nonostante sia intriso di pensieri e ragionamenti piuttosto complessi spesso impliciti  mascherati dalle vicende e dai pensieri del personaggio  lo stile e scorrevole e mai pesante  Si puo leggere la storia in due chiavi diverse  seguendo le vicende vere e proprie come se fosse un romanzo poliziesco  oppure cercando significati e spiegazioni profonde  quindi come un romanzo psicologico filosofico  I temi trattati dono sempre attuali  si analizza infatti come si possa raggiungere la salvezza attraverso la sofferenza  quale sia il ruolo della fede negli animi degli uomini  cio che spinge davvero un uomo  in questo caso il protagonista  a compiere un delitto e cio che succede in seguito  il pentimento  l orgoglio  la paura della morte e quella di non raggiungere il proprio obiettivo di essere qualcuno  il fallimento  la miseria    Insomma  questioni negative che portano ad un finale totalmente diverso ma molto  molto significativo  tanto da essere uno dei principali messaggi del romanzo  E necessario dare molta importanza a tutti i personaggi  poiche ognuno e l incarnazione di un idea  di un modo di vivere e seguendo il suo percorso vengono alla luce molte particolarita importanti e ricche di significato  Possiamo dire che quest opera e in grado di andare fino in fondo all animo umano  metterne in risalto i difetti  le ideologie perverse e i principi che danno vita a conseguenze molto spesso disastrose  Cinque stelle piu che meritate  bdwn shkh mfkhm tryn w rzshmnd tryn

w nh zyd I read this novel long back  Set in a feudal background of a Russia  the author creates a procession of unforgettable characters  Roskolnikov wants to commit a petty crime which results in murder  The author brilliantly explores the mental processes of an criminal who  for all his moralising about the society and criminality  cannot shake out the guilty consciousness which leads him to go back to the scene of crime  One of the greatest novels ever written   Changed my whole perspective on crime  I m rooting for the killer  yet knowing he really killed an old woman  The heights of sheer paranoia in the cat and mouse game make his final trip to Siberia a total relief  Learned much about real repentance  This was a pretty difficult book to read  so I enjoyed the challenge  however  it was a little boring and it seemed that Raskolnikov didn t really do much to be worth all those pages of writing  However  I did like it more than my other assigned summer reading  Life of Pi  The relentless internal monologue of a killer is both poetic and jolting  This is definitely one of those books that has changed my life and the way I view myslef and the world  It forces you to come to terms with the reality that all of us have a light and dark side  The book made me feel so compelled to acknowledge and explore my dark side   and then feel grateful that most people have the ability to govern these base forces  My favorite book Amazing    Endless misery   I read this book 3 years ago  It was the best I think and I recommend it to all people who are fond of Dostoyevsky   Crime and Punishment  is the best psychological thriller ever written  19th Century Russian novelist Feodor Dostoyevsky wrote the story of Raskolnikov  a Russian college graduate who makes his living tutoring current students and doing odd jobs  In the process he meets an old lady who is essentially a loan shark  and he plans to kill her and take her wealth  He does so  and in the process he also kills the woman s sister who walks in on the crime  The novel is brilliant in that it portrays the demented mind of the criminal  At first Raskolnikov rationalizes the crime by thinking that he is doing the world a favor by ridding the world of this horrible woman  and by using her riches for good instead of evil  After the crime Raskolnikov can do nothing but try to ease his mind of guilt  He goes through incredible mental tortues as he struggles with what he has done  The novel also makes known to the reader the unexpected sources of grace in Raskolnikov s life  Raskolnikov s friend  a worthless drunk who dies during the novel  is his only supporter  After his friend s death  the friend s daughter Sonia takes care of Raskolnikov  Sonia turned to prostitution in order to support her family  and despite her status as a prostitute she is the most moral and loving character in the novel  Sonia literally becomes the salvation of Raskolnikov  It is quite fascinating Within the midst of this drama  the mere fact of living becomes difficult for Raskolnikov  He can t concentrate on his work and is questioned by the police  He barely holds up  When his sister asks him for his blessing for her pending marriage  Raskolnikov goes off on the fiance  But his most difficult opponent in this novel is himself  I would highly recommend this novel to everyone  This is really something that all readers should discover  k dty lm  stT   n  Sbr Hty  nhyh w  ktm m fy Sdry dstwyfsky  bqry   fdh fy wlwj lmnTq lw r  llnfs lnsny  w brzh bshwl   shkhSyt rwyth mblG fyh  yt md  n

  even if we fail what better way is there to live   Fresh from a week in St Petersburg  Russia  I deeply enjoyed the city s role as backdrop  The city is like a character Crime and Punishment  the warren like apartment buildings surrounding courtyards  or  dvors   the canals and bridges  and of course Nevsky Prospekt are major contributors to the atmosphere and realism of the story  Having seen them  and so recently  I felt completely immersed in the book  Beyond that  Dostoevsky s attention to detail and particularly his laser like focus on the murky interior life of his characters  were mesmerizing  Great book  page turner at 150 years of age  Thought provoking  I want to read it again  there s so much detail and character interaction I m sure there are things I missed  And I have to admit  the different Russian names for the same characters did confuse me for the first part of the book  My son  who took Russian last semester in college  helped me understand how Russian names  nicknames and formal names change in form  Nice to have smart kids around     I think  that this book I must read earlier Really  this book have somekind of humanity  darkness and other black stuff But what I think about this book Main character have a great deal with his morality and change his mind for this deal  And won  Maybe  Somewhere else Maybe MC can change himself and be a great man in future  without morality or other  good  things Maybe he could won some time and check all evidence  that he left on crime place Maybe he could be another MC in another story But  You don t like this  another  story  You like MC falls  You like MC actions  You like MC feelings about his Crime  You like him because nearly all of you will do think feel the same  Because You find a piece of yourself in MC  And in that way you like that book  Really like  But  after all  you will like his  Crime and Punishment  story  lrwy  bshkl  m mmt   jd lknh mjhd  dhhny     dystwfsky ysmH lnfsh dwm blstGrq fy

analysis were already written about this novel  thus rendering anything I will add to it comparatively trivial and unoriginal  please imagine I did not write anything in this review  or if I did  that you refrained from reading it   In the running for my favorite book of all time  Reading it for the first time in high school made me realize how accessible something as scary sounding as Russian literature could be  and at the same time gave me the confidence to read things I d considered beyond me until then  Plus  the story and internal struggle of Rascolnikov is just kick ass  It s the first time I m really into a book  spending hours and hours reading it in my bed I couldn t stop   Time flies by so quickly while you read  you eat 200 pages without being aware of it  Definitely one of the best book I ever read  Dark  disturbing  completely engrossing  It is easy to understand how this novel has long been regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of literature There is so much going on in this novel I hardly know where to begin  The protagonist s delirium  dreams  wanderings through the dirty and smelly streets of St  Petersburg  his heinous crimes  one premeditated  the other not   poverty  marriage  class structures  drunkeness It is  in places  utterly absorbing  especially in Raskolnikoff s encounters with Porphyrius  the magistrate charged with solving the crimes at the heart of the novel  It is a profound psychological analysis of a criminal and his crime  unlike any novel I have ever encountered Everyone should read this novel  Since my disastrous attempt to read Anna Karenina three years ago  I found myself avoiding Russian novels like the plague  primarily because of my inability to mentally pronounce Russian names and then struggling to remember them  and top of that each character is referred by a different title depending on who is addressing him her   It really boggles your mind I ve heard that Dostoyevsky is slightly easier to read as compare to Tolstoy  and I proceeded to give his much acclaimed novel Crime and Punishment a go  I am glad that I did  as this book truly deserves to be a classic  Once you get into the story and familiarize yourself with the characters  names  the novel makes a compulsive read and despite its fatalistic title  I found the book unexpectedly humorous at times  I would add more  but I would just end up reiterating the sentiments of other reviewers  but this book is undoubtedly a  must read   I don t think anything was not written better than it  The truth about this book for me is it was so difficult for me to cope with all the terms  name  and places  Although I consider myself as not a slow reader  it was such a heavy book for me  It question about my moral and so many others    And at the climax to confess and declare that you only did it robe as napoleon    Hoho  Did anyone else laugh out loud at this bit  This is an extremely human piece of literature that weaves its story intricately around the the nuances of life  and in this case also of a murderous end   If The Brother s had never been written  one could legitimately wonder whether anyone could write anything as good as Crime and Punishment  As always  the P and V translation is essential for the beauty and humor that it maintains in FMD s language and for the careful footnotes  A amazing psicological book    Dostoievski s characters are good shaped and all this insane situation find it s justification in the desperation of a single man    the way that Dostoievski wrote the epilogue is fantastic  I read this book last week  I was very impressed by the last two pages of this novel  Raskolnikov and Sofya  who came from quite different background and had had own sufferings in life  could understand each other well without words  They got the beautiful renewal for their life  This novel is relatively long  I would say the rest of the part was the prelude to the last two pages   This is the most intense thing I ve ever read  So raw  so real  So    disturbing  Don t get me wrong  I mean that in a positive way  I love this book  not because I particularly enjoyed the writing style  or the story itself  No  I love this book because it emotionally and mentally rocked me to my very core  I have never been so impacted by anything that I ve read  This doesn t feel like a book  it feels like real life  Like you ve stumbled into one of the darker corners of reality  and now must accept whatever happens next  Read it frequently enough  and by the end of this book  you ARE Raskolnikov  You amble through your monotonous daily life feeling disturbed  guilty  and paranoid   This book spoke to me on a very personal level  and here s how   I used to be an elitist  and a cynic  just like our friend Raskolnikov  Reading this book gave me an ugly glance at what kind of person I was in the past  and what horror it could have evolved into  had I continued to allow myself to believe that I was superior      Basically  this book changed my life  I would recommend in to any advanced reader  especially those with an interest in psychology   This book was great  The writing was interesting  I liked the fact we get to see inside the mind of the main character who is a criminal  The characters were good and added to the story  This is complex and interesting read   I found this hard to read because I kept grimacing and just hoping it would hurry up and get to the end  reading this was like waiting for an execution  I guess that s the mark of an incredible novel  This book haunted me for months after I read it but I did enjoy it  I loved it even  But I m not in a hurry to go back to it soon  An absolute masterpiece  I would highly recommend it to everyone  It s a book that requires patience  and time for reflection  but it is completely worth it  Fantastic  of course  Not The Brothers Karamazov  but what is  I found it a little more confusing than Karamazov  There were a few characters that I was unsure about  But all in all it is hard to beat this psychological portrait of Raskolnikov and what he did and what he thinks about it and what his mother  sister  and prostitute friend think and how it all ends up  I read this back when I was 15 or so for Honors English in high school  so I had little memory of the goings ons  I did find that last sentence peculiar in how Dostoyevsky seemingly leaves is story open for continuation  Karamazov had that same sort of ring at the end  so I suppose it was just something the author liked to do  Estranho  Comeca lento  algo confuso  novamente estranho  O resumo das primeiras paginas como o resumo introdutorio da minha primeira experiencia ao embater no comboio Dostoyevsky Os dialogos  curtos e longos  os pensamentos de poucas linhas ou de uma pagina  a criacao duma cidade em busca do seu lugar numa sociedade russa em mutacao  as personagens  a descricao da pobreza mergulhada no intelecto superior  tudo isso e descrito de forma sublime  Ainda antes do crime  as cinco estrelas do goodreads ja estavam atribuidas Os nomes de Sonia  Raskolnikov e Razumikhin devem ficar na memoria durante um bom tempo  This was my Christmas reading  And my first russian novel  I was completely enthralled from start to finish  I can t believe I didn t read this masterpiece sooner  Thrilling and very very readable  I couldn t put it down  If anyone has any other recommendations on other similar novels I should read please do let me know  And if you haven t read this yet  trust me  make it a NY resolution to read this   One of my all time favourite authors  Dostoyevsky encaptures the poverty and harsh conditions of Tsarist Russia beautifully  A must read for anyone interested in the classics  a story still current today  empoverished students still exist   Intense psychologial questions still not answered today but still as controversial The nature of crime has always been a posed question  Set in the very dark yet enchanting backdrop of st Petersburg in Tsarist Russia we explore the nature of crime excellently  I study Criminology and to me this classic novel explores the nature of crime better than any textbook I have ever seen Including tragic alcohol addiction  haunting discriptions of life in Siberia and looks into the past this is the very definition of a  timeless classic   Ultimately this should not be missing from any book shelf The best of Dostoyevsky  A great piece of work     Intriguing  psychological drama of suspense  with splash of every human emotion possible   Crime and Punishment  As the title indicates  this novel is about a man and his crime  in this case  a double homicide   as well as his punishment  However  the bulk of the novel is focused on the conjunction  and   The crime occurs quickly and yet the  judicial and social  punishment does not come until the very end of the novel  Indeed  it appears in the Epilogue  The protagonist Raskolnikov commits the murders  believing that he is a superior person  one who considers himself above the law  and is subsequently tormented by his inability to become a  genius  or a  superman   He is psychologically disturbed and his outward appearance is that of a indigent or drunkard  Even following his confession  he does not consider himself a criminal  he does not find himself to have acted immorally As in his other novels  Dostoevksy  Dostoyevsky  has created numerous  varied  and memorable characters  Dostoyevsky s most famous novel is perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing I ve ever had the privilege of enjoying  The story focuses on the murder of a pawnbroker by the novel s protagonist Raskolnikov  The young man personifies all the traits Dostoyevsky associated with the nihilist movement who were beginning to gain influence throughout Russia in the mid 19th Century   generally speaking he embodies secularism and a move from Russian orthodoxy and Christianity to the  godless  atheism nihilism of what ultimately became Russian socialism  thus the ability to justify a cold blooded murder in the absence of any real moral compass  He is a tormented bundle of conflicting  half formed ideas and justifications  just like elements within pre revolutionary Russia The murder is committed as a reaction to news that Raskolnikov s sister Dounia is marrying a man he feels unsuitable  essentially to secure the financial stability of her family  including Raskolnikov who is studying Law in St Petersburg and living in appalling poverty  Raskolnikov is able to commit the crime as he sees his victim as a  louse   a money hoarding  washed up old woman with no value to society  Money would seem to be the primary motive  but as the story unfurls we learn there is far much more to it than that  What unfolds is one of the best examination of a gamut of human feeling  paranoia  suspicion  fear  guilt  the search for meaning   redemption in life and in some part  love  that I ve ever experienced  Raskolnikov s madness is written brilliantly  I often got cold shivers   sweats when reading some of the passages and it s a testament to the power of the writing that such strong physical reactions were provoked  Indeed  Rasko s pre murder dream about the flogging of the horse is almost as terrifying as Hippolyte s shocking dream in  The Idiot   although I have to say  the latter still ranks as my  favourite  Dostoyevsky pant wetting moment  actually both amongst the most shocking passages I ve experienced in literature   St Petersburg features strongly in the novel  acting I feel as a suitable psycho geographical backdrop to the descent into madness  It is a City orientated towards Europe  not the old Orthodox Russia and is as such portrayed as a turbulent melting pot of stinking taverns and eateries  poverty  prostitution  floods etc  Place is really important in the book and I feel it s used to emphasise Raskolnikov s moral uncertainties and those that Dostoyevsky feels are challenging Russian Orthodoxy  The setting imbues the novel with a sense of uncertainty suspicion  and even a surreal tone at times  Although the narrative is essentially formed from a crime thriller   detective story  it s brilliance lies in it s examination of the psychological tensions that would be troubling someone who had just committed a murder  Unlike other novels with similar themes  very little time is afforded to the crime or investigation itself  rather  the bulk of the narrative consists of Raskolnikov s mental breakdown before and after the crime  and the subsequent attempts to reconcile the murder with his own soul  Ultimately  Raskolnikov confesses  in submission to the mental torment of having to live with the guilt of committing such a bad crime  He senses redemption in the idea that he will be suitably punished for the act For all his admirer s  I am often amazed at how Conservative some of Dostoyevsky s ideas are  He was sending Russia a warning about it s slide into a potentially godless  chaotic future where ideas of  wrong  and  right  are jumbled  In that sense  the book is essentially anti atheistic and perhaps event somewhat reactionary given the climate it was written in  Still  like all of Dostoyevsky s novels extremely powerful and important points are made about human nature and changes in 19th Century Russia  It s a brilliant book   It s not a classics  but a sheer thrill to read a story of a man  who lands in Siberia  remembers his days in Russia and then his multifaceted outlook to the world   Dostoevsky is an amazing writer  I love Dostoeysky  This book does get at the heart of man  being evil in nature and yet the evil can be mended by a higher form of love  Every action has a reaction  pick up this book and read it today  Of abject poverty and unrequited love Dostoyevsky did a good job of painting chilly Russia so vividly I caught a chill in tropical Africa  a timeless classic   Li  Crime e Castigo  logo depois de ler  Os Irmaos Karamazov  e a comparacao foi inevitavel durante toda a leitura   Os irmaos     me prenderam muito mais  sobretudo pelo clima de romance policial e pelo fato de que  ao contrario de em  Crime      o suspense quanto ao assassinato se arrasta e se arrasta e se arrasta  quando no segundo tudo e revelado prontamente  ate antes de abrir o livro  ja no titulo   Duas formas bem diferentes de desenvolver um enredo  construir o caso  montar as evidencias  adicionar reviravoltas para finalmente revelar  ou nao  a verdade versus mostrar a verdade de cara e construir toda uma narrativa sobre as consequencias morais  psicologicas  legais e todo o conflito resultante disso tudo  Entretanto  ao terminar a leitura consigo ver claramente o motivo pelo qual CeC e considerada a obra prima de Dostoievski  Apesar de ter achado Raskolnikov um dos personagens mais chatos  mimados  e  muitas vezes  ate meio infantil  desculpa  gente   e inegavel que ele e tambem brilhante e talvez sua grande questao esteja justamente em  nao  saber lidar com uma mente tao genial em uma cabeca tao confusa  Betapa kompleksnya menjadi manusia  Betapa sedih menjadi manusia yang dibebani kebijaksanaannya sendiri  Dibebani kesedaran sendiri bahawa kemanusiaan adalah sesuatu yang perlu dipertahankan namun pada masa yang sama memerlukan penderitaan paling tidak munasabah  Melihat manusia manusia lain menjalani kehidupan dengan bersahaja tanpa tanda tanda bahawa mereka menyedari sepenuhnya hakikat takdir sebenar manusia  I did not bow down to you  I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity    Raskolnikov Itulah sekurang kurannya yang saya pelajari daripada Dostoyevsky di dalam novel klasik ini Dari sudut lain  saya mengkagumi ketelitian gambaran kehidupan abad 19 di Russia yang ditulis Dostoyevsky  dialog dialog yang bijak dan bersifat filosopikal  kesedaran tentang hal hal psikologi manusia dari sudut sudut paling tersembunyi  kuasa kesedaran moral  nilai kepercayaan dan cinta  Oh novel ini sangat kaya  Mungkin tidak berlebihan mengatakan seseorang itu belum cukup lengkap kemanusiaannya selagi belum membaca novel ini   Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart  The really great men must  I think  have great sadness on earth  I like the way Dostoevsky describes everything so hmm over realisticly  And the greatest punishment is not the punishment that the court can give you but rather your own punishment  I got this book for my birthday two weeks ago  Despite the intimidating 521 pages  I flipped to the first page  Next thing I knew  it was 7 days later and half the book was read  Another week passed and here I am writing a review for this astounding book  How you ask  did I finish the massive book  I owe it all to the outstanding writing of Fydor Dostoevsky  His thrilling novel on poverty  crime  agony  and the study of a murderer is intriguing and causes you to think of things you never dreamed of before  His examples of the guilt and agonies of a criminal are fascinating  But what I most enjoyed was the theme of freedom and the value of life  The character s pride and effort to fight for his freedom was interesting and when he finally gave in to punishment  he found that it is in captivity when we value life the most  I will never forget this excellent book  Crime and Punishment  and what it has taught me  I will also never forget Fyodor Dostoevsky  and I assure you  this is not the last book of his I will be reading  Whew  What an amazing book  Like Les Miserables  it takes on the question of morals and responsibility for one s actions and makes you squirm  It s long  but worth the investment  Hardly a week goes by when I don t think of it  I read this twice during my undergrad years    first  for a seminar  and soon after a second time  out of sheer pleasure  Disturbing and compelling  it pulled me in and along  One of the wonder books of my early 20s  Fyodor Dostoevsky s Crime and PunishmentRaskolnikov confessed that  I wanted to make myself a Napoleon  and that is why I killed her     He wanted to see if he could rise above a sense of guilt when he rid the world of a moneylender  Alena Ivanovna  he identified as evil  Though his bid to be a conqueror of old ways and ideas is complicated by the additional murder of the moneylender s backward sister  Further complications confuse Raskolnikov when his conscience is challenged by the values of the religious Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov  a virtuous woman forced to prostitute herself to support her family  Her meek  easily embarrassed temperament makes her a spiritual antagonist to Raskolnikov  whose intellectual arrogance and godless amorality cause him to be ruthless  Her shame contrasts sharply with his pride While Sofya prostitutes herself out of indigence  Raskolnikov  who is also and lives in shame off his poor mother and sister he is too principled to use the moneylender Ivanovna s savings  even hiding a handful of trinkets before fleeing the scene under a rock  He likes to think he is above pecuniary self interest  that he is a type of idealist who gives the little money that comes his way to those poorer than himself  It may be that Dostoevsky is offering a tragic parody of early communist revolutionaries who sought to change the world into a better place through acts of violence  His generosity of spirit is witnessed by his friend Razumikhin  who relates that Raskolnikov risked his life to rescue children from a burning home Dostoevsky offers a professional opinion in the form of Zosimov  Raskolnikov s doctor  who believes he suffers from hypochondria and There are ways in which Raskolnikov s humility contradicts this diagnosis  Perhaps Dostoyevsky carries his point too far when he describes Raskolnikov s moods  mutterings and dissociation  so implying that he is schizophrenic  his delusions broken by lucid periods like the one in which he plans his murder This  point  of Raskolnikov s crimes is plumbed by Porfiry Petrovich  the examining magistrate  who also serves as a priest confessor who offers Raskolnikov a sympathetic opening  even though he is also his nemesis  Petrovich s equips himself to understand Raskolnikov through familiarity with an article he wrote dividing mankind into two categories  the masses  for whom laws are written  and great men  men of ideas  whose power puts them beyond the laws of God and man  In time  Raskolnikov appears to abandon this theory and so approach the road to his own redemption   I always appreciate works of fiction where I feel as though the author has looked into my mind and soul  found something relatable  and implanted that into their protagonist  I think anyone who reads Dostoyevsky feels that way  and squirms a little bit  Masterpiece   Although  this book may go a little slow for some readers  it is truly an amazing book  There are some great themes on love and redemption  I cried at the end  which I don t do for a lot of books  I read this book in tandem with Their Eyes Were Watching God for the summer reading AP English whatever  While at the time  and now too I think  there are some things about this book that went completely over my head  I absolutely loved it  I hate to admit but I think I developed some sort of weird crush on Raskolnikov  even though he s a   well a bit off   I blame the cover  which is not the cover shown here  he looks rather fetching in the one I own  and the fact he is Russian On to something about the actual book  The inner monologues in this were fantastic  I think that s what I liked most  getting inside people s heads  especially people who aren t exactly all there  Romanzo che ha una potenza tossica  Produce effetti velenosi sull umore  Sembra un liquido di contrasto che ti invade per via endovenosa e ti fa vedere arterie mentali altrimenti invisibili  Denuda  Scava  Ha qualcosa di archeologico  Ho pensato ai calchi pompeiani  Quando affiorava un osso umano  Fiorelli  il direttore degli scavi nell anno in cui fu scritto questo romanzo  intuiva che attorno c era un buco  lo spazio lasciato vuoto dalla dissoluzione del corpo di un essere vivente  Faceva un foro  iniettava nel buco la calce liquida e ne otteneva un calco perfetto  perfino nell espressione del viso  Delitto e castigo e una cosa cosi  la sua storia e come quella calce  Raskolnikov e un calco perfetto  Porta alla luce costruzioni mentali antichissime ed universali  sommerse e insieme preservate dalle eruzioni storiche degli ultimi due secoli  In tutti e due i casi resti muto a pensare   All times Russian classic  I wonder why they make you read it in school when you have no capacity whatsoever to fully comprehend it  I tried reading it several time in the past 20 years  and now is the first time I actually enjoyed and appreciated it  lrwy  kthr mn ry  h tshtHq n tqr  kthr mn mrh     I don t think I ll be adding anything new to what s been said  but here goes  it was amazing  I m finding that I have a preference for existentialist fiction and misanthropic heroes  and I m not sure I m comfortable with what that could say about me  Probably not good things    self absorbed  too contemplative  indulgent  angsty  most likely young and impressionable  etc  Lots of unflattering adjectives  Anyway  that aside  I want to talk about how surprisingly humorous this novel was  I actually burst out laughing at many lines and situations    that were unintentionally hilarious in all likelihood  Everything is just so overplayed  everybody speaks so much  and the situational humor was striking  If you don t see the humor in Crime   Punishment  don t worry about it   I have still yet to find someone who agrees with me  All that said  I admired how Dostoevsky constructed his characters  I felt like I was sitting in their heads  John Malkovich style  for much of my time reading  In particular  how Katerina s plight developed gave me a new understanding of tragedy  Pity and fear  indeed  Also  how did Dostoevsky make a pedophile my favorite character  I don t have an idea  but it s certainly an achievement This was fun for me to read  Humor  philosophy  psychology  ethics  absurdity  incredible characters  and existential crises abound   The superlative novel  and it s not even his best  Yes  yes  I know you read it in 11th grade and loathed it  but it s time to try again  Texter  Hearken back to an age when people looked up when they walked around and contemplated murdering greedy pawn brokers while their monomaniacal world is challenged by the love of youthful prostitutes and family  The Pevear Volkhonsky translation is supreme  and Dosty s prose is sublime in this  the first of his Giant Five  and   again  not even his best  Mind blowing book  Even though Dostoyevsky wrote in the 1860 s  his insights about both society and the individual are very applicable to today His character development is extremely intriguing  the reader continually learns about the main character throughout the novel  I love how Dostoyevsky created this developement in various ways  He did not just narrate their thoughts  The reader can almost learn more about a specific character by the way other characters act around that individual that by solely focusing on the individual himself  Crime and Punishment is definitely worth a second read  Stunning  Inner turmoil too passionate to restrain and love too pure to deny a brighter morning  The depths of nefarious creativity and reckless blindness  All the elements of a wonderful book and very infectious  Read with caution if you can sympathize with Raskolnikov  This is a classic for a reason   As good as everyone says  I could not put it down  Are you a genius who is willing to crush all obstacles in order to attain a higher good  Probably not  so please don t kill me As an ardent existentialist of the Sartrean variety it was only natural that I would fall in love with this masterpiece  Never have I had such emotional responses to a book before  I m sure the patrons at the coffee shop thought I had gone mad given the faces  gasps and scowls I was making  Well worth the commitment  24 11 2015 just ordered Crime and Punishment  Vintage Classics  editionFirst Fyodor Dostoyevsky book i ve read The only thing i can say after reading this book is   I just in love with Fyodor Dostoyevsky  and with Raskolnikov omgyesasdfgh   the character This book really left a very  very deep impression for 18 year old girl like me  and even now i can t still stop forgetting it I keep thinking about this book until now  it s already past half year i ve read this book  is this called obsession or im being crazy or something  lolOh Mr  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  I wish

Morality Totters   The novel brings you inside the deranged mind of the protagonist  the murderer   A theory of his own impels him to commit the deed  which is executed in a horrible fashion with an axe  which he blithely disregards initially as a crime  Do you repent after swatting a blood sucking louse  There are two kinds of people   the ordinary  who create  follow and bound themselves in an abstract circle of intangible confines that they call  rules  or  laws   The world is full of such folks  The other smaller kind   the extra ordinary  are those who do not have a legal right  but an inner right spared by their conscience to take extreme steps that might be labelled as  transgressing the law  by the ordinary which are taken for the fulfillment of their own ideas and executing their designs  Where is the scrupulous lot when a deserved is dethroned  Power is attained by those who dare stoop and pick it up No moral or legal barrier should stand against an act done for greater good  even murder ought to be overlooked  If the death of an old bitter and wealthy crone would ultimately blow the breeze of betterment into the lives of many people  then will it not rather be an act of kindness With his radical views he launches himself onto the world with the intention of putting the theory to test  sniffing up the air  searching for a prey  When the object is identified  he boldly plans for it and gingerly executes it  The aftermath of this incident is unbearable agony falling upon his soul  the raging conscience of his own refusing to mollify the wildfire tormenting him   view spoiler  Quite the contrary to his understanding of future events and my liking he eventually succumbs to confession that puts him behind bars in Siberian Jail   hide spoiler  Particularly the character of the protagonist written by Dostoyevsky stood as a flickering flame in the blackness pulled over by some extreme radical doctrines propelling the Russian youth for virtuous violence back then The plot might not appeal to everyone  and would rather seem a lacklustre and heavy psychological read to many  The more one trots on  the more disturbing it becomes  But I sincerely was glued to the book  and despite the stress it made on my mind it was an inexplicably good voyage over the tumultuous waters of this grand piece of Russian Literature  tdwr Hdth lrwyh Hwl shb rwdywn rwmnwf

the details with which Dostoevsky describes the deterioration of Raskolnikoff s state of mind  His ideas on the justification of murder are chilling  Small tidbits of historical knowledge of the time adds to the book  relocation to Siberia as a form of criminal punishment  the recent emancipation of the serfs  the influence of Nihilism and Socialism from the west  etc   A very good read  one of the few books I would consider reading a second time   i read this one in high school along with the brothers karamazov  for some reason i tend to read certain authors  books in a row  dostoyevsky for a while then tolstoy  this one was an interesting story of a man who grows to hate the woman who loans him money and is cruel in how she operates  she is the one with power and she is greedy  the man figures out where she hides her box of money and he craves the money  he decides to kill her and take her money  he figures no one will miss her and all the debt owed her would be canceled  so in a way he was helping people  so he does the dirty deed and gets away with it cause the police can t prove it  driven by guilt of his awful crime he admits to his crime  once again the author delves into the inner life of the main character  i was fazcinated by this mode of writing character development  it seemed to me dostoyevsky enjoyed the process of the inner mind  the man is sentenced to siberia  he gets married there and ends up truly happy even amidst the desolation of where he was living   I read this edition between over 10 years ago so I can t really remember much  except that it has been my favourite book of all time This is the Richard Pevear  Larissa Volohonsky translation  and I remember the prose great  This book had me gripped from start to finish  I am currently reading the Oxford World Classics version now   by Jessie Coulson  and the style is a little different from what I remember  but so far so good  I will update you all on what I thought of it when I finish  While there is arrogance and crime  the punishment is much more diffuse  Both emotional and physical punishment are evident  but there is never remorse  Only a realization that time and love may offer a future  which is hopeful  but disconcerting in some way  Within this ambivalence lies the true power of this great work   Heroic Demoralization  It always makes me sad when someone in life or fiction has to deal with something that makes them less than human  When those first steps are taken there is no going back  What makes it worse is when a character sacrifices their own morality for the benefit of another  I feel like this book was a collection of one awkward situation after the other  The love of a father for his daughter with a twist  The love of a step mother for her children  but not quite  The redemption of a lady of the streets  and a murder you cant help but root for  all come together to make a GREAT story  I was mesmerized by this story  Read this book  Una obra maestra  Nos introduce de forma excepcional en una mente obsesiva  claramente trastornada  y tan brillante como altiva  Novela psicologica que consigue a la perfeccion describir el funcionamiento de nuestra

would have enjoyed it more if I wasn t being forced to read it  I enjoy Russian literature and Dostoevsky s writing style is very intense  complex  and thought provoking I have never written so many essays or read so many articles about any book before and I still feel that we only scratched the surface  The only plus is that because of Socratic seminars and essays I can pronounce and spell almost every name in the book  Yay   Mot tac pham kinh dien ve toi ac cua con nguoi  Khi da cam len la khong the ngung doc  khi da doc xong thi khong the ngung nghi ve no  Voi hinh anh trung tam la

beroemdste detectiveroman uit de wereldliteratuur  geschreven met een geweldige handicap voor de schrijver  de lezer weet wie het gedaan heeft  en wordt toch in voortdurende spanning gehouden of de dader gepakt wordt of niet  Zelfs mensen die niet van Dostojevski houden bewonderen dat boek  Zo heeft Ivan Boenin een keer gezegd   Al die krankzinnige Kirillovs  Svidrigojlovs  ivan Karamazovs kan ik niet uitstaan  Al zegt de hele wereld me dat het geniaal is  Ik kan het niet hebben en daarmee basta  Ik weet zeker dat ik gelijk heb maar Dostojevski heeft prachtige dingen  Het armoedige  donkere  koude Petersburg  regen  modder  lekke overschoenen  trappen en katten  Die Raskolnikov die met een bijl onder zijn jas de trap opklimt naar die oude woekeraarster  Dat is geweldig     Crime and Punishment  is one of my top books  I can say for sure that this book is remarkable not only by its action  but because of its characters  The psychological analysis is memorable  is the best I have ever read  It makes you feel you are in Raskolnikov s shoes  that you are in his conscious  that you know exactly how he feels  And this is amazing for a book  Wanted some light reading for the

bqy bmwnh khd mydwnh    I was half expecting a Russian version of Law and Order but it turned out to be more like The Talented Mr Ripley  I thoroughly enjoyed this murder story which we see from the perspective of the murderer  Raskolnikov is obviously a disturbed man who has failed to live up to his expectations and this leads to his becoming a criminal  Despite believing that he is in some way above the law he descends into doubt and guilt thus meeting out his own punishment  Will he be found out by the authorities led by Porfiry  who inspired the writer of Columbo  or not I provides the suspense for most of the book  There is a fair amount of action despite the mainly psychological nature of the book and a warning to animal lovers  there is a most horrendously brutal scene with a horse towards the beginning  In comparison to Dickens it is quite sparse in humour but delves deeper into the protagonist  It kept me enthralled throughout i can t imagine how I have never read it before  estoy fascinada con este libro es el segundo que leo de Dostoyesvky  sus mejores dos libros  tengo que hacer incapie en la claridad de detalles en la cual manifiesta y describe a sus personajes  la emocion y sentimientos que lo acompanan  wua  nunca me habia sentido asi al leer  Toca mucho las la creencia de Dios y su fe   lo mas raro de todo es que hace dias estuve oyendo en mi Iglesia la historia de  Lazaro  de la biblia en el libro de  Juan    y hoy estoy leyendolo en el libro  es esto una mera coincidencia  o algo se esta reflejando en mi vida como mensaje    estoy mas que intrigada    Creo que el final fue fantastico  como siempre trata uno de imaginar varios escenarios para el final   pero tratandose de Dostoyesvky y su infinita inclinacion psicologica e espiritual a la escencia humana  creo que el errepentimiento vino a abrir la mente y alma de Rodya    haciendo reverencia al Titulo Crimen y Castigo    castigo que pagara dia a dia por ocho anos en Siberia  Crime and Punishment was amazing  If you can it is easier to read this book with a group and i think it is the kind of book you can hate while your reading it but love once you have finished  Genial  Crime e Castigo foi o meu primeiro contato com a obra de Dostoievski e devo dizer que eu fiquei muito surpresa com o que li  A leitura e envolvente e a cada final de capitulo ficava ansiosa para saber o que viria a seguir  Gostei muito e  agora  estou doida para ler toda a obra do Dostoievski  Thank goodness this book is in the public domain where I can grab a PDF version for some intensive copying and pasting of the Russian names  The protagonists  names are hard enough to remember  but names like Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov have me reaching for the white flag Plot wise Crime and Punishment is fairly straight forward  an impoverished young man murdered a nasty old woman and her sister but afterward finds that he can not live with himself  after suffering some extreme anguish of the soul he begins looking for redemption  The simple synopsis belies a psychologically complex book  This is an entire character driven novel  full of psychological insights and profundities  To me  the most difficult aspect of reading this book is the writing style which is eloquent and evocative but most of the characters seem to speak in extraordinarily long monologues  pontificating  ruminating  philosophizing  wringing their hands like nobody s business  However  once I got used to this I became captivated by the protagonists and their plights  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is a wonderfully complex antihero  I was appalled by his act of murder which seems like some kind of weird experiment to test his very odd theory about what an intellectual is entitled to do  especially if he compensates for one evil act by doing numerous good deeds  While Raskolnikov is front and centre of the story  the novel is not entirely about him  the supporting characters also have very hard lives of their own  Particularly Sonia  Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova  the poor girl who sells herself to feed her family and eventually finds love and respect in the last place you would expect  All the characters are very vividly developed  even the villains of the piece are not the mustache twirling types with Machiavellian schemes  They are just horrid  odious  selfish  manipulative men  the sort you meet or read about all too often in real life  There is Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin who never murdered anyone but is so cruel  arrogant and selfish that I wish Raskolnikov had administered the same axe treatment to cure him of his personality  Then there is Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov who is a pervert  possibly a pedophile  yet also some kind of antihero yearning for redemption This is not a book to read if you are looking for a good giggle  but if you are interested in contemplating faith  redemption  conscience and morality it is the very thing  It would seem ridiculous if I said that reading this book has made me a better person  the trouble is the truth is sometimes ridiculous  Brilliant psychological analysis of the guilty mind   Shu Jia Du Tuo Ge De

of my favorite books of all time  Pure genius  One can read this book over and over an still find new subtleties and points hidden within the text  So creative and just a fascinating idea about the intricacies of the mind of a murderer   Dostoevsky is incredibly detailed and certainly knows how to keep a reader interested  He also sprinkles the book with so many names and nick names and associations that it can be daunting at times  This book changed my life   who knows why  It makes you question all the things man is capable of   what you re capable of  And i guess in the end   man s limitations beyond his own rationalizations  dwstwyfsk  fwq lnqd Great book  Indescribable writing style  Bearing in mind that I only just finished reading this book yesterday  it s perhaps a bad idea to review it today  Why  Because I m still so deeply affected by it Let me start by saying that  as a result of having grown up in a post socialist country  my generation was taught that Russian  everything was rubbish  In our compulsory reading lists  there featured many foreign a work  but none originated from the Russian Federation  At the time  I wasn t too phased by it  but after a few years  I concluded it must have been a sly political move  As if renouncing our history would change much  Never mind  I promised myself that I would one day read certain Russian classics  The highest rating I can give to this book is five stars  I ll go ahead and give it six  In writing  for it isn t possible to do so otherwise  I was well aware that it would be a heavy  heavy read  However  I don t think I imagined it would be that heavy  As soon as I started it  I made a distinct parallel with certain French authors I d read in the past  The likes of Victor Hugo and Honore de Balzac  to be more precise  I d say that this is a character based book  About 95  of it is concerned with  what totals  a month   month and a half  You can  by that  deduce that the focus isn t on the plot  Or  it is but in a direct link to the psychological  mental and emotional state of the protagonist  The protagonist  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is someone whom I should  in theory  dislike hugely  Yet  I find myself sympathising with him  Why  I have no idea  A part of me refuses  point blank  to accept that he s a deranged  twisted and calculating bastard  Another part of me is convinced that he is  A third part of me is in agreement with the possibility of him actually being insane  And at this very moment  I can t make my mind up  I don t have a preference for one  or the other  The depth in which Dostoyevsky explores human nature  with all its failings  is simply extraordinary  A person s ups and downs  highs and lows  triumphs and tragedies are described in the most shattering of ways  Happiness and sadness  love and hatred  admiration and disgust  certainty and doubtfulness  honesty and mistrust among other roller coaster human emotions are presented to the reader in a masterful manner that manages to cause confusion  empathy  ironical laughter and shaking one s head in disapproval  Rationality creeps into it  too  Sometimes  It s probably this weird mixture of rationality and irrationality that has left me baffled  numb  speechless   Everything follows one single event  an event that turns the protagonist s existence  and the existence of those close to him  into a downward spiral  Realism in its finest For the book is primarily written from the protagonist s point of view  it is his thoughts you hear  That is not to say that there s any form of I narrative  really  It s sort of neutral but subjective  if that makes sense  Also  it is other characters  thoughts that are put forward sometimes  which then allows you to see a situation from a completely different angle  Lastly  a third party altogether seems to be narrating all along as well  Which  in short  contributes to writing style versatility and an overall greater effect Since I m running the risk of writing on and on  I ll end this review here  I realise it hasn t been very coherent but I ve done my best  I highly recommend this book   Io amo questo autore  ogni suo romanzo e un capolavoro  Storie appassionanti  personaggi talmente umani ed attuali che sembra che saltino fuori dalle pagine  Il delitto perfetto escogitato da una mente superiore  Se si puo riuscire a scampare alle leggi degli uomini  si puo riuscire a nascondersi anche dalla propria coscienza  Un capolavoro  davvero imperdibile  I read this book in AP English my senior year of high school  and I ve read it probably 8 times since then  It follows in the tradition of a lot of existential novels that aren t necessarily plot heavy but filled with such copious amounts of emotional torment that they really require a nap after reading  I found the antagonist  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  gotta love the name  to be altogether repugnant and charismatic  In such a faraway place and a long ago time  the thoughts and feelings of a destitute murderer were a thing I never thought I could relate to  but this book actually kind of makes it possible  I ve always enjoyed books where all materialistic distractions are stripped away enough and the human condition in its barest form can be revealed  and what better place than a barren  economically depressed  cold ass Russian town full of drunks      LOVE IT One recommendation  This novel is chock full of nicknames and really long Russian names  so I always use a few sheets of paper to help me sort the shit out  lw fy ktr mn 5 njwm knt HTyt wllh Bueno  pues me termine ayer Crimen y Castigo  y tengo que decir que es uno de los mejores libros que he leido en mi vida  La manera de escribir es tan sublime que parece mentira que sea del siglo XIX  No se  tampoco es que haya leido tanto  pero da la impresion de que Dostoievski estaba por delante de su tiempo comparandolo a otros grandes escritores de su epoca Los personajes son completamente reales  humanos  parece que te esten echando el aliento a la cara cuando estan hablando  Los soliloquios de Raskolnikov son simplemente magnificos  Hay momentos desgarradores en la novela como la escena de Catalina Ivanova en el puente con sus hijos  Las pesadillas de Svidrigailof son simplemente aterradoras  Las conversacion de Rodia y Sonetchka en el momento mas critico creo que es la mejor parte del libro  Esa y el final  que no el epilogo  No se hace nada pesado de leer  Cada parrafo esta tan bien redactado que se observa el cuidado y la buena mano del escritor y el carino que ha puesto en ello  En fin   que es una pena que se haya terminado  Pero como todo lo bueno  el libro tiene un final   A challenging read which plumbs psychological depths and questions the morality underpinning  crime and punishment   I found the brutal killing and attendant emotional turmoil both disturbing and fascinating in equal measure and the abundant food for thought truly marks this book out as a classic   One of my favorite books  I know  it s kind of dark  right  I think it s the perfect psychological thriller  This could only be a novel   the depth of the main character s delusions can only be explained in print  The main takeaway  beware the brainy college dropout  Probably Dostoevsky s most famous work  Although this book is a classic masterpiece  I felt almost disappointed and confused when I finished  Not that it wasn t a wonderful book  but because everyone seemed to be telling me what a fantastic masterpiece it was  I was expecting a little more from it  It seems this book has drawn a superior rating across the universe  It was although  evidently a great novel What a great bird s eye view of the human mind  human nature  love  forgiveness  transformation  redemption  sacrifice   This book is a must read  So many facets of the human soul are explored  I experienced mirrors held up for me as well as ideals for me to hang onto  I likes the story immensely  a few niggles here and there with typos and grammatical issues  the copy I have is the  Penguin Classics  edition  although it was still good A lot of twists and turns throughtout and excellent tension building scenes The often full naming of characters or pet naming of characters I found odd but not off putting Full marks  Reading this book was an incredible experience  Perfect creation of a murderer  opposite to a conventional stereotype  The main character  instead of all his drawbacks  makes the reader be fond of him and even understand him in some way  An interesting story written in a very unique way  At times certain paragraphs or chapters seemed to go on for ages while other themes or parts of the story seemed to not be developed enough  such as his actions thoughts before the murders  however this didn t distract much at all from the overall genius of the  The casual reader not interested in the extended analysis of the mental anguish punishment from crime may find the book a bit too weighty  Personally I found it refreshing to find a book with such a different take on the typical murder story   I have difficulty rating this book  It was  of course  extraordinarily well written  and its subject matter was distinct My biggest problem was with how little I could relate to the main character  and how depressing it all was  I could see the good in him  but he refused to see it in himself  There was no hope  The world was naught but a series of grotesque mechanisms made to set a man to his knees  buckling beneath its weight  And he buckled  and let madness slip beneath his honor and dignity to foster horror and baseness I have a pessimistic nature on the surface  but I am an optimist at heart  The absolute resolve not to allow himself happiness in life was terrible to behold  to me  as a young man living through a similar point in his life  Loss is universal  as is loneliness  but one must still live the life one is given And perhaps that is the genius of the piece  Dostoyevsky drags me kicking and screaming through the darkest thoughts of a man who has given up to remind me of the bitterest dregs of existence  and give me renewed purpose in leading a life filled with something more And so  five stars  I had expected a somewhat dense  turgid story but it was far from that  After a slow start  this novel turns into an absorbing tale and   dare I suggest it   one of literature s first psychological crime thrillers  Although some of the female characters are a bit two dimensional  the main male characters are cleverly drawn  human  complex and fascinating  The main character  Raskolnikov  is somewhat of an anti hero and is quite frustrating   though very believable   in his obtuse reactions to others  but my favourite character is Porfiry Petrovich  the detective in charge of the crime investigation The melodramatic style was not to my taste  but I guess it was typical of mid 1800s literature  think Wuthering Heights   More problematic  in my view  was the overtly Christian conservatism that coloured much of the novel  Nonetheless  this was a towering  masterful novel that really broke boundaries in world literature  can not understand people who have not read it yet  ndm bd tu bhdhh lrwy     bd tu bh bshyin mn lkhSwSyW     tqtDy jmlythu n yZlWWa sr byny wnfsy    fhnlka  shy jmlyth tkmnu fy  dmi lbwHi bh  w lfSHi  nh

mnh w nht  ly fy 2   nwfmbr   2014   rhf      A trajectory changing novel   The moment in this book in which I felt most engaged and as if I understood clearly what was going on is when Raskol thinks about the letter from his mother about his sister s courtship with Luzhin  Raskol thinks to himself about Luzhin s desire to marry a girl   raised from destitution and owing everything to their husbands  bounty          In this quote  I find that Raskol is frustrated because he sees a parallel between Luzhin and the pawnbroker  they both  according to Raskol  abuse those who are powerless  The reaction against reason and logic reminds me of the counter Enlightenment in Western Europe around this period   I adore the lecture by Irwin Weil  I am intrigued that he  too  found inspiration to learn Russian in a Dostoyevskii novel  The Brothers Karamazov   Doestoyevskii s language contains so much thick  humid emotion  But I wonder if this is only the translation  I want to reread this novel using several English texts and the original Russian text  so that I may really see what Dostoyevskii meant  what he intended   In my opinion  an excellent translation  The story of a murder by a man is focused on the perpetrator s mind   dense passages of describing his inner torment await the reader  I found the prose to be faster reading than expected  with some interesting twists in the plot to keep one turning pages  Not sure who to recommend to except those who like Dostoyevesky or classic literature since I think many people might get bored if expecting something like the bulk of suspense novels being written today  I found the writing to be enthralling    Just couldn t stop reading this book   It really change your view of living the life   Through this book a got also the first time in contact with the physiognomic   You start to look at people on a different way  you see if someone is unhappy or if someone is hiding sth   I can only recommend this book it takes time to read but it s worth to read it   Sorry for my english I m croatian    Raskolnikov  what a fabulous name that is  Roll the first letter around your mouth and spit the rest out from the fourth letter onwards  Is there a better name for a sociopath  He is a man whose brain is sufficiently differently wired to feel that he can do what he likes without consequence  Unlike most sociopaths he appears to learn that his actions impact on society and his immediate family and is redeemed by the power of love  Perhaps the consequences of his actions are attributable to the the connectedness of all things and his family are the natural targets of the vengeful Furies  In the end this is something for personal reflection  The writing is dense  graphic and dark  FD s ability to put his fingerts inside somebody s head and scramble your synapses is expert and this boook should be obligatory reading for anybody whose life involves personal interraction   A must read  how could I not sell this book enough  This book shows how the mind of a murderer works  Any conversation with Raskolnikov after the major plot point early in the book will keep your heart beating in tandem with him  You feel like you killed some one  What else     To be read least twice I m your life   Immenso e intenso  Gli unici due aggettivi utili alla recensione di questo libro sono proprio questi  Dostoevskij descrive in maniera perfetta la psicologia di un delitto appoggiandosi su un romanzo tracciato minuziosamente senza lasciar scampo al non detto  Sorprendente come questo autore riesca ad utilizzare il giusto numero di parole in ogni situazione  dialogo  descrizione  non una fuori posto  non una di piu  ne una di meno  mescolando la narrazione a sottili riflessioni  E  proprio vero che i libri formano i lettori  La lettura di questo testo mi ha fatto riflettere ed analizzare la psicologia umana da un punto di vista diverso  Come dice lo stesso autore  la sofferenza e la stessa causa della consapevolezza   Dir frottole a modo proprio e quasi meglio che dir la verita al modo degli altri  nel primo caso sei un uomo  nel secondo sei soltanto un pappagallo  La verita non ci scappera  ma la vita si puo massacrare  se ne sono avuti degli esempi  Ebbene  che cosa siamo adesso  Noi tutti  tutti senza eccezione  nel campo della scienza  del progresso  del pensiero  delle scoperte  degli ideali  dei desideri  del liberalismo  della ragione  dell esperienza e di tutto  di tutto  di tutto  siamo ancora nella prima classe del ginnasio inferiore  Ci e piaciuto vivacchiare dell intelligenza altrui  e ce ne siamo penetrati    I consider myself one the biggest fans of the great Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky  I think his works has that very unique taste of beauty which can t be found anywhere else  Dostoyevsky is different  I read his novel Crime and Punishment before I read my favorite The Brothers Karamazov  and I loved it very much  I loved It s Protagonist  Raskolnikov   I loved the way the novel ended   I like that kind of  open  endings which allow the reader to be a writer  It opens thousands of windows and creates millions of roads in front of It s reader s imagination This novel is definitely one of the greatest works of literature all over the world  It is worth reading   more than once  Seperti buku Novel Rusia lainnya yang cenderung suram  buku yg satu ini sama aja Cerita ttg mahasiswa miskin yang membunuh lintah darat dimana dia sempat jadi korbannya Tapi cara berceritanya Bapak Dostoyesvky ini luar biasa kayanya ceritanya itu benar 2 terjadi di depan kita Setiap detail perasaan setiap kejadian bener 2  seakan 2  real  Dostoyevsky once again turns fictional characters into real people and makes their lives incredible complex  Very long and slow  but the payoff is worth it  I was able to feel the emotions and mindsets of the characters  which is am amazing feat  The audio book version was a Constance Garnett translation  which is apparently the absolute worst version  When I go back for another round in 10 years  I would like to go with a Jessie Coulson translation  I can t even imagine how much better it might be  Raskolnikov and Sonia forever  3I really liked the book  even though there were soo many paaages  The book made me laugh and go  gasp   There just should ve been more Raskonia lovin   Raskonia forever  To label Dostoyevsky s CRIME AND PUNISHMENT  a classic  or  influential  is an understatement   Archetypal  is more accurate  not just in terms of Russian writing  but literature as a whole  Dostoyevsky revolutionized both psychological and philosophical novels  directly inspiring authors such as Knut Hamsun  Franz Kafka  and Virginia Woolf  among others The protagonist  Raskolnikov  is a former student living in abject poverty who spends much of his time indulging in existential musings  Unable to afford sustenance and slowly becoming delusional  he murders an old woman and her half sister for their money In the days following his gruesome deed  Raskolnikov begins to crack beneath the weight of his guilt and the stress he feels as the police inch closer to identifying him as the murderer  He wanders through the streets of Saint Petersburg  frantically attempting to get his thoughts under control with vodka and interacting with all manner of people in the city  All the while  his two closest friends  Razumikhin  a fiercely logical ex student  and Sonya  a young woman with strong morals that has been forced into prostitution  provide advice and desperately try to help Raskolnikov  In the end  Raskolnikov must decide whether or not to confess CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is a fascinating look at the human psyche  one you are unlikely to forget  Raskolnikov  his companions  and the characters he meets along the way are masterfully created to the point that they seem real  Dostoevsky s masterpiece of the irrational mind justifying the most heinous of crimes  We watch the descent of the perpetrator s mind into madness and how he is unable to admit when he s caught that what he has done is wrong  This is a must read for those who love the classics and a powerful story that is fraught with meaning  Best novel I ve ever read  period  The way in which Dostoyevsky dives into the human soul  especially the tormented and guilty human soul is amazing  and the path it sets to restoration and redemption is amazing too  Highly recommendend to anyone who wishes to take a look into the depths of his own soul   Brilliant  My second attempt at reading Russian literature and the work that secured my fascination with the  genre   Few books have made me think and empathize with greater intensity upon re reading them as Dostoevsky s masterful delve into the human psyche   Crime and Punishment   The book s venerable flourishes of the tongue do little to diminish its twisting exploration of insanity and vice  and its gripping characters that never intertwine  but instead vividly and painfully collide  It is undoubtedly a difficult read  made harder still by the layers upon layers of flaws bestowed on all participants   but becomes all the more human by doing so   Crime and Punishment  paints a ravaging road to redemption that will not just linger in memory  but leave a mark on a person  Nobody  other than Dostoyevsky  could have written  Crime and Punishment  Line by line  Dostoyevsky s troubled lines trickle down as he esplains the turbulent mind f a criminal and his volatile behaviour is escaping from law  Brilliantly characterized  Raskolnikov is a character that has lived through the ever expanding world of literature and will continue shining through for centuries to come The brilliance of the narrative is that Raskolnikov has not been significantly victimized by his situation  rather by his guilt  Read this for high school English class  It was one of the few novels I liked that I had to read  I found it fascinating  for the same reasons I went on to study psychology  It s a thorough psychological plundering  If you ever wondered are you capable of murdering someone and coping with it afterwards  Dostoevsky does some very good work here  analysing the psychology of the killer  his guilt  apathy and lust for life  His book also concerns some interesting philosophical themes such as determinism  nihilism and rational egoism  I m giving it a 5 star rating  although there were few soap opera moments which I found quite annoying  However Crime and Punishment has some serious cliff hangers   clever and intensive  and that s definitely how a psychological thriller should be written  With a risk to take the book s message on a superficial level   if you re planning to kill someone  read this masterpiece before you do it  so you can either give up on the idea or do it the right way with a minimal chance of being caught    Dostoyesky s classic masterpiece about alienation  Aways look for the Constance Garnett translations of FD  s major works know one is more passionate and right on then Garnet  Duo teams have tried to out do her in recent years but her work stand as the best and can be found at any local bookstore even your Crown or B  Dalton are those still open man I stole a lot of books from those places If they are not in businesss you can venture with hood on head to a Barnes and Noble or Borders and possble find a bargain Garnett translation  but please first got to yoour local bookstore  We have to keep them alive other wise our only selection will be Jackie Collins and romance novels with Fabio on the cover and kid s book with parents dragging along their crukmbsucker wishing they had never had sex with anyone  I read it in russian  Actually  my russian is much better than my english  F  Dostoyevsky is one of my favourite writers of  think making things   I can t say anything univocal   it would be platitude   banality     Que dire de cette merveille  aucun mot ne saura exprimer ce que j ai vecu en compagnie de ce roman durant ce mois  mon seul regret etait de n avoir pas pu y consacrer mes journees toutes entieres pour ne faire que penetrer dans l histoire  Ce roman m a emu comme seuls les chefs d oeuvre le font  il m a fait verse des larmes et a su touche mon ame  ce n etait pas une simple lecture pour moi mais carrement une experience qui m a comblee au plus haut point  Dostoievski a su peindre l ame et l emotion humaine comme je n ai jamais lu auparavant  il a cree des personnages authentiques et n a epargne la description d aucun de leur emotion fusse il ressenti dans la plus banale des situations  Bref  un genie de son genre  Apres ce roman et  Anna Karenine  je sens devenir fan de la litterature russe  6 stars  Raskolnikov is a young student who begins to contemplate a murder and carries out that murder  He toys with ideas at turns utilitarian or Nietzschean  The book touches on issues about how one should live  bold ideas of youth  with positive and negative consequences   and the role of religion or spirituality in one s life  I will say this about the book  if you re an impatient person  you might not want to read this book  This book required a lot of patience to read  and if I had it to do all over again  I might not have finished it  At any rate  if you like Russian novels generally  you ll like this  especially for its philosophical and emotional depth   I read this a very long time ago and loved it  Looking back at it now  I was much younger  and I think I may have been too easy on Raskolnikov who is actually a bit of a b  I don t want to re read it now because I fear I might hate it  Crime and Punishment is a great novel    a masterpiece  I think that Dostoyevsky through his novel unraveled the different meanings of crime  For example  poverty  which is a social problem the author dealt with  is actually a crime  He wanted to drive the readers or the people s attention to their superficial way of defining the word or act of crime and criminals   dealing with the question of what is meant by a crime  In the novel the murderer stated that     I fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honorable   Another quote by his sister  Dounia  asking  why you have shed blood     he  murderer  replied    which all men shed  he put in almost frantically  which flows in streams  which is split like champagne and for which men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind  Look into it more carefully and understand it    I think that this also can be linked to the people s superficial way of defining ISIS  There are more than one ISIS in this world   let alone the ISIS of thought  As Dostoyevsky said  look into it more carefully and understand it   Read the last quote from the last pages in the novel which is the murder s dream when he was in prison  The murderer s dream I guess is what Dostoyevsky foresaw to be the situation of our world today   He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of Asia  All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen  Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men  but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will  Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious  But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers  never had they considered their decisions  their scientific conclusions  their moral convictions so infallible  Whole villages  whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection  All were excited and did not understand one another  Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others  beat himself on the breast  wept  and wrung his hands  They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good  they did not know whom to blame  whom to justify  Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite  They gathered together in armies against one another  but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other  the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other  stabbing and cutting  biting and devouring each other  The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns  men rushed together  but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew  The most ordinary trades were abandoned  because every one proposed his own ideas  his own improvements  and they could not agree  The land too was abandoned  Men met in groups  agreed on something  swore to keep together  but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed  They accused one another  fought and killed each other  There were conflagrations and famine  All men and all things were involved in destruction  The plague spread and moved further and further  Only a few men could be saved in the whole world  They were a pure chosen people  destined to found a new race and a new life  to renew and purify the earth  but no one had seen these men  no one had heard their words and their voices  I also liked his way of netting the struggle or the suffering of the murderer  Self struggle is something that the author stuffed with number of important questions about life  death  religion  society and etc  Also most importantly the question of morality   principles   But if one looks at men in all ways  are there many good ones left     As a whole  I found Crime and Punishment psychologically insightful  Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoff was a personally alienated but intelligent student who broke the bounds of law  In his desperate attempt to prove his theory  he carried out the plan of killing an old woman usurer  However  I disagree with his theory that great people become famous as results of their crimes  He believed that he identified himself as one of those great people which gave him the right to commit a crime  In this case  my view is that  people of renowned achievement and leadership introduce new laws  new concepts and innovations to their society  but the fact and necessity of having to kill human beings are only means when there are people who oppose these leaders who are bringing about these societal changes  Therefore  Rasknolnikoff s reasoning about crime is flawed  since the act of killing precedes the changes he want to see in his society  And in the end of the story  he admits that he has  failed in his mission    You hate how you relate to the main character so much  and he s a bastard and a killer  cold blooded killer  as a matter of fact  A story of poverty and isolation in 19th century Russia  It is a classic  Very fulfilling  There are no flaws in this book  Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is a young man with dreams of being great with a capital G however he is living in poverty and cannot be comforted by little things such as being young  handsome  intelligent  healthy and having friends and family who would do anything for him  His inconsolable ego drives the story about apathetic and disaffected youth written well over a hundred years ago that remains disturbingly relevant  The story clips along quickly and it is not a difficult read but you cannot skim  Every line is significant  no characters are superfluous  and the Russian names are not easy to keep straight  Print a list off the internet to help you remember Avdotya is the formal name of Dounia  etc  Rather than attempt to summarize the story I will include two passages that do all that work for me  Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is summed up nicely as he observes a young woman who has become a prositute to support her alcoholic father   There are three ways before her   he thought  the canal  the madhouse  or    at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone  The last idea was the most revolting  but he was a sceptic  he was young  abstract  and therefore cruel  and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely  The novel itself is also nicely summarized by the author  This is a fantastic gloomy business  a modern case  an incident of to day when the heart of man is troubled  when the phrase is quoted that blood  renews   when comfort is preached as the aim of life  Here we have bookish dreams  a heart unhinged by theories  Here we see resolution in the first stage  but resoulution of a special kind  he resolved to do it like jumping off a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime  He forgot to shut the door after him  and murdered two people for a theory    he is a murderer  but looks upon himself as an honest man  despises others  poses as injured innocence  I can t recomend it highly enough  It s beautifully written  challenging and inspiring  Patrick Bateman has nothing on our Russian psycho  Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov   Can be hard to get through  but you ll think about it a lot and remember it forever  I am always looking for a way to relate this book to the modern literature my book club reads   so many current books have tragic and depressing themes  and they just weigh me down and bum me out and I am definitely turned off   with this book  many of the same depressing things occur  but I can accept and understand why Dostoevsky included them  and appreciate how I am asked by the author to reflect on humanity and responsibility  as opposed to just being told to cry and be sad  which is what a lot of more modern  Oprah picks  books seem to want  Oh  Rodya  thou art no Napoleon    and a good thing that is  or this would be a much less arresting read  After reading it some time right after high school  and loving it  I decided it was time to revisit this tome and I m very happy I did  I enjoyed it even more this second time This is not just a psychologically fascinating tale  it s a masterful dance  Just look at the dialogues  it s a near constant to and fro  together and apart  round and round the dancefloor  It s frustratingly captivating  it makes you ache as the characters ache  it creates a fervor  almost a madness  and when it gives you sweet relief it is not without a price that must be paid  That s life  that s Dostoyevsky  and this is masterful storytelling The biggest difference between reading it before and reading it now I think is that I found a new  strange  not necessarily love for   but certainly appreciation of   the Svidrigailov character  Raskolnikov s and his conversation at the start of part 4 is simply wonderful to read and while he isn t to be loved or adored  he does bring a certain delight to every page he is in  This book is nothing but a masterpiece  as the world already knows  It tackles difficult topics with flare and presents it in a uniqely Dostoyevskian way  I could go on but what s the point  Anyone who hasn t read it should   I really enjoy all of Fyodor Dostoyevsky s books and this is no exception  It was a bit different than some of his other works and I can see why it became a classic  I could not put it down  Llegue a Dostoyevski  en parte  por las referencias que suele hacer Henry Miller en sus libros a proposito suyo  Decidi empezar por una de las novelas mas conocidas del escritor Ruso Entre tantas cosas que podria opinar de este libro  hay dos cosas importantes   los contrastes que generan en mi las descripciones y el nivel de realidad  Cuando menciono el nivel de realidad no me refiero el genero del realismo en la literatura  necesariamente  sino a las descripciones de pensamientos y sentimientos de los personajes  Son pensamientos y sentimientos reales  cosas que a cualquiera podria ocurrir  En cuanto a los contrastes  es un tema mas bien subjetivo y personal   es el hecho de comparar San Petersburgo  una ciudad que siempre he querido visitar  que en google imagenes se ve majestuosa  con la San Petersburgo de la historia  llena de miseria Uno de los momentos mas intensos de esta novela es cuando  view spoiler   el protagonista sufre un estado parecido a la enfermedad  justo despues del asesinato  La mente de Raskolnikov trata de suprimir  inutilmente  el acto que acaba de realizar a traves de un debilitamiento fisico y adormecimiento  Esta parte fue tan fuerte que llegue a imaginarme que de alguna manera yo habria asesinado a alguien tambien  pero que a traves de suenos y agotamientos auto inducidos lo habria olvidado    hide spoiler  La historia tiene un sin numero de personajes que estan  o caen  en la desgracia  Y a pesar de ello Dostoyevski presenta algunas escenas de humor negro  como cuando una senora pretende celebrar un funeral con las personas mas distinguidas posibles   en la mentalidad de la senora   y se le aparecen personas con bata de dormir o que solo quieren comer algo   El personaje del detective es muy bueno  view spoiler   Es uno de los detectives mas estresantes que he visto  ya que nunca abandona su presa sin dejar mostrar cierta serenidad  El detective opina sobre el estado del criminal  encerrado en si mismo y sin escapatoria  con un discurso tan claro y real que acaba reduciendo a Raskolnikov a su condena inevitable   hide spoiler  Desde un punto de vista moral y educativo  pienso que la novela tiene un gran valor  Vivimos en sociedades que han banalizado la criminalidad y que se hunden progresivamente en la impunidad   tal vez a Dostoyevski le toco vivir una epoca similar     view spoiler   El crimen se presenta como un terreno desconocido e inescrutable  Los cambios que sufre la persona son irreparables  Es como una especie de demostracion de la imposibilidad de llevar el crimen y una mente normal por el mismo camino   hide spoiler  No soy un fan de las novelas llenas de desgracias  sin embargo recomiendo  sinceramente  esta novela     spoilers  Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky  read by Anthony Heald Genre  Fiction  classicRating  5Sin  Sentence  and SalvationThe allegory of Crime and PunishmentCrime and Punishment  one of the more famous works of Fyodor Dostoevsky  is considered  the first great novel of his mature period    Frank  1995  and is one of his more famous books  rivaled only by The Brothers Karamazov  What makes Crime and Punishment such a classic  Perhaps because it is a picture of the only classic  and greatest story of all time  Crime and Punishment is an allegory of Salvation Self justifiedThe main character  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  was a poor student at a university  and was overcome with hate toward an old pawnbroker  and decided to rid the world of her for the greater good of everyone  He believed that she was a  louse   and since everyone would be happier without her  his actions would be justified  He believed that he had broken the letter of the law only  but that it didn t have any authority over him anyway because it was written by people just as low as himself  He didn t believe in God  and in prison he was convinced that he didn t deserve his treatment  and that it was something he simply needed to get over with  He had no higher authority  so he said  my conscience is at rest   This is a picture of man before he is touched by the merciful salvation of Christ A Troubled ManAlthough Raskolnikov justified his actions in killing the old woman  he still felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and fear over what he did  He worked very hard at keeping it a secret  and at first he thought he could live with the guilt that sat in back of his mind  but he was wrong  Raskolnikov had horrible dreams  was always sick  and one of the other characters noticed that he was constantly  set off by little things  for no apparent reason  though the reader knew that it was only because it reminded him of his crime   This represents a man who knows in his heart that he is a sinner  but who will not turn and repent from his sin Unending LoveSonya Semyonovna Marmeladov was the daughter of a drunkard who  took the yellow card  and prostituted herself to support her family  Throughout the book  Sonya began to love Raskolnikov  Eventually  Raskolnikov told Sonya his secret  Sonya was horrified  but still loved him and forgave him after her initial shock wore off  As Raskolnikov was fighting inside with his conscience and his sins  he repeatedly snapped at her  refused her comfort  yelled at her  and so on  He was a bitter  angry  hateful man  and yet Sonya forgave him for everything he did to her  and everything he had done in his past  What redeeming quality Sonya saw in the wretch and why she forgave him  one cannot begin to comprehend  aside from the simple truth that Sonya was a loving  gentile  merciful girl  She saw that Raskolnikov needed someone to love him and she reached out to him  even when he repeatedly pushed her away  Sonya s love for him is a picture of Christ s unending and perfect love to His sinful people A Silent WitnessWhen Raskolnikov finally broke down and confessed his crime  Sonya moved to Siberia with him  Raskolnikov expected this  and knew that telling her not to come would be fruitless  She visited him often in prison and wrote to his family for him  But although Raskolnikov expected her to preach to him and push the Gospel in his face  she did not  Sonya followed the scripture s instruction to Christian wives with non Christian husbands in 1 Peter 3 1    Wives  in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that  if any of them do not believe the word  they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives     The verse tells women to be good examples of Christ to their non Christian husbands rather than to preach to them and try to convert them  and that is exactly what Sonya did  even though she was not married to him  She did not try to convert him with words  rather she won him with her love  She did not push the Testament into Raskolnikov s hands  he asked for it  When she did bring it  she did not pester him to read it  She had faith  and showed Raskolnikov the love of Christ through her actions  In the end  it paid off  Although Dostoevsky does not specifically say that Raskolnikov was converted  he does imply that he eventually became a Christian when he mused  Can not her own convictions now be mine  The truth will set you freeWhen Raskolnikov finally realized that he loved Sonya  he accepted that he was a criminal  and a murderer  When he finally accepted that he was a sinner  he repented and had a new life in him  He said he felt like  he had risen again  and that Sonya  lived only in his life   By life  Dostoevsky refers to his mentality  Before  he had been a living dead man in prison  He was hated by his inmates  was almost killed by them in an outbreak  was unaffected by anything that happened to him or his family  and eventually became ill from it all  But after his resurrection  he repented from his sins  learned to move on with his life  and started to change  He began to converse with his inmates  and they no longer hated him  Sonya was alive in his  life  because of her love for him  When he was changed  she was so happy that she became sick with joy  to the point that she was ill in bed  Dostoevsky paints a picture of a redeemed man at the end of his novel  redeemed both by the law  and by God  This picture symbolizes the miracle of salvation through Christ An amazing AllegoryDostoevsky was a wonderful writer because of his use of dialogue to tell the story  his descriptive scenes  his powerfully developed characters  and their inner dialogue  He often times told you that something was happening by only telling you what the character who was speaking at the time said in response to what was going on  For example  if Sonya was standing up  Dostoevsky would write       hey  what do you stand for   for Sonya had stood  He also painted such good descriptions of his characters  that by the middle of the book he didn t have to say that Raskolnikov was musing in the corner of the room  glaring at anyone who was brave enough to look at him  while he stewed in grief under his old ratted cap  because you knew from how well he was described earlier and how well his character was developed from the dialogue  that he was doing exactly that His characters are so real  they almost frighten you because you see the things they do and feel and experience reflected in your own life  They are not perfect  in fact they are all incredibly flawed  but they are a joy to read His ending is superb  because he closes the story without actually telling you everything  He never says that Raskolnikov was converted  he never says when he got out of prison  and he never says that Sonya and he were married  but you know that it happened  The last scene of the story is so superb  it makes you want to read it again  just to experience the joy all over again But what really made Crime and Punishment the classic that it was is the picture of the best story in the world  the classic story of the world  showing through  The story of the Gospel  of Jesus Christ s unending love and sin and salvation is clearly portrayed  and makes a joyous read Works cited Quotes are from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky  1886Frank  Joseph  1995   Dostoevsky  The Miraculous Years  1865 1871  Princeton University Press  ISBN 0 691

intimidating  I bought  ouch  the audio book of Crime and Punishment  recorded by Anthony Heald who did a fantastic job reading  His voices for the characters perfectly matched them  he felt for them  and he acted them  None of them were cheesy  yeah you all know how lame some male readers are at acting female voices   He read fast enough that the story didn t drag at all  but not so fast that you d feel like you d miss something if you didn t listen hard  I will definitely re listen to the audio book Content  some gruesome descriptions of blood from the murderRecommendation  Ages 14  Okay fine  this book is lengthy  like very  But every page that it has more than an average number in a book does not mean that it s any less great because I got hands down for this book  It s so packed with values and ideas  some of which I concur and some I oppose  But surely if you read this book you ll not regret the times where you opted to sit alone with it  You ll learn something  and that something I might have no idea about for you but I know what it is for me  Wow    where do I begin The story moves at a relatively quick pace from the very beginning of the book and the language  to me  seemed very simple  So for those of you that complain that the beginnings of books are slow and boring  here s on that you ll delight in reading I feel that Dostoevsky really captures his characters really well  He develops all sorts of personalities in this book  namely Raskolnikov  who is a troubled man with blaringly conflicting emotions  Basically  he struggles to establish a good name for himself in society after he commits the terrible crime of murder  yet he embraces his apparently superior position over all others in the world  While Raskolnikov is a highly complex character  Dostoevsky creates other  simpler characters  However  they still adorn the main plotline with equally compelling sidestories  such as that of Dunya   I honestly loved all the female characters in this story save a few like the pawnbroker  Those I m talking about are Dunya  Raskolnikov s siser   Raskolnikov s mother  and Sonya  In a story where a male protagonist undergoes massive emotional turmoil  Dostoevsky projects a strong female presence  Dunya comes across as a self respecting  yet down to earth sister who aids Raskolnikov in any way possible  Raskolnikov s mother does not do as much as Dunya  but her persistence to do good for her children is felt throughout the novel  Sonya herself was very interesting  Although she is portrayed as a cowering  overly delicate figure in Raskolnikov s presence  her dedication to him and to his ultimate confession is imperative to the plotline  I don t consider myself  or Dostoevsky  necessarily a feminist  but I warmed to his portrayal of women in a time when that was not so  The plot is engaging and thrilling  I found it interesting that the reader got exclusive insight into the mind of a criminal  We know what the crime is  who committed it  and all the little details  For once  we do not really know what the police or the detectives are thinking  It is the norm for the reader to experience the crime from the outside  but never from the perspective of the emotional tortured criminal who is undergoing a massive change in character and perspective  As a lover of mysteries  I found this plot quite special  Crime and Punishment  as I mentioned before  is relatively simple in terms of language  Of course  that depends on which translation you read  I recommend reading Constance Garnett s version  This book delves into the mind of a man who has committed a crime and lives with guilt and fear  The characters were quite fun to read about and imagine and the story itself is very engaging  I strongly recommend reading this book  This is one of the best psychological novels ever  I love that the  Crime  happens in the first 50 pages  and the  Punishment  is mostly internal  mostly moral  When I read this at the age of 17 or 18  I was first falling in love with a small quiet and devoutly pious Christian girl  She wasn t a prostitute  and I wasn t out killing pawn brokers  but I still found a bit of myself in Raskolnikov and a bit of her in Sonia  Now that I m older  I feel a lot more like Svidrigailov  who is certainly my favorite character  When an ex girlfriend read this and I gave it a reread with her  I was much more impressed with how the book is a blatant reaction to popular idealogies  It s kind of sweepingly reactionary  and I m okay with that  because I can be too  Traditional morals exist for a reason  They have the tried and true tests of time and experience  We know that rules and morals and laws keep society together  but this book also points out that they keep individuals together  which in turn implies the obvious  that individuals comprise society  There is nothing new to be said about Crime and Punishment that has not already been said  Until now  my favorite novel of any I have read was The Brothers Karamazov  but Crime and Punishment will now sit just to the left of it on my bookshelf  Thought the anti semitism is difficult to digest at times throughout the novel  and should not be brushed aside lightly  I m sure many have written about it already much more thoroughly than I am able here  Regardless of its modern flaws  It is a beautiful novel of mental suffering  despair  hope  love  and redemption  Dostoevsky is a master of characters and dialogue  It s definitely worth a read   stnfdht  Sby lakhr Hrf  w blnhy   kn y rf b y Hb  myq jrf swf yshtry lan kl almh  What would you do if you killed someone  What happens if it was for the good of the world  Raskolnikov  the main character  will tell you that you did a good deed  Fyodor Dostoyevsky effortlessly encompasses the meaning of a mental breakdown  he takes you into the mind of a murderer and makes you sympathetic for them  Trying keeping your morals on point when you read this book  Raskolnikov believes he can easily hide from the truths  but once the truth begins to eat at him  well we all know what happens then  This book is perfect for anyone interested in the human emotions and wants to be challenged  Disturbing how the human mind works  Wow  What a ride  I got up from my bed  went to the bathroom  reminded myself of the sheer historic momentousness of this tome  forced myself to plod through the last ten or so pages  excluding epilogue  despite it being the second night in a row that i was up even at 3am  trying to finish homework for all kinds of classes    and bam  i come out with a 5 star impression of the book  When i was done  i turned off the lights and lay in bed  reflecting on the entire course of the story until i slumber soon took over my consciousness  I saved the epilogue for the day after   I m not sure what exactly i gained from reading Crime   Punishment  but i feel an intangible certainty that i was able to come out of it with a little more    how should i say   wisdom   then i possessed before  The memories are still too fresh for me to right a coherent and meaningful review  the novel is still too personal for me   But they say that every law student reads this master piece of fiction at some point during their education  and as a work of literature it has consistently stood the test of time and of all cultural boundaries  I really think anyone who is even remotely interested in Crime and or Punishment  should read the entire book   I read Crime during my 12 credit load 2nd quarter of freshman year in my tough Russian Studies program  and finished Punishment  finally  during my 20 credit  completely full load  3rd quarter  for another for another class   You will thank yourself for having done so  Never has a book caused such an adverse effect on my psyche as Crime and Punishment  The main character  I won t attempt to spell his name  and his descent into torment at his actions and the paranoia he feels is enough to unnerve even the strongest willed individual  The protagonist s attempts to rationalize his actions and assure himself that he was in the right are probably situations that anyone has been in  albeit hopefully with less murderous intentions   Unlike many Russian works  I didn t feel like the book dragged or that I struggled to reach the end  Of the end  I wasn t very moved  as it just seemed like an ad for Christianity  but I do like that the character managed to find redemption through penance and the someone s love  I imagine if this was published in a more contemporary age  the main character would just walk away and continue being a morally ambiguous a hole or something worse  but hey  this was a more romantic age  ironic since we re talking mid 19th century Russia  _   Samo edin lud mozhe da poznava taka dobre umovete i deistviiata na tragichnite si geroi  gubeshchi razs d ka si  Stranitsite na romana sa zap lneni ne prosto s emotsionalni

tema Must read  Fantastic  Unique With 8 000  reviews  there s really not much chance anyone will stumble across this review hoping for a detailed analysis  Instead  I m just going to rave a bit about Dostoevsky  I really am no longer sure why bother reading anyone else in between his books  I ve taken to rationing them out to myself  I read five or six other works before picking up another of his  yet every time I come back  I find everything I find those novels to be lacking I adore his hysterically philosophical characters  how they pour out their own intellectual and spiritual struggles and hypotheses to each other in enthusiastic torrents  I find in his characters a sense of intellectual camaraderie and mutual worth that are rare in modern  or maybe just real life relationships  I find myself wanting to be even half as open and honest as even his most villainous inventions  And the things they are saying aren t just for the sake of furthering his intriguingly complex plots  but serve a dual purpose of revealing  if not a philosophical truth  at least the potential path to one  or away from one  depending on the mindset of the character delivering it   His writing is consummately satisfying  Re reading this book has made me realize that  a lot of books  such as this one  communicate better when being read throughout a extended period of time  with several breaks and other not quite serious tense things in between  Some books  especially the short and light ones are with no doubt better enjoyed when having a seamless reading experience  but I m simply not capable of and won t be capable of using this same approach on all of the books  Classic     For some reason  Crime and Punishment references were everywhere around me in movies  books  Drama and a lot of people recommended it to me as a must read so finally after all these years i decided to give it a try and all i can say is that now i know why it s Dostoyevsky s masterpiece  A masterpiece  that s the only way to describe this book  Uma obra sublime que todos os amantes da literatura devem ler   This remains the most important book I ve ever read  I read it during a very difficult period  While I won t say  it got me through  or any cliche garbage  the time period did influence my love for it This is not an uplifting book   I m not an uplifting guy  in Crime and Punishment everybody in this novel has a story everybody has different character and different suffering but if we want to speak about everybody we will need to write another book but we will talk about basic characters Dostoevsky turns on the paradoxical character of a thoughtful  sensitive young man Though he seems a brutal murderer  he s a philosophic young man who radically challenges our basic assumptions about good and evil Dostoevsky conceived his novel as answer to the philosophic theories of his day  utilitarianism   nihilism  In light of these theories  Dostoevsky s novel asks  in effect   How would a humanitarian murderer conceive his crime  commit it  then live with the consequences    1  Raskolnikov a young man who embraced dangerous new theories  Raskolnikov publishes an article arguing that ordinary people admit to law but extraordinary people  such as Napoleon  have the right to break the law and kill people even innocent people for the benefit of humanity in large 2  While drinking tea at a tavern  he overhears a student whose comments on a rich old pawnbroker  The student says the woman  who has left all her money to a monastery  should be killed and her money devoted to the service of all mankind  Raskolinkof start thinking of that and ask himself wouldn t thousands of good deeds make up for one little tiny crime       and what does the life of this stupid  consumptive  wicked and old crone mean in the general balance  no more than a life of a louse  he aimes to use the woman s money to relieve his widowed mother and sister from the burden of supporting him Raskolnikov wrestles with himself  he s repelled by the thought of it  He begs God to deliver him from the nightmare of his own intentions but his urge to renounce his intentions can not stand the pressure of what he takes to be fate  when he goes to the market he overhears Lizaveta the sister of old woman  talking to wife and agree to see them at 7 o clock the following night  he nearby acquires a captivating piece of information that tomorrow at 7 o clock in the evening Lizaveta will be out and the old woman will be left at home ALONE  a sense of destiny now seizes Raskolnikov and feels that he is predistened to do so 3  After killing the old woman  he must also kill her innocent sister  Lizaveta  because she sees the corpse 4  He stashes the old woman s loot in a small hole in a deserted lot  then he realizes that he doesn t even know how much money is in the woman s purse that he stole or what he would do with it  he finds that this crime hasn t made him Napoleon and he is also consumptive and nothing as the old woman 5  He becomes isolated  When his mother and sister come from the country to see him he realizes that he can t talk to them at all and feels he does not want to talk to anyone about anything ever paradoxically  he speaks too much to the man he should hide as much as possible  the police inspector  Porfiry   by questioning Raskolnikov about his article  he is like krombo  asls questions which seems trivia but lead him to know what he wants to know and the police inspector nearly gets him to admit his guilt a  When Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he considers himself one of the  extraordinary people who have the right to break laws  Raskolnikov says it s possible b  When Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he himself would kill and rob  Raskolnikov says only that he would not tell Porfiry if he did 6  Exemplifying the psychology of guilt as Dostoevsky conceives it  Raskolnikov s conscience demands that he be punished for his crime  7  kindness and sensitivity of Raskolinkov will save him from his suffering early in the novel  Dostoevsky shows the kind side of Raskolinkov  He tries to save the drunken young girl that he sees on a bench from a rich man wants to use her this sensitivity will lead him to give most of his money to Marmeladov s destitute family  His generosity to the Marmeladov family wins the love of Sonia  Marmeladov s daughter  who has been supporting the family with her earnings as a harlot  but who sets out to keep Raskolnikov spiritually  physically  and emotionally alive 8  Raskolnikov s sister  Dounia  tells him that she will marry to a rich man  but he knows that she hates him He can not bear that donia will sacrifice herself for the seek of his own advancements  in eyes of Raskolinkof Donia and Sonia have to choose between prostitution and destitution unless he finds a third alternative for them  which he does  he also come to cherished Sonia as the only one who can save him from madness and suicidal despair  he needs her as she needs him 9  Sonia finally offers the despairing Raskolnikov the gift of faith  She gives him a copy of the New Testament brought to her by the murdered Lizaveta Raskolinkof confesses to Sonia that he killed both the old and Lizaveta  at the moment of confession  he sees Sonia s face the face of Lizaveta  the same look of helpless childish terror  but sonia does not reject him  she tells him that she will never leave him and indeed she does a harlot and a murderer are Reading together the story of Christ and he agrees to admit his crime to police 10  Raskolinkov goes to prison and Sonia follows him to prison in Siberia in the prison he asks himself why he should go on living  why he does not kill him self  Sonia give him the answer  In the light of her devotion  he sees  the dawn of a renewed future   they were resurrected by love  the heart of each held infinite sources of live for the heart of the other crime and punishment is a story of a crime   suffering and the mind of murderer and also a story of regeneration and Dostovesky s faith in the love  faith and human soul  I loved this book  I was very surprised by the ending and I love it when that happens  It was extremely well written and I loved how it flowed  I thought for a while I might get annoyed with the way Rodya was handling certain things  but then things would change and another surprise would unfold  I did not quite fall in love with the book until midway through  Then  it was almost impossible to put down  except that I had to put it down several times which is why it took so long for me to read it  Ugh  I don t know how I picked audiobook for the type  but it was actually a book   Anyway  it was great and I will be looking into his other books to see if there is something of interest still waiting for me   One of my top 10 books  There s just so much here  Friendship  psychology  the treatment of women in the 19th century  what it means to be evil  what it means to be a little evil  how reactions can t be predicted  especially when they re our own reactions  Most of all  it s that punishment comes long before the criminal is found out  maybe even before the crime   An incredible portrait of insanity  Having known some manic  bi polar  eccentric  paranoid people in my life  it was almost shocking to see the initmate reality of such conditions revealed so openly on the page  As there are likely whole graduate level courses devoted to the genius of Dostoevsky  the amateur reader in me won t dare to offer much critique other than to say that this book was thoroughly exiting to read  So visceral  you can almost feel your own heart racing along with the main character s escalations into madness  rwy  kthr mn ry    lqd  sht m

best lines ever   this book stays with you and I still find myself guoting lines from it  It is a book that is worth rereading because when you do you find it still holds up and that you learn new things each read  taking different vantage points or things you might have missed the first time through  One of the best books I have ever read  While reading it I kept believing it was about how we as humans can justify anything  and put ourselves on a pedestal  In the end it is a story about the process of repentance  Fyodor Dostoevsky s Crime and Punishment is epic in the scope of human emotions  yet fiercely small in execution  it centers around a few ordinary people and takes place in the span of only a few weeks  It focuses on the deeds and subsequent demons of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov   a young intellectual who murders an old woman in an attempt to make himself  extraordinary   As the novel progresses  Raskolnikov must face his own guilt  disappointment  and ultimate transformation  Dostoevsky s intention  namely  to question what happens when the intellect is one s only guide  is captured very clearly in his writing  This book provides a thrilling and captivating plot while still managing to impart the wisdom that will so often drag a book like this down  As the Chicago Tribune says  this translation retains the  force and frightening immediacy  that comes across in the original Russian  This novel is not only a page turner  but a stunning insight into the complications of the human mind  It will draw you deeply into the earthy Russian spirit  seizing your interest and making you rethink your own values and the morals of our society   This book surprised me   some may look down on me for not reading any Dostoevsky novels until I was 30 but honestly I thought it might be a bit over my head  I found this to be as easy as reading someone like Hemingway  though  only with more of a Dickens meets Hesse in Russia sort of feel to it  In any case  it was very easy to understand with the exception of the names of the characters at times Crime and Punishment is one of those books you feel is incredibly relevant and probably will be so as long as there are humans existing on the planet  Dostoevsky s insight on humanity  consequences  and even social structures are advanced and quite profound  The moral arguments within this text are fascinating to read in the same way many of the best philosophy texts are  only this is applied to a situation one must imagine has occurred hundreds of times both before and after the novel is written  I don t think Dostoevsky s goal was to stop people from committing crimes but delve deep within the psyche of one murderer and show us the mirror he brought with him on the dive  This is definitely in my top 10 of books I have ever read  Dostoyevski has the tendency to be dull  until you get into the story  I love the way he develops the characters  giving them shape and depth  I am sorry I finished reading it  although I have been trying to read it by bits  so that I can enjoy it longer  Will definitely read it again  in a few years time  And am not giving up on the hardcopy  as it is one that I d like to hold on to   For such a long book it had something to say throughout  Something profound and something not altogether easily categorised  I m conflicted  not sure if I absolutely love it  reading a translation of course cant be as good as the original   A book which was ahead of its time a psychological thriller with elements of alienation  morality  pride and ego  radical thinking and much more   It began with the socialist doctrine  You know their doctrine  crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more  and nothing more  no other causes admitted   This novel stayed with me for weeks  I often think of it even now  It is a great caution against putting your nose where it doesn t belong   It is no mystery to me after re reading  or reading thoroughly for the first time actually  this classic  Raskolnikov is truly a ground breaking character in literature  Dostoyevsky takes you inside the mind of a  regular  man who commits murder and instead of playing him as merely a villain  takes you inside his head and makes you understand how his mind works and his inner turmoil and insecurity Truly a monumental work and a psychological masterpiece from  in my opinion  Russia s greatest author A must read for everyone  My first Dostoevsky  Gives an insightful look into a tormented soul  I could relate to the main character so well it was almost scary  It was also a surprisingly accessible read  maybe it was the translation  Pevear and Volokhonsky  sp    I read   Anyway  I feel further comments aren t necessary for this particular book  everybody should read this  I first read  Crime and Punishment  at the age of eighteen  and the weighty issues involving murderous rage  suicide  and the like were a bit too much  But now I have re read the book  and noticed so much more of its grandeur  its significant importance in the canon of Western Literature  It deserves the highest praise  as both a representative story of suffering and redemption  and as a  thinker s book  exploring deep philosophical issues relating to Friedrich Nietzsche and theories of  The extraordinary man  and  The Superman   These are woven into a story which is also a psychological exploration of a man searching for his place  denying himself  suffering as a result  and ultimately finding love  At one point  the criminal Raskolnikov exclaims in passionate frenzy     so  why are you embracing me  Because I couldn t endure it myself  and have come to shift the burden onto another   You suffer too  it will be so much the easier for me   Can you really love such a scoundrel  Not only does Sonya love Raskolnikov  despite his crimes  but she also becomes the symbol of suffering humanity  suggesting to him that he prostrate himself before God and man  claim his wicked deed  expiate his own sin  and redeem himself to his proper place  In the beginning  Raskolnikov believes himself to be more important  the  Extraordinary Man  theory  which holds that a man of greatness  such as Napoleon  can step over others and kill them  because of his own superiority Coupled with this is the character of Svidrigailov  who represents Nietzsche s  Superman   and ultimately thinks he can do however he pleases  This theory in opposition to Raskolnikov s  would mean that Svidrigailov can be on his own  alone  needing no one  In the end  it is disproved  because the man who wanted to do as he pleases and be independent of other people  desires the warmth and affection  and human contact  of a young girl  This failure of his theory leads him to contemplate his existence  see no way forward  and kill himself with a bullet through the brain The extraordinary one here is Fyodor Dostoevsky  who is able to represent a raving madman  going into great detail of his interior monologue  of his illness  This state of mind is so well written  that I believe it to rank with Edgar Allan Poe s story  The Tell Tale Heart   in that it describes a man who is driven mad by the murder he has already fully committed himself to perform  It is this description of the mental state  and the wonderfully well written story  underlaid with such rich philosophical theories and psychological background  that makes me give this novel five stars  I am sure that I will one day seek it out on my bookshelves again  I decided to read this new translation  expertly done by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky  It was expertly done  mentioning  a sucker   i e  a  fool    someone being  plastered   i e   drunk    just to include two examples  This vernacular of common everyday people  this richly translated story  including all of the wonderfully explained footnotes  lend new life to it  and far surpass any previous translation  I know  because I read one myself at the age of 18  Disturbing  horrifying  uncomfortable  beautiful  rewarding and thoughtful  Push through and you ll see its fingerprints on your life  The remarkable thing about Dostoevsky s characters is his foresight in portraying their reactions to their fate  He somehow always knows how a certain personality will end up  how he ll be forced to come to terms with his ideal  In Crime and Punishment  Raskolnikov may appear to be mad  but his fantasy is almost reasonable in light of his suffering  which comes to the fore gradually throughout the plot  Though he s an inwardly charitable and  compared to other loathsome characters  like Luzhin and Svidrigailov  even compassionate gentleman  his crime is clearly vile and egoistic  We re reminded constantly throughout the plot that this crime is clearly wrong  that this man has done wrong and for the wrong reasons Dostoevsky has every confidence that his readers are intelligent enough to know that he doesn t condone murder  In fact  Raskolnikov s path of delirium causes more anguish for himself and those around him than any punishment in Siberia  Nothing is resolved concerning his Napoleonic ideal  he only concludes himself unworthy of it   this is my only issue with the text  If anything is redeemed in the course of events  it s always the inevitability of poverty and death that resolves the situation  The drunkeness of Marmelodov  the madness of Katerina Ivanovna  the dangerous stalking of Svidrigailov   these intrigues are all relieved by untimely deaths The only characters that seem to be fantastic are ironically the only comforting and recognizably fabled in the cast   Lebezyatnikov and Luzhin  In the funeral feast scene  Luzhin is called out and humiliated by his  partner in crime  Lebezyatnikov for framing Sonya  It s cathartic but seems awkwardly placed or rushed in  Aside from this the plot and characters are genius  of course  and still so perfectly dark and ominous scene by scene  that I feel absurd critiquing it at all I regret that I hadn t read this properly and in depth before  and after reading this PV translation I think of it as nearly as good as The Idiot and The Brothers Karamozov  If you re having a difficult time with it  watch the 1970 USSR adaptation  of like title  by Lev Kulidzhanov  It s accurate and the English dubbing can easily be set  I read this book in the 1970 s  No book has probably had a greater influence on my reading or even life  I m told that Dostoyevsky is somewhat out of favor today and that s a shame  This book is at the top of my reread list  I recently saw the movie with Peter Lorie in the lead role  This is a GREAT read  I have many favorite books  but this one just might top the list  I read it in highschool  but it really impacted me  It s about crime   and punishment    ha ha  but also about self hatred  love  and redemption   I have tried to write a review for this book several times  but have failed  What follows is not much of a review but  notes  for  my own self  much like Rodya s murders      I read this book like a thriller   I was so curious about Rodya s fate that I read the 700  pages in about five days  which makes this book the fastest I ve ever read  Needless to say  this also means that I was so highly engaged in the plot that I could not pay attention to much else  This makes me want to re read the book sometime in the future  when I am hopefully more aware of the Russian socio political scene around that time   Purpose of the book  Initially I thought of it more like a psychological exercise   to understand the mind of a murderer  But as the novel progressed  it felt more like an attempt to portray the murderer as a human   very soon I liked Raskolnikov even after the murders  His impulsive urge to help people in need  often at a cost to his own self   his love for his mother and sister and general goodness made him very likeable  except when he was angry and even when he thought himself mighty special   Post murders  I felt all his emotions   his fear and anxiety  then his hopefulness and relief  and then fear and anxiety again and so on  The only thing which threw me off now and then was his sudden and intense loathing towards other people  which because I could not feel  amused me   In the  very interesting  afterword to this edition  ISBN 190463334X  ISBN13  9781904633341    Oliver Francis mentions that in writing this book  Dostoevsky was warning against the effects of Nihilism  Rodya is a quintessential Nihilist and in Dostoevsky s opinion  Nihilists are upto no good  He says that it is only in God we find the meaning of life  and we must suffer to find happiness  apparently a Russian Orthodox belief   In retrospect  this seems to be the case as most of the book is about Rodya s suffering and then redemption with the help of Sonia  who he initially dismisses as a  holy fool    although I almost completely missed this point  The time when Rodya asked Sonia to read to him the section on Lazarus from the Bible  should have served as a hint  but I still failed to pay attention  On the other hand  I read it much like a commentary on power  Raskolnikov is not wrong  when he claims that there exist men who are special and that most  or did he say all    great men  are criminals in a way  The examples he gives of  great men  were actually  powerful men  rather than say poets  With great power  comes a license to do whatever the hell you want  and the only reason Rodya  failed  was that he was poor  Even then  being a member of the Elite  because of his education   he was somewhat spared by Porfiry because Porfiry claimed to like him and to find him interesting  Would he have done the same if Rodya was an uneducated non elite   Dreams as a way of knowing the characters more deeply  Again something I noticed by did not realize  A lot of the characters  dreams are described in good detail   There was an interesting comment on the naming of characters  Sonia s intimate name  Sofia  derives from he Greek for wisdom  whilst Raskolnikov s sensible  industrious  generous friend Razumihin derives from Russian razum meaning reason or good sense  The falsely confessing Nikolay Dementyev gain his name as a derivation from the Latin dementia  madness   and Dounia s unscrupulous and mercenary fiance Luzhin stems from lyzhin meaning dirty or muddy  The name of Raskolnikov himself is derived from raskol meaning schism or break  This is my favourite book of all time and it being the first book I read in 2014 for the first time just set my hopes so high and my standards right up after this absolute treasure  This book is my All time favorite  Not because the seeting was in russia  The main character always had me sitting on edge  The brutality of the mind that suffers once making others suffer first    and then reveal it all at the end as a way to be spiritually renewed   This book is one of my favoritescan t stop saying that the Russian classic Literature is the most real  beautiful and honest thing I ve read this book more than 3 times and gave several lessons on it I think this was my first  adult  book  Sadly  now that I think about it  I m pretty sure I had a better attention span and focus as a 9 year old kid than I do now  I distinctly remember having one passion for a month or two of my life  finishing Crime and Punishment Now my  currently reading  shelf has no less than 7 books on it  Go figure  I guess I ve been raised on the cultural myth  epitomized in the smartphone  that you need to be doing  and reading  a bazillion things at once to be effective  I didn t expect to love this book when it was assigned to me in my High School English class  but I did  I believe the one I read was a different translation  but couldn t find the one I was looking for  Classic  Murder mystery  Intellectual drop out student contemplates and then commits a murder of town pawnbroker  How he lives with his crime and final resolution  It was really good  A psychological thriller as much as a spiritual novel  Dostoyevsky takes the reader through a tour of a tortured soul wrestling with his own guilt  In the end it turns out to be a story of hope  but along the way the journey is terrible  See my full review here  http   andthewordsbecamebooks wordpre    Dostoevsky s most accessible book  and I would recommend it very highly to anyone  It s a fantastic read  and not that difficult  really  However  I would strongly recommend reading the Pevear Volokhonsky translation  other translations I have read of Dostoevsky s work seem muddy and leaden by comparison   hidupin soundtrack Death Note Akhirnya Raskolnikov menyerah Novel klasik terbaik yang pernah kubaca sejauh ini Dari novel ini dapat diambil kesimpulan bahwa saat itu  di Rusia  orang orang miskin ternyata memiliki pendidikan tinggi dan sangat cerdas  seperti Avdotya Romanovna  Orang orang berduit cenderung pelit dan berotak dangkal  contohnya Pyotr Petrovich Pria yang bergaya feminim ternyata seorang detektif yang otaknya canggih  contohnya Porfiry Gadis yang rela menjual diri demi keluarganya ternyata sangat religius  contohnya Sofya Semyonovna Orang yang idiotic ternyata berhati mulia  contohnya Lizaveta Dan orang yang pendiam  anti sosial  sakit sakitan  suka menolong  dan membenci uang ternyata bisa membunuh tanpa ketahuan  contohnya Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov Paling emosional saat Raskolnikov berteriak  Saya adalah seorang pembunuh   Walaupun tetap aja dia nggak merasa sudah membunuh seseorang  Dia cuma membunuh seekor kutu Persis Light Yagami kun  kyaaaa  Cuma kalau Raskolnikov menganggap dirinya Napoleon  bukan shinigami  _____ Raskolnikov bukan contoh yang baik  sekalipun dia pintar  rajin menolong  religius  dan tampan Oh  mulai lagi Ya  tapi dia memang tampan  tingginya di atas rata rata  tubuhnya ramping  dan bla bla bla  Hanya saja ketampanannya tersamarkan oleh pakaiannya yang lusuh Ah  nggak papa  Sekali tampan tetap tampan Nah  karena sudah melenceng  saya akhiri review sinting ini  Farvel   malah pake Bahasa Denmark   ___  I m really embarrassed and ashamed that I haven t read this yet Okay  now I have and I m even more embarrassed I hadn t before  Fucking fabulous   Absolutely amazing book about poverty  ambition  remorse  family  ethical values  societal norms   the human condition really  A diverse cast of well developed characters shows how different people may view and handle these intricate concepts  Still  fairly easy to get into and not at all the tiring read one might expect  Oh  Rodya  I simply fell in love with you  Such a  gentle giant  type character  I m so glad this book had a somewhat happy ending  Was beginning to think there was absolutely nothing happy about this book at all  Kind of a dark story but VERY interesting   This story is quite compelling  Being inside the mind of a man who has killed and experiencing his frenetic thoughts and actions is rare and unusual Regrettably I wasn t able to finish it before I packed and left to travel and I had to leave it behind  But if I see it in a charity shop or find it online as a free classic  I will definitely finish it  Russian literature has always been one of my favorites  although I m a student of English literature  and Dostoyevsky is without doubt  the main reason for this interest  Whenever I see Crime and Punishment on my shelf  I feel like picking it up from it s place and start reading it all over again  The novel is surely a masterpiece  I will never get bored of reading it  It is usually my first recommendation whenever I m asked to give one  I read this in high school in lieu of The Great Gatsby   along with about two other people in my class   because it was longer and neglected by most of my so called A P  English class  You know why people like The insipid  pissy Gatsby  Because the font s bigger  it has fewer pages  and it s written in a simpler style  but Crime   Punishment is BETTER  You hear me    Una excelente edicion de este clasico ruso  Fedor Dostoievsky nos arrastra por las profundidades de la mente humana  Esta novela trasciende el tiempo porque su tematica es la contradiccion de la mente misma   Quien puede afirmar que comparte todos los valores de la sociedad   Quien no ha pensado en cometer lo que para otros es un crimen  pero para el no es mas que un medio para un fin  El castigo autoimpuesto por la conciencia quiza sea el mejor invento de la sociedad moderna  No es realmente el castigo fisico el que destruye un alma  sino el que la mente del criminal le dicta  Con personajes completamente logrados  Dostoievsky nos narra una de las historias mas trascendentes del siglo XIX  Definitivamente es una novela para leerse  Aunque siendo honestos  no es para todos  Lectores noveles  abstenganse  les aburrira  Wonderful   Hd  lrwy   lklsyky  lkhld  w

wonderful  the language was more than readable  although the complexities and depth behind the text are apparent  I thoroughly enjoyed reading Crime and Punishment  and it is a definite reread  gr hdf

dd  Well  what can I say that hasn t been said a thousand times before  Sitting here typing this review reminds me why I rarely bother writing reviews of established classics  It s all been said before  so often and so well  what can a numpty like me hope to add I first read Crime and Punishment when I was a teenager  I loved it  but at the same time I don t think I fully understood it  I was too innocent  perhaps  and too desperate to believe that people are basically good  and that we should all  y know  be nice to each other  A few years and a few bruises later  that belief is difficult to sustain  And Crime and Punishment takes us right down into the dark  seething  ugly heart of humanity   and then  hauntingly  shines a faint ray of hope into it On the surface  the plot is simple enough  but Dostoyevsky never operates solely  or even primarily  on a surface level  which is perhaps one of the reasons why I love him  Beneath the apparent simplicity of the story is a web of interlocking philosophical  moral  religious  political and social questions  For example  Raskolnikov s crime is informed by his idea that certain men  in certain conditions  have the right to sidestep  or discard  morality  Interestingly  Crime and Punishment was one of Moors Murderer Ian Brady s favourite books  and he identified strongly with Raskolnikov  but he also discarded Dostoyevsky s central message about repentance and redemption We experience Raskolnikov s descent as he does  from the dramatic opening chapter in which he contemplates murder  through his agony and tortuous attempts to justify himself  right through to his punishment  and the start of his eventual redemption   Several scenes are frighteningly real  Raskolnikov s desperate flight from the murder scene  his feverish  tormented state of mind afterwards  and the knot of suspicion and guilt that slowly but ineluctably closes around him  We identify with Raskolnikov  even though he s not a particularly sympathetic character  People who assume  with no justification whatsoever  that they re better than everyone else annoy me in general  Yet it s testament to Dostoyevsky s skills that we are able to experience Raskolnikov s world as he experiences it  and are unable to condemn him outright  Raskolnikov is saved by suffering  and by the devoted love of the patient  sweet natured prostitute Sonia   And this is another thing that I love about Dostoyevsky  his ability to wring something of nobility and grandeur out of the most pitiful lives  Nobility  A murderer and his prostitute girlfriend  Oh  yes  Yes  Raskolnikov s crime is not simply the murders  but his arrogance in setting himself apart from  and above  his fellow beings  His punishment consists not simply of that meted out by the authorities  but in the inner repentance and self loathing he feels  And with these  Dostoyevsky introduces the idea of redemption and salvation  Interwoven with Raskolnikov s story  is the strangely parallel story of his enemy  the vile Svidrigailov  who has his own crimes to expiate   crimes that society would probably consider less serious  but which were committed by so darkened and dead a soul that there is little possibility of redemption in his case Each character is given his or her unique characteristics and traits  and his or her own distinctive  voice   They rub against each other  collide  collude  come together and go their separate ways  Yet we re constantly drawn back to Raskolnikov  who serves as an emblem of both the depths to which humanity can sink and the greatness to which we can aspire  It s not always an easy  still less a comforting  read  but if you want to fathom the murky depths of the human condition this is for you  It was a great book  Some parts were a drag to read while other parts were page turners  I guess from this book I noticed I like more dialogue in books and less detail  I have read this book THREE times  not a minor accomplishment considering its density   and I loved it more with each reading  Dostoyevsky addresses the human conscience as a question of circumstance and intent  The novel s protagonist  Rodion Raskolnikov rationalizes that  extraordinary men  transcend the law and can be excused of some crimes if they are perpetrated for the greater good  He tests this theory in his own life and is faced with the psychological implications of his actions  From the crime itself  to the unraveling of Raskolnikov s resolve  this story deals with the struggle of the good and evil in all of us   I could write thousands of words about this excellent novel  in part because of the fantastic book group I joined to discuss it  But you wouldn t want to read my endless thoughts and I d never do it justice anyway  Here s how you know this novel is worth your time and effort  I never thought I could spend six 90 minute sessions talking about a single book   that s 9 full hours    and yet it wasn t nearly enough for Crime   Punishment  I could imagine talking about it for six more sessions  it s that complex and so full of wonderful detail  Dostoevsky is the master  Such a good novel of  what a man thinks in his heart  so he is   It isn t an easy read  at least for me  but has great characters  heart wrenching losses  amazing resilience and redemption  When one of the characters  a man who abandons his family for alcohol  announces that God loves him too  my frustration with him was changed to love  Beautifully done    Delitto e Castigo  e l esecuzione di un dramma  Un dramma interno e feroce  Ma non grida a voce altra e strepita  O meglio lo fa  Ma e anche basso  infido  strisciante  Il motivo stesso del delitto che Raskol nikov compie  ai danni di una vecchia usuraia e della sorella  non e chiaro fin dall inizio  Per il denaro  Non proprio  Per vendetta  Beh  no  I motivi sono vari ovviamente  ma di fondo sussurra quel concetto di Raskol nikov stesso  il fatto che esistano  uomini straordinari   per i quali le leggi non esistono  ma che loro stessi sono la legge  superiore ad essa  affermati geni superando gli ostacoli  Senza indugio  Ma Raskol nikov crolla  Crolla per la voce della sua coscienza certo  ma crolla anche per il non superamento di certi confini  per la paranoia  per la mancata affermazione morale  Il crollo non e chiassoso  E un vero e proprio percorso di angoscia  paranoia appunto  con anche un ansia quasi da romanzo giallo poi  I personaggi intorno a Raskol nikov sono tra i piu vari  canaglie  portatrici di redenzione  amici veri  Non voglio dilungarmi sullo stile  se Dostoevskij piace  piace  La sua capacita di delineare la moralita e la brama sono tra le poche capaci di mettere davvero in atto la sceneggiatura di veri contrasti umani  Cinque stelle meritatissime  This novel has the most real characters I have ever read in a book  or from any author to date  I thought the book would be hard to read  considering it s a Russian classic  but I got through it surprisingly quickly  The emotion  the psychology  the political intrigue  the philosophy  the plot  the characters  the setting  the storytelling  and the prose are all you could ever want from a book This is now one of my favorite books  and I am so glad that I decided to ask for it for my birthday  Do yourself a favor and look into this one if you re a fan of good murder stories that deal more with psychology than anything  a piece of art    Verilecek cezanin  yakalanacak olmanin korku ve olumsuz heyecani  suc islemeden once sonra hissedilenlerin

malam ulang tahun saia  di gunung sambil menggigil kedinginan  hiking bersama teman yg sengaja ingin merayakan ulang tahun saia dengan membuat saia menderita   ini  sempat membuat saia berhenti total membaca buku  selama 28 hari sesudah saia turun gunung  saia sama sekali tidak mau membaca buku apapun  takut tidak bisa menikmati kenikmatan membaca seperti saat membaca buku ini  meski akhirnya saia tersadar  masih ada banyak buku hebat lain yang yang terserak diantara sekian banyak  buku sampah  lainnya 2  Buku Crime and Punishment diceritakan dengan sangat hebat  punya kisah yang teramat memukau  karakter karakter agung  Kisah detektif pembunuhan ini mengupas sisi psikologi tergelap dan terdalam manusia  bagian paling liar dan paling kejam yang ada pada diri setiap orang yang tak pernah disadari  Thomas Mann  menyebut buku ini sebagai The Greatest Detective Story Ever Told dan dijadikan sumber inspirasi bagi Freud dalam memulai kajian psikoanalisisnya yang fenomenal  Dalam daftar buku terbaik sepanjang masa versi apapun  buku ini selalu bertengger manis di 10 besar 3  Yang mengagumkan dari novel tebal ini  sangat tebal    adalah detail yang kaya dalam menggambarkan suasana muram  keputusasaan  tragedi  sikap asosial  alienasi  sinisme  dan nihilisme  semuanya dipentaskan melalui pisau analisis tajam dalam tragedi kemanusiaan terbesar sekaligus paling mengerikan sepanjang masa 4  Selama membaca 9000 buku  ex  majalah  komik  buku pelajaran   kebanyakan novel yang saia baca adalah bergenre detektif misteri thriller kriminal  dari buku2 itu  saia belajar banyak hal  Dulu pernah kejadian  ada seorang teman pernah mampir ke kostan  kebetulan saia sedang membaca buku Agatha Christie  teman saya nyeletuk bertanya  buat apa baca buku tentang pembunuhan seperti itu  memangnya saia mau menjadi seorang pembunuh  dengan nada sedikit mengancam dengan ekspresi sedingin mungkin saia berujar   bila diperlukan  saia bisa membunuh orang yang datang ke kostan saia dengan kemungkinan 6 cara yang tak bisa mengindikasikan bahwa saia pelakunya  ada 4 cara membunuh korban tanpa perlu membuat korban meronta meronta berteriak  dan 7 cara keluar dari kostan saia sehingga tercipta alibi sempurna bagi saia Sesaat saia berhenti berkata sambil memikirkan ada berapa kemungkinan lain cara saia bisa membunuh  dr kemungkinan kemungkinan yang pernah saia sebutkan  setidaknya dg permutasi matematis  ada 168 cara membunuh  dan masih tertarik memikirkan kemungkinan lainnya  saat melihat senyum di wajah teman saia mendadak hilang dan wajahnya tampak lebih pucat Hehe  serius  dengan banyak membaca kisah2 kriminal  saia menjadi tau Bagaimana cara membunuh korban tanpa perlu mengotori diri dengan darah  bagaimana cara membunuh orang tanpa perlu meninggalkan menghapus jejak yang mencurigakan  bagaimana cara membunuh korban dengan trik yang bakal membingungkan polisi tercerdas sekalipun  bagaimana cara membunuh dengan menciptakan alibi sempurna   Ngeri  bagaimana kalau saia punya cara yang paling kejam diantara semuanya  Bagaimana cara membunuh orang tetapi tuduhannya teralihkan pada orang lain  Tapi  semua itu belum bisa mengalahkan cara keji yang saia dapatkan dari buku ini  yah  dengan sangat gamblang dan brilian  buku Crime and Punishment telah mengajarkan apa yg selama ini para pelaku kejahatan selalu luput melakukannya sehingga mereka dengan mudahnya mengaku pada polisi  buku ini menerangkan bagaimana cara kita melenyapkan perasaan bersalah karena membunuh 5  Membaca buku ini mengingatkan saia pada lagu tentang pembunuhan yang dinyanyikan secara riang dan ringan  tentang seorang psiko yang keranjingan membunuh dan mendapatkan kesenangan karena membunuh  Maxwell s Silver Hammer6  Buku ke 9001 yg saia baca juga tentang pembunuhan  image error  On a scale of one to this is the best book I ve read as required literature   Wow  Rodian Raskolnikov has done to me what Edward Cullen has done to the teenage female world  It s been a real kick following this guy s existential journey  and frankly  I m a little bummed out to be done with it  I m sure anything I have to say has been said before  so I ll just leave it at that   besides  the amount of impressed I am is quite ineffable   Woah  I tried to read this book a year ago  but was trying to rush through it and couldn t finish  It just wasn t enjoyable  But now that I read it at a slower  more understanding pace  I found this book to be absolutely incredible  The emotion  the characters  and the thinking behind everyone s actions really pulls you in and screams at you  This is a great story   Every page I turned brought me further in to the mind of every character  And unlike some other books I ve read  Crime and PUnishment has the most satisfying ending I ve ever read Thanks for writing an incredible book  Fyodor  Caro Rodia  que caminhos de sofrimento intransponiveis e isolados percorreste    Grandes viagens pela mente Caro Dostoievski  no

know til the 1980 s that cigarettes are bad for you  because this book was published in 1866 and says that cigarettes can give you  black lung   I basically had to stop drinking for a month in order to read it  my friends no longer call  But it s great  I Liked This Book So Much That I ve Created a Doc  To Give This Great Novel My Tribute   Also To Clarify My  Trouble  Abut The Cover Do Check out The Link   Please Share Your Feedback With Me __________http   www scribd com doc 77396150 Cr    Tolstoy spent 1200 pages of War and Peace to refute the theory of the extraordinary man  Dostoevsky  it seems to me  did it very nicely with a few strokes of an ax  This was my first reading of Crime and Punishment since childhood  and it affected me almost as powerfully today as it did fifty years ago  All the logic in the world  Raskolnikov finally learned   I hope  is no good if one begins with the wrong premise  There is no way I can really analyze a book by Dostoevsky  his writing is something that  kicking and screaming at times  one has to live  How to write a review that is on the level of the book  How to describe how it has grasped me since the very beginning  How to say that I completely felt the way he felt  forgetting for the moment the reality outside the book  It was a pleasure to read it despite the title  Its funny how I came across this book  It caught my eye at a road side bookshop in Delhi as it was suggested by a friend of mine having a fine taste in literature  So I thought it would be a nice read for my two day train journey towards south of India  I am 21 years old and it was striking how close the ideas of Rodion Romanovitch matched mine  The book gives a fine insight of the psychology of a murderer with a conscience  It describes the misery of a student  the poverty in Russia  It also tells how cunning can people get to achieve what they want  I think if I had to summarize the book in one word I would choose the word Conscience  All through we are taken deep into the guilty conscience of Raskolnikov and we see the mental turmoil that he faces  Crime and punishment are related by causality  Punishment always follows crime however it is still not clear to me how this would be if the criminal does not have a conscience  Another point that was not clear to me was Sonia  Sonia I think could have been omitted from the story  If Raskolnikov had stayed for few more months like that he would have eventually confessed his crime  What was the need of putting Sonia into the story  Ofcourse she is the religious pivot of the story but then it only sums up to the possible fact that Dostoevsky was himself religious and then for me it does not undertake any deeper meaning This book left me with tears and a smile at the same time    The last chapter  how it ends    Its only seven more years  they will seem like only seven days when they meet again    Breathtaking   The introduction in my book explained that Dostoevsky was poor at the time he wrote this due to gambling  He approached publishers saying that he was going to write something that has never been written before  After reading this  I have to say that it is one of the most unique novels I ve ever read  It was perfect  I am not gonna front   it has been a minute since I read this book   since senior year of high school for AP English  I recall being completely enraptured by Dostoyevsky s writing style and his examination of the psyche   or psychosis   of Raskolnikov  I especially remember loving Porfiry Petrovich and how he seemed to personify Raskolnikov s psyche   the paranoia   etc  I need to give it a read again  And maybe you should go read it too  Maudlin story that took me to the brink of almost every emotion  but a deeply satisfying read  Read during an English class  Had to write a 10 page research paper after reading  It was so painful     yet a couple of weeks after the paper was turned in I reflected  It was an awesome book  This book is in my top five  It is a masterpiece of human emotion and character  I will try not to give anything away  but in Crime and Punishment Dostoevsky delves into the inner psyche of both the saint and the sinner  He looks into the thought processes of them  their emotions  their desires and creates a fascinating plot that both intrigues and disturbs the reader  In the end  you sympathize with a drunkard  you root for a murderer and you love a prostitute  Dostoevsky creates a bridge for readers to cross to better understand the base and low of humans and see that they aren t that different from the rest of us  and sometimes  they are better   Crime and Punishment is the best example I can think of for a book I have a love hate relationship with  Reading it is miserable  until the last fifty or sixty pages  when you can see the light  But every time I step back from it  or close the covers  I am simply blown away  This fantastic book is an old friend   I read it in high school for Russian Studies and my impressionable mind found it to be fascinating and beautiful   oh how I wanted to write like that  This translation  Pevear and Volokhonsky hums with a natural tension that isn t overplayed and it moved along at a steady pace that at times made it difficult to put it down  I caught myself reading well beyond midnight and looked forward to picking it up again during my next sitting  Dostoyevsky reminds me of Dickens  the overlapping of stories  characters and their various interests and knowledge  and the sparks of humor that wink and twinkle even in the most inappropriate moments is awesome   it is a book of its time and place  yet timeless as far as human nature goes    Can t you tell I loved the book   udiko psichologija prie nuudym  udymo metu ir po jo  Galiau pasakyti  kad Roskolnikovas buvo skystablauzdis  bet kaip bt jeigu bt a nenoriu suinot   While containing many characters  Raskolnikov is the key character of this novel  The reader finds this story line interesting and the way the author portrays such a damaged and deranged mind i testament to his great talent  Although reading this book is a labour of love in some places  i would recommend this book to anyone   Deu ha mort pero l home continua sense poder suportar la consciencia del mal  El magistral relat dels pensaments de n Rashkolnikov  L escena de l assassinat quan de les

blog post on Raskolnikov s bed  It dawned on me  a few pages into my freakin  fourth read of the book  that I have been haunted  I mean  haunted  by the image of his tiny  disheveled  slab cot couch in his dirty hovel of an apartment in St  Petersburg  Russia  I have this image of that bed with the twisted sheets on stained cushions imprinted on my brain  ready in a moment s notice to speak to me about passion and anguish  Smitten by Raskolnikov s murky death wish as early as sixteen  I carried it with me into my forties This  no doubt  sounds sick and wrong The haunting  The crazy  unconscious thing is that I ve written this bed  with the strewn sheets  strewn in the only word for those sheets   into my own fiction two times  I didn t even know what I was doing  First  Love Slave  In an original draft  Sybil goes home with an artist and has a one night stand  in a tiny  gross apartment somewhere near the Bowery  near the now defunct CBGB s  with Raskolnikov s bed right there  Probably on the bed The scene did not make it into the novel  I cut it  Because I just thought  You know what  I don t want Sybil to have a one night stand So  the bed disappeared Then  after that  even though the novel came out after the story collection  I wrote this story after the novel  it s a little confusing   I wrote  Glasnost   a short story  which appears in The Freak Chronicles  What do you know  There s another artist with an apartment and a bed       and this time  it s in St  Petersburg  The story still exists with the bed in it Interestingly enough  I kept adding an artist into the equation I really didn t put two and two together till just recently  I m obsessed with Raskolnikov s bed  What s up with that Before the pervs take this and run  let me retrace my readings of this novel The first time I read it was in high school  and I had to be about sixteen  Then  the book was like dope  can t believe I wrote that   I sorta remember melting over the pages  dripping over the edges of furniture  I had been turned into liquid  The humanity  the guilt  the heart hurting  I fell apart  I think I was in love with Raskolnikov  who seemed  at the time  pretty manly to me  I think my friend Laura loved Razumikhin  and I now know this is the better choice  Obviously  I was a deeply disturbed girl  Yes  this is the truth  I found amazing solace and affirmation  dear God  we re talking affirmation  in the way Dostoyevsky revealed the weight of sin  It was the weight of sin  Had anyone ever taken sin so seriously  And another thing  the guilt  I got that  At sixteen  I felt super guilty about stuff  just life and shit  Guilty girl  I guess that time I chopped up the pawnbroker with an axe really did me in The second time I read it was during college  in a Russian Humanities class  I suppose this was the most lackluster time  though  well  there is this  I ended up going to Russia for a university language program  living for a month in Leningrad  St  Petersburg   and I really did go back to some guy s apartment and he really did have one of those beds with the strewn sheets Yes  he was an artist  Of course he was an artist What do you think The third time I read it happened to be the summer my father died in a car accident  That summer  I remember reading two books  Crime and Punishment and Dave Eggers  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius  I think I just wanted to re read Dostoyevsky  it had been a little over ten years  Now  those two books are forever associated with my father s death  They re fitting  are they not  Do they not both speak about the value of life   This is  incidentally  one reason  among others  I m not really into dissing Eggers  which seems to be something many of my cohorts like to do  The fourth time was just now  I m teaching it  I didn t love it as much  though I still loved it  I guess that different things speak to readers at different times  I remember my high school teacher suggesting that Raskolnikov s resolution was insufficient  he did not adequately come to terms with his crime  I might accidentally misrepresent him  and even though he s not reading my post  I d rather not do that  In Crime and Punishment  is it fair to say that the solution to the crime is that love conquers all  Raskolnikov is  saved  from his sin by love  redeemed through Sonya s love  My high school teacher suggested that this is not a sufficient solution to the problem of evil  I kinda wanted to not pay attention to him  thinking him a bit of a literary killjoy  since he didn t even like The Catcher in the Rye  which obviously implies a character flaw  But  well  I think he s right  the love of a good woman  even a whore with a heart of gold  will not suffice in removing the blood on Raskolnikov s hands Here s what I think  though  and I m going to leave it at this  Dostoyevsky makes a noble effort in dealing with sin in a secular way  Ultimately  his secular solution to the problem of evil doesn t cut it But this book  which is a ghost that forever lurks in my life  still sings  This time  I felt the weight of other words  Remember Raskolnikov s dream in Siberia   Everyone was to perish  except for certain  very few  chosen ones  Some new trichinae had appeared  microscopic creatures that lodged themselves in men s bodies  But these creatures were spirits  endowed with reason and will  Those who received them into themselves immediately became possessed and mad  But never  never had people considered themselves so intelligent and unshakeable in the truth as did these infected ones   Ah  this was Raskolnikov  He felt free to sin  Madness  Combined with pomposity  This time around  this is what gets me  Dostoyevsky does fail to truly address why this crime is wrong  He does fail to offer anything other than this murky conception of suffering and love  He does  though  offer this  an astute vision of the faux intelligentsia I ll probably read this again  I ll no doubt stop at the foot of Raskolnikov s unkempt bed  I ll hesitate  look down  scoff  sink in  smell the sheets  want to change them  pull them over my head  and sleep  Sleep with that Russian dude  Tell him to get his life in order because we re apparently in this together   I completely immersed myself in this book and it was so well told I felt like I was the protagonist Raskolnikov  thank God I m not   I think immersion is the best way to fully appreciate this book   Increiblemente poderoso de principio a fin  Es una novela increible  con una buena descripcion escenica y  sobre todo  una gran profundidad psicologica en los personajes  sublime en el protagonista  R  Raskolnikov  El gran contenido psicologico y la narrativa  tratada con inteligencia desde el principio hasta el desenlace  mostrando sus puntos algidos en los dialogos que sostienen algunos de los personajes entre ellos  en mi opinion  hacen de esta gran novela una obra maestra  con todas sus letras   I would give it the 100 stars if I could  I read this during my senior year to prepare for a test and I could not have chosen a better book  I was a little hesitant because everyone said this was a heavy book and it is but It is so worth it  This is not about solving a murder but solving how a murderer can achieve salvation and how it troubles him  Raskonilkov is not a hero  he is not entirely a villain either  Everyone in this book is very complicated  Sonia is my favourite character in this book  She is so nice and so strong that you forget how old she is  If you re thinking about reading it  don t doubt yourself  Go ahead and read it  It will make you think about stuff you have never thought of before  The book also has a cute ending   Almost like living it   danashauli

and how their decisions had far reaching effects  I actually just read this book for the first time  I found it pretty easy to get into the rhythm of the translation   and I thought it was an amazing story that explored the darker sides of human nature  The ending was very interesting to me   A profound psychological drama it is exquisitely formulated with different reference points  murder  poverty  social structure  and beliefs   Am citit aceast roman pentru a doua oara acum la 17 ani Mai citisem cartea atunci cand aveam 13 ani si tineam minte subiectul si numele personajelor  Singura problema era ca nu am fost la fel de profund atinsa de complexitatea psihologica inalnita in fiecare roman al lui Dostoievski Da Dostoievski a fost un mare psiholog In romanele lui protagonistii se lupta cu ei insisi cu viata cu saracia cu mizeria  Iar dupa cum ii spunea Marmeladov lui Raskolnikov cand s au cunoscut in acea carciuma  Stimate domn incepu el aproape solemn saracia nu e un viciu iata un adevar indubitabil Dar nici betia nu e o virtute cu atat mai putin Insa mizeria stimate domn mizeria e un viciu In saracie omul isi mai pastreaza nobletea innascuta a sufletului im mizerie nimeni niciodata  Raskolnikov ca orice intelectual este framantat de tot felul de idei si vise irealizabile care l ar putea scoate din mizeria in care se afla de ceva timp  Renuntand pana si la facultate aceasta se prabuseste intr o vacuitate existentiala nemaipasandu i de mama si sora lui care ii poarta o dragoste inconmensurabila si care si ar da si sufletul pentru el Rodia al lor Desi mama lui incearca sa l ajute financiar asa cum poate ea mai bine Raskolnikov nu se descurca cu putinii bani ai acesteia si se gandeste la o solutie ce l ar putea salva  Acesta decide sa o ucida pe Aliona Ivanovna o batrana pe care el o considera o scorpie  un paduche  si la care isi amaneta putinele bunuri ramase  Planul lui Raskolnikov nu decurge asa cum trebuie si acesta e nevoit sa o ucida si pe sora batranei care are ghinionul de a aparea la locul crimei  Dupa varsarea sangelui celor doua femei Raskolnikov realizeaza ca el nu s a gandit de unde ar putea fura banii femeii incat se vede nevoit sa fure cateva bijuterii pe care le gaseste in urma unei cautari rapide si superficiale Fugind de la locul faptei incepe sa realizeze ce a facut iar sperietura de a nu fi prins il induce intr o stare de depresie si tulburare psihica  Un lucru care mi a placut si m a interesat a fost faptul ca Raskolnikov nu s a folosit de bunurile furate de la batrana  Sa nu fi fost oare acesta motivul crimei Asa cum i a spus Soniei el s a vazut un Napoleon care pentru a atinge succescul a fost nevoite sa zdrobeasca sufletele oamenilor  O carte exceptionala  Un roman ce ne invita sa urmarim si sa apreciem sufeltul unui tanar care dintr un intelectual zdrobit de situatia financiara si cu gandurile mereu invalmasite  savarseste o crima teribila si desi nu se caieste nici atunci cand este inchis la inchisoare Raskolnikov descopera ce inseamna dragostea credinta in Dumnezeu si isi deschide sufletul fata de ceilalti visand la ziua in care va putea lua viata de la capat  This book is a classic  but psychologically it still compels  The level of detail  and the backstory behind Dostoyevsky s writing it  are definite selling points  The play reveals so much about the author s belief system and the morality of his time  and ours   Generally  I m not a huge fan of Russian literature but this book works for me  It s not a light read  but worth the investment  I very much enjoyed this book  even though it was difficult to read at times  However  my attention never went astray  It keeps you reading late at night  wondering what will happen  It definitely keeps you from ever wanting to commit a crime  And helps you realize sometimes guilt is the worst punishment of all   fDl mstT  tjsdyh lrwy y hw tjsyd m ny lm n  wlalm lbshry  l shkhSyth lmtnw      wkdhlk tjsyd khylh k wq  Hqyqy

wkhSh hn  E difficile scrivere delle parole su Delitto e Castigo  classico per antonomasia  Su questo romanzo si sono espressi grandi critici di tutto il mondo e  certamente  non mi sento all altezza delle loro valutazioni E altrettanto difficile  pero  leggere Delitto e Castigo e tacere  Si  perche quest opera non lascia affatto indifferenti  anzi  quasi vien da dire che  terminata la lettura  si provi un senso di straniamento Continua a leggere  http   www temperamente it classici d    Human beings are always searching for going beyond boundries  Even if it costs their life  Or someone else s  getting out of one of the impossibles  You feel it by all your heart and brain  you feel the threat you feel the fear the impossible changing to the possible and you are the main actor     you feel the discovery     andall this happens by the magic of Dostoevsky and his power and knowledge of man s mind and soul   I read this pretty late  in the present middle age   having read most of Tolstoy and Chekhov in my youth  I was scared that this writer would be  difficult   on the contrary  It is a measure of his skill as a writer that reading this book was such a rewarding experience proving my theory  which I m sure is not original  that when reading a book becomes a task  it is not due to the lack of wit of the reader but rather to the clumsiness of the writer  A brilliantly written  tense  vivid  claustraphobic read about one man s psychological descent into madness and the possibility of redemption  One of the great works of literature  Few works have drawn me in totally as this one did   Truly one of my favorite books  You will never find a more introspective piece of literature  Dostoyevsky writes about one man s fall into madness as the result of a grievous crime that speaks to everyone on a universal level about their own depravity  A must read   Excellent book  I have actually read it 3 times  one of the three was a school requirement  Dostoyesvsky is masterful in the way he portrays the conditions in Russia at that time  He did an excellent job with his main character and his love interest  The metaphors are spot on and the reasoning behind the events is quite convincing   One of the best books I have ever read  some scenarios are so dark to the extend of comical and depressing at the same time  A true masterpiece in which you find yourself in many of the characters  A clear description of how a personality can not be defined on any basis  and how reactions of one to any situation cannot be predicted   Cannot describe this book  Reading it was more of a spiritual experience   I debated giving this book four stars because there were parts in which I found myself getting a bit bored with all the detail Dostoevsky included  But in the end I found it to be an epic story where the reader is really able to get into the heads of the characters  So  while there are two or three instances of  something happening  and the rest of the book deals with the people dealing with what happened  I give it five stars because the author really did prove he knows how to tell a story and bring the reader fully into it  A truly psychological novel and a work of art   To go wrong in one s own way is better then to go right in someone else s   One of my favorite books  Remember reading it over a long period of time in 2010 during my stay in Austin  TX   sitting outside in cafes and hookah bars along Guadalupe street While I don t recall many of the other characters very well after all this time  the book s protagonist has stayed with me  Roskolnikov is troubled in many ways   esp the alienation bit  where he won t seek help or support from those willing to offer and instead considers himself above the rest and is intensely proud   justifying deeds on the pretext of a higher purpose  Going through the novel was like living the life of a criminal   involving all the fears and doubts and suspicion  It was as if the reader gets convinced that leading a life like this is much tougher than any punishment the world has to offer  Sitting outdoors and taking long walks in chilly winters in Austin made me feel through a bit more of the poverty striken life in Russia that the novel portrays  One of the reasons I may not read it again is so that even the book cover reminds me of that memorable time I finished this book in a little over 2 weeks  I say that not to brag but to express how completely I was taken over by this story  The characters jump off the page  their every action and though pulses with unquestionably distinct life  I found the last 2 books  5 6  the most interesting but was a little disappointed with the epilogue  Not because it was bad  but because after the stressful build up  I often found myself reading in a near frenzy  of the first 500 pages to the final climax at the end of book six  the epilogue feels dull  If you re debating reading this book  debate no longer  Just read it and allow yourself to be carried away by twisted thoughts of murder and human worthlessness contrasted constantly with acts of undying love and glorious humanity   mn mn ftr  Twyl  wlrwy  fy qy m  lwants to read  wlSrH   ny

written  The first 50 pages were slow  boring and I can t believe I actually made it through them  but luckily a review told me to suffer through those first 50 then it gets awesome  True  so true  The rest of the book got me hooked on Russian novels   This is a book that really moved me  it is dark  cold and utterly gripping  You feel like You have planned and committed the crime  In many ways i think there are similarities with  Clockwork Orange  in how the outer changes do not force an inner change  but it all starts from within  Very strong female characters  especially Dounia  Highly believable dialog and unexpected humor weaves through the cracks of an essentially horrifying story   spoiler alert     ultimately humane and redemptive  Some say  ultimately religious  but I think that s reductionistic  The fact that it really is a spoiler to note the ultimate redemption is a tribute to d s mastery of suspense  A true page turner  Excelente obra  un gran libro  Me lo venia recomendando mi madre hace tiempo y la verdad te deja mucho que pensar  puede que no del mismo modo que otros libros  pero esta nutrido de significados y ensenanzas  Deja a uno muy expectante y con ganas de mas  pero eso ya puede ser parte de otro relato  This Book surprised me  I expected a difficult read that would be for the most part depressing  What I found was was an author that was easier to read than Dumas or even most of Dickens  that was incredibly well written and no characters that were 2 D or uninteresting  and by the end i had a had a hard time putting it down  This novel was one of the best I ve read and i will look for more written by this author   view spoiler  Bettie s Books  hide spoiler    Crime and Punishment  tells the story of Raskolnikov  a student  Raskolnikov  his mind  his ways  his thoughts  his crime  his anguish  his family  his world  his philosophy  are all capable of changing your perceptions on many things  Finally  I get a proper taste of what the world of Dostoevsky is  The abridged versions of many works of authors like him I read as a kid does no justice to the feel that classics like  Crime and Punishment  gives  nor would I have been able to comprehend the complexities of thoughts at that age  Some things are only to be read  seen  and perceived at the right time in life  Even though at first I got confused with the names of the characters  like I did for Bulgakov s Master and Margarita   now I can t forget most of those names  I want to think like Raskolnikov  be like Razumikhin  love someone like Sonya does  hope and be brave like Dunya does  destroy manipulators like Petyr Petrovich  the novel made me associate with many of their thoughts and deeds  Crime and Punishment was an emotional journey for me  I will revisit the novel after some months I guess  looking forward to reading more of Dostoevsky    I like living  I have sometimes been wildly  despairingly  acutely miserable  racked with sorrow  but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing    Agatha ChristieCrime and Punishment proved to be one of those rare breed of books that well and truly break through the outer facade and leave behind a permanent impression  even if its a dark and hideous one Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky died a 110 years ago before I was born  and yet all through the while that I was reading Crime and Punishment  it felt like he must have written this books for me and me alone  It was almost as if he could see through time you know  like a known face reaching out from an unknown  distant pass  I found Raskolnikov s actions and world view to be eerily similar to that of mine  as if I was looking through his eyes  Or if he was looking through mine eyes instead  one and the same  Now mind you  this is not necessarily how the world is  only this is how he chose to see it  Or perhaps this was the only way he was capable of seeing it  Note the difference between the two  for Dostoyevksy not once accuses Raskolnikov of a crime  He lets us  the readers  decide for ourselves about that  That  however  is right about the only slack he cuts him Everywhere else he scythes through his  protagonist   Lays bare his twisted and conceited thoughts  practically strips him naked  And that is where I found myself cringing  Raskolnikov s biggest flaws  his worst nightmares  his darkest secrets were all mine  But this wasn t it  Every time I looked up from these accursed pages  I could almost imagine Dostoyevsky sitting off across me  With a smirk on his face he would say   You really thought no one would ever know  Add to this the fact that beyond a point in this book  Nina Simone s beautiful rendition of Sinnerman would not stop playing in my head  You know you re in love with a book when mere words on a scrap of page  although Dostoyevsky s are hardly  mere words  to be honest  can spring in your head one of your favorite tunes  English is not the most evocative language in the world  am afraid that honour must go to Urdu  Yet  the force behind these  mere words  is one to reckon with  and I learnt it the most beautiful way And to top it all  Sonya  I am a sucker for simplicity and her character was delightfully attractive and fascinating  As is  I found her and Raskolnikov s a better story than most that I see around myself  real or imaginary world whichever  Should I feel too stupid to wish happiness for them  I think not  because its not too bad to have a little bit of hope at times  And that is what I realized Dostoyevsky was trying to tell us too   that there is hope and redemption for the worst of us  Raskolnikov and SonyaSo yes  living is worth the while  So said Madam Christie  so said Raskolnikov too  and Dostoyevsky  So say I  Hounded by debt and creditors  Dostoyevsky struggled with his gambling addiction for much of his life  His prison experiences  would provide a vivid backdrop for much of his work Murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose  Work in progress   Classic Russian novel  What a great book  What else can I say  The crime here is more extreme than most of us will ever face  but the punishment   the self inflicted torture and guilt   is probably just as real as any of us feel  Being of Russian heritage   I believe I have been born with a pre concieved love of Russian literature  so it s no wonder Dostoevsky s  Crime and Punishment  holds a special place in my heart To read more of my reviewhttp   christinesbookclubforwomen com    Was good  10 10 do recommend  The writing is a bit dry at times  possibly due to the translation  I read Garnett s version  having failed to find a P V version which I ve seen rave reviews of   but the story absolutely shines  Dostoevsky intertwines psychology and philosophy to tell the tale of Raskolnikov  a poor student who commits a crime  believing himself to be above the law  Each character is finely crafted to represent a certain philosophical line of thought  giving the reader plenty to ponder  Dostoevsky isn t afraid to delve into the dark recesses of the human soul  The book is compelling  meditative and suspenseful  a very engrossing read  Wow  This is an incredible literary work of art  I couldn t put it down  read all 600 pages in two sittings  completely oblivious to the rest of the world  This is definitely going on my list of all time favorites  I ve been meaning to read this book for a while but was daunted by the size and the name Dostoevsky  However from the start I enjoyed the story  The characters are well drawn and the descent into madness of Rashkolnikov is fantastic  It s made me think about reading his other books as well  I finally got around to reading this  yes  shame on my Russian major and all that  and I think I may have missed the window  in the interim I ve internalized every jot and tittle of the European Romantic novel and this is Exhibit A  so the handwringing  the plot twists  the sturm and even the drang were not all that exciting  Good thing Dostoyevski is a genius of quick images    details that only matter if you re paying attention  but if you re going through with a comb  they add up to create an image plot that doubles the characters  plot  So that s where the twistiness and the excitement of the novel is    and that s what I d recommend to those of you who ve read enough Romantic novels to choke a thin  overwrought student struggling with issues of fundamental importance and slowly going mad with the emotional exertion  La novela rusa mas comentada La habia leido hace mas de 12 anos  cuando apenas tenia 14 y estaba terminando el bachillerato y claro  no entendi nada Para mi era la historia de un tipo que cometio un crimen y se encerro en su cuarto a dejarse atormentar por la culpa  pero no es asi  hay mas  muchisimo mas  Siempre pienso que los libros son para leer y releer  siempre encontraremos una historia diferente  pues le estara hablando a la persona diferente que ahora somos Por esto  asi como las mentes pervertidas que descubren formas lujuriosas en manchas de tinta  alli donde a mis 14 solo habia visto culpa  ahora con mas anos  veo enganos y astucia  complicidades  histeria  por encima de todo veo una sociedad pacata y enfermiza  ocupada en atacar el mal como un ciego que da escobazos a las moscas  destruyendo pensamientos fragiles de conciencias profundas  defendiendo viejas costumbres de ambiciones largas como unas de arpia Un grande Dostoyevsky Raskolnikov  a hypochondriacal monomaniac  on receiving a letter from his mother  murders an old pawnbroker and what follows is an intense and a brilliantly written story of redemption  love and sacrifice  The protagonist s inner struggle and his continued attempts to convince his own conscience about the legitimacy of the murder are etched in as absorbing a manner as possible  I couldn t get rid of the book for a whole weekend and I think it wouldn t be long before I start reading it again  Must read for those who don t mind reading books which at times compel you to question some of the universally accepted moral values   I m sure many an oblivious teenager has picked up C R expecting some sort of 50 shades ripoff That title yo  unless they bothered to notice they were in the classics section and after the first chapter  would have thrown it down in childish disappointment  Well I m here at the end of this horrendously long winded book to tell you not to put it at the back of your bookshelf with the rest of the books your parents gave you  And when I say long winded  it s not really about the length of the book  but rather the amount of philosophical rambling that makes you read paragraphs twice over  Keep in mind I did finish like 4 of the GOT series  or as you nitpickers would say  ASOIAF   of which each book is longer than C R  I think      Anyway  as I ve already established  the book has its flaws  but my five star rating comes mostly from three factors 1  My overall enjoyment of the book  Great  Frustrating at times  but don t we all like being emotionally compromised by ink on a page written over 100 years ago     Ok  just me then 2  The amount of time thinking about the book after it had been finished  It s been a week  Which is a record for me  I can t even remember to take daily medication  fortunately the non lifesaving kind  3  The ability of good  ol Fyodor to make me like a psychopath  I know  I m cringing at that sentence too  Don t condemn me just yet  I will try a little psychological unraveling of Raskolnikov myself Ok so this dude is crazy  Like kill an elderly woman with an ax crazy  And no  I don t think it s ok just because she is slightly more compassionate than Scrooge  He has a god complex  death note  anyone   and he loves animals which reminds of some other famous historical figures of the genocidal kind  Starts with an H  if you didn t get that reference  Raskolnikov is like a modern day stockbroker  He has the creds to impress the average schmuck into thinking he is some kind of bigshot  but in reality he s having an existential crisis that makes him daydream about stuffing his boss through the paper shredder  Despite all this  it s the relationships he has with family and other characters throughout the book that make him likable  He s sarcastic and abrasive  but his entertaining exchanges with the cast of supporting characters lighten the mood  and ultimately have you hoping Raskolnikov will change his ways  If anything  read it for the impact it had on the literary genre of crime drama  C P is the rambling grandpa of your James Patterson novels   Dostoevsky builds a complex and amazingly fresh narrative out of a relatively simple question  can a person rationalize immoral behaviour and live with the consequences of his decisions  The protagonist  Raskolnikov  kills an old pawnbroker and her sister in support of a philosophical stance that postulates that extraordinary individuals have the right to transgress against conventional laws and morality  This idea predates Nietzsche s concept of the Ubermensch by seventeen years  The rest of the novel with its plethora of interweaving characters and subplots revolves around Raskolnikov s journey towards eventual confession  prison and ultimately his redemption  The narrative is told in the third person omnipotent which allows effectively for characters besides the protagonist to reveal their thoughts and feelings  The internal voice of Raskolnikov  which makes up the major part of the narrative  is more of an internal dialog as opposed to a monolog  The punishment of the title is not the political punishment of penal restitution for a crime committed against the state but the torturous personal aftermath of the moral sin  This is primarily manifested through Raskolnikov s internal dialog throughout the whole novel  it is how we realize his suffering   I was also surprised at the astutely observed psychological reality of the characters  their actions and reactions  Significantly  Raskolnikov himself is not a very likable character  he is arrogant  misguided  rude and even in some cases unkind  Yet  he is repeatedly redeemed in our eyes by his generosity to the poor and needy and his compassion for the daughter of the landlady and of the drunkard Marmeladov s daughter  Sonia   I really like the character of Razumikhin  His good nature  generosity and romantic leaning makes him a more sympathetic character than Raskolnikov  In a sense he starts to act as a surrogate brother and son to Raskolnikov s family eventually marrying Raskolnikov s sister  Avdotya  Dounia  Romanovna  Hardly a character escapes having flaws that make the personalities fully human and believable with the possible exception of Dounia who is as flawless morally as she is beautiful  Relatively minor characters like the doctor  Zossimov  the magistrate Porfiry Petrovich  Marmeladov and his family are all meticulously drawn  Interestingly  reference is made several times in the text to psychology but that separate field of science  is it a science   was not established until thirteen years later in 1879   Although the book grows increasingly melodramatic as it develops  culminating in the attack on Dounia by the thoroughly disagreeable Svidrigailov and his subsequent suicide  it does not pander to other conventions of the time like gross sentimentality and overt Christianity  The city of St  Petersburg is a stand alone character in the story  Dostoevsky s opening description of it as hot and dusty is a suitably uncomfortable setting for his intended crime  The contrasts between the exceeding beauty and grandeur of the city  which would have been well known to his audience  and the abject poverty of the inhabitants in his orbit is very dramatic   Dreams are used to great symbolic effect to reinforce the action  Raskolnikov s dream of the beating a horse was almost unbearably shocking  his dream of drinking cool water in the dessert  p 68  was a peaceful contrast to the shock of his next action  preparation for the kill   Of note  although the narrative is generally serious I was amused by his use of humour in scenes such as in the police station when Ilya Petrovich s remarks about authors  Dostoevsky  1866  p 99    There were only a couple of criticisms that I have I was surprised by Porfiry Petrovich s revelation about Raskolnikov s essay  until then I could not understand his rationale for the killings  On this point I was not entirely convinced   The Russian convention of using first and second names  the plethora of characters and the ins  and outs of the plot made for very close attention and having to often re read for clarity Having said this  I was especially glad to read this again after thirty years  It does not age  although I do interpret it differently now than I did back then  it remains amongst the very best books I have ever read   Probably my favorite of the classics  Reading it in high school seemed like such an accomplishment  I really enjoyed Dostoevsky s infusion of psychology and philosophy into this tale of transgression  delusion  and redemption  Best of all attempts at human drama in story form  Did you know that Woody Allen s movie  Matchpoint  is a translation of this novel  Weird to discover it in Hollywood  somehow incongruous  Dostoevsky is a master with words  storytelling  hands down  Crime et Chatiment  Crime and Punishment    Fyodor Dostoyevsky    I read it in   French   What it s about    A Russian young man living in St Petersburg  Raskolnikov  who  as soon as he s killed an old usurer  falls into insanity and madness This book is just great  I had picked it up a few years ago but couldn t get through the first pages somehow  This time  I was determined to read the entire novel  And wasn t disappointed  I won t lie  some parts were very slow  boring even  I had the feeling that the author wasn t very coherent in his writing  But then  I realized that it s probably how Raskolnikov  the main character  was in his thoughts  confused  lost  never managing to keep track of anything  Some scenes are very well written also  full of a metaphorical meaning that leads the rest of the book to its final goal  I guess I haven t really understood the different purposes of the book  the author s different thesis  and the whole meaning of the novel yet  but I definitely intend on re reading it some time later to analyse it with more hindsight   Ahh fydoor  Who can incarnate such powerful human emotions  so pure    so serene were your words   the authenticity and the appropriate manner in which u have expressed ur views often terrifies me   A pleasure   i dont think what it is if its not a pleasure     To read a long Russian novel is like falling down a rabbit hole and landing in a strange parallel world  eerily similar to ours  but with distortions and inversions  On second thought  that doesn t apply to Tolstoy  whose world  despite its distance in time and space  is recognizably ours  But it is so for Dostoevsky  Whether this something you will enjoy  or even appreciate  is not a given  It s been forty five years since I read this book  As in almost all well told tales  I identified with the protagonist  But in this case  what a trip it was  For weeks  I was Raskolnikov  Although the book didn t drive me to pick up an axe and butcher an old lady  for days on end  even after putting down the book and going about my daily chores  I felt what it was like to live with the dark knowledge of having done so  Perhaps the book is not perfect  The heroine  Sonya the virtuous prostitute  is a bit too saintly to be believed  but the book worked for me as a narrative unfolding of crime and its inexorable punishment  or  as the Russian words of the title can also be translated  guilt and expiation  Although I doubt this is a book everyone will enjoy  the combination of the impact it made on me long ago and the clear memory of that impact make it a five star for me  That s a rating I try to reserve for books that have become part of my mental furniture  Conozco poco la obra de Dovstoyevski  y es que  vamos  habla de una Rusia inexistente  Pero no es cuestion de que si me acercamiento fuera dificil o no  pues mis antecedentes como  El jugador  y  Las noches blancas  se me hicieron tranquilos  pero este libro fue uno peso pesado  por que  pues porque necesita sus antecedentes historicos y filosoficos  Aunque hable de la miseria de la epoca  la cuestion es concentrarse en la historia de Raskalnikov  un joven universitario que dejo de serlo para ver que otra cosa podia ser  Sus acciones lo llevan a asesinar a una vieja avara  y no digo eso como algo peyorativo  si no que realmente la personaje se hace odiar cuando casi sentimos el hambre y la desesperacion de Raskolnikov   Al ser larga la historia  tambien lo es la percepcion de los hechos  y uno se pierde entre largas cartas y entre visitas a la comisaria  mas los hechos que ocurren alrededor  Se entiende que muchos se alejen del libro porque como dice el titulo de un articulo  Libros que te has perdido porque tus maestros los han arruinado   pero la verdad en el caso de esta novela es pesada  Y yo misma me pregunte por que no tenia la ligereza de las otras obras que lei  hasta que comprendi que efectivamente fue escrita con largo aliento  Pero pese a esto  pensando en que habia tropezado muchas veces  llegue al final  cuando ya pasa por la prision siberiana y en donde Raskolnikov debe inmolarse  y lo logra  Por lo que es casi la historia de una vida  Me llama la atencion que dicen que es novela de carater psicologico  y creo que esta forma de decirlo es como una cosa mas para complicarla  por que no puede caer en historia policiaca con una ficcion biografica  pues porque en la epoca de Dostoyevsky no habia una definicion tan clara como hoy  Lo que si lamento es no haberlo leido antes  Merecera mas lecturas  pues a pesar de que en la emocion estetica me gusto mucho  siento que me falto imaginacion pues a veces no me quedaban claros los paisajes y las descripciones  pero esto ya es una limitacion de una humilde lectora que le falta conocer mas sobre paisajes y frios invernales descritos  De ahi en fuera  altamente recomendable     I did not bow down to you  I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity   Russian literature is often a challenge  but one that is generally rewarded if the reader is brave enough to dive into the worlds of such literary greats as Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky  This classic Russian novel  considered one of the masterpieces and cornerstones of world literature  is a tale of misery  poverty and murder  with little or no humour but ample pathos and melodrama  Wonderful book  Amazing descriptions of a St Petersburg from another time which can still be found there today and a story with a challenging moral question at its heart  A great book in understanding how human emotions and guilt from committing a murder eventually unravel the protagonist s mind  Dostoyevsky is brilliant in capturing the emotions behind such a horrible crime  Still my favorite book of all time  Finding a good translation is a must  Either McDuff or Pevear  a new husband wife translation team  Don t bother reading Constance Garnett  she sapped the life out of all the Russian lit she translated  Raskolnikov  the radical law student  remains a compelling character on the verge of nervous breakdown  You can feel his highs and lows  his exhilaration and his paranoid madness  This is a thrill ride after the first 200 pages  St Petersburg in the 1850s has all the sad  beaten down and sleazy characters that could have seen in 1970s nyc  Still relevant today  What happens when everything is permitted and there is no God      Raskolnikov barakadan cikip dogruca kiyiya indi  burada istif edilmis kutuklerin ustune oturdu  genis ve issiz irmagi seyre daldi  Bu yuksek kiyidan  goz alabildigine uzanan bozkir goruluyordu  Irmagin karsi kiyisindan belli belirsiz bir sarki duyuluyordu  Orada  gunesle yikanan ucsuz bucaksiz bozkirda  kucuk kara noktalar halinde gocebe cadirlari seciliyordu     Bir dus dunyasiyla kendi ic dunyasi arasinda gidip geliyordu  Hicbir sey dusundugu yoktu  Ama bir sikintinin heyecanini  acisini duyuyordu icinde     this was one of the earliest  advanced  books i read  i remember picking it up mid teens  and doing so a few times until i got into it  i lost a copy on a far east flight during my first re read  and only got around to getting my third copy and finally re reading it a few years ago  the feeling of redemption and hope in this wonderful book has helped me in countless situations  as i get older  i realise that you can think your way out of a lot of problems  i did not know this as a teenager  but the book helped me to get my head round a lot of stuff  recommended to all  They say this is the first real crime novel ever written  and still it is probably the best  This illustrates the genious of the author  What an insight in psychology this man had   Would love to read it again  There s so much to say about this book  First  the main character is the typical anti hero   what s to like  But that makes the book funny as he does things that you can t believe  There s also such tension in certain places  The scene where he just committed the crime and he narrowly escapes  Or when he s being questioned by the lawyer  Or his confrontations   When modern writers say they want to get in the heads of the criminal  they should read this first  Very enjoyable   even as a classic  this is an easy read   with comic relief The only knock I d have is this  1   the characters are verbose  At times this makes for an interesting read as I can imagine these long winded characters  The main one has long winded thoughts  but is often brief when he speaks  I don t mean this as a knock  but he might be Christian  The end lead me to belief this   the hero or anti hero almost has Christ like moments   There are certain books which come into our lives at the right time  I am lucky that hitherto there have been two of them  The first is The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13 3 4 and the second is the classic  Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  Crime and Punishment is the first of its kind I have read till now and opens door for a whole new genre in my modest reading career The most symbolic message in the novel is poverty  I am extremely lucky that I can eat food three times a day and also extremely lucky that I have realized this fact early in my life all thanks to Mr  Dostoyevsky  My attraction for this book is justified by the fact that the protagonist  Raskolinkov and I share same ideals  questions  moral dilemmas and egoistic personality  The  killing for greater good  conundrum is beautifully illustrated  The book is full of powerful and enigmatic characters  My favorite is Sonia  Her devotion towards her family  love and understanding for a killer is meritorious  She didn t take the easy way out like Svidrigailov nor did she blame her problems as fault of other people like Raskoinkov did  Instead of fixing the world  she tried to fix herself and lived for others sake  Rakolinkov terms her behavior as religious mania  we can rationalize almost everything but the capital T truth is we all need some moral code to believe in otherwise we go crazy  Rodion being the prime example The cat and mouse chase between Rodion and Porfiry Petrovich is nothing short of spectacular  It is a battle of wits and philosophies and reminds me of the extraordinary anime Death Note  I particularly liked the ending of the book because it gives the readers closure  Crime and punishment is a splendid tale of tragedy  friendship  poverty  love  mystery and cure  This is a great book  in every meaning of the word  I m not sure who I m more taken with  Raskolnikov or Razumikhin   Without a doubt the most depressing beginning to any store ever  The whole bit about the  lipstick being expensive  thing is pure evil depressing genius  What kind of a mind comes up with a story like this  The long slow  ok not that slow  decent in to madness and despair  Yet  we never quite reach hopelessness  Maybe I would have  but the story marches on past that  to a point where redemption  not the clean slate kind of prodigal son type of redemption  but a dirty gritty  I can carry on  and maybe yet again I will smile and find joy some day  kind of redemption  Oh  yeah and the bit about how it s the first psychological thriller  I also figured out at some point that I could no longer trust the protagonist    to be giving the straight dope  That s a neat trick for an author to pull off  nZr  khr  lljrym    nZr  Grq  fy lnsny   I read this book  long described by acquaintances as a  typically  difficult Russian tramp through dark  heavy  and frozen mud  while working as an attendant at a parking ramp  It was amusing to have people drive out and ask me what book I was laughing at so readily  and to see their faces when I told them what it was  Just like that other writer who emerged out of Dickens  Kafka  Dostoevsky does not fail to learn the lessons of Dickens  gothic humor  as well as his social criticism and class horrors  The fact is  this novel is black humor at its finest  and it is no surprise that that humorous TV detective show  Columbo  should have emerged from the central relationship in this novel  between the  Napoleon of crime  and the relentless but witty   even sardonically understanding   police detective  A man who fancied himself as a new generation criminal  able to commit a random murder without feeling or intent  is reduced to lying on his shabby bed and staring into a hole in the wall  I found each page more hilarious and excruciating than the one before it  and the internal fretting and building dread of the murderer is a fascinating study in the fallacy of modernity  of alienation from morality  and a satire on the utopian ideals Dostoevsky had once embraced but now found lacking  This   as humorous literature goes   is not the big hearted adventurism of the Pickwick Club  or the stuff of an evening s relaxation  but it IS funny  even as it cuts   This book is amazing  Dostoevsky offers a profound insight into the human psyche with a chilling story of the ravaging effects of guilt and deceit  One of the books I would like to read again someday  This was the book that really got me into reading  It will always mean a lot to me  Probably  one of my all time favorite books  if not my favorite  I m looking forward to reading The Brothers Karamazov and his other works Una novela 5 estrellas desde cualquier punto donde se le mire  Un clasico entre clasicos  una novela completa y que abarca todos los espectros o la mayor de las mayores partes de la complejidad humana  Sin duda un reostato que Dostoievski mueve a su antojo y nos deja en una larga novela para continuar debatiendo y analizando todavia por mucho mas tiempo sus teorias increibles y que todavia causan interes por su complejidad y atemporalidad  Una de las curiosidades es que el mismo Fiodor nos habla de vez en cuando  directamente  a lo largo de la novela y en la linea final  con una sutileza formidable  Finally doing Dostoyevsky  a few streets away from where he wrote his biggest works  Wild  Crime and Punishment wasn t fun reading  especially in the span of just over a week  Dostoyevsky s an unpleasant stylist in an oppressive setting  Every nobody in his neighborhood can spin a great story  but this means trudging for the reader  I d call the plot  anxious  rather than  suspenseful   for the most part  The book gets five stars because despite all the sweat and dust  it was the most religious read I ve ever had  Meaning it s structure  characters  and philosophical interrogations seemed to immerse me in a vaguely Christian experience I hadn t touched before  On a more pragmatic level  C P suggests a psychological encyclopedia  You can talk about it forever  Compressing the setting  cast and timeframe makes more room for invisible content  So it s an inherently profound project  I can t say I m sad to take a break now with the Symbolists  though  Glad to see colors other than dead yellow   wwwwwf Intrigerend boek met een bijna filosofische benadering op het plegen van een misdaad  Extreem wat betref gebeurtenissen  karakters en filosofische denkwijzen zonder dat het de grens van bullshit overschrijdt  Daardoor een erg boeiend boek naar mijn mening die boeit tot de laatste pagina  Ik heb ook erg genoten van de mind games  dubbele agenda s van de karakters en de scherpe dialogen  Echt een ware klassieker die de tand des tijds goed heeft doorstaan    No words can express my love for this book    well  maybe these can  I completely adore any kind of unlikely protagonist and this case was no different  Raskolnikov utterly won me over from his very first insane ramble of a monologue  Descriptions were terribly vivid and emotions were heightened to the point where I could experience them myself   Though I did read the David McDuff translation of the novel I trust that any of these authors did justice to the original  but since McDuff s was the first I read it will always be held closest to my heart  Dostoevsky is  without argument  an incredible author and I have no doubt that this book will remain among my favorites for the rest of my life  A fantastic book  an intellectual and thought provoking account of the repercussions of the crime a man commits  This took me a while to finish  but I m so glad I did  A heavier read than something like  Anna Karenina   Dostoyevsky is my favorite writer of all time and this Crime and Punishment is one of my most favorite books from the ones he has ever written  Fyodor is really an amazing writer  my other favorite books of him are  The Idiot  also  The Brothers Karamazov   I d recommend you really so much to read this book because it s really amazing  A brilliant novel that swims deep into the feelings and emotions of a killer  exploring the human nature that sometimes drives us to pursue things that we didn t know we are capable of  anyways this an amazing novel that takes on psychological thriller   yS b  n tfhm kyf y khdhk dwstwyfsky fy hkdh rHl  wnt l tfhm m ldhy yHSl m k   sHr bkl m n  lklm    fy nHw  lf SfH  tsh r wk nk t

Raskolnikov as a protagonist  For some reason  Russians are very existentialist in character  who believe that God does not exist  therefore do you whatever you want  but then they consciences that torment them  and then in the end  they always come to the salvation and repentence  I like the inner confusion and frustration of the character as a college student trying to survive  but then kills two people trying to rob a pawn shop  Humorous and an excellent read  This was such a great book  As my first classic book  I didn t know what to expect  But Dostoyevsky made me appreciate how great books of that time period were  I have to admit that some parts were a little slow  but I lived for the parts that revealed a great thought  often scary  but great   The ending made it all worth it   everything was connected  I love this book  and I ll read it again for sure   Napoleao matou milhoes e e um heroi   para os franceses   O estudante Rodion Raskolnikov matou duas pessoas e e um assassino  Qual a diferenca  Napoleao conseguiu cumprir o seu sonho de conquistador e imperador  Rodion  acreditando na sua superioridade em relacao ao grosso da populacao  encarou o crime cometido como uma alavancagem necessaria e justificavel para cumprir o seu destino  No entanto  depois percebeu que nao era grandioso  mas antes o oposto     This book resonates with humanity like no other I have yet read   What is it about those Russkies that we find so captivating  Russian authors are so different than everyone else  The intellectual class has always been drawn to philosophical ideas  As young university students they want to try out these ideas  So here we have Raskolnikov  a penniless St  Petersburg university student  who wonders if he has what it takes to commit a murder  Most people have not thought about committing a murder but our hero is completely consumed with this idea  He thinks that with this one act and the money he can gain that he will then be able to make his way in the world  He has a rather high opinion of himself and believes that the good that comes from this one act will exceed the evil of it    the end justifies the means I read this book in high school and was totally drawn into it  Reading it some 50 years later was just as absorbing plus I understood it a bit better the second time around  Dostoevsky is a master at understanding human psychology  He takes us into Raskolnikov s mind    the mind of a man who kills for an idea  All the above takes place early in the book and we then follow him through various stages I  like many others  question the end of the book  Is it likely that such a person would make such a complete turnaround  I think not  But here is where religion gets in the way for Dostoevsky as it does for Tolstoy    their belief in redemption  But this is minor stuff that we can forgive and forget Dostoevsky penetrates human psychology better than anyone I can think of I highly recommend the Norton Critical Edition which contains 150 pages of commentary including some of Dostoevsky s own notes and critiques by Russians of the same time period   Inogda ia dumaiu  chto khorosho imet  pamiat   kak

Raskolnikov s skewed world and makes it too  too real  as Raskolnikov works out his man beyond morality theory in other s blood  A brilliant work that disproves Raskolnikov s theory and allows him to reclaim himself  reluctantly  supported by Sonya  lys mn lysyr  bdan  n tsbr  Gwr lnfs lnsny  wtbHr fy  Hwlh wHlth wn stT t dhlk Gdwt fylswfantywdwr dwstywfsky lm ysbr  Gwr lnfs lnsny  fHsb wnm sbr

great pieces  If I had to rate the four of them  right now  it would be as follows  Brothers Karamazov  Crime and Punishment  Demons  Idiot  Well  maybe  Brothers Karamazov  Idiot  Crime and Punishment  Demons  Or  Brothers Karamazov  Idiot  Demons  Crime and Punishment  Yes  probably the last list I fit with best    I see you are a gentleman  so let me be perfectly clear  I can be quite ridiculous  quite ridiculous  I assure you  this is all a great joke  You might expect an exploration of  say  Crime  and  say  Punishment  that would be reasonable  I can tell you are an educated man  and you just told me how clever you are   He grinned widely and leaned in close  I had said nothing about cleverness  My mind was a whirl  and the chipper voice continued   So let me tell you how ridiculous I am  Somtimes  ha ha  characters will rant on for page upon page with nary a paragraph break in sight  But it is so easy to follow  for a witty reader like you  Clearly you already know how to read this type of thing    it s very typical    you ve seen it many times before  Just imagine if it was unique  Why  you would have to become an entirely new sort of reader    one who could follow a character s words and actions deep into the murkiest part of their subconscious    one who could adhere to long chapters of loaded  ironic dialogue    one who knows what a patronymic is    But this is silly  Look how ridiculous I am  saying these things  You are already this type of reader   But I was not  I had to become a different kind of reader to approach this book  and for that I am grateful to it PS  My favorite character was Porfiry  After reading this book for the second time  I can see why so many people dislike it   I still think it s such a great book  XD Probably because I m a sap for half the things that are in there What I didn t like was how some of the characters totally overreacted to things  I was also annoyed with Sonya because she was so    I don t want to say weak because it takes strength to do all the things she did  but she cried too much and that sort of thing  I was also disappointed that Razumikhin disappears halfway through the novel  He was my favorite character  but of course  he disappears  Once Sonya showed up  Razumikhin was pushed into the background  T T I also realized how much of a jerk Raskolnikov is  especially in that one scene with Sonya  I still like him  though  He s probably my second favorite character I think that even though a lot of the characters  actions were unrealistic  their thought processes were realistic  at least for people in their positions  In any case  whether realistic or not  I like the way Dostoevsky writes his characters  I guess insane people is just his style         I like it  XDI thought this novel was pretty intense  funny  and deep  as it touches upon many of the issues that Dostoevsky explores throughout his works Certainly The Brothers Karamazov is a lot more intense and philosophical  but I don t think people give this book enough credit  I m still rating it five stars  As with Dickens  Tale of Two Cities   this book really seemed to drag at first  but the last half really draw me in and the book left me full of emotion  with tears forming in my eyes   Clearly  the work of a genius  I mean       come on  It wasn t a  quick  read for me and i m okay with that  It s my first time reading it  but surely not the last  From the few books of Fedya  has become one of my favorite authors  Hats of  hands down It did so much that I can t help but look at some of the things that make it fuckin  difficult personally for me  the names of some of the characters   those fucking russian last names  bloody hell  Don t take it the wrong way   I love everything about russians  And i think it has a lot to do with me being bad at remembering names  in real life as well   Don t throw so many names at me at once   thank you and good night  A very slow read  it took a while for the book to get going  but sometimes this is necessary for characters to develop and form a great story  and this is exactly what crime and punishment is  It explores whether suffering legitimises the act of sin and whether its possible its possible to seek redemption through suffering  The ending was satisfying for me and I loved the book  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED   Crime and Punishment is an interesting look into the psyche of a killer  I have read it a couple of times and it is a very haunting book  Dostoevsky really takes me to those dark streets in Russia and the images he creates are still vivid in my imagination  the only novel i can perhaps use the cliche d phrase  changed my life  in reference to  d is a fucked up guy with a crazy messianic view of russia and faith in general  but he is an unparalleled artist in craft and in suffering and the kind of writer i m afraid that the modern world can no longer produce  By Fyodor Dostoyevsky  Grade  A If there is any author that can be spoken in the same breath with Shakespeare  Goethe  Dante then it has to be the name of Fyodor Dostoyevsky  one of the finest authors Russia has produced  right in the ranks of Leo Tolstoy  if not higher  However  like most Russian authors  Fyodor s characters are outlandish  over the top  proud  egoistic and at the same time perverted  However  this perversion  is meant in an intellectual sense  more like a corruption of thought Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a master of psyche  and every line uttered in his novel reverberates and changes the entire psyche of the character  Crime and Punishment was originally published in parts in a magazine  it was later compiled and published as a novel  The period from 1866 1881 saw the creation of Dostoevsky s greatest works  Crime and Punishment  1866  The Idiot  1868  The Possessed  1872  The Brothers Karamazov  1880   Though a very engaging novel  truth be told  it pales in comparison to The Brothers Karamzov  a study of human psyche  and the master s magnus opus  His prison experiences  as well as his life after prison among the urban poor of Russia  would provide a vivid backdrop for much of his later work  Released from his imprisonment and service by 1858  he began a fourteen year period of furious writing  in which he published many significant texts  Among these are  The House of the Dead  1862   Notes From The Underground  1864   Crime and Punishment  1866   The Idiot  1868   and Devils  1871   It feels strange to review this great author  as I may more than must have failed to understand the meanings of his words and the layers he adds in the novel  Life is in ourselves and not in the external   writes Fyodor Dostoevsky in a letter to his brother dated December 22  1849  To be a human being among human beings  and remain one forever  no matter what misfortunes befall  not to become depressed  and not to falter this is what life is  herein lies its task    The Brothers Karamazov First I must begin with describing some key features of this novel  the dialogues are long  by long I mean they run into pages  so it is really difficult to catch and cling to the train of thought  then the thoughts interloping the conversations are sometimes confusing  but the real difficulty is in understanding Russian names So here is how you go about the last problem  which is the only problem that cannot be solved via avid reading  the Russian convention is to refer to someone by their first name and a middle name based on their father s first name  You take the father s first name and if you re male  you add  vich and if you re female  you add  ovna  Razumihin  bear with me on the spelling   it changes from book to book because of the Cyrillic alphabet translations  has the first name Dmitri and his father s name was Prokofiev  thus he s  Dmitri Prokovich  in polite company Rodion and Eudoxia s father was called Roman  their mother s father was called Alexander  Peter Luzhin s  Looshin  father was also called Peter  so he s Peter Petrovich in polite company  As for the sister s names  her real name is  Eudoxia Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov   Dounia Dunya is a nickname for  Avdotya Eudoxia   and  Dounetchka  is another one  In Russian  anything that ends with  ya or  ka is a diminutive  For example  vodka  means  little water   So the family calls the sister Dunya and the main character Rodya at home  Source for most of the information above is from Yahoo answers  Keeping this in mind we are raring to go Give me a moment to recollect myself and explain to you in the sanest way possible  about what the book is really about  The book is many things  it is about thought  crime  suffering  Christianity  perversion  love  hate  madness  solitude  and an inexplicable dread that resides in our hearts  the dread that we too  after all may not be as special as we assume ourselves to be  The protagonist  Raskolnikov is a depressed university dropout who lives in his gloomy little room  in St  Petersburg  Russia  and rarely does anything else but think  and sleep  he sometimes goes on days without eating  in his solitude  strange ideas come in his mind allied with childhood fears and dreams  and in this deranged state  Raskolnikov decides to test his boundaries  Then what follows is a detailed psychological study of crime  its consequences and the suffering one endures to compensate for it  The story explains all this and much more with the help of a plethora of characters  such as his sister Dounia  friend  Razumihim and other unpronouncable character  The crux is the internal struggle the character faces and his need for redemption and feeling at peace again Another thing the author takes note of  is how physical appearances are usually terribly deceptive  the best people in the book turn out to be the ones that we find physically repelling  The book also studies why people do what they do  when they know what is the right thing to do  There are varius scenes and depictions of morbid violence and such tension that it may leave you feeling mentally deranged as these scenes are so powerfully depicted  Also important are the metaphors and the symbology used in the book  You may never get it  I might be hardly getting it completely  but respect this 527 page critique on human nature Originally reviewed at  www the vault co cc I was amazing  but sometimes is hard to read  Brilliant  It is masterpiece  Wow  Dostoyevsky always takes me a while and I ve been plugging away at this one for a good while  I never read the Constance Garnett translation  it s been on my shelves for almost 40 years  so I can t offer a comparison  There is an immediacy and humanity in this book that is hard to explain  As I read Raskolnikov became more and more real and I actually started liking the rascal  I ve always considered D the greatest of novelists ever since I read Brothers in my twenties  But this is now my favorite of his novels Despite the depth of the philosophical underpinnings of the character development  the plot was endlessly inventive and unpredictable  The first half is more difficult as much of the action is internalized  But once the central murder occurs the plot starts moving rapidly  for Dostoyevsky anyway   The best book I ve ever read    Thank you Marco Vicente    The best novel I have ever read  It s almost perfect   I finished reading this book a month before or maybe more  but I couldn t marke it as  read  I never wanted to  We had to write a paper this term about the approaches of criticism  I chose a psychoanalytic criticism of crime and punishment  it was the best assignment ever  This audiobook version is tremendously great  I can almost taste anxiety there  in Raskolnikov s realm  I felt like I was there  hovering in the top corner of his room  keeping silent so no one can feel my presence  Yeah I know I m weirdo  Just a stunning novel  piece of art  Thank you Dostoevsky  you suffered a lot  you wrote this masterpiece under a great pressure and it s one of the finest books I might ever read  Thank you  Tragica e emocional  Crime e Castigo e uma obra excecional em varios aspetos  como seja a profundidade psicologica do enredo  a ponderacao critica do mesmo e a complexidade individual das personagens intervenientes  Neste livro  Dostoievski deixa nos um extraordinario e profundo estudo da natureza humana  aliado a ponderacoes filosoficas  religiosas e politicas  O crime e cometido quando o protagonista  Roskolnikov  assassina uma velha penhorista com o objetivo de lhe roubar dinheiro pertences e tambem a irma desta  que acaba por testemunhar involuntariamente o homicidio  O castigo surge logo depois sob a forma de culpa  remorso e medo Psicologicamente torturado  Roskolnikov passa a viver num turbilhao de emocoes  alternando entre euforia e panico  alegria e depressao  amargura e alivio   drama que Dostoievski descreve de modo extraordinario  A passo com o desassossego emocional  acompanhamos de perto as motivacoes de Roskolnikov  a sua atitude niilista e aparente confusao moral  Apesar de o jovem estudante viver na pobreza  este nao foi o unico fundamento para o maleficio cometido  Roskolnikov divide as pessoas em dois grupos  as ordinarias e as extraordinarias  Colocando se a si proprio no ultimo grupo  Roskolnikov ve se acima das regras da sociedade  intelectualmente superior e capaz de feitos importantes   nao necessariamente eticos   sem sofrer por eles danos ou remorsos  Alem de tudo isto  nao considera o homicidio um ato condenavel se a vitima nao for um membro  util  da sociedade  pelo contrario  encara a morte da agiota como um acontecimento benigno Roskolnikov ira   a medida que mente e corpo se corrompem em irracionalidades   que nao esta realmente no grupo dos extraordinarios e a redencao chegara atraves do seu amor por Sonia  personagem de verdadeira devocao familiar e religiosa  cujo sacrificio  e  crime   tem como objetivo beneficiar os outros e nunca a propria    dstywskhy z nwysndgn m dwdy st khh y bsyr mHbwb y mnfwr khwnndgn khwysh st  shdt fkhr w  ml w Hsst w b khwy hmgn szgr

Sinto que foi o melhor livro que li esse ano  Simplesmente incrivel  Ainda estou sem palavras para definir o sentimento que me dominou e me domina ainda agora  apos o termino da leitura  Toda o enredo e fantastico  todos os personagens perfeitamente construidos  O desenvolvimento da trama apos o assassinato da velha usuraria e sua irma Lizavieta cometido por Raskolnikov e incrivel demais  toda a construcao psicologica dele  assim como os estados de delirios e febres  sao tao freneticos que eu passava quatro horas lendo sem perceber  Incrivel como acabei ate assimilando o estado de espirito do personagem  descrito com tanta perfeicao e de uma realidade assustadora  Nao so Rodia  mas todos os personagens foram cruciais na trama  desde Svidrigailov  Razumikhin  Sonia  Dunia  Porfiri  ate Catierina Ivanovna Alem disso  a teoria dele de que os homens sao divididos em duas categorias  ordinarios x extraordinarios  e de que  aos extraordinarios foi dado a licenca moral para cometer crimes em prol de um objetivo  foi tratada  claro que de forma diferente  mas em essencia muito parecido  pelo ultimo livro que li de Tolstoi   ressurreicao    de que a alguns individuos e permitido cometer certos atos crimes e sair impune perante a sociedade  exemplo disso sao os enormes assassinatos cometidos atraves das guerras  mas que ninguem liga  ou fica pasmo  porque ja foi aceito socialmente desde tempo remotos Enfim  o final de  Crime e Castigo  e lindo e justo     o amor os ressuscitara  o coracao de um continha fontes infinitas de vida para o coracao do outro  Concluo que Dostoievski e um genio  E me pergunto  o que tinha na agua desses russos  Rs It is one of the greatest books I have ever read and can read it over and over again  Dostoyevsky is sheer genius and brings to life a

morality and inner anguish  A must read for people that enjoy reading about or discussing societal issues   Terceira leitura que faco do livro  a primeira nao conta pois era muito nova e estava numa fase de livros sangrentos  Imaginei  pelo titulo que ele seria assim  Resolvi reler por ser traducao direta do russo e nao consigo dar menos que 5 estrelas para esse livro por ser um dos preferidos de meus pais  A gente sempre acaba se influenciando por ele  nao e  Nao existe autor melhor para criar personagens perturbados e nesse quesito Raskolnikov talvez seja o mais  Nao e um personagem pelo qual tenha empatia mas e impressionante como Dosto nos faz penetrar na sua mente conturbada e doente e nos faz sentir asfixia naquele ambiente claustrofobico em que ele vive   Nem sempre a prisao e o maior castigo  Inesquecivel e o embate de Rodia com seu perseguidor Piotr  uma verdadeira guerra de nervos  um jogo da gato e rato psicologico  No fim das contas  trata se de uma historia de amor e fe

inteligencia  Oh  como eu odiava aquele cubiculo  Mas ainda assim nao queria sair dele  Passava dias e noites sem sair  nao queria trabalhar e nem comer  vivia so deitado     O toco de vela ha muito se extinguia no castical torto  iluminando frouxamente naquele quarto miseravel um assassino e uma devassa  que se haviam unido estranhamente durante a leitura do livro eterno    Eu nao matei uma pessoa  eu matei um principio    O sofrimento e a dor sao sempre obrigatorios para uma consciencia ampla e um coracao profundo  Os homens verdadeiramente grandes devem experimentar uma grande tristeza no mundo   No artigo dele  todos os individuos se dividiriam em  ordinarios  e  extraordinarios   Os ordinarios devem viver na obediencia e nao tem o direito de infringir a lei porque eles  vejam so  sao ordinarios  Ja os extraordinarios tem o direito de cometer toda sorte de crimes e infringir a lei de todas as maneiras precisamente porque sao extraordinarios   Porfiri citando o artigo de Raskolnikof escrito 2 meses antes do crime    Eu conheco Rodion ha um ano e meio  carrancudo  sombrio  soberbo e altivo  ultimamente anda cismado e hipocondriaco  E magnanimo e bom  Nao gosta de externar seus sentimentos e antes prefere uma crueldade a fazer falar o coracao  Nunca tem tempo para nada  tudo o atrapalha  mas vive deitado sem fazer nada  Nao faz galhofa  e nao porque lhe falte graca  mas e como se nao lhe restasse tempo para semelhantes futilidades  Nao ouve ate o fim o que os outros falam  Nunca se interessa pelo que todos os outros estao interessados em dado momento  Tem um conceito terrivelmente alto de si mesmo e  parece  nao deixa de ter certo direito a isso   Ao cair da tarde de um inicio de julho  calor extremo  um jovem deixou o cubiculo que subalugava de inquilinos na travessa S   ganhou a rua e  ar meio indeciso  caminhou a passos lentos em direcao a ponte K    This book seriously made me consider learning Russian when I was a teen  just so that I could read it in its original language  It affected me profoundly and every time I re read it  I learn something knew  It s an extraordinary novel and whilst I would never describe it as an easy read  it is one of those books that is really hard to put down once begun  This was Great  The first half was hard going    the protagonist is Such a sulky  and  of course  murderous  brat  But in the second half there were some really Wonderful characters  and even wretched Raskolnikov became more sympathetic  Definitely a book to reread  Raskolnikov ar en fore detta juriststudent i St  Petersburg med en syn pa livet att det finns tva sorts manniskor  en sort som maste lyda de moraliska lagarna medan den andra star over dem  I en artikel beskriver han hur denna sorts manniskor nastan har en ursakt att bega brott eftersom de endast borstar av sig efterat och gar vidare  Raskolnikov ar ocksa i behov av pengar  for att fortsatta sin juristutbildning men ocksa for att betala det sunkiga lilla rum han hyr  Efter ett besok hos en lokal pantlanerska far han en ide  Hur skulle det vara om han tillhorde den andra sortens manniskor  De oatkomliga  Skulle det inte da vara en sorts tjanst fran honom till samhallet att morda pantlanerskan Aljona Ivanova och darmed aven fa tag pa de pengar som han behover  Efter att ha upplevt att han fatt hintar och bevis for att odet vill att hans ide ska bli verklighet  ger han sig ivag for att morda Ivanova i hennes lagenhet  Men han inser snart att han inte tillhor den hogre klassen av manniskor trots allt   nagot som leder in honom i ett febrig vansinne  Dostojevskijs bocker brukar ofta vara pa listor som  100 bocker du maste lasa innan du dor  men har aven beskrivs som en sadan dar klassiker som fa faktiskt orkar lasa  Brott och straff ligger pa nagon sorts underbar plats mellan de tva  I borjan fann jag spraket ratt trist och byrakratisk men med tanke pa flertalet hundra sidor i boken sa hann jag aven fatta tycke for det  Det ar sa dar lagom dramatiskt och lojligt  Men Dostojevskij ar aven en hejare pa att beskriva manniskor och deras psyken  Mojligtvis ar hans karaktarer lite for teatraliska for min smak men de ar trots det komplexa och intressanta att studera   vilket ar perfekt for en bok som detta  Jag har last lite recensioner och dylikt sedan jag blev klar for att forsoka fa en sa bred uppfattning av boken som mojligt  och i en av recensionerna resonerade skribenten att brottet ar Raskolnikovs livssyn och straffet ar sjalva brottet han begick  Det ar en bra beskrivning av denna bok som sammanfattar en intressant bok som utforskar det manskliga psyket  Trots att det ibland kandes segt att lasa boken sa ar den vard sin status som en klassiker   men aven en bok jag skulle rekommendera att satta pa sin  100 bocker jag maste lasa innan jag dor  lista pa grund av studeringen av Raskolnikovs psyke fore  medan och efter mordet   Odna iz redkikh knig shkol noi programmy  kotoruiu ia schitaiu interesnoi  This is the ultimate psychological thriller of a criminal  It is highly satirical and clever  a trademark of Russian literature  similar to authors such as Tolstoy and Bulgakov  but I found it held my interest more consistently wire to wire  with better character development and less filler storylines Raskolnikoff is an intensely tormented character and it was wonderfully entertaining following his deranged thoughts and twisted actions Highly recommended book  had me on the edge of my seat for much of the time  Presents a unique philosophical theory on crime that I had casually pondered before only in my head  I don t want to go into a lot of detail right now so I ll just say that I m glad my teacher gave me a copy to read  It s pretty difficult to get into but it s definitely worth it  I was going to say  unless you re one of those assholes who won t read a book if it has words in it  but I guess those people aren t going to be reading this   At the time of reading this book  I didn t realize its significance and far reaching themes connections  Everything seems to connect back to Raskolnikov and his motive behind the crime  Teaching Macbeth and listening to the news and watching Gladiator further point to the same themes threaded within Crime and Punishment  and I will never be able to see criminals or crime in the same light after reading this book  I read this and instantly loved the darkness yet the inescapable realness of the situations and the characters  Page turner  I couldn t help but feel involved in the dilemmas and emotions of the characters  I can t wait to read it again  Seriously  if you have not read this because you feel it is too  high school English   too long  or too serious  you should definitely re consider  this is such a powerful book that will stay with you forever  This book was unbelievable  It starts a little slow  but picks up after the first fifty pages  Dostoyevsky is brilliant and funny  It was 542 pages long and I didn t want it to end His argument of the dangers of following ideology over one s heart and faith is timeless   In place of dialectics life had arrived THAT was an emotional workout I imagine there are many interpretations about Crime and Punishment  there is a lot here and you could probably argue many different ways what any single point might  mean  much less the book itself  But more simply  I have to say  I LOVED it  The imagery  the plot  the character development  the tone  the   whatever  How could this Russian dude from the 19th century know what kind of story I would find fascinating  But  even with that I could easily see someone lamenting some pretty improbable plot developments  and sometimes the coincidences are a little too glaring  But it just doesn t bother me     Although his habit of using Jewishness as an attribute of despicable people sure did break the magic spell  And I guess being German also means that person is inherently bad  Interesting how he can be obsessed with his individual characters finding a fundamental meaning of life but not recognize the absurdity discounting some  individuals  because of race or nationality I can also imagine people identifying literary devices and themes and such  like maybe Marmaledov s drunk talk with Raskolnikov at the beginning foreshadows something or other  or perhaps he blurts out the overall theme of the book in a few short sentences  Maybe  but I just don t want to pull together any such argument  I just want to exist in that thick  emotional world of these characters  They are consumed by deep issues of meaning  But meaning at such a core level it makes you cry  600 pages of searching for answers on what LIFE is  And even the superficial people go at that with all their being However I guess I should at least remind my self of possible topics  and some quotes I might want use for a book report if I ever how to repeat High School Accept Suffering and be redeemed by itAccept lifeLife itself defies logicRazumakin  damn I wish this guy was my friend  Talking nonsense is the sole privilege mankind possesses over the other organisms  It s by talking nonsense that one gets to the truth     Talk nonsense to me by all means  but do it with your own brain  and I shall love you for it  To talk nonsense in one s own way is almost better than to talk a truth in someone else s  in the first instance you behave like a human being  while it the second you are merely being a parrot    251It wasn t a person  but a principle that I killed pg 328Raskolnikov to Sonya about her    how such turpitude and vileness can exist in you along side these other  opposing and holy emotions  I mean it would be more just  a thousand times more just  and more reasonable to throw yourself headfirst in the water and be done with it  Pg 381Raskolnikov confessing to SonyaI wanted to kill without casuistry  Sonya  to kill for my own sake  for no one but myself  Pg 487Sonya to RaskolnikovYou must accept suffering and redeem yourself by it pg 489In place of dialectics life had arrived   last page My favorite aspect is that the book changes every time I read it  It can be read as philosophy or psychology or social criticism  If feeling lighter  it can be read as an absurdist comedy or just a straight ahead crime novel  You have to love a work that apparently inspired Nietzsche as well as the Colombo television series  I read this  for fun  when I was a teenager  This was one of the first books I read because I knew it was a classic  but otherwise knew nothing about It was intense So much so  that I HAD to talk about it as I worked my way through it  I told my mom about it from the beginning  and every day I was busting at the seams to tell her about the latest chapter  I honestly could not believe what I was reading  the story is graphic and brutal in parts  and yet also dangerously personal  I could see behind the eyes of the protagonist like some kind of out of body experience  as if my soul had helplessly merged with his  It was a little bit like The Picture of Dorian Gray as i literally sat frozen with guilty horror at what seemed to be a reflection of myself  It was intense And also amazing  It really did change me  it added a layer of depth and understanding to my naive teen awareness  It was monumental  I remember feeling the palpable change from the experience  like my whole interpretation ofthe world was now profoundly dimensional  There was clarity   an awakening of my adulthood  perhaps  that sharpened all of my senses  The memory of that insight is tangible to me even now  I can taste it  smell it  feel it tickle against my skin  It was transcendent  I ve read this one a few times now   again  if you haven t read it and want to  look for the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations  not this Penguin crap      It s a whole different experience The book is a great inquiry into poverty and the nature of  crime   I used to teach a class in African American literature where we compared it to Richard Wright s Native Son   the parallels are staggering  I used the book to illustrate how crime is a function of economics  not culture And  there are few books that offer the following meditation  The crime is the punishment    The original work  ineffable  The translation  shapely  controlled  dexterous Fantastic  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and found myself gripped as I learned more and more of the motivations of Raskolnikov and what truly caused him to act as he did  Dostoevsky does a wonderful job giving you gradual glimpses through different characters  perspectives and allowing the reader to understand alongside the main character himself  I love stories that transport you to a different time and place with a different culture that give you an appreciation of a different way of life and thinking  A great book once you get into it  I struggle with classics because they make you use your brain  especially this one  The main character is so complex and it really gives you a different perspective on life  I highly recommend this book  but only if you can take your time on it  Those Russian authors can be tricky to understand  mostly because all the names sound the same   Przerazajaco realna i brutalna opowiesc o tym kim jestesmy  jak siebie widzimy  opowiesc o zbrodni i karze ktora czeka na kazdego z nas  Rzecz o pogardzie  rzecz o dumie i o swiecie w ktorym dominuje szarosc  a nie podzial na czern i biel  Pomimo wiekowosci fenomenalnie aktualna nie tylko pod wzgledem niezmiennej psychiki czlowieka  lecz takze problemow spolecznych  jakze podobnych do tych ktore aktualnie przezywa wiek XXI Arcydzielo  Crimen y catigola cruda realidad cuando se comete un crimen  nunca queda sin castigo y el precio a pagar es muy alto   A timeless novel of the grey morals and hazards that accompany life and modern day society  The main character s vicissitudes  vexations  reasoning  and vanity play out in a gripping story of murder and redemption  A great novel  This book was initially hard for me to get into  but as I read on it became more and more intriguing with the way the author really puts you into the mind of this highly disturbed character and sends you through the journey with him  Indeed how the young man pays for his crime is the worst kind of punishment and I think this book is  although slightly disturbing  a fantastic piece of literature  I hated this book when I read it in high school  May 2000  but LOVED it when I read it in April 2006  for a college class on European literature  I think the epilogue is a huge sell out but otherwise  I was completely struck by the suspense in which I found myself throughout the novel  The cat and mouse game between Raskolnikov and Porfiry Petrovich is utterly fascinating  And who can resist the  hooker with a heart of gold  theme  Some disconnected thoughts   It s easy to see how much influence this novel had on film directors Robert Bresson and Martin Scorsese in modeling their own  angry young men  in Pickpocket and Taxi Driver respectively  In Taxi Driver especially Travis Bickle shares Raskolnikov s perverse rationalization for murdering  that it will benefit society at large  and there are even some undercurrents of Iris  the underage prostitute Bickle sets out to save  in Sonja  the pitiful  dirt poor prostitute that Raskonlikov finds solace with in Crime and Punishment  Scorsese however  takes a decidedly more subjective approach to the material  allowing the viewer to sympathize with Bickle as he takes us through his warped mindstate  and ending on an ambiguous note that eliminates the  punishment  aspect entirely  Bresson  on the other hand  seems to share Dostoyevsky s overall theme of faithlessness resulting in purposelessness  The agony of Bresson s petty thief and Raskolnikov are shared in the fact that both men lead lives without meaning  and their acting out against society only deepens their spiritual wounds   Raskolnikov is a surprisingly relatable character for contemporary readers  Of course  I can t sympathize with his poverty and the sheer misery of his surroundings  and I ve never murdered anyone myself and don t plan on doing so  but it is revealed that he is a former student who dropped out of school because he let his books collect dust while he sat in his room doing nothing  Anyone who has ever put off studying or avoided schoolwork entirely can sympathize here    Unlike Pickpocket and Taxi Driver  which perhaps are limited by their artform  not in a negative way though   Crime and Punishment is a much more comprehensive survey of poverty  misery  loneliness  insanity  and crime  highlighting several characters who fall victim to their surroundings  including one deranged mother whose street performance is one of the most jaw dropping scenes in the book  instead of just one    As scholarly and dense as I m making this novel sound  it is actually really readable  Dostoyevsky s prose is eloquent but never overly dense  The only hurdle a reader might face are the long winded dialogues that are occasionally delivered  one character in particular is really annoying with his self absorbed blabber    The dynamic between Raskolnikov and Zametov  the police detective on his case  is easily the most compelling thing in the book  at least from a plot perspective  Above I noted that the long winded dialogues can sometimes be tedious  when Zametov is delivering them to Raskolnikov  however  they are anything but  and the reader will hinge off of every word the man speaks  searching for a crack in his well meaning facade that would reveal his true intentions of prosecuting Raskolnikov  This was a masterstroke by Dostoyevsky in creating suspense    Even besides these adrenaline fueled scenes  Dostoyevsky creates a lot of tension off a simple premise  Raskolnikov has done a bad thing  now he must pay for it  but will he  Or is he paying for it the entire time  through his paranoia of actually being caught  His psychical sickness articulates pretty well how much of a  real  toll this inner guilt is taking on him    This might be my new all time favorite novel  So much depth beyond what I barely touched on here   A wonderfully written novel by Dostoyevsky  In Crime and Punishment  you are able to enter the mind and psychology of a killer  and better understand his motives  his reactions toward the killing  and his fear towards being caught by detectives   Primeira incursao em Dostoievski  uma excelente historia  personagens fortes e uma aprofundada e vincada exploracao dos meandros da alma e dos sentimentos do homem  em especial da culpa e da loucura  AMAZING      But beyond my expectations   It s the kind of book that would get you interested from what s beneath the words  I enjoyed every single detail in the book  and it is really amazing how Dostoyevsky actually gets the reader into this condition whereby he she enjoys every part of the book by experiencing different emotions  I personally  enjoyed all the feelings I went through while reading this book  the torment  the tense  the happiness  the pity  the astonishment  the surprises and whatever s left from emotions in this book  One other thing I LOVED about the book  is how Dostoyevsky went deep inside Raskolnikov s self  and other characters  When Raskolnikov  the main character  commits the murder of the old pawnbroker lady and her sister  Dostoyevsky describes in a perfect way his feelings along with the physical description of his condition in such position  After the part of how Raskolnikov commits this crime  the other parts of the novel may not sound really interesting  but trust me they ARE  As I thought for an instant that because the murder happened in the very first part of the novel  it would be boring later on  for what would come up in the next 5 parts of this novel  But as they say   Don t judge a book by its cover    Undoubtedly  one of the most famous and influential novels in world literature  Redemption through suffering  The more we intellectualize  the more imprisoned we become  Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart   I have read this book several times  It is one of my all time favorites  The beginning is hard to consume  but once you continue with the book it is amazing  The end message is very biblical  I could say much more but I don t want to give anything away  Wonderful read     Este libro me cambio la vida    me abrio el cerebro y me hizo pensar que hay miles de emociones por experimentar en la vida  Possibly my favorite read of all time  It made me feel like I was living and walking the streets of st  petersburg at that time  The intense psychological drama made me feel I was living in this guys skin  Is it wierd that I loved this as a teenager and read it twice   In this case the tension is moral rather than physical  It s a murder mystery of sorts  but one where we see  and FEEL  the crime being committed  Dostoevsky puts you inside Raskolnikov s mind before  during  and after the double murder at the center of the plot  In this case the problem that drives the story isn t whether the police will catch the killer    although the novel features a clever and persistent detective worthy of the best of the genre    but whether the killer can be brought to a point where he has the moral courage to confess  I stole the above from another review  but it is on the money Again  this was one of those that I always knew I should read  but hadn t  In this splendid book  Fyodor Dostoyevski takes us to a new horizon of understanding the psychology of the crime  Rodion Raskolnikov  an early twenties law student  was pushed to commit a crime due to his poverty and social problems  He finds later the most humane characteristics through suffering  In general  this book reconciles the relationship between the material world and the spiritual one   My favorite book of all time  Given FD s  paid by the page  reputation of being hopelessly wordy and digressive  I thought this was pretty taut and focused  Although the central drama of the plot involves the resolution of a moral thought experiment   do the laws of right and wrong only apply to those too weak to transcend them    the pleasure of the book is not in finding vindication of one s ethical convictions but rather in the experience of the protagonist as he navigates his place among his various relations and tries to evade capture  from both the police and his own psychology  Probably my favorite book of all time  The character development is really wonderful and despite the book being quite long and the Russians being known for being a little dry  I find that every time I pick this book up I end up finishing it in a few days because I am unable to put it down  The story is beautiful and really moving and explores a darker side we all grapple with Also I find the Barnes and Noble translation to be pretty decent  they are usually okay with making translations more  for the people  although my all time favorite version of the book is Princess Alexandria s translation  I recommend this one the most highly  It was really pretty  This novel  unprecedented before its publication in its subject matter  provides a window into the mind of a murderer  As the readers learn  it is not fury  revenge  or insanity that causes Raskolnikov to commit his crime  Nor is it because of his theory that some men are born with the innate right and responsibility to kill  and by doing so  change the world  No  Raskolnikov s crime is  I believe  committed due to the hopelessness of the world he lives in and the loneliness in his own heart  After the murder is committed  in the first section out of six in the book   Raskolnikov spends the rest of the novel desperately attempting to avoid confrontation and discovery  but these attempts are futile  The ending of the book leaves us with a feeling of overwhelming relief  yet  even as we condemn Raskolnikov s actions as detestable no matter what the reason for his crime  we simultaneously cannot help but empathize with his feelings of self loathing  depression  and hopelessness  This book allows us to see not the deranged mind of a heartless killer  but the proverbial mind of all of humanity  irrational  passionate  flawed  and powerful   Two works  in all the literature I ve read  really drove home what it would be like to commit murder and then feel the utter alienation that follows  One  of course  is this book  and the other is a drama  Shakespeare s under rated play  Macbeth Both works did and still produce chills  Zero at the bone    Dostoyevski kitaplarini bir kac yayinevinden okuduktan sonra ceviri de ciddi kusurlar fark ettim  Arastirmalarim sonucu Iletisim yayinlarini buldum  Dunya klasiklerini Iletisim cevirisiyle okumanizi tavsiye ederim Suc ve Ceza ya gelince uzerine soylenecek o kadar cok sey varken bir kac cumleyle anlatilmasi imkansiz gibi  Derin  etkileyici    A thrilling drama of crime and redemption  this book is an intriguing expedition into the psyche of a murderer and those who make his aquaintance  I had some misgivings about the translation being rather orthodox and uninterseting but then again it doesn t bais the narrative that much  All in all  a must read P S  Do not go for translation by Constance Garnett look for a more recent one   bsm llh l ly l ZymqT    dbyW   Zym  sbr fyh lktb  Gwr wdwkhl lnfs

ltHyWt  ly  Classic  Another surprisingly easy and absorbing read  I was very intimidated initially by Russian literature  especially by Anna Karenina and War and Peace  But this book was accessible and understandable   Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart  The really great men must  I think  have great sadness on earth  Honestly  I don t know how it is humanly possible to write such a book Let s begin by acknowledging that this isn t an easy read  The language isn t especially tough  but it takes time to get used to the dialogue   which often consists of long monologues and narrations within narrations  and confusing pronouns  Also  the Russian names  Almost every character  and there are lots of characters  is referred to by multiple names  some of which I can t even pronounce But hey  the best things in life never come easy  When you get past these minor hurdles  Crime and Punishment is a treasure chest  Of suffering The book has many themes   the foremost of which deals with the psychology of crime and the effects it produces on the criminal  The overall plot is rather simple but has many fascinating subplots and nuances attached to it  The story continues in a slow pace with a strong focus on philosophy and character interactions Crime and Punishment outshines all other books that I ve read in one aspect  characterization  The characters are painfully complex and exquisite  Dostoevsky sets things up such that multiple  and often conflicting  traits are squeezed out of every character and the reader is presented with fictional beings of amazing depth and variety  Seriously  I can t praise the characters enough I would recommend this book to everyone who is willing to cross the mentioned hurdles  Crime and Punishment will not disappoint those who are patient with it  On the contrary  it ll create a permanent and profound mark P S  One of my friends gave it up midway because he found it to be too dramatic  Well  I would concede that no one actually talks or acts like the the people do in the novel  But this is literature  old literature   You simply cannot expect it to be completely like real life  Actually  I feel it is better than reality A person kneels before a frail  young girl who has been forced to sell her body to support her family   he kisses her toe  which frightens her   and then proceeds to explain himself   I did not bow down to you  I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity  That s not drama  That s art  I d say this is Dostoyevsky s finest moment because it s so readable  I expected a plodding  worthy Russian tome  but got a thrilling page turner  A great introduction to Dostoyevsky and one of my favourite books ever because it surprised me  Deeply philosophical without being esoteric  literary and gripping  A must read   What can I say about Crime and Punishment  Well NOT READING IT would be a capital Crime     Dostoyevsky s genius lies in his ability to create simultaneously a psychological novel and a novel of ideas  Though each character represents a certain philosophy of life  they never become lifeless or stereotyped  Dostoyevsky s genius is in this ability to combine the perfect counterpoint between conflict of personality and conflict of philosophy between his fascinating characters  He also specializes in stealing the reader s interest and sympathy for the most unlikely characters  like the protagonist  Raskolnikov  As always  it s difficult to do a complete review of Russian classics  or any other lengthy piece of classics   There are so many layers and much more to talk about and it s a time consuming process  So a group readings always help to get the full experience with the feedback from other readers  even when I re read  such as this one If anyone s interested to understand the novel in many levels check out the group discussion on  Crime and Punishment  at  Discovering Russian Literature  http   www goodreads com group show 4    this was such a good book  although over my head at times i really enjoyed reading it and found it extremely thought provoking  i plan to read it again so that i can understand it more and thus enjoy it more   I d say may favorite book so far  I received as a present from a good friend on my 26 birthday I think 26   The same night I started reading and send him a text message that it was great to finally open a book which really made you feel good about what was to come  I just gave this book to another friend  Ad funnily enough  the next day I received a message stating  it s like i m reading my own diary  A must read  dg Daha once kim bilir hangi siradan yayinevinin  nasil berbat bir cevirisinden okumusum ki  kitaptan neredeyse hicbir ayrinti kalmamisti aklimda  Simdi Is Bankasi yayinlarindan  Hasan Ali Yucel Klasikleri Dizisi icinde  okudum  Sanirim piyasadaki en iyi ceviri bu   I read this book in 12th grade  I almost cried at the end  I must read it again  One of my favorite literature I read in high school  A gripping book packed with psychological and philosophical brain teasers  This was one of the first books I bought and read  when I was 12  and it has stayed with me ever since  I need to re read it as I m sure I ll have an entirely different reading of it being 24 now  Fydor    It is interesting that I happened to read Crime and Punishment at this particular time in my life  I found peculiar similarities between my own circumstances and those of the main character  Raskolnikov  23 years old  former university student  struggling to find his bearings in life  uncertain future prospects  always seeking out isolation  preoccupied by his own thoughts and fantasies  Although my own thoughts and fantasies are not as mad or immoral as those of Raskolnikov  nor are my financial circumstances so dire  the juxtaposition of our parallel lives made me think  Dostoyevsky s reputation as a master of the subtleties and profundities of the human condition cannot be better elaborated by me than it already has been by others  Suffice it to say  Dostoyevsky s brilliance is on full display in Crime and Punishment  and it is justly considered to be one of his greatest works  as well as one of the greatest works of world literature  It is a crime thriller  a moving story of sin and redemption  a philosophical exploration of an individual s attempt  in the belief of his own superiority  to impose his will on the  raw material  of humanity and its eventual defeat by total selflessness and compassion   This is a life changer  It s difficult to read  without a doubt  one of the few books I ve read with the literal power to alter my mood in a fundamental way  I was a terrible  depressed  unapproachable and morose person from page one through page 1 479  or whatever   sorry  family   But the payoff is tremendous  I ve read many a  tale of redemption  book  but this one puts all others to shame  This is my second time reading it  although it took me quite a long time to read a full book   and again I m being very impressed  Dostoyevsky created a true masterpiece which everybody has to read  and I ll judge you if you never ever want to read it    This is a masterpiece  Learned more psychology from here than from textbooks    Painfully brilliant  A thorough dissection of a murder and its murderer  complete with a good rendering of the time and the place in which the story takes place  Dostoyevsky took me on a ride to experience what states of mind before  during and after a crime  Such a complex states beyond the typical cliche expressed in the crime novels  I learn that there is no black and white  It is always a mix  And a character is prompted with decisions along the way that leads to the realities he she has to endure  I have to remind myself that this crime and this criminal is Raskolnikov  who has been rendered with his past  his desires  his inspirations  and his dreams  Then he is fronted with a situation and react according the rendition of character he has been given  That is one of the masterful aspect of Dostoyevksy s authorship  What I mean here is that  another character with different characteristical renditions would possibly end up with a completely different story  I am relating this to the recent debate about the concept of prison and crime following the violent riot in one Indonesian prison  I was intrigued by how should a prison is approached and managed with the intention of handling criminals  This story gives insights of how a crime came to be in certain circumstances  and then how should this be punished  What about the other crimes and criminals  How can there be a general system of punishments for such special crimes and criminals Those questions are definitely not to be answered in this place  But I just want to show how a good literature can illuminate a certain aspect of human life   Hard to rank any book 5 stars  but I can t imagine a better one  Classic style  amazing skill   Dostoyevsky brings you right into the mind of a murderer  And by the end of the book  I found myself really rooting for the guy  Interesting   how far away are we from becoming the same  The power of the mind    well worth the time  but certainly not a weekend read   Hard book to read but a MUST read  Definitely one of the greatest classics books of all time  Morality and wisdom  Fyodor Dostoyevski is one great author  The book is remarkable  It is very difficult  you feel sympathy for a murderer  but he killed an evil creature  All the way along the novel  you think he would not make it  that suicide is looming  but when you reach the end and see that there is hope and that life goes on if you have someone to stand by you no matter what  that is the real catharsis  This novel is the proof that a real masterpiece does not necessarily have to end tragically  It s Dostoyevsky   What more can I possibly say  A true piece of art and my all time favorite novel  Dostoyevsky depicts an in depth understanding of the psychological aspect of a human being and emphasizes the dualistic forces and contradictions existing in human mentality   it is simply mind blowing   This was a re read  and it reinforced  and all the more enjoyably  just how brilliant a writer Dostoevsky is  Reading this at a more mature and sensible age really evoked Dostoevsky s philosophical musings more  and overall it was a poetic and powerful reminder of the influence and genius of Russian literature   This book was tedious  dark  brooding and painful  I loved it  It explored so many aspects of human nature  The characters were tragic  yet so alive  It came down to this  what persists  What is real  What can one truly believe  I think the answer Dostoyevsky provides is complex and yet altogether simplistic  I am sorry I have finished it   Fascinating look into the mind of a criminal  the world of mid 19th century Russia  and the way in which our lives connect  I never expected to like this book nearly as much as I did  I ll admit that at times it seemed a bit long  and I would have dearly appreciated a few more paragraph breaks  but all in all it was a fabulous read throughout  including one of the best endings to a novel I ve ever read   Sin duda un libro espectacular y digno de leer  Es un clasico  En primer lugar  Fyodor Dostoyevski me impresiono como escritor  En esta obra al menos me parece que tiene un talento para ahondar en la psicologia y el alma del ser humano Al principio me parecio un poco lenta  y quizas el idioma traduccion fue un pequeno obstaculo  hubo algunos problemas de traduccion  errores ortograficos y redaccion  pero de eso hablare en breve   Basicamente  la historia se desenvuelve en una epoca dificil  La Rusia de los Zares  Una epoca en donde la sociedad esta en crisis y a punto de sucumbir  El personaje principal de la historia es Rodion Raskolnikov  un estudiante que vive en la miseria que decide cometer un crimen para comprobar una teoria  algunos seres extraordinarios en la sociedad se les  permite  moralmente cometer un crimen si este es un mal para la sociedad  Despues del crimen es cuando la historia se vuelve interesante  Nos pone en perspectiva esa delgada linea entre lo etico  lo moral  lo legal y la justicia  Rodion comienza a experimentar una culpa que lo corroe por dentro  que aunque no fue apresado  vivia en paranoia  se sentia enjaulado en su propia culpa  Aunado a Rodion  hay otros personajes cruciales en la historia  y he aqui lo fantastico que muchas historias no logran cumplir  cada uno de estos personajes tiene densidad y profundidad  cada uno es diferente  cada uno nos da referencia de diferentes aspectos de aquella epoca ya mencionada en Rusia  llena de injusticias  desigualdad  pobreza  no tan diferente al mundo actual en ciertos paises    Desde el inicio  Rodion  como personaje te atrapa  y considero que hasta ahora es uno de los personajes complejos  impresionantes  intensos  humanos y conmovedores que me ha tocado leer  Otro personaje entranable para mi fue Sonia  Sonia es la persona que transforma a Rodion  y al menos a mi parecer  lo que proyecta su personaje es como el amor puede regenerarnos  puede hacernos capaces de transformarnos  Y precisamente por que ella tambien sufre   su miseria la lleva a optar por la prostitucion para hacerse cargo de su madrastra y hermanitos   es el dolor que los une y los  purifica  por asi decirlo La familia de Rodion y su mejor amigo Razumijn tambien aportan sentimientos a esta historia  Sobretodo su hermana Dunia  que representa la virtud y la bondad  y su amigo la generosidad y la esperanza  Inclusive personajes secundarios como Porfirio  la justicia  la etica  y Schvalitov  la avaricia  la ambicion   Mermeladof  vicio   enriquecen el mensaje que nos da Fyodor con esta majestuosa obra literaria  Una obra que al menos a mi  me produjo sentimientos encontrados de desazon  tristeza  alegria  odio  y amor  El final  fue sublime e inteligente  cargado de esperanza  de perseverancia y amor incondicional Puntos negativos  son pocos  El libro puede por ciertos momentos parecer muy denso  Sobretodo puede parecer un poco dificil de interpretar para aquellas personas no familiarizadas con los clasicos  este libro fue escrito en el siglo 19   Tambien el uso de diminutivos y usos de apellidos patriarcas en el idioma ruso puede confundirnos  Por ejemplo  la hermana se llama Avdotia pero tambien el autor se refiere a ella como Dunia o Dunetchka  tchka al final de los nombres es ITO ITA en espanol  es una forma de llamar a alguien carinosamente   A lo largo de la trama  a veces el autor llama por el apellido patriarcal a un personaje y otras veces por el apellido normal  Es parte del idioma y cultura rusa y no es algo negativo per se  pero puede confundir  Otro punto negativo es que al menos mi edicion tenia errores ortograficos  no muchos   errores creo que de redaccion  tal vez es dificil traducir un clasico del idioma ruso al espanol   Sobre todo al final  encontre errores como Mar1A por ejemplo  Me llevo esta historia en mi corazon y recomiendo este libro ampliamente para tenerlo en la seccion de clasicos permanentes  Me gustaria leer pronto otra novela de Fyodor Dostoyevski  y creo que sera Los Hermanos Karamazov  Otro clasico con excelentes ratings  Para todos aquellos que no conozcan de antemano un poco de la biografia de Fyodor Dostoyevski  les recomiendo hacer una busqueda simple  ya que nos proporciona un poco de profundidad cuando leemos sus novelas  Yo al menos lo lei de wikipedia http   es wikipedia org wiki Fiodor_D    One of the greatest novels I ve ever read  At times so intense it was a bad idea to read it before bed because it would get my heart racing  It s one of those classics that is absolutely relevant to this day  and just as gripping as a modern psychological thriller  Recommended for all mature readers   Les digo lo que dijo Dostoievski que dijo Rilke sobre Rusia   Rusia  el pais donde los hombres son seres solitarios  donde cada cual lleva un mundo en si  donde cada cual esta lleno de tinieblas como un monte  donde cada cual es profundo en su humildad    seres humanos llenos de lejania  inseguridad y esperanza  seres humanos en trance de estar haciendose  Y por encima de todos un Dios al que no se determina jamas  que constantemente se esta transformando y creciendo   De eso va la novela  Por eso Dostoievski utiliza de epigrafe a Rilke  Por eso yo retomo la epigrafe de la novela  Porque de eso va la novela  A really good book  Keeps your mind active and makes you over think a lot of decisions  The characters are really nicely done  they are all well defined  their actions are motivated and everything feels natural  This story  next to Alexandre Dumas  Count of Monte cristo is my all time favorite  Very profound and fydor paints an awesome picture when he writes  feels as if you are there  I have been practicing saying  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  so it rolls off my tongue making me sound very cultured  I told my friend I had just finished reading  Crime and Punishment   she asked if it was by Jane Austen  in her defense I read Jane Austen twice a year  and she had kids jumping all over her as I told her about the book   I said  No  it s by Fyodor Dostoyesvky  and then felt quite smug that I managed to get the name out without tripping over any syllables   It helped that I listened to the audio book  I have an audio book on the go  I listen to them in bed while I settle my children  or while I am doing the ironing  or sewing  or baking because the book got so good I listened every chance I got   About a third of the way through I transferred a copy to my husband s phone so he could listen on the way to work  I was blown away by the book and needed him to listen so that I could discuss it with him The rest of this review will probably contain some spoilers  but it won t spoil the book  this book is about the writing and the pyschological insite  rather than simply the plot The first part of the book left me rather shaken  The main character did something rather heinous  but during the whole lead up to the act it was as if he wasn t going to do it  I mean he was thinking about how he didn t think he would do it  how he couldn t believe that he was considering doing it  that it was a funny thought that he might to it  He didn t seem particularly evil and yet it murdered a woman in cold blood  I was shaken  I sat there thinking about how his actions seemed so innocent to himself  up until he commited the murder  I thought about all the times I had fleeting thoughts of doing a heinous thing ie driving a car off a bridge or one of those scary thoughts that occasional pops into your head and makes you think  what the fuck I don t want a thought like that   Yet here is this guy having those thoughts and slowing making plans to actually commit the act all the while not actually believing that he has an intention of going through with it  I finish the first part of the book and wondered if I do would be capable of murder  I mean this guy murdered  how was he any different to me   Thankfully by the end o the book I could see how different we were  what a relief  I needed my husband to read the book so I could talk to him about how exasperating Raskolnikov  the main character  was  Basically he kills a woman for money  extensibly so he can set himself up with a good education and fulfill his destiny  Yet up until this act he had given up university and spent his days laying miserably on the couch  His mother and sister where scraping every penny together and sending it to him  but he would waste it or give it away and just continue to be depressed and doing nothing His friend is the contrast  his friend works hard doing this and that scrapping money together in order to finish university  He even offers a job to Raskolnikov who refuses it  thinking to himself that it is too little money and not worth the effort  Money is continually coming to Raskolnikov and we start to see that if he had only got off his ass then he could have made enough money to pay his own way through university    this shit me off The book ended with Raskolnikov realising that he loved the girl that had followed him  I won t give away who she is   But this is what I hate  at the moment that he realises that he loves her he realises that she is not good enough for him  He has an ephinany about life and her and awakes from his depression ready to begin life anew  but he looks at this woman who has been looking after him and helping him  and ponders how she isn t good enough for him because she hasn t had the same ephinany that he just had  I though  Fuck you Raskolnikov  she didn t need the ephinany because she was already living it     I mean Raskolnikov is an asshole and won t talk to anybody or be friendly  Yet the girl is friends with everybody  everybody likes her  she is alive and he isn t  So when he misses her  realises that he loves her  and is suddenly awakened and alive again    he looks at her and thinks she isn t smart enough  blah blah blah I loved how the book highlighted all sorts of crimes and awful people and we got to see how and why we considered one act a crime and yet another wasn t  Why did we  the reader  accept the murder of the old woman  yet it was the murder of the young woman that horrified us that most  Why did we cheer for Doonya as she pointed the gun at her attacker etc I love Russian doorstoppers  I didn t realise how much until I finished this book  Two of the most amazing books I have read are Russian doorstoppers  Anna Karenina and Crime and Punishment   I am of to start reading Crime and Punishment now  Once again Dostoevsky manages to flood my consciousness into a world so palpable that I feel as if the protagonist s movements are my own  I can feel the streets  the cramped rooms  and the stench of every last one of the airs he describes   There is much more to be said  but for now  I can only express my gratitude for the genius achievement that is Crime and Punishment  io credo che questo sia uno di quei testi che devono far necessariamente parte della biblioteca di ogni singola personaseppur lungo  la trama e ricca di colpi di scena e a mio parere mai noiosa come invece molti definiscono la scrittura di Fyodor la maggior parte della trama si basa sui pensieri del nostro protagonista e su quello che lui considera giusto o sbagliato nei suoi modi d agire qS  jmyl  khSwS fy wSf lshkhSy  lmDTrb  llbTl This book is awesome  The protagonist  Raskolnikov  is crazy like a fox  The weird thing is that  despite how bizarrely wayward and even evil some of his thoughts are  I think a lot of readers are intrigued by them and by him in general  Man  it s hard not to be   repulsed and luridly fascinated at the same time  Wow  Not sure I ve ever quite read a book like it  This stuff is intense Just a heads up   read the whole thing  There s an epilogue or something at the end that really puts a twist on Raskolnikov  I almost skipped it and persuaded myself to read it at about 2 am the night before a test on it the next day in English class  Phew  did I dodge a bullet on that one  This book really grabbed me  It is a little dark because the main character really pulls you into his dark world  It shows how the evil one can make you feel you are doing the right thing  but as soon as you do it  he jumps on your back and tells you how bad you are  Una obra maestra de la literatura universal  Dejando al lado la dificultad de los nombres y de recordarlos  que para nada es una falla  es una de las obras mas sencillas de leer de Dostoyevsky y tiene tantas cosas para analizar  es una novela algo larga  pero para nada se siente pesada  lo mejor en todo en mi opinion es la gran cantidad de personajes  y lo bien escritos que estan todos  Recomiendo leerla si  Te gusta Dostoyevsky o la literatura rusa  Los clasicos  Personajes atormentados  Tramas complicadas  Great classic  Wonderful story  So very glad I finally got to it  Ini adalah buku pertama dari Dostoyevsky yang saya baca dan langsung jatuh cinta dengan penulis yang merupakan kompatriot Tolstoy  konon Notes From Underground juga layak untuk disimak   Heartbreaking it is true  Dostoyevsky captures the human soul in its lingering shame and beauty  He is sensitve to the duality of nature and mastered the art of social interactions  The reader begins to question their own view of what tragedy means and how the world encompases it through the totality of chaos  mn  jml m qr t fy Hyty klh  Dostoyevsky taught me a salutary lesson  how pride and vain distinction of oneself  fatal arrogances in themselves  can propel one to take the irrevocable path which leads  terrifyingly  to an alienation from society  As such  a warped self belief  of that ideology  instills delusions of superior exemption from it socially  morally and lawfully A detailed review to follow in the new year  This is my favorite book of all time  The detail here in the social setting is exquisite  The twisting and turning of the plot is extravagant  The author goes through pain staking detail of getting you into the main character s head to the point where you feel his anguish and pain  You know by the end of the book what will happen  The conclusion is quite telegraphed  but you are so gripped by the character s emotion that you want to keep reading and don t want the story to end  By the conclusion it is easy to see that Raskolnikov has redeemed himself and has been relieved of his sins  I read this as a 10th grader and now again as a 37 year old  I enjoyed it then  but mainly  I suspect  because it was a challenge  I enjoyed it this time because I was able to see beyond the basic plot to some of the ideas and how Dostoevsky works with the characters to express them  Big takeaway  self justification is a kind of slow motion suicide  But how does one get free from it  From suffering and from undeserved love  Sometimes  I feel like I give classics 5 stars just because they re classics  it s like they ve stood the test of time so they deserve it  Honestly though  Crime and Punishment was different  Reading the foreward  you would have expected Fyodor Dostoyevsky to have been Sigmund Freud   all the references to the  duality  of a person s nature  the psychoanalysis of the crime   all of it seemed so insightful  But like most classics  I don t feel the full force of the  message   the  greater  that makes it a classic  But the story is very touching and realistic  in that it throws you into the messy situation and makes you feel the anxiety and madness of Raskolnikov  I can t get over Svidrigailov and Sonia  He s just like Andrei in We the Living  her faith in humanity is incredible  To be honest  this is the first book I read from a Russian author  I ve always felt intimidated by them  and I was utterly scared of starting reading some of their works  and not being able to finish them  Even my dad told me that Russian writers were very difficult to read Beginning the book was hard  It took me a whole month just to finish the first part of Crime and Punishment  and I was reading it in Spanish  I m not that brave to read it in English    yet   After that  it took me another month to read the rest of the book  After the crime was committed  it was just page after page after page after page  I couldn t stop reading it  and if it took me so long to get to the end  it was mainly because university has kept me busy  As I read  I could feel Raskolnikov s anguish and anxiety  I really felt desperate  The only complain I have with the book is that I read two different editions  the first one was borrowed from the university library  which I couldn t borrow again because I lost my card  So I kept reading it in my Sony Reader    and the names where different  The first book had the names adapted to the Spanish pronunciation  while the ebook edition didn t  and it took me a while to figure out who was who Apart from that  it s an awesome book   To my surprise  I ended up enjoying Crime and Punishment  It s a great book  The ideas are its greatest attributes  Raskolnikov s beliefs about greatness and society  rationalization of murder  and ensuing insanity are fascinating to read  Simply the best book I have ever read     and I have read a lot  And I have read a lot of good books  And I have read all the classics  Still can t find a better book  I hope you get the idea  Read it  khtb rw bh Swrt Swty ghgh tw mshyn w msyr khr gwsh ddm   lwh br ynkhh tbdyl bh y  dt khwb w jlb shd

had to put it down and just breath  Very few books have had such a profound effect on me  Very few books can draw a person in so completely  make one think so deeply  and so perfectly do justice in its portrayal of pain  suffering  guilt  anxiety  and injustice inescapable in the human experience  In a broader sense  this book is a tome of human experience itself  I may not be skilled in literary criticism  but it doesn t take a college degree to realize the power of this masterpiece  If you ve never read this book  then I ask you to do yourself a favor and pick yourself up a copy  I don t remember the specifics but I remember really enjoying this book  being kinda blown away in fact  Psychology  politics  fiction  history and the highest level of writing talent   an all time classic  must read  that hasn t lost any of its charm   I didn t agree with Dostoevsky s philosophy at all  The notion of purging oneself of sin through suffering or pain strikes me as antiquated  Still  the conveyance of emotion throughout the novel was brilliant  I was gripped with anxiety or fear at points where it was apparent that these are what Raskolnykov  forgive my spelling  was meant to feel  The worry and questioning that the protagonists had for his own actions seemed to perfectly reflect how someone who s just done something horrible and is having second thoughts would think  This is one of the most enjoyable books I ve ever read   Ne znam zashcho i kak  no Dostoevski umee da vliiae na edno stranno nivo Deserving of all its praise I was terrified by this book s incredible size and it actually ended up being one of the fastest reads I ve ever had  as I read it in a period of 3 days A wonderful book  Everyone should read it  Quando mais nova  eu tentei ler duas vezes indo ate a metade e depois acabando por abandonar  Minha euforia adolescente hiperativa de quem quer tudo ao mesmo tempo agora nao deixava eu me concentrar em obras mais longas  Consegui finalmente ler inteiro no inicio desse ano e compreendi o  por que  de ser tao comentado  Como Dostoievski constroi Raskolnikov e trabalha com seu psicologismo e digno de louvacoes seculares   A must read classic   I really enjoyed this novel and think I will re read it again at some point  At first I found the Russian names difficult to follow  but soon I came to know all the characters by their many names  I loved the in depth perspective into the mind of the protagonist  where the reader almost comes to reason with the protagonist despite his crime  The book succeeded in providing us with a psychological perspective into the mind of a criminal   4 5 starsThis was so long winded  but so worth it  My only real complaint is with the ending   view spoiler  its title is Crime and Punishment  not Crime  Punishment  and Redemption  hide spoiler    right  Just finished this last night  When I began  I d just finished Lord of the Flies and started wondering what I was doing to my inner child  I m wondering what those who have also read The Lord of the Flies think of Crime and Punishment  For me  the latter treads fearlessly into the darker side of humanity as well as the former  but evolves and concludes in a way which left the reader with a satisfying sense of hope and redemption  I d sincerely welcome comments from those who have read BOTH books  as well as anyone who has also read only Crime and Punishment  As you can see  I give this book 5 stars  because it carried me through a broader spectrum of insight  emotions and I feel more  whole  for having read it  Took me an age to get through this one   you can t stop and start too much without having to go back and reorientate yourself in the story  However it s a fantastic in depth study on the human condition  and Dostoyevsky was so far ahead in his political analysis and commentary on what was evolving in Russia at the time  He applies the new emerging theories   in particular utilitarianism   to a single individual and the decisions he makes  and follows him through the emotional and moral turmoil that ensues as a result  It s insinuated that what works for government is not necessarily the best for the individual  New revelations come with age I last read C P sometime in my 20 s  Forty years later I m glad I returned to it  especially around the occasion of visiting Dostoevsky s apartment and some locations from the novel  I am put off by the over long speeches and formalities of the Russian language  but enjoyed the brevity and clarity of the Epilogue  It was a sobering and thoughtful read   At first I thought it was very slow  It took me ages to read it  but in the last 1 4 of it I couldn t put it down  and the epilogue was incredible  I nearly cried   This is my second favorite novel  also written by my favorite author  The last line makes every page worth reading  Also  Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky are my favorite translators of Dostoevsky  Wow  This book follows a man who wonders whether an important person can kill an unimportant person without guilt or consequence  He follows through seeing himself as someone who matters more than others and who can therefore decide who doesn t matter as much  He kills an oppressive woman who lends money and will probably not be suspected or caught  Most of the book follows his spiral into near insanity from the guilt of his actions  For Hitchcock fans this shares the basic plot of Rope and for Woody Allen fans  Crimes and Misdemeanors  but with different moral conclusions for each  I loved this book  I thought that I would have to make a big effort to read it but found it very readable  I found reading it as an adult that I definitely saw things in this book that I would not have understood if I read it in school like a lot of my friends did  Give it a try   jbtn  llGy     lm stT  tSdyq nn  qr  lktb rws  wthqf  mkhtlf  bl Hsst b nh nfs mshkl wfkr w rf mjtm n ldh  y khdh blZhr km  jbn  ltfSyl

depraved mind  and exposes the soul of a man possessed by both good and evil     a man who cannot escape his own conscience   I m glad that I read this in the summer  It hung around me like a heavy winter storm  The darkness of it is easy to recall on even the sunniest of days  That is why it is such a tremendous novel  I have a hard time finishing books of this length  so I m pretty excited to have actually finished this one  c As for a review   I mean  it s a classic  What can I say that hasn t been said before That aside  I really enjoyed this book  A question that runs through the book   Does the ends justify the means  Is violence an ethical means for change  This is still a relevant question  Dostoevsky does not seem to offer a solid answer to this question  but instead makes arguments for and against the idea of the end justifying the means  All in all  it s a great literary exploration on the question Another common theme within the book that I really enjoyed was the reoccurring theme of the scapegoat  Dostoevsky deals with the rights of silenced groups  especially women and sex workers Anyway  it was a great read  and I d definitely recommend it  c  I am reading it now and I just love the way Dostoyevsky writes  A great book to read but I have to stop evey once in a while to reread passages cause I get some ot the caracters and their nicknames mixed up   khub

dramatic  can t stand hapiness  they allways became ill or mad and obcessive about it and i really love it    Fascinating  Genious    Dostoievski  and no need to say anything else  Saying anything about this book s plot would be giving away too much  Just know this  This should not be the first classic you read  but this should definitely be one you eventually read because it is sooo worth it   This is possibly my favorite novel of all time  This is not the edition I read  so the translation may be different  but the symbolism is beautiful  and the juxtaposition of light and darkness  sin and redemption is soul stirring  Dostoevsky deserves the stature he has attained  Sin duda no es la novela mas compleja de Dostoievski  pero si que es la mejor para empezar con este autor  precisamente porque es la mas directa y la que mas va al grano  la que te engancha mas desde buen principio y ya no te suelta hasta el final  aunque esto no quita que sea una novela compleja y fascinante  con una estructura impecable y algo de sentido del humor  Tiene que ser realmente buena  porque Raskolnikov  el protagonista  me cae como una patada  es un egoista con delirios de grandeza ridiculos que trata fatal a las mujeres que se preocupan por el  Pero esto  que tantas veces me hecha para atras en una novela  aqui no me importa lo mas minimo  Y es que ademas esta Dunia  que es un personaje con caracter maravilloso  y Svidrigailov  que es un villano cinico y sarcastico pero con matices  probablemente mi villano favorito   dostoevsky brings you into the mind and heart of a troubled former student  raskolnikov  suffering poverty and confused by the philosophy of his time  operating under a theory he devises that allows him to view the murder of a crooked old widow as merely a matter of the extraordinary elevating themselves  this psychological thriller will captivate you  i almost felt like i had killed alyona  like i stood blundering and unable to think in her room  shuffling through her things  his guilt  mine  overcame him  and me  in the most excruciating ways  although written in 1866  it doesn t feel a bit out dated  and despite criticism that the ending is trite  it s well worth the plot and sub plots that run throughout  you ll realize that the punishment part of  crime and punishment  wasn t referring to the protagonist s eventual sentence in Siberia   it also doubles as an excellent critique of social ills  with feminist and class issues made clear   did i mention that dostoevsky was amazing     and talented  One of the most timeless  brilliant books I ve ever read  Although it was addressing a very current issue of its time  raised by the emergence of Socialism in Europe  the questions Raskolnikov asks haven t gone away  Are there fixed moral bearings in the human world  or is everything relative  with history being written by the victors  And can perpetrating an evil to benefit the greater good ever be justified  A brilliant story  with layer upon layer of depth  and still strikingly modern seeming   what s not to love  A beautiful exploration of redemption  judging others  and the nature of good and evil  There is romance  but it s not the typical romance novel  A background in Russian helps explain some of the wordplay  Ame este libro   Resena pronto   Eu cred insa in ideea mea  anume ca oamenii  prin insasi

fact that it is over 500 pages  The reason for this is that Dostoevsky is an extremely good writer  But the best part is how well he describes the characters  You KNOW and understand the main character as if he is your brother or son  Dostoevsky describes him so well and in such facinating detail that you know the reason why he chooses to do anything and everything  The murderer becomes a very empathetic character and you understand WHY he murders For me  a lover of character in novels  I fell in love with this book for the amazing characters and how the author understoods his characters so beautifully  Most amazing is that the author writes beautifully about his characters and their psychology a good 20 or 30 years before Freud came up with his theories Such sensitivity  such lovely writing  this book is a definite Good Read  Not sure if this is the edition I read  Grim story of sin and guilt in 19th century Russia The summer after I read this in a challening senior level English class at Penn  I was standing in line to check out a book at the Jackson Public Library when I noticed the rather good looking girl in front of me was checking it out  I had a wonderful girl friend at the time  otherwise I would have flirted with her but the library check out guy was about my age and he did by making several comments about the book  trying hard to sound impressive  She replied  Sounds like you know a lot about it  When did you read it   For her his reply could not have been a more complete turnoff   Well I never actually read it  but I know a lot about it because I took an exam on it once    a psychological masterpiece about redemption of the neurotic  fear and guilt burdened mind of the modern man  A cry for simplicity and alignment with nature  a cry for eden in a dark and nihilistic world  Bedre og bedre og bedre og bedre og bedre for hver gang   This is simply the finest study of human nature in literature  I adore this book  and lament that I am currently incapable of reading it in the original Russian  If you have not read this  stop what you are doing  and get to it  Vseki  koito se smiata za chetiashch chovek  triabva da mine prez ruskata klasika  Tazi kniga za men e nai dobriiat otgovor na v prosa  Zashcho triabva da ima literatura   Dostevsky s novel did not only consist of an extremely intriguing storyline and plot  but also brought up thought provoking questions regarding the basic issue of morality  In the beginning of the novel  we are introduced to a poor and somewhat manic Rodya Raskolnikov who is simply struggling with existence  We soon become aware of his enormous intellect  but also have knowledge of his strange thoughts and meditations upon the subject of murder  we become more familiar with his thoughts on this subject when introduced to his published theory on the subject   Also in the first section  I was extremely impressed with the intense and vivid descriptions that Dostevsky uses to build up the supporting characters and their personalities  The characters who we meet not only are present in the beginning  but play extremely important roles throughout the story as a whole  As the book progresses  we witness Raskolnikov s murder and the subsequent internal and external struggles that he faces  The attempt to discover a  way out  came to no avail  since the inevitable capture occurred  While the ending was one that left the audience with hope for improvement in the life of Sonia and Raskolnikov  upon reading the last word  there were many issues that I reflected upon  The morality of committing a crime  which certainly was a talking point throughout  was something that I was left thinking about  While murder or any crime for that matter is not commendable  the arguments that Raskolnikov made that stated some great men were able to overstep laws and morals for the betterment of society was certainly intriguing if nothing else  Many times throughout I was left pondering upon the points made  which made for an enjoyably stimulating read   lol  okay  well I ll offer my opinion  as yet its embryonic in its process  so excuse me if it sounds muddled  but what redemptive qualities are their in a man who offers himself up for punishment to redeem himself in the eyes of someone he loves  rather than for coming to realisation of his deed himself  Rask  returns to face his punishment upon seeing Sonia s horror  as such that itself leaves me questioning his sincerity   One of the all time best books ever written  of course I could say that of any of Dostoyevsky s books  There were scenes in this book where my heart was pounding and I could barley breathe  Nietzsche wrote about the concept of humanity moving  beyond good and evil   to break the shackles of morality and do whatever we must to evolve into the ubermensch  supermen   Well Dostoyevsky played with these ideas first  The main character is seized by ideas like this  that there is no God  all things become permissible   that some form of socialism will make everything fair and the supposed rationalism that would see humanity as an equation  So without God there is no right or wrong  we shape the world and with socialism we shape society so when you believe this you say so what if people get killed in my revolution in the end it will be justified by getting the world we want  It s the  ends justify the means  thinking  no longer  restrained  by traditional morality like  thou shall not kill   So the protagonist Raskolnikov believes these ideas  they were all over Russia and Europe at the time  but he questions what would it take to implement this  He asks himself if he has what it takes to be the type of man  what he calls a Napoleon that can kill for his ideals  Or is he just another weakling restrained by Christianity and morals that he and many no longer believe in  Can he move  beyond good and evil   I ll stop there so as not to give away spoilers but I ve only laid out the intellectual premise  the rest is a gripping novel about the crime he commits and the guilt and paranoia afterward with the police hot on his trail  that s where all the heart stopping scenes come in  Oh by the way if the ideas of the main character seem far fetched to you  then don t forget that all of Russia was taken over by this line of thinking and the communists killed millions  Dostoyevsky is nothing short of a prophet  No se si es un genio o si simplemente divaga mucho en detalles poco importantes que la mayoria de las personas ignoranCortesia de Memes Literarios The world has seemed to set itself up perfectly for Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov to commit murder  economic poverty  political oppression  and a hinted at mental emotional debility of the young man  The immediate impetus  i e  an overheard conversation in a bar  to kill a particular woman set Raskolnikov s mind spinning plans  and on the day he was to carry them out  even the string of circumstances seemed too perfect for his barbaric act not to be destiny  It was if the day had been made for him to shed the blood of the lecherous   tiny  dried up old crone   Alyona Ivanovna The psychological repercussions of the young  former student s act are overwhelming  his family and friends alienated  as he sinks deeper into himself and the psychical agony over what he has done  The attentive reader will ask herself how much of this is really Raskolnikov s fault  Is the agent of the murder to blame completely  partially  or perhaps not at all  Is 19th century Russia the true murderer  and Raskolnikov cognitively pulled under by the devastating tide of his circumstances It makes sense that Dostoevsky s work would remind me of Clarin s masterpiece _La Regenta_  as they were both written around the same time  Had I not known the dates of composition of either work  one would still have called to mind the other  Fyodor Dostoevsky  similarly to Leopoldo Alas  i e  Clarin   seems to act as a scientific god  creating his characters in his world  setting the top spinning  and stepping back as the impartial observer _Crime and Punishment_ is a joy to read for its complexity and nearly unparalleled masterful writing  even in translation  by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky   Yet  every so often  I have felt compelled to lay the book to rest for days at a time  At times  as I hover over Raskolnikov s world apace with the narrator  it is like watching a set of fine crystal teetering at the edge of a shelf  as if to fall and shatter at any second  That said  this work goes highly recommended to those who enjoy writing that often acts as a rubber band being drawn back indefinitely I have not as yet finished this book  Relentless  Not only my favorite by Dostoevsky but also my favorite classic  and one of my favorite novels altogether   I once even read it aloud to a friend  the other four times to myself   Translators Pevear and Volokhonsky make all the difference  Worth reading twice in a row  then as often as possible afterward  I was a 17 years old teenager when I read this book  After 12 years  what can I say about Raskholnikov s saga  Every line of this masterpiece is full of feelings  thoughts  life  every minute that I spent reading it brings me the best of my young reflections  Maybe my personality would be quite another if I didn t have read Crime and Punshiment  One of the best books I ve ever read I had never felt so out of breath because of a book  the author really made me curious and interested to know what would happen  Some dialogues beats the bush and make you anxious to know where they are going The characters are pretty unique and interesting  Raskolnikov reminded me of Holden Caulfield  Catcher in the Rye  with his crazy and rebellious mind  a really powerful guy  The Russian names are a bit difficult to remember and they get you confused sometimes but don t affect that much The idea of the book is very reasonable and you start thinking in different perspective about ethics and justice  Really cleaver book  Os estados psicologicos sao objectos dimensionais quantificaveis  Razkolnikov nao se sabia ainda mover por entre os seus objectos psicologicos  foi apenas isso o que o conduziu a Siberia  Isso e as condicoes miseraveis em que vivia  o que deve ter contribuido em muito para a degeneracao do seu discernimento Livro ideal para quem ve a vida e o mundo como um pedaco de marmore a ser esculpido  Rashkalnikov   the most haunting character in literature    I could go on and on here  but suffice it to say reading Crime and Punishment greatly diminished any enjoyment to be had from reading the existentialists as Dostoevsky s work is far more effective and realistic in explicating the agony of self realization  The Russians have this stuff down cold  what a bad pun  and make the westerners look like whiny spoiled children  It s your life  live it  mn  n l tHdth  n l bqr   w  n lrwyh nmr  1  lmy f  kthr ltSnyft Having not been exposed to all that much Russian literature I was slightly apprehensive about starting this  It was actually rather easy to understand  the only bit that confused me was how the names work  I thought the characters where fantastic and the plot interesting  I loved the setting of the back alleys of St  Petersburg  it just worked so well  He also made some excellent points on the class system and the issue of poverty prevalent at that time in Russia  Definitely need to pick up more of his work  I m thinking  The Idiot  next  My favourite book of all time  I want to reread it next summer  Part of my Top 3 books of all the time   This book was amazing  The ending was beautiful  and  for me at least  everything I wanted to happen  happened    The writing was heavy  but smooth  The characters were like threads in a tapestry  everything went together and worked well  The lauguge was mild  there was very little vilence  I mean the guy murders someone  but it s over fairly quick There is a character who is a prostitute  But the book is very good at implying what she does without saying it from a long while  And this goes on throughout  The prostitution is implyed but never shown  Clean in that respect The way the author dealed with capturing the human mind was amazing  I am eager to read his other novels and to re read Crime and Punishment soon  I read this in high school at a time when I mostly read books on politics  and it completely blew my mind  It made me discover the beauty of fiction and good literature and  also  Russian literature  This is a must read   I should read it again  it s been more than 10 years since I read it the first time   Whether you like it or not  Rodion Romanovich s soul in turmoil is shoved through your throat now and then  that is if you experiment with a bit of books and movies  So  it is inevitable that you want to face the real Rodion yourself  I took my own time though  Dostoyevsky works have been a mixed bag to me   Poor People  was a revelation  I was smitten by the style of that book for at least 10 years  Then  read  The Gambler  from Project Gutenberg  liked it till what I read  And  naturally became a self proclaimed advocate for Dostoyevsky in my circle A few years ago  attempted his magnum opus  doorstopper of a book   The Brothers Karamazov   Maybe it was that bad reading phase I was going through  I stopped after 1 4th of the book  So  I was a bit apprehensive to start  Crime and Punishment   Enough of a backstory I guess I am not capable of saying anything new about this masterpiece  Of course  it is a masterpiece  Effect of  Confused Ideology   it hits you like a heavy blow  150 years  Russia has come through a revolution  biggest historical change of recent centuries  the world has seen off a couple of world wars  The tortured soul  the one Dostoyevsky portrays  is still relevant  Don t mislead by the notion of certain people that Doestoyevsky s characters are one dimensional  they are far from being one  this novel has a multitude of characters which go to the path of salvation in different ways  If you are not moved with later part of the book  it might only mean that you are more cynical than me    You coast along the pages like as if you were in a roller coaster dream This novel is not without its shortfalls either  You could smell the plot 20 pages ahead  no we are not Fyodor Dostoyevsky  it is just that we have seen similar things umpteen times  Let us not even talk about the hooker with a heart of gold  who does Mary Magdalene here  But  we don t read classics  especially a Dostoyevsky  just for the plot  do we  ry     fy dkhl kl mn rskwlynkwf According to what I think  this book is one of the best example why it s important to read novels  The point behind why is because we get chance to understand more about different situations  that happens or happened in somewhere in this world  we have never experienced or some of them which we even could relate to and thus understand how people dealt with them  In other words  understanding human psychology in various situations  Novels of this type always leaves us with something to speculate about  An amazing book  Though it did not move me nearly as much as The Brothers Karamazov  I love how Dostoevsky is able to find beauty in that which is ugly   When it especially comes to the arts  can the Russians do anything wrong  I don t think so  I hate to over generalize  but I think it s true  Russian writers awesome writers Picking a favorite Russian novel is like picking your favorite piece of dark chocolate from an assortment of equally succulent chocolates  This one  though  is one of my favorite books of all time  Masterful storytelling  great character development  and good  meaty  philosophical stuff  Has this been made into a movie  I don t know  If not  what in the world is going on  Yes  it s that good Obviously  this is not a short novel  So  here s my quick take on it  You have a man  driven by his own ego  committing some atrocity  You can probably guess  and even if I were to state it  it wouldn t necessarily be a spoiler  Dostoevsky places this pivotal scene in the beginning of the novel to serve as a catalyst for the rest of the 300  pages of the novel  He is a sadistic author  torturing the main character with an internal conflict that starts to eat away at him  Raskolnikov  the main character turns out to not be such a callous individual after all as his guilt ruins his mind and makes him dysfunctional in life  Ultimately  he realizes that his twisted theory does not apply to him  and he slowly transforms and starts undergoing the process of redemption  So  in short  a story of redemption  There are a lot of those out there  aren t there  Redemption is a long and complex process  but take a novel that tries to capture that process and does it eloquently  it makes a great story  And   it s inspiring   This has got to be the hardest book Ive ever tried to read get about half way and can t continue  The mistakes people make are so hard to assimilate without finding our own failing within the story   Does this great work need a review    It is the first book of Russian literature I ve read and there is not so much I can say about it You know about those books you read and when people ask you about it and you just mumble not finding the right words to tell how much you enjoyed it well this is one of those for me There were times Dostoyevsky left me stunned by how much he seemed to know of human nature Raskolnikov I say without any doubt is the most complete character I ve ever encountered in a book  Ex student Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov has a theory  and one that will change more than one life forever  He believes  with great conviction  that a genius has the moral right to commit murder  theft  and other crimes   just because he is intellectually  above  others  He believes this so thoroughly that he  believing himself something of a genius  murders a pawnbroker and her sister with an axe and steals the money they have accrued over the years  Just managing to escape  Raskolnikov sinks into a war with his conscience and a delerium that causes others to doubt him  After meeting a drunkard named Semion Marmeladov  Raskolnikov has bouts of generosity and conviction  helping their family with their debts  and then paying for Marmeladov s funeral when he is crushed by a wagon  all the while trying to justify his moral degradation  Then he meets Sonia  Marmeladov s oldest daughter  a young woman who has turned to prostitution to keep her family from sinking further into hunger and destitution  Raskolnikov befriends her  fascinated by the oxymoron she has created  a poor prostitute  sunk so low  who believes in the saving grace of Jesus Christ  In the end it is this  and his own raging conscience that bring him to justice This is my second Dostoevsky novel  and I cannot say how much I enjoyed it  I don t even know where to start  I have so much to say   there s so much to mention  to bring to the table  However  I think I ll start Dostoevsky s incredible  almost super human  ability to create characters Having read Dostoevsky before  I knew I was going to enjoy the characters  The characters in The Idiot stuck with me for a long time  In fact  as I write this  I can very clearly picture each character  what he she was intended for in the story  and their personalities that are so impressioned into my mind  It is the same with Crime and Punishment  Raskolnikov s character alone is a masterpiece  His strange thought processes  his convictions  his awareness of all going on around him  his dilerium after he murders Lizaveta  and the new convictions that come about because of it all make up who he is and where he s going  As I started the book I wasn t as taken with him as I was Prince Myshkin in The Idiot  but as the story progressed and he changed  I felt a great attachment to him  While Myshkin was on the more talkative side  Raskolnikov was quiet  one who observes and reflects rather than speaks his mind  I felt sorrow for Raskolnikov because of the choices he made  but I loved him all the same as he tried his hardest to come to grips with the horrors of what he had done  Sonia s character is the more simple type  and a hard one to read about  After becoming a child prostitute at her step mother s insistence  Sonia hates her life but continues living that way because her family needs the money  However  her simple and wonderful faith in Jesus Christ as a wretched sinner affects Raskolnikov in ways he cannot foresee at the time  Other characters in this story include Porfiry Petrovich  the police inspector  who  one word at a time  tries to squeeze the truth from Raskolnikov  Peter Petrovich  the fiance of Raskolnikov s sister Dunia  Marmeladov  Sonia s father  the mad Katerina Ivanovna  Marmeladov s wife  and Razmukhin  Raskolnikov s closest friend who wants to help and has a very innocent love for Dunia Dostoevsky s writing is the next aspect that just gets me  in every way  his sentence structure  the way he describes scenes and objects  how he introduces characters   the purity of it all should be recognized for as long as books are in print  I felt this way about The Idiot and I feel it now  Dostoevsky s writing makes you feel as though you re reading a dream  If you ve ever wondered what a dream would be like if you could read it  I m convinced this is it  It s perfectly smooth  like you re floating  and yet his topics are real  his characters are lively and relatable  and above all his stories pierce you deeply with their symbolism and their cunning  If only every author used a bit of Dostoevsky s methods in their works    If only the stories spoke of real and often dreadful things but still permeated with the kind of hope and love we see here  this world would cease to exist as we know it   ykhy z bzrgtryn rmn hy trykhmbHthy dr bb rwnshnsy nsnhy shrwr w qtl tmm trykhy h w rwshny hy drwn shkhSyt h rw myshd mw bh mw dyd w tshkhyS dd hych wqt hdf wsylh rw twjyh nmykhnh   yn chyzyh khh rmn qrrh bh shm yd bdh  If you have only read this book once you may remember it being  deep  or  dark  The second time around it is still both of those things but I think that it becomes a bit lighter  and a funnier read Dostoyevsky never fails at making his heroes so right  even attheir cruelest  A man that can consider the act of murder so lightly  should also consider suicide  so  lightly  And he does this  I also believe that only Dostoyevsky can warm someone up to these feelings  He makes the reader a comfortable human being Or have you not thought of these things for yourself Own it  and read it forever  I loved how intense some moments got  The theories put into the crime solving based on behavior were quite interesting  and I was always excited to see how the conversations would play out between the accuser and the guilty  The book was well written and easy to follow  It was a bit longer than I m used to  but I didn t want to put it down after the first few hours  This book would quite easily be perfect for debating in a book club  if all the members could spare 25 or so hours of heavy reading time   Consigliato proprio a chiunque  alla fine scrivero un elenco per provare a convincere anche te  si  proprio te  che hai paura del mostro sacro Dostoevskij e non osi toccarlo La vera recensione dura una riga   Questo e un capolavoro  uno tra i libri che bisogna assolutamente leggere   Non ho intenzione di parlare dei personaggi e delle tematiche  Non mi ritengo neanche all altezza di qualche accenno  Questo libro si avvicina parecchio alla parola  perfezione  L unico punto  brutto  del libro e  la parola Epilogo  penso che solo un libro su cento mi abbia davvero fatto male lasciarlo Sarebbe bello creare una listopia  addii dolorosi   ma dubito che molti sarebbero sinceri  Chi non ha mai provato questo  dolore  probabilmente inserirebbe i suoi venti libri preferiti  Anch io mi sarei comportato cosi fino a qualche anno fa  Questo  dolore  e  un altra cosa  penso che alle persone fortunate  o sfortunate a seconda dei punti di vista  capitra al massimo una decina di volte nella vita   Io raggiungo quota tre  Alla parola Epilogo ho deciso di ricominciare da capo  leggendo prima tutti i commenti degli esperti  L ho trovato persino piu bello  Le chiavi di lettura sono molteplici e tutti sembrano aver ragione  Questo romanzo contiene veramente  tanto  Alcuni libri penso che li rileggero  dopo decine e decine di anni  per esempio Anna Karenina   Per questo romanzo non bisogna aspettare  Secondo me va riletto immediatamente per notare le sfumare e le possibili interpretazioni Molto bella la prefazione di Serena Prina all edizione Mondadori  Basta scaricare l estratto gratuito del kindle per leggerla   Un consiglio  non leggete prima le varie  prefazioni   Forse aiutano a capire meglio alcune cose  ma contengono troppi spoiler  Sembra quasi che la trama sia l elemento meno importante e si possa raccontare tranquillamente tutta la storia  Secondo me la  tensione emotiva  provocata da una prima lettura va lasciata libera al cento per cento  Per qualche giorno non credo che leggero  altro  Voglio rileggermi alcuni passaggi per una terza volta                        EDIT  non sto proprio leggendo nient altro  Odio Dostoevskij  Devo continuare a scrivere In questo romanzo e molto forte la componente psicologica  quindi provero a fare da  psicologo motivatore  per convincere  gli intimiditi   come Jessica  Monikav  Jul        che non bisogna avere paura di Dostoevskij Ecco un elenco di ragioni   Questo  finto mattone  ha stranamente alcune caratteristiche comuni ai piu avvincenti thriller moderni  come  Gone girl  La sfida psicologica tra due  avversari  e  molto intrigante  Avete paura di leggere un thriller moderno e temete la tensione degli interrogatori   Nonostante il falso luogo comune  Dostoevskij illeggibile   ha uno stile scorrevole  ovviamente non come Grisham o Connelly  e si legge con facilita  Tra i famosi 1001 libri da leggere  sono presenti almeni 100 libri con uno stile piu complesso  anche alcuni libri recenti  per esempio  Il senso di Smilla per la neve  sono decisamente meno scorrevoli  Avete paura dei luoghi comuni e dei coccodrilli nelle fogne di New York   Leggendo questo romanzi potete studiare psicologia  vengono descritti sogni  paranoie  attacchi di panico  ossessioni  manie di grandezza  fantasmi  ricordi dell infanzia     Non volete risparmiare i soldi d un manuale di psicologia   La prima esperienza con i russi e  indimenticanile  I nomi russi fanno  letteralmente  impazzire  Come si fa a non confondere Rodja Rodka Rodion Romanovic Raskol nikov e Ramuzichin  Volete privarvi di un bell aneddoto da raccontare ai vostri nipotini   Quello volta che ho scagliato un libro fuori dalla finestra perche continuavo a confondere i nomi      E  un libro da leggere punto  Leggere per poter dire agli altri  l ho letto  non e mai un buon motivo  pero in questo caso se serve a togliere le paure   Non volete farvi belli con i vostri amici Queste sono solo scemate per convincere i timorosi che non e un libro impossibile  La bellezza del libro e  da tutt altra parte  Ho evitato qualsiasi spoiler  qualsiasi citazioni e qualsiasi accenno agli indimenticabili personaggi per non rovinare minimamente un capolavoro Se siete esperti dostoeskiani vi consiglio la discussione su goodreads  club russo  su tutta la sua bibliografia Per gli altri riscrivo il mio consiglioLeggetelo senza informarvi su niente  poi scoprite i vari  segreti  del romanzo  leggendo prefazione ed interpretazioni  e rileggetelo L  etichetta  libro da leggere  secondo me e assurda  Nessun libro e  da leggere se non si ha voglia  Se invece non leggete per paura  devo essere severo  fatevela passare e leggetelo  A book of very rare depth  portraying the dual nature of the human condition in one single character  Raskolnikov  compassion  irrationality  logical thinking  hubris  cruelty  sophomoric  in self denial  egoistic yet altruistic  suffering yet reborn  Life cannot be lived in theory  One can choose to look at the book with modern  social democratic  Western and even atheist eyes  but the core of the story remains the same  We are all Raskolnikov and struggle with the same Faustian demons within ourselves  If life were only rational  we would not be human   La obra maestra de Dostoyevsky simplemente no deja que el tiempo la desgaste  es intrigante  directa y permite a su lector cuestionarse sobre la moral y etica del ser humano y la sociedad en la que este reside   Puede un asesinato justificarse  si beneficia a una mayoria  Una lectura obligada para cualquiera que se jacte de ser un lector arduo     l tw jlw

crimine  senza dubbio il migliore  The first time I read this book was in Englsih 300 and SCSU with Professor Hibbard  Since then I have read it another five times  I cannot seem to stop  I have tried other translations but I always come back to the husband wife translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky   If there was a way to rate it six out of five stars  I would   Pero comienza aqui una

and Punishment  is a classic  and  as one would hope  is an outstanding book  I debated only briefly on the rating  Sure  there are some minor issues that can make the reading more difficult for a modern day English speaking person  but the fact is that this is a book of great intellectual depth  It is not only a story with a rich assortment of fascinating characters  it is really about much more  It is nothing less than the struggle of the soul  Captivating reading  i heartily recommend  Crime and Punishment   Tb an nHn   m  lns w lbshr dhw lqdrt l dy   l yjwz ln ktb  ryfyw ldystwyfsky

modern case  an incident of to day when the heart of man is troubled  when the phrase is quoted that blood  renews   when comfort is preached as the aim of life  Here we have bookish dreams  a heart unhinged by theories     Fyodor Dostoyevsky  Crime and Punishment It s always nice to find out what a book is about in a simple phrase  line  or sentence within the book you re reading  Dostoyevsky was kind enough to do this during a conversation with Porfiry Petrovitch and Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov  an otherwise good man  was unhinged by the theories of nihilism and utilitarianism  and like Don Quixote  with  so little sleeping and so much reading  his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind   Except  with Raskolnikov it seems to be so little eating and so much thinking  He explains later that before we meet him  he had spent most of his time lying on his couch  eating or not with equal apathy  depending on if anyone remembered to bring him food  and thinking  thinking over his theories  This is a cautionary tale  though I balk at the idea of calling it a  cautionary tale  about what can happen when a man  utterly alone  gives thought to perverse theories  Thomas Mann said about a man who lives too much by himself   Images and observations which could easily be disposed of by a glance  a smile  an exchange of opinion  will occupy him unbearably  sink deeply into the silence  become full of meaning  become life  adventure  emotion  Loneliness ripens the eccentric  the daringly and estrangingly beautiful  the poetic  But loneliness also ripens the perverse  the disproportionate  the absurd  and the illicit   There is a touch of the absurd in Raskolnikov s theory  to an outsider  of course  It seems that utilitarianism is the main ideology Raskolnikov is building his theory upon  Killing one old woman who no one cares for and who no one will miss so that he can use her money to further his education and go on to help people makes a strange bit of sense if taken in the light of  the most good for the most people   however  I have a hard time seeing anyone but an unhinged mind seeing anything in it besides its theoretical application  But  of course  Raskolnikov s is an unhinged mind  Along with utilitarianism  the another ideology Dostoyevsky is attacking is nihiilism  Nihilism almost sounds like a joke to me  thanks to all the ridiculous teenage trends that have adopted Nietzsche as their patron saint  more often than not  having never read anything by him   but nihilism in 1860 s Russian was no laughing matter  Though Raskolnikov never refers to himself as a nihilist  one can easily see many of the aspects of existential nihilism in his theory  along with the utilitarianism above mentioned  Raskolnikov act as a reductio ad absurdum against these  and other  ideologies that Doestoyevsky says are a plague infecting modern society  The concept of dangerous ideologies seems to be a common theme for Doestoyevsky  based on the three novels I ve read by him and the ones I know a few things about  So far  each book I ve read could hold the forewarning   Here we have bookish dreams  a heart unhinged by theories   Of course  Notes from Underground has been called the prelude to Crime and Punishment  but even in The Double  I ve noticed a common theme of the lonely  thoughtful man  Perhaps it s just the books I ve read by him  I d be reading more if I owned any more   but it s a theme I find very interesting  When it comes to being undone by a flawed theory  there are really only two ways  only go over it with yourself or have it backed by your peers  Dostoyevsky chooses to analyse the former  If Raskolnikov had talked over his theory with  say  Razumikhin  I m sure he would ve ended  rather than following through  by laughing it off as a fanciful idea  He did say that he discussed it with his landlady s daughter  who he was engaged to  but after she died  it only rolled around in his head  Like Raskolnikov  I don t have a lot of people to talk with about philosophy or what have you  but I have noticed that often times I ll come up with some theory or idea that sounds good until I read a book with a conflicting notion  In other words  it s always good to have your views challenged  I think that was Raskolnikov s downfall  he didn t have his theory challenged until after he put it into action  Though I must say  one thing I really enjoyed about this book was that for a novel about flawed thinking and transgression  there s no preaching or moralizing  There s hardly even sentimentality  though it sneaks in at the last second  One could argue that there s a little bit of moralizing in the Epilogue  and I ll concede to that argument if anyone wants to make it  Still  Doestoyevsky isn t here to tell you how to think  He gives voice to people  often conflicting voices  and often conflicting voices from the same character  There s a realism in that that s refreshing  Often novelists use characters as symbols in this type of book  but Dostoyevsky s characters feel more human and less stand ins for ideas  There s quite a bit in this book  and I ve been trying to write this for over a week now  so I won t try to go any further  I do plan to reread this  in the Volokhonsky Pevear translation  and I m thinking about writing up a comparison to another novel that kept coming to mind while reading this  Great Expectations  But I ll save that for later  If one is to read Crime and Punishment  one must read the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky  I am only one fourth of the way into the book  but I m impressed by how Dostoevsky has the reader feeling empathy for one of the main characters  a murderer  This book forces the reader to look beyond the punishment into economics  a main force behind his need to kill  The book is a bold and honest confession of a daring passionate student of law in nilhist radical times of Russia   Raskolnikov   He doesn t care much for labels   be it political   social or religious   He wanders streets in rags with nothing but contempt for people around him   He consider himself Napolean of the common and considers himself the savior of common law   Despite his contemptuous attitude towards the people around him   he ends up saving two people in fire   caring for a fellow student consumed by tuberculosis and pays for funeral of a Marmeladov  funeral he doesn t want to attend   This contrast lies in his  logical  understanding of societies moral fiber explained beautifully by Dostoyevsky   His characters are loquacious with flaws and prejudices   The story follows the psychological journey of Raskolnikov as he commits murder of a old   miserable scrooge like pawnbroker who spreads nothing but misery around her   He considers the murder a service to the people but realizes he has taken a life of another human being  but he never really admits to the remorse in the novel   It seems like Dostoyevsky wanted to create somewhat absolute character and his conscience seems to lie in Sonia  a prostitute    a woman he ends up loving more than anything in the world and would repent for her   He is not a underdog whom you would root for but you can definitely end up having sympathy for him as he goes through a treacherous painful journey which affects his sister Dounia and mother and put them through hell   He might not show his love for his family and his friend Razuhumin   but he loves them a great deal and even though he might not repent for his sins completely but he gains appreciation for people he once jeered and angered at   and envisions a better future with less Napoleanic grandeur but more love   There was a time in my life when I couldn t get enough of reading Dostoevsky  Maybe because his books made me think so deeply about being human and how we choose to live our lives  I began with Crime and Punishment  probably the work he is best known for  What I remember is being fascinated by Dostoevsky s brilliant understanding of human nature  I remember thinking what a deep study this book was  an incredible examination of a man who commits murder and how he is  punished  for it  I remember thinking that here was a master storyteller  Not only able to create complex characters  but able to take the reader deeply inside a character s mind  Best of all  I remember that I would stop reading periodically and think  not a mindless read  but an absorbing one   This was difficult to start  but well worth the effort   It s been about a decade and I still remember this book so vividly  The character is so well drawn that you become paranoid while reading  almost as if you had committed the crime  I remember an acquaintance comparing himself to Raskolnikov in my yearbook  If you haven t yet read this classic  you should  There is a reason it has stood the test of time    vllliyi    kittnnu kittttiy sv   nnaabhrnn petttti ettukkunnvne kllll

mnsaakssi tnne aann      Crime and Punishmentpresents its readers with a mystery  Why did Raskolnikov kill the old pawn broker woman  Several explanations are offered  He s poor and he needed the money  He was temporarily insane  The Devil made him do it  Raskolnikov s mind is certainly muddled  On the one hand  he thinks killing her is actually a moral act in an ultra utilitarian sort of way  Because she is an evil person who beats her sister and cheats her customers  the world would be a better place without her  Raskolnikov could then use the money she hoards to help the poor  He thinks he d be saving dozens of lives by taking just one Additionally  he thinks of himself as the next Napoleon  When you kill one person  you re a murderer  but if you kill thousands you re a national hero  Rules  he reasons  are made for the commoners  Great men are above the law  This line of reasoning no doubt inspired the creation of Nietzsche s superman Raskolnikov also sees himself as a pawn of fate  He happens to learn that the pawnbroker hoards money  Then  by chance  he also learns that she ll be home alone at a certain time  He finds meaning in these coincidences and thinks it must be fate  He plans out how to kill her and goes through with it as if following a script  Other characters offer the opinion that crime is caused by the environment or a person s nature After actually committing the deed however  he finds that his abstract ideas clash with reality  Overwhelmed with guilt  he falls ill and goes around St  Petersburg in a delirious state talking to himself and returning to the scene of the crime  He almost gets caught several times  but evades suspicion with the help of coincidence and the fact that nobody can believe he d actually commit murder Raskolnikov s character isn t very sympathetic  He s very irritable and treats his friends and family poorly  I found myself wanting him to get caught sooner  The psychologically talented police inspector Porfiry is a much more admirable character who seems to know Raskolnikov better than he knows himself  Dostoevsky s examination of philosophical ideas and psychological states is by no means a light read  but one well worth it  Oh  Fyodor Who else could keep me up and awake night after night  even though I promise myself every morning to go to bed at a decent hour Who else can create such authentic human emotions that I feel I m experiencing all of them myself Who else would make me subject my kids to dinners of grilled cheese sandwiches  scrambled eggs  or frozen waffles just to spend more time with you There is no one else  Only you  This is my first Dostoevsky and I have always wanted to read a Russian author  I really quite enjoyed this and I am now keen to read more I read it last year so this book isn t quite fresh enough on my mind to do a lengthy review  I m not an English Literature student either so I m not going to go into an in depth review of this book  though I would have thought it would make a very good subject for one I did start reading this a long time ago when I was about 15 I suppose and got   not bored with it I suppose but lost patience with all the names  Now I m a slightly more patient reader and understand a bit more about Russian name giving and that   I found it a lot easier to get along with It is basically a rather simple sounding story  Raskolnikov  a student down on his luck   living in poverty  decides to murder a pawn broker in order to steal her riches  He plans it in the greatest detail  The story of Crime and Punishment is how Raskolnikov lives with himself afterwards It is a deeply psychological book and the characters portrayed are so real it is almost frightening  And that is what takes a simple story of a crime committed  into a much deeper  much more complicated one  Quite the page turner after 200 pages or so  Some stray thoughts   Raskolnikov s mom was the mom est mom ever  I felt like I was reading about my own mom  It was interesting that they Raskolnikov  and Dostoyevsky  wrote about  the extraordinary man  in 1866  30 years before Nietzsche wrote about the Ubermensch   How this book managed to have a happy ending was quite a feat  I feel like  view spoiler  Porfiry should have had received the final confession  or at least was in the room when it happened  He worked so hard for it   hide spoiler    Dounia  3  Sonia  3  Razumihin  3  Pulcheria Alexandrovna  3  3  3 I thought this was quite the great translation of the original text  Crime and Punishment tells the tale of a young Russian student named Raskolnikov  who plots and executes a murder  What is interesting is the act itself is probably less than a quarter of the story  the remainder of the book focuses on Rask attempting to come to terms with his actions  There are many other characters that you will meet throughout this story  and they each represent or carry a certain philosophical idea but without becoming cartoonish caricatures  This creates an interesting pool of conflicting values that will keep you gripped til the very last page  This is one of those books that once you finish  you are left in a state if utter confusion because you don t know what the fuck you had been doing with your life before picking up this godsend of a book This had been on my to read list for a long time  I finally got around to reading it after finding out it was free on the kindle  heh  I m a cheapskate   At first  trying to get into this book was not that difficult because Dostoevsky has such a story telling like prose  that the words seem to blend into a movie in your head  The only drawback for me  since I am not really familiar with Russian culture  was with the Russian nickname system  NOTE to to selfRodion Romanovitch   RaskolnikovDounia   Avdotya Romanova Sonia   Sofya SemyonovnaRazumihin   Dmitry ProkofychAnd the damnable Svidrigailov is just Svidrigailov The spelling of the Russian nicknames varies depending on the book copies  For example  Dounia has been spelled as  Dunya  in other translations Nonetheless  Russian lit has turned out to be quiet surprising  I was hooked on this novel for 2 weeks  Yes  it s a little long  but each page was definitely not a waste or redundant  This isn t your kind of action  intense killing and violent kind of novel  Well  because with a suggestive title like  Crime and Punishment   one would assume it would cover macabre events and other such crimes  Lol  never have I been so wrong  It s more like thriller suspense  and just the quintessence of what a true chef d oeuvre is  Did I mention it also throws in enough French phrases so  by the end of the novel  you and Google Translate are best friends  I hope so  A little draw back  without spoiling anything I hope  is that I found the ending a little too perfect  Like everything was meant to be in a good way  But Dostoevsky does leave us a shadow of doubt   which you ll have to read and find out for yourself  Apart from its confusing names and a little mundane events  I found the book psychologically stimulating  Not the kind of mental stimulation you d get after doing math problems  but the  holy fuck what is this mastermind of an author planning next  All adjectives pertaining to Dostoevsky are well deserved  of course Since brevity is the soul of the wit  I will be brief  READ THIS BOOK That is all  This one ranks at the top of the list for Classic Books I have read  Technically  I listened to it  narrated by Anthony Heald who was fantastic as well  and if anything this format probably enhanced my experience as the book is a surprisingly long one  I own a paperback copy as well and it has deceptively small font and thin pages  In trying to make a modern story comparison  the story  No Country for Old Men  comes to mind  This is probably not a very good comparison on the surface but the more I think about it  the more similar they seem to me  And I will qualify that statement by adding that I have only seen the movie No Country  haven t read the book  yet  In both stories we have relatively long periods where not much action happens interrupted by sudden brutality  and the violence in these two stories is both different and similar In Crime and Punishment  the violence and depravity going on here gives you a very real and un sugar coated look at what I presume life in Russia in the 1800 s must have been like for a lot of people  In this way the violence kind of characterizes the society in which it takes place  There is a quote by writer Erik Larson which comes to mind  and I am going to mangle it but it goes something like  murder is a uniquely interesting crime because it gives a more unique insight to the culture of its time and place than any other crime does   I think it is very applicable here  Likewise in No Country  the narration from the sheriff who is pursuing the villain in that story has some really interesting things to say about violence in a modern America Conversely  Dostoyevsky gives an incredibly believable and thorough portrayal of a medium sized cast of characters  This makes the violence considerably more impactful on an emotional level  although this story lacks the sustained tension that No Country has with the continual pursuit and flight of the characters involved in that story Setting aside the comparison to No Country  the story presents an interesting take on  moral superiority  and how killers in history are celebrated or reviled based on whether they were successful in their ultimate goals  and whether those goals are considered honorable in hindsight  This concept has a lot of inter relation to personal pride and a person s conscience  and in this way the story has several parallels to  Pride and Prejudice   another story which I have watched on film but have not read yet   But you have things like people marrying for money  and others who would sooner undertake drastic alternatives  You have characters who DO have a conscience  no matter how much they seem to act otherwise  But I digress An interesting summary I didn t know that I set out to write is that this book makes a good hybrid story between Pride   Prejudice and No Country for Old Men  I will definitely read more Dostoeyevsky  Buyuk keyif alarak okudum  bitmesine bildigin uzuldum  Psikolojik cozumlemeler iceren romanlari zaten cok severim ama itiraf etmeliyim ki bu bambaskaydi  Raskolnikov un vicdan muhasebelerinden cok etkilendim  Okurken roman karakterleriyle sanki karsilikli sohbet ediyormuz gibi hissettim    tabii ki bu Dostoyevski nin ustaligi  Dostoyevsky questions human morality in an absolutely gripping tale so profoundly that even after hundreds of years it still has direct relevance to our society  Murderers live in every continent  country  and state  But what brings one to murder  What kind of a human can succumb to murder another  It is absolutely fascinating to think through Raskolnikov s thoughts  and watch his moral development  Dostoyevsky makes the reader question his own ethics and previous judgments not only on murder  but on the pursuit of truth  beauty  and unchangeable wisdom  Clearly  there are many different paths to find the truth and live it  One can redeem himself after crime  through punishment  and still obtain happiness   I don t have any energy to read it now  but I loved it when I was young   I m not sure how it is that I made it through high school and college without reading so many of the classics  but rest assured  it wasn t because I failed to complete an assignment  I guess my English and lit teachers had more eclectic tastes  because I am forever embarrassed to admit yet another title that I ve not read  I am working to remedy that  however  and completing this monster novel has given me renewed confidence  Let me begin by saying how surprisingly accessible this was for me  I expected a little more difficulty given that the book is a translation  is incredibly lengthy  and that it was written nearly 150 years ago  but I found it both manageable and enjoyable  Because Rodya talks to himself  the book is rich in dialogue   a factor that always speeds reading for me  I was likewise intrigued by the constant internal struggles  emotional and mental  that plague the main character   primarily because it highlighted my own inner struggle with deciding whether or not I should sympathize with this particular protagonist  In the end  I couldn t help but do so  though with a heavy dose of pity Without giving it away  I will say that I found the ending to be extremely satisfying  There were so many different ways this novel could have concluded  as many as there are possible directions in anyone s life   but I am grateful to Dostoevsky for choosing the one that he did  I really did love this book  and I hope to read more by Dostoevsky in the future  khtb  ly bwd  dstn  ly bwd  prdkht shkhSyt h  ly bwd  dr khl ldht brdm z

Dostoevsky s  Crime and Punishment  and  Notes from Underground  are his most popular and famous works  And deservedly so  Dostoevsky s  Brothers Karamazov   on the other hand  is his most critically acclaimed work  regarded by many as the best novel ever written  And deservedly so  While  Brothers Karamazov  is Dostoevsky s longest  but also best  most subtle  and complex work  Crime and Punishment and  Notes from Underground  are shorter  easier to read  and more entertaining  This is not to put down the other two books  I place  Brothers Karamazov  above the other two only because it is arguably the best book ever written  and only the best of many of Dostoevsky s masterpieces  Crime and Punishment is another masterpiece and a great book  As mentioned  Crime and Punishment may be Dostoevsky s most readable and entertaining longer novel  It is by far the best psychological study I have read  and owes much of its entertainment value to the psychological insight it presents  Then the question may be  psychological insight into what  Well  nothing less than that of an intellectual murderer  The fun of the novel is in the psychological collapse of the protagonist s mind  as he slowly becomes more and more obsessed and paranoid  Some of the thrill is also in the cat and mouse game that the inspector plays with the protagonist  Finally  some additional delight comes from the plot itself  and the actions involved  That being said  this book is not primarily cheap entertainment  although it does well in this department   nor a psychological study  even Freud admired Dostoevsky   but rather it focuses on the philosophical  moral  and religious implications of the actions  the mental states  and the  internal and external  punishments that the protagonist must endure  As most of Dostoevsky s books  this one is essentially about faith  doubt  and rationalism  To conclude  if I would recommend an introduction to my favorite author  Dostoevsky   it would probably be  Crime and Punishment   or  Notes from Underground    This is especially recommended to those who love psychological thrills   Sometimes classics have a reputation for being dry  and I ll admit that in some cases  this is warranted   Crime and Punishment is the farthest thing from dry  I found it absolutely riveting  For one thing  the plot itself is unforgettable  from the moment Raskolnikov does  it  to the climax at the ending  Philosophical ideas are woven throughout the story  with such themes as  can an immoral act be moral if done for lofty reasons   and  can a good person perform an evil act and still be good   This will always be one of my all time favourite books   O PorphurasE Kolase pant  agrupne sou stetheke trigurou Alla den ekhei duname parex makria kai

interest in Russian literature and poetry   After getting through the first few chapters  you will not want to put this book down  This is definitely my favorite book  moral dilemma of the character and the suspense so perfectly written   One of my favorite books  Like Dostoevsky s other novels  the characters are so strongly developed you feel like you know them  and the setting so potently conveyed  you feel you re walking the streets of late nineteenth century St  Petersburg  succumbing to a nervous breakdown after having committed a senseless  yet perfectly understandable   crime   This book truly surprised me  As a classic of Russian literature I was expecting to have to really roll my sleeves up for this one but It s a genuine page turner  The characters are vividly portrayed and the reader really cares about their fates There are several subplots that are interesting but do not detract from the main arc concerning Raskolnikov s existential angst  which is harrowingly and yet compassionately described to the reader  There s symbolism galore too and this is a book that will stand several re readings  If I had to make a criticism it would be that the root that Raskolnikov finds out his situation seems a little trite to a modern reader  but this is a book of its time and when this is born in mind  its importance as a work of literature and as a groundbreaking exploration of psychological and philosophical existentialism cannot be overstated   I m very happy  and lucky  that I m able to read in russian  because in my opinion tough classic novels  such as this one  need to be read in the language they were written  so that the reader could experience the book in its full beauty  The reason it took me so long to finish this book is that after reading a couple of chapters  questions just started popping up in my head I needed to stop and digest the content  A student driven by his  Extraordinary Man Theory  murders an old woman and ends up suffering the consequences throughout the whole story  A very interesting concept indeed  No wonder it s hard to understand the true reason of such behavior murdering  raping etc   But nonetheless  no one has the right to take a life  As Raskolnikov said himself when he was questioned by Porfiry   If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake  That will be punishment as well as the prison   His own mind became a prison to him  I believe inner suffering is more painful than physical for humans  In the beginning I actually felt bad for his family and loved ones  Especially his mother and sister  Raskolnikov put them through pain and misery they didn t deserve  But in the end  when he was sent to Siberia  he finally found redemption  Redemption through love  Well it does seem like a happy ending but it will be very hard for Raskolnikov to start a new life while carrying a heavy burden  He s very lucky he met a woman like Sonya  May they find peace in their hearts together     This book isn t a walk in the park  I would recommend it to everyone  Skip your fifth time  Twilight  reading  I know your obsessed  D  and grab something more serious  Trust me  you won t be disappointed   rwy  mn wl Hrf fyh l  khr Hrf fyh tdhshk wtfkr fyh kthyr rwy   Zym  jd I have just finished it and I can t wait to start it all over again  Too good to even consider a two liner on Goodreads  Should be discussed for hours over the best vodka tonic you can muster  Right  well I m not going to write much about this  as I certainly am not qualified to pass judgement on Crime and Punishment  I thoroughly enjoyed the way that the whole book pretty much followed someone s descent into madness  That s enough for me  If you are going through a particularly difficult time in life  somehow angry  suffering from chronic depression anxiety  or the like  or even combinations of any  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK  That monster in your head responsible for annoyances  rage  cringe thoughts  random flashes of bad memories  self hate  anger  depression  anxiety  and etc  will go on a rampage mode  It will burn through your mind SCREAMING PAIN    Unless of course you want to challenge yourself or test your limits  hahahaha The story is generally sad as the characters go through extreme poverty and abuses  Eventually  they rise to better economic status by virtue of luck and personal integrity  Thankfully  it ends with a beautiful  good  and optimistic ending  Which is not what I expecting given that my head is often SCREAMING while reading through the parts and chapters I had not expected this book to have discussions on philosophical ideas between mankind and society  and even onto spiritual aspects  The story felt very deep with various possible representations on the motives  ideas  personalities  and works of the characters  There is that itching urge that there is something more to them than what was written Dark humor snippet  It s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness   the doctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov  What do you think of him   he asked  He will die immediately  This book definitely deserves rereading but probably on a different time in the far future  On a physical book preferably  eBooks are starting to feel really inconvenient somehow  When I was suggested to read the book  Crime and Punishment   I was bit hesitant to do so  because of its stale title  But it only took a reading of few pages to shed my hesitation  I need just one reason to love a book and Crime and Punishment has offered me quite a few  Written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  this book is definitely among one of the more impactful novels I have read  The book presents a deep insight on the negative shade of the human character and on the moral struggle between their right side and the wrong side The Theme   What do you think  would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds    The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin  That is his punishment   The two quotes from the book summarizes the theme  The primary theme of the book is crime  suffering and redemption but the author has unfolded the theme in a thought provoking manner with the aid of eloquent arguments  As far as the book is concerned  the narration and the arguments   and not the story  makes it a classic Raskolnikov  an intelligent destitute youth  who believes in the philosophy that it is right to do wrong against some people for the greater good  dreams himself equivalent to Napoleon and commits a murder  what follows next is his struggle with his self  The moral struggle of Raskolnikov is so beautifully depicted that it arouses the feelings of empathy  pity  hatred  all at once towards him Rating 4 5The Characters and the Scope  The book is filthy rich in terms of characters  Besides the protagonist there are other powerful characters  each very impressionable  There is a beautiful and chaste sister of Raskolnikov who believes in sacrificing self for the well being of others  There is Pyotr Luzhin  a pervert wealthy man who wants to marry a poor girl so that she remains indebted to him  There is a prostitute  Sonya in whom Raskolnikov finds some salvage for his crime  There is a lecher Svidrigailov with his interesting theory on flattery and lechery  There is Razumikhin who symbolises a true friend and then there is an intelligent investigator who lays a moral trap in which Raskolnikov finds himself entangled Dostoyevsky has penned each character with a ferocious intensity  I especially liked the description of the traits of Pyotr Luzhin as and when he entered the story  One can almost hear the noise of the author grinding his teeth in anger while penning this character The only negative about the characters is their mouth filling multi  syllable names Rating 5 5The Flow of the Plot  The plot is set up in the semi lunatic town of St  Petersburg  the town with an air of warm gloominess  The author has at many places used the description of the town and its weather to set the shade of the darkness in the plot  The plot flows quite smoothly and characters come  play their part  create an impact and vanish without making their absence conspicuous Rating 4 5The Language  The book is originally written in Russian and there are many translations available but I suggest the translation by David McDuff  I had chance of reading few pages by another translator and I realised how important a role the translator plays The Language used is rich and lucid  At places the author translator has used legal phrases and native words all of which are explained in the notes section of the book  The language used while describing the characters is vivid  Dialogues between the characters are always meaningful and as a reader I was able to feel the tension whenever Raskolnikov talked to any other character Rating 4 5Overall  Crime and Punishment is a rich book   in terms of philosophy  characters  language and arguments  I suggest that it should be part one s library  I loved this book  I didn t expect to love it  and I didn t start out loving  I hated the protagonist  I found the writing depressing  and I just wanted the story to end  But as it continued on I found myself deeply involved in all the characters  Raskolnikov particularly  and fascinated by his journey and the way he thought about the world  I devoured this book and wanted more of it when it was finished  Dark and fascinating  Overvaldigad  if you really want to know how fyodor dystoyvisky mastered the psychological description of poorness craziness illness  crime  prison and all tough life experiences mentioned in his novels   well  that s bcz he experienced them all in his own personal life  He experienced poorness as he was born withen poor family and in his late life after the death of his 1st wife he had depression and gambiling issues which caused him financal problems to the point that he begged people for money He experienced illness as he had epilepcy and his mother had tuberculosis He experianced crime and prison as his father was murdered  and as he was sentenced for 10 yr  spent 4 yrs of them exiled in siberia with criminals and was released due to his frequent epileptic seizures  This guy biography is an indian movie    And in each one of his novels  he left traces of his own life struggles  His novels are worthy reading for sure  _   dwstwyfsky   l   rf mdh ymkn lshkhS  n yktb b d  n ynthy mn jml khdh  jml y srk Hrfyan wysrqk mn lnwm  jml yqbD  l  qlbk fy kl mr

for me to say anything new or insightful about it  It is  as has been noted in numerous circles  the perfect psychological study of the criminal mind  Books created me since when I reached to my mother s knee  She taught me to read when I was three and the first book I remember reading is that with the dwarf called Rupelstilskin  Books hid me when the world seemed to strange and taught me to understand it  When I read I dive into its universe entirely and I am born again to live a life that I can t experiment otherwise  People would shout and I wouldn t hear them  and for hours after I d have finished the book I would still borrow characteristics of the character whose life I d borrowed When I read I become  again and again  This and Dostoievski s  The Idiot  were extremely disturbing for me as I couldn t understand them  as their characters weren t average or logical  it seemed to me like he was juggling personalities  like the book was constantly shutting me out  I would stop and start again  bored  annoyed and when I d finish I d say  Hey  not fair   because I still can t understand  My mind travels  searches and slowly unravels severall words that I overlooked on the last page where in a moment of extreme agony at the end of a slow subtile tortre  and the joy of purification trough pain  the main character in stripped of all masks and shows us for a second the brightness of an untained soul  This book is an essay about Remorse   the character feels everything but  and the whole book except the ending  is like a desert in what regards that particular emotion  The protagonist lives without remorse   except for the very end  That particular moment when he crashes at Sonya s feet  when he s healed  that s when he feels remorse and the feeling that engulfed me then was like I ve reached the end of the dessert and drank a mouthfull of water In  Crime and Punishment  Raskolnikov doesn t have a plan  he s cornered  weak  and constantly battling inside with his conscience  He tries to understand himself  yet after the fact  He can t he s shaken  he tries to find normality  yet he s secluded  while surrounded by people who are either naive or hostile  The catalizor is the madman Svidrigailov  who  in my opinion becomes for a short precious time the voice of the divine  It is a mixed divine  neither God or the devil  yet a subtle Puppeteer  He comes and chides yet has no desire to actually tip the balance of Raskolnikov s fate  He is always there  in the crowd  growing more impatient  yet always unwiling to take action  He also represents Raskolnikov s conscience  almost saying  I know  can you see me everyday and ignore me    When Raskolnikov finally makes a choice  he tells Dunia  with the purpose of making her depend on him but fails  Here his madness gets a grip on him and he tries to force her  but when he understands she won t love him  he sinks into madness again  when he understands that there is nothing for him in this world anymore and dies In my opinion this book deserves five stars because it is a perfectly made literary jigsaw  You search and search  trying to unserstand Rodyon  and he always changes and matures  getting out of your fingers every time  yet  in the end  when the last piece is in place he strips himself of pride  of theories of his high ideals  and shows us his soul  Comparing this with The Idiot  I ve come with this idea  perhaps most of Dostoievsky s books portray characters lacking a particular feeling  Sadly enough  this particular string of epiphanies came to me in 2011   it would have been a lot more pleasing to have named the book Remorse or Pain The Idiot   but then  perhaps it wouldn t have been that popular    I daren t guess at the author s thoughts  Beste boek over schuldbesef dat ik ooit heb gelezen  Kan en zou eigenlijk ook moeten gelezen worden door iedere christen  Het broeierig  ziek hoofdpersonage wordt goed geschetst  maar vooral het innerlijk proces naar boetedoening toe  wordt schitterend verwoord  Een echte aanrader   Randomly  it is the perfect time in our nation s history for me to read a novel about a poor college student who is driven to steal and murder because of the weight of his debt and paltry job prospects  My first Dostoyevsky book in almost 8 years was worth the wait  I d forgotten how deep inside the mind of his characters Dostoyevsky dove  The circumstances of the driving incident of the narrative came as a bit of a shock and the many side streets that the narrative took as a result were endlessly engrossing  This book left such a profound impression on me that the last three nights I read it I had fever dreams about being the the Raskilnokov s situation and not being able to find a way out  I was curious how I would respond to the christian themes that always seep into Dostoyevsky s work but they were muted and therefore more palatable  A brilliant look into a mind wracked in guilt and the desperate stages of falling into despair  Reading this book i felt so engrossed in it and felt a small affinity with the main character as his thoughts closed in on himself and isolated him from all others around him  This book started out slow and was a challenge to read out loud due to the old language used  however  it moved quickly soon enough  It wasn t as daunting to read as many other people made out  I d heard that it was filled with run on sentences and a complex story line  It really wasn t bad  In fact  it was especially good  Reading the critiques at the end of the book really helpful in understanding hidden messages and potential interpretations  This book is a masterpiece  Everyone who has read Crime and Punishment should  in my opinion  be fascinated by it  The way Dostoyevsky describes Raskolnikov s psyche before and after commiting the crime is amazing  I felt like I was the protagonist  for I completely sunk into the story  A great read from a great mind  I don t have enough words to express my gratitude for this book  Het verhaal gaat over Rodion Romanovitsj Raskolnikov  die een roofmoord pleegt op een oude vrouw  Dostojevski schetst een indringend beeld van een mens  die in conflict raakt met zichzelf  want hoewel Raskolnikov zichzelf aanvankelijk verheven ziet boven andere mensen en de moord dus beschouwt als zijn recht  wordt hij uiteindelijk toch verteerd door schuldgevoelens  Je werpt als lezer een blik in het hoofd van iemand die eigenlijk altijd heel normaal en stabiel leek  maar het ergste doet wat een mens kan doen en dan moet leren omgaan met wat hij gedaan heeft  Je krijgt inzicht in hoe het eigen schuldbewustzijn een mens zwaarder kan straffen dan welke legale straf ook  Je beseft dat niet alleen onze keuzes  maar ook de manier waarop we omgaan met de gevolgen ervan  bepalend is voor wie we zijn  Straf boek dit  zowel inhoudelijk als naar stijl  Het is absoluut geen boek waar je vrolijk van wordt  maar dat moet natuurlijk ook niet Alleszins zonder enige twijfel een aanrader  Ik weet nu al dat ik het ooit nog eens ga herlezen  I had read the translation by Sidney Monas written in the 60 s  It was an excellent translation and made the book very readable  However  such modern language was used that it sometimes felt like the book couldn t have been written in the 1800 s I started out thinking that the author was terrible  The whole thing was written like the guy was either geeked on caffeine or coke  However  I soon started to read the book obsessively  Unbeknownst to me  I became darker and darker  My boy friend and loved ones started to comment on my mood  Finally  once I had finished the book  I was in a wretched depression  Ignorantly enough  in my darkness  I wasn t able to connect the book to my emotional state  It wasn t until about a month later  when my depression had cleared  that I realized it was connected to the book From that point on  I ve deemed this book one of the best I have ever read  I could not believe how deeply it penetrated into my psyche and effected my state of being and disposition towards life  Definitely worth the read  Great translation  Sidney Monas  I wonder if any other translator could have done as good of a job    Read this at the start of my Russian period in my teens  and it affected the way I viewed everything else  Despite its age it was so readable  I hadn t realised that an author could draw so much from his characters knt  rf nk bn mtnk  w htTl  dyn  my   Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  I find this book absolutely fascinating  not about the crime because that is absolutely horrible  Yet  I find it a wonderful book because it is written and made of truth  The main character committed a crime  In the world I live in  crime demands punishment  but most people run from it  That is exactly what he did  He ran  Yet  his conscience haunted him wherever he went until   well  I can t say   The truth will set you free   I believe that is one of the main ideas behind this book  one of the themes and that theme is carried on in everyday life  Not only is this a good book  but it also based on everyday life  When we commit crimes  they need punished  However  sometimes the inward punishment is worse than what happens on the outside  One might be physically put in prison and then released once their term is over  but unless they have made it right on the inside  they will not be released from the internal torment  However  it does not end on that note  It also has a theme of sticking with each other  not giving up on them  When you love and  or care about someone  do not let them slip away  Keep them close and help them through the tough times Filled with thought provoking questions  this book will not only fill your hours with good literature  but it will also make your mind think to answer the questions for yourself  That is why I like this book because it makes you think and ponder some very tough questions   This is the translation I

out this book on the iBooks Store  https   itunes apple com us book crim    Entra entre mis favoritos de los clasicos  a pesar de lo pesado  cabe decir  por momentos pense que no lo terminaria pero las situaciones que van sucediendo dentro de la trama logran atraparte tanto que uno solo logra seguir y seguir leyendo  Crimen y Castigo es un reflejo de nuestra sociedad moderna  de como el poder aplasta a la clase pobre que se ve angustiada y triste  sin ver una salida mas que el de lastimar para sobrevivir  Es el reflejo de la desesperacion de un hombre por salir de la miseria y luego el miedo y el terror que enfrenta al verse perseguido a veces por sus propios pensamientos debido al pecado que ha cometido y luego por sus mismas justificaciones  No hay personaje mas sufrido que Rodia y tampoco personaje tan santo como el Sonia a pesar del cruel destino que le depara la vida  Adore al amigo de Rodia  muy estridente pero fiel  hasta pena me daba porque Rodia se comportaba como un cretino  Dunia  otra bella santa  la hermana perfecta y capaz de sacrificarse asi misma por su adorado hermano Son cosas que hoy en dia vemos pero no con la frecuencia habitual  sin embargo  estan ahi  One of the greatest novels of all time  incredibly realsitic  hasn t dated at all  very modern  I loved this book a lot more than I thought I would  Although it was a little difficult to get into at first I was amazed at how modern it felt  I was surprised by how much of a love story it was too  I must say that the passages after the crime did make me feel incredibly tense  the author really captured that feeling of adrenaline that accompanies that sort of guilt  I found those sections pretty difficult to read  I was shocked at how lenient the sentence was   although my husband pointed out that it was hard labor and in Siberia so they probably expected them to die anyway  Really enjoyed this   Not only one of my favorite books of all time  but also a book that often enters my consciousness whenever confronting a moral dilemma  or when a morally depraved path is chosen and suffering ensues   It all seemed so tragic at the end of the last chapter  when Rodion looks at Sonya in the courtyard  sees her in such pain  and then turns and walks back up the stairs  But then in the epilogue  Dostoyevsky gives hope that all is not lost as Rodion realizes his love for Sonya and his mind becomes clear again  The last three pages were an uplifting resolution to a story that seemed destined for tragedy   Crime and Punishment is one of my all time favorite books  Dostoevsky manages to paint an amazing picture of post revalutionary russia  and the  dangers  of nihilism  Raskolnikov is one of my favorite tragic heros   One of the few classics I have read and has made me aware about the difference between junk and art  I am an avid junk reader and I won t be stopping it anytime soon  But this book has definitely made me question my choices and have lessened my appetite for bad books  Although this classic appears daunting because of its size  it is certainly worth the time and trouble  The protagonist of Raskolnikov may cause frustration throughout the reading  but Dostoevsky s pure genius is undeniable as he flawlessly enters and analyzes the mind of the schismatic Raskolnikov  Make the effort to plough through it  and C P will not disappoint   My first Dostoyevsky that I read in 1992 when I started my literature studies  All his books you can read over and over again and you always find something new  I remember scenes from this book very well and think about them every now and then  Everyone should read Crime and Punishment  I had heard so many intimidating things  so I was on a mission to get through this book  and it wasn t at all what I had expected  what a roller coaster of an experience  The thing that still gets me is to the degree that I could relate  He says that people of his generation are lazy and don t want to have to work  they want the easy way out    we are still like that    is every generation  I had no idea  I think about it often    it is a different time  but the people  we are all the same  This Russian masterpiece was one of the most compelling novels I ever picked up  It tells the story of down and out Russian middle class Raskalnikov as he murders an old woman to test his theory of the  extraordinary   The story quickly became more than a murder  it was a psychological thriller  Raskalnikov is testing the fact that there are people who  according to conscience  have the right to transgress the will of others but can barely come to terms with his own sin  His humanity is shown through his hesitation and it is pushed to every limit until each shred of his person is broken down for us to analyze  The author took care to tear a character apart to allow readers to truly examine delusions of grandeur   We are reading this for our book club and I look forward to the discussion  This is my first time reading Dostoyevsky  and he certainly captures the human condition and the despair dingy harsh life of poverty in St  Petersburg  I would be curious to know how the different translations of this book influence the reading experience  A lot of the names are allegorical and I will need that explained to me as well as the many themes  some of which I am sure I missed  A long book  but worth reading  What can I say about Raskolnikov which hasn t already been said  A sinner who repents his actions done in a moment of madness  The novel  like all of Dostoievski s works  is infused with the dark passions and the omnipresent concept of  Mother Russia   Suc ve Ceza nin kisaltilmis halini okumustum ancak eserin tamamini okumak istedim  Iletisim in basimi oldukca iyi  yazim hatasi neredeyse sifir  Tercumanin herkesce bilinen basarisi beni de etkiledi  Dostoyevski okuyasiniz varsa bu yayin evini ve tercumani siddetle tavsiye ediyorum   A mediation on right and wrong  C P is the tale of one man s  heroic  attempt to break free from conventional morality   only to fail  The most astonishing thing about the book for myself was the way in which Dostoevsky managed to capture the heart of the criminal with such frightening accuracy   Amazing Dostoevsky    that says it all  You won t like it though if you are the happy type of person  the book is bleak  in a good sense in spite of the fact that the ending brings the promise of redemption   those Russians     I identified far too much with the protagonist  at least I feel like my younger self did  I felt a bit like I was looking back at attitudes I had when I was a teenager  filtered through a crime thriller novel set in the 1800 s  The book drove me to watch a multiplicity of adaptations on DVD  a Soviet one from 1970 which removed all references to aristocracy or class  but played up the poverty  That one had the best Sonja  hands down  Two BBC adaptations  one from 1978 with John Hurt that ended up being my favorite  and a really crappy one from the 90 s with John Sim  My favorite scenes are the one where Sonja and Raskolnikov read the Bible  and everything including Porfiry Petrovich and Svidrigailov  I loved those two characters  and was very happy to roll around in their company a while  Can notions of progress justify killing  Dostoyevsky argues no   resoundingly  I agree with him  I feel that he chose the act of killing because of its dramatic effect  because of its extremity  Raskolinkov s crime appears to symbolize any crime for the sake of  progress  or some  theory  Would I have agreed with Dostoyevsky in my 20 s when I was fueled by ideals and the drive to  change the world   Probably not  Would I have agreed with him if I succeeded in becoming Hegel s  superman  and broken out of the moral fabric imposed on me by society  Of course not  Nevertheless today I think I understand  In fact  I am happy to understand  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel  It has all of the elements that I like such as actions  ideals  beliefs and realism that is expressed through the characters  I am beginning to understand how society was viewed and how it was changing through the thoughts of the younger generation  I do believe that I will read this novel again in the future  This novel was translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky   Why  oh why  did I neglect the classics in school  No matter  I probably enjoy them more now than I would have then  Shocking and raw in its brutality  elegant in its depiction of redemption in the face of complete degradation  Its a fantastic read  quick and stunning in its depth and insight into the mental state of its protagonist  Don t overlook this gem   I really thought this book was going to be a long slog when I started  but was HOOKED from the very first page  Far beyond a typical murder mystery  Dostoyevsky is as brilliant as I hoped he would be  managing to simultaneously paint a picture of the minute  deeply introspective qualities of a particular human being while offering commentary on the broader scope of human experience  on society and human nature at large  Heavy themes  symbolism  and nuance abound  A masterpiece and a delight  Who would have thought that an assigned book in high school would have turned out to be my all time favorite book  Not this girl but it did  For some reason I love Russian authors  This book is the ultimate psychological thriller  I felt my stomach twist up in knots at times while reading  You may not be uplifted by this book  but you will be compelled by it  I thought that Crime and Punishment was an amazingly gripping novel  An entire novel that is supposed to take place over a couple of weeks and that can still maintain suspense and dramatic irony is hard to produce and yet Fyodor Dostoevsky did a fantastic job  With its biblical allusions  color imagery  and wonderful irony Crime and Punishment is a must read  Absolutely loved  I read this book many years ago  I was about 20 and now I m in my early 60s  I ve rated it 5 because I still remember it as the book that got me hooked on literature  My family didn t grow up with books in the house and I found reading for school laborious  My now husband was studing literature at University so I started reading and this book has stayed with me ever since so it must be powerful Russian novels tend to be full of self examination and as that is one of my favourite topics   delving into the human mind   I guess that is why  Be warned  if you don t have similar interests  there is no point in reading this book  Utterly beautiful  I don t think a book has figuratively dropped me as low and lifted me as high as this before  The literal literary bipolar experience Crime and Punishment is a book we read from the vicariously sympathetic perspective of the people who surround and try to help the main character  Raskolnikov  We ache for the people in and around his life just as we pity him as he drifts along in his loveless  joyless torpor  a fog of mental illness  erratic and generally devoid of empathy This is a book about the love hate dialectic that wages war within every single one of us as well as within the people around us  to varying degrees  for various reasons  affecting us in various ways  at various stages  throughout our entire lives  The vicissitudes of 19th century life arise and affect these characters in tragic and humbling fashion  and we respond emotionally with empathy or sympathy depending on our own life experiences  to the usual magical extent characteristic of classic 19th century Russian literature Overwhelmingly this is a book about the possibility of redemption in the absence and presence of its pre requisite conditions  love and empathy  As a moviehttps   www youtube com watch v ahi3p   https   www youtube com watch v d_cjB    A masterpiece  What else can I say  Is just impressive how D is capable of expressing feelings and emotions  as he was living inside all his characters It s amazing  Take a holiday and read it  you need it  is quite long eh eh  This IS a novel in all aspects  Also  this edition is by far the best translation of the original  This well known classic turned out to be one of my favorite reads of all time  Dostoyevsky does a brilliant job driving the reader through the deranged yet very real world of Raskolnikov  Fyodor was able to perfectly depict the cringing mind of a guilty man  describing his paranoid thoughts so well that the reader is left unsure of the reality of the actual setting  Even though I read this book quite a while ago  I can still clearly recall Raskolnikov s paranoid mind racing through the streets of Russia  through conversations with the police  and within his own mind  One of the greatest works of art I ve had my hands on  You haven t read a good book until you ve read this one   I know Dostoevsky is known for his deep insight into human nature  but I m convinced this is the precursor to the modern detective novel  even though it s told from the murderer s point of view   Honestly   I was dumbstruck after finishing the book  It is a literary marvel  a classic masterpiece  It successfully depicts the depths of the human psyche  I am yet to find a novel that depicts a crime and the guilt after committing the crime in such horrendous details as Fyodor Dostoyevsky did in his masterpiece  My personal favourite is Part 2   when Raskolnikov is in a constant state of shock and delirium after committing the crime Conscience is the Killer   If you haven t read this  go out and get it right now  Dostoevsky s most accessible masterpiece  and remember to make sure you have a good translation  One of the best books of all time    hl ymkn  n ykwn Hub lbq qwyan hdhh lqw   yS

a great story about the audio tapes of this book   a thief breaks into his car and steals two things  sneakers and the audio tapes of Crime and Punishment  his body might be floating in the Potomac these days   Dostoevsky s Crime and Punishment is a book that must be read not only because of its importance in the history of literature  but also because of the story  Raskolnikov commits the crime early on in the novel  and it is not until the last chapter that we learn whether or not he will be caught  Suspense is maintained throughout  Meantime  he tortures himself wondering if he is a true suspect  he throws away the little money he has on drunks and prostitutes    not to buy them drinks or use them  but to pay for funerals and food  He sacrifices nearly all to save his sister from a disastrous marriage The characters are rich  the thoughts about good and evil are complex  and there are some memorable lines  including the insult one character throws at her landlady   You vile Prussian chicken leg in a crinoline  The passion of the characters  the view of life in St  Petersburg in the mid 1800 s  the disturbing suggestion of Dostoevsky s antisemitism  not to mention the challenge of keeping track of the Russian names  these are all reasons for reading Crime and Punishment if not for the first time  then again  as I did  Well after living through a power cut  finding the time I could to finish reading this  and nearly losing my mind  I ve finally reached the end of  Crime and Punishment   I d say I d beaten it  but given what it s put me through it may have beaten me all the same  Crime and Punishment  is bloody brilliant  A detective novel without the mystery  as it is told from the criminal s POV  It wasn t at all what I expected it to be  It isn t exactly scary or gory  It is a whirlwind of the main character Raskolnikov s mental  emotional and physical instabilities  It is psychological yet surprisingly simply written for a classic novel  for me anyway  A riveting page turner worthy of all its acclaim  Raskolnikov  an ex student living in poverty in St Petersburg  never really comes across as being unlikable  despite murdering two women at the same time  He does various good deeds throughout the book  such as giving away money to those poorer than himself  despite this  He goes through the motions of his crime  though he doesn t see it as a crime  One of his theories  he constantly mutters to himself  and writes articles  is that human beings   of the extraordinary  liberal kind not taken by order and system   have to go low and commit something considered outside the norm in society and politics  in order to become a revolutionary and aim higher in life for the  good  of mankind  He thinks the women he killed were nothing but worthless louses  But he experiences guilt and madness before and after he commits cold blooded murder  and to him this shows he was not born to become a revolutionary figure  but an ordinary man of ethics trying to get through life like everyone else he knows Much of  Crime and Punishment  is about Raskolnikov suffering the risk of getting caught  his views and theories being challenged  and about the people around him who are affected by his actions Raskolnikov s former university friend Razumikhin is his polar opposite  He is one of my favourite characters   a right chatterbox and an outrageous man of convictions  never giving up on his friends   a great contrast to Raskolnikov s sullen and closed off personality  His sister Dunya is a firm martyr  especially concerning her impoverished brother   perhaps too selfless for her own good  And there s Sonya  a teenage prostitute living in worse conditions than Raskolnikov  with a home life away from her family whom she tries to support  Her stepmother Katerina Ivanovna is losing her mind more and more each day that passes  But Sonya keeps faith and relies on God  even though this could cause her further harm  making her another contrast to Raskolnikov  who is an atheist   I was a little disappointed that she isn t very strong   she s a typical feeble and saintly female   but I suppose Dunya is meant to fill the role of the strong and assertive female character  Sonya may be Raskolnikov s salvation in many ways  something that the police detectives of this novel cannot achieve Oh  and Ilya  Gunpowder  Petrovich is awesome One of the great themes of  Crime and Punishment  that puts it ahead of its time  one I feel I can talk about in an interesting way  by which I mean an original way as far as I know   is a certain view on women in society One character  Svidrigailov  at one point in the story talks to Raskolnikov about how all women can t resist flattery  and that basically any bloke can catch any bird he wants in his net so long as he makes her feel good about herself  thus she is open to being taken advantage of and then tossed aside when the man gets bored with her  Svidrigailov is a villain  in case you didn t guess  I have my theory about the social art of  flattery   Women  especially from the 1800s  live hard lives  They are made to believe that their looks are all that men want from them  and that they need men in order to be whole and happy  regardless of how they live  When they get no compliments from them they feel that something that is beyond their control is their fault  So when a man does pay her compliments    flatters  her  as it were   she feels she is something worthwhile  Someone worth existing  She believes or wants to believe that this man genuinely likes her and thinks her special  This also paints men in a bad and pitying light  as it suggests that they are all manipulative lechers who see women as easy gain for their sexual pleasures   by using flattery they can play the Nice Guy role until they eventually make their conscious or unconscious wants clear  which can be revealed years later  Svidrigailov s theory suggests this unfortunate rift and relationship between the sexes  that men are basically programmed to be unfaithful and unable to resist bare lady skin  and that women are damned if they do and damned if they don t get into loving relationships with men  This leaves women either being seen as stuck up bitches who are  mean  to guys  or as  whores   a hateful word too much overused nowadays  with too much freedom  In the words of Maaka Albarn from  Soul Eater    You accuse women of making assumptions without reason  but what reason do men have for cheating  Of course there are decent and genuinely nice men in the world  and Svidrigailov is making excuses for his actions much in the way Raskolnikov excuses his own  by inventing theories that may or may not be true and may or may not be all that original to begin with  Like a true coward he makes these excuses rather than taking his flaws to heart and working on them in order to change himself  to become a better man  Safe to say that Svidrigailov gets to suffer near the end in a creative and creepy fashion  when we are put into his head for a time  A significant difference between him and the novel s  hero  is that one of them takes the coward s way out of his suffering  Plus  given the number of women who die horribly and are often in situations where they could get raped in  Crime and Punishment   I wouldn t call it a feminist read Indeed the novel isn t perfect  A few characters  such as Luzhin  disappear near the end without much of a finale to their arcs  And it took me a while to get used to the Russian names and nicknames so I could tell each character apart  as some names look very similar to others However  how could a few little things ruin a whole achievement of literature   Crime and Punishment  is a beast of a book that anyone can and should read at least once  even if they don t like classic novels  Gritty  intelligent  unpleasant but unputdownable  and filled with despicable and unforgettable characters   Crime and Punishment  fairly tired me out And I won t stop thinking about it any time soon Final Score  5 5  Psychologie de l assassin   Ces trois mots resument bien le contenu de  Crime et Chatiment   On est plonges dans Saint Petersbourg  et on voit evoluer une ribambelle de personnages tous plus vrais que nature  Raskolnikov  le personnage principal et l assassin  a une theorie qui justifie son acte  Malgre tout  il est parfois difficile de passer de la theorie a l action    et c est une des theses que ce livre defend  Il decrit le chemin psychologique torture du  heros  et c est tout son interet  en lisant ces lignes  on s immerge dans l esprit de l assassin  et on finit presque par le comprendre  C est original et pas si desagreable tant Dostoyevsky rend les personnages et les situations reels  Un classique  Tres original  A lire    Do you understand  sir  do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn   Marmeladov s question came suddenly into his mind   for every man must have somewhere to turn        A bit heavy in Philosophy at times  But so far a good read  It made me ask Had the world been better off without Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili It begins with the decision of an impoverished student  Raskolnikov  to rob and kill a pawnbroker  having justified his decision with the argument that her death will do the world more good than harm  both because she cheats her clients and because the money from the robbery will give him the start he needs to become a great man and ultimately benefit humanity The action of the novel is confined to the day of the murder and a few days following it  during which time  in addition to dealing with a murder investigation led by a clever and intriguing detective who suspects him  Raskolnikov spends time with his mother and sister  who have just come to visit  and with the tragic Marmeladov family  consisting of a drunken father  a consumptive mother  three young children  and an eighteen year old girl who is forced into prostitution in order to support the family There are reasons that this book is considered one of the most celebrated books in Russian literature  And you need to find that out by getting a copy of this dang lit  Can someone lend me a copy of the Idiot please  Dostoevsky walks a fine line between genius and psychopath in this pseudo memoir of the same  The hero of the story  Raskolnikov  tests himself to determine if he is a great man by committing a murder  If I remember correctly  he hypothesizes that a great man would be able to handle it psychologically  I suppose evidence from his experience would indicate that the null hypothesis holds true  You ll have to read it to see what that means  When I read the book in 1999  I had just finished serving as a missionary in Eastern Europe  so I was eager to read something non scriptural  but still brimming with missionary naivete and sweetness  It frightened me to feel so drawn into the mindset of a murderer  His character was written with such richness and authenticity that it was hard not to relate to him  even as his soul spiraled into hell   The more we intellectualize  the more imprisoned we become   Read and liked this in high school  then read and LOVED it for my Dostoevsky class  First of all the translation was superb  it was just bristling with intellectual and psychological intensity  This book is so dense and emotionally riveting  it s the ultimate book to get totally engrossed in and lose yourself in and find new elements as you read it over and over  I guess if there s one flaw it s that Sonya is sort of the cloyingly saintly victim  but all the Russian books I ve read have that character  Lara in Dr  Zhivago  Kitty in Anna Karenina  etc     It began with the socialist doctrine  You know their doctrine  crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more  and nothing more  no other causes admitted   Dostevesky begins by very slowly painting a dark world full of poverty and hopelessness  The the story moves very slowly  v   e   r   y s   l  o  w   l  y in the first two parts  I actually lost the number of times Rashkilonov fell ill during the book  His psychology and morality being the main subject of the book  Then there is fact that each character has three names R  is a good man   a man of golden heart  He doesn t believe he has done anything wrong but is greatly depressed by his condition  He knew after once he got his education  it would be far easier to manage his finaces  it was a question of those first steps which were difficult   A special little theory came in too  a theory of a sort  dividing mankind  you see  into material and superior persons  that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority  who make laws for the rest of mankind  the material  that is      Socrates once said nobody knowingly commits a wrong  Logic though is a slave to passion which in turn is influenced by circumstances  Now R  was living in miserable circumstances  was greatly intelligent and was worried about poverty of his family  He was an atheist and thus his morality doesn t have divine backing   There are no sacred traditions amongst us  especially in the educated class  His extreme sulkiness doesn t help either  Thus when he saw a social parasite of a women   his hatred would have made him believe that she doesn t deserve to live  Till the very end  he was convinced that in killing her he had actually done a great social service and nothing convince him otherwise  This is what  he argued  a great soul in his position would do  His belief in this line of reasoning is so genuine  he actually wrote an article on the subject  This is where extremity of reason can take us to     what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing  but have overstepped the law without thinking about it  He seems to have fancied that he was a genius too  that is  he was convinced of it for a time       or  as Mario Puzo puts it   Behind Every successful man  there is a crime  R s extreme rationalism stands in deep contrast with Sonia s morality mainly derived from religious values  If you keep to old roads you are not likely to be lost  but you won t find anything better either   There are many other interesting things I would not detail  was Dounia tempted by Svidrigalov s offer  How come later deal with his crimes better than R did   but in a nutshell its a great read  Its a masterpiece with a whole world inside   I read this over winter break  I loved it  I think our good friend Fyodor s genius comes through when he creates a character who is a murderer  and yet you sympathize with him  you identify with him  As a novel  I felt it moved far more quickly than  The Brothers Karamazov   The structure is tighter and it is less long winded  there is more suspense and action  But like  Brothers   in my mind at least  the book is just so profound and deep and insightful about human nature  YEAH  Made me Speechless Makes u estimate your life      that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident  even in those nearest and dearest to the victim  from which no living man is exempt  even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion   To go wrong in one s own way is better than to go right in someone else s   One of the best books I have read   deals with human emotions  Psychoanalytic journey   beware not to get swayed by the justifications on crime   D  I couldn t put this down  Although written in the 1860 s  it s a timeless story  There were times that the main character was too emotional and got on my nerves I just wanted to slap him and tell him to get on with it  IT was a good novel i enjoyed it so much   Thinking about this book fills me with lots of thoughts and emotions and it is hard to properly relate them  Yes  it was long and filled with lots of sorrow  but there was a ray of light through it too that surprised me  It had  bad people  who did  good things  and  good people  who did  bad things   there were conflicting motives and obsessive behavior but ultimately it was so very human  in a fallen  shattered sort of way  Broken families  mothers  fathers  just so much sorrow and yet containing hope too  Russia was a horrible place to live and I didn t expect that I would feel sympathy for a murderer  yet there it was  and he wasn t really all that different from anyone else I liked it far more than I thought I would  jz m

realize now I didn t have the capacity to truly appreciate it then  This  along with Pride and Prejudice and Huckleberry Finn  is a book that gets better with every re reading  I m looking forward to coming back to it a third time  I could never forget this book  if I tried  Dostoyevsky truly knows human nature  the way a lion knows it s prey  And describes it with perfection  This is in my top 5 books  A great mind boggle  Dostoevsky s character s are complex and full of surprises  Motifs pop up on every other page of this one  And you ll never guess the ending    Good for those who like a

is just the best book I have read   It is the portrait of how despair and imorality influenciate our actions  and also  the consequences of these actions in our lives and of the ones around  I totally recommend this book  a classic of the literature  I read this book years ago  when I was about 20  At the time I was working at a restaurant  and I d taken to reading when it was slow  A customer came in one night  saw the title in my hands  and said  simply   That book ll change your life   He was right Crime and Punishment is an achievement in writing unlike any other I d known at that time  and probably still holds that position in the canon of works in my head  I don t know another work that so astutely draws you into a protagnist s tortured psychology  you re with Raskolnikov every step of the way    paranoid  terrified  exhausted  confused  It s truly brilliant  C P set the bar for my own literary criticism    it s a book  an achievement  to measure other works against  Dostoevsky has a seemingly magical ability to set the scene  both external  impoversished St  Petersburgh  and internal  Raskolnikov s mind and state of being  I need to read this book again   vor v zakone blin  This is a great book  it really makes you think and I agree with the ideas presented in this book by both the author and Raskolnikov  Dostoyevsky s ideas on poverty  morals  and superiority of certain people are epitomized in this story of a man who to prove to himself that he is a  Napoleon  among peasants  murders an innocent woman and stands idly by as the case is investigated  Raskolnikov begins to think that the police already know his secret  and that they are just toying with him  He confides in a poverty stricken woman  who he begins to love and eventually  coaxes him out of his shell and into confession  to free himself from his burden  Has taken me fifty one years and an English degree to get around to reading this     loved it but had to read in little chunks  Such a dense  layered description of a psychology but what surprised me was the amount of humour  I had in my mind it was an intensely bleak book  hence my foot dragging  but it s not  Loved the sweep of the novel so that although the introspection at times feels claustrophobic as does St Petersburg in the heat  there is a sense of reading about a wider world  Russian 19th century writing at its best  I now wish I souls have read this while in st Petersburg during the summer white nights    For suffering  Rodion Romanovitch  is a great thing   Fyodor Dostoevsky is a man well versed on the subject of suffering  and Crime and Punishment is his bleak ode to it When approaching Crime and Punishment  I had in my head the unfair assumption that what I was about to read would change my life and my way of thinking  This is absolutely no way to greet a new novel  but the legacy of Crime and Punishment is such that one can only assume that it is a work of immense genius  Although I cannot say this is a novel without its faults  it is probably the most thought provoking piece of literature I ve ever read  Dostoevsky  possibly more than any writer I ve encountered before  has a keen insight into the way people think  He expresses in sharp prose what most people would only think about in the most cursory way  Raskolnikov s wild  paranoid  cascading thoughts are like poetry of the neurotic  His  irrational  actions are a golden representation of the self destructive nature of the intellectual suffering from idleness  In my eyes  this is his greatest strength  and in a novel like Crime and Punishment  this strength is an absolutely crucial aspect to what makes it such a timeless story  In Raskolnikov  Dostoevsky created the icon of an alternate universe where man actually  dares   where the intellectual practices the theory he preaches  albeit with disastrous results  He is a figurehead for the folly of the narcissist  a man who foolishly believes he can conquer his own conscience  and his story is a cautionary tale of egotism gone mad  Raskolnikov epitomizes the hate filled loner who is so deeply insecure about his lot in life and indignant towards those with undeserved power  the rich  the old  the moronic  and those who take up fashionable causes  At the same time  Raskolnikov feels a kinship to those who suffer greatly like himself  the noble  abused spirits  In this way  he is a character of great contrast  and one I sympathized with on a number of levels  As a hate filled  anti social man in his early 20 s who admires genuine intellectualism and noble suffering and despises morons in positions of power  someone who doesn t currently attend college and spends almost all of his time in his bedroom  the plight of Raskolnikov  sadly  hit very close to home in this confusing period of my life  Reading Raskolnikov s journey and descent into paranoia is akin to watching a slow death  Indeed  there are parallels between Raskolnikov and Tolstoy s terminally doomed Ivan Ilyich  The intense despair and isolation from humanity that Ivan feels during his final days are mirrored in the suffering of Raskolnikov  who knows his anguish could not be understood by any of his peers  and also that the Sword of Damocles is forever hanging above his head   One moment a spark of hope gleams  the next a sea of despair rages  and always the pain  the pain  always the anguish  the same thing on and in  Dostoevsky s portrayal of a man consumed and ravaged by the consequences of a great mistake is something any neurotic reader can sympathize with  but the fact that the mistake is something as extreme as murder complicates things  It makes the reader hesitant in siding with a killer  but more importantly  he questions the nature of evil by creating a whole cast of characters who are sinful and unlikable in one form or another  Nothing is black and white  and Dostoevsky s even handed characterization is such that an ethical debate is sure to crop up between passionate readers  Is something really only a crime when it betrays one s personal moral code  Are suffering and expiation necessary to life  and can they be good for the soul  Is there rationality in the theory that  superior men  should be allowed to indulge their any desire without the interference of the law  These are just a few of the major questions the novel poses  and certainly not one of them can be answered definitively  Beyond acting as a springboard for intense thought  the novel itself is entertaining  darkly funny  suspenseful  and grim in a very real way  There is nothing particularly fantastic about the narrative  with one exception I ll address later   meaning that the journey of the characters is just bizarre and detailed enough to be true to life without any vulgar indulgence into fantasy  The murder scene  although detail oriented  does not glamorize the violence and is described bluntly to portray the absurdity of the situation and the fog of  temporary insanity  that Raskolnikov finds himself in  Great humor is found in the funeral scene  where Raskolnikov defends the honor of Sonia from the devious Luzhin  and a drunken orgy of hysterics erupts  resulting in the ejection of the consumptive widow  Equally grand suspense is seen in the riveting quasi interrogation of Raskolnikov by the cunning and endlessly interesting Porfiry Petrovitch  The symbolic dream sequences throughout are genuinely haunting  with specific regards to the horse dream  wherein a  thin little sorrel beast  struggles to pull along a large carriage filled with menacing brutish drunkards who brutally and sadistically whip the animal to death  It s undoubtedly the most grim and nightmarish account of cruelty I ve ever read  Crime and Punishment is  however  stronger in its philosophy than it is in plot  Some aspects of the story are superfluous  like Dounia s  affairs  with Luzhin and Svid and much of the material concerning the tubercular Katerina Ivanovna and her destitute children  While it could be argued that these are  in part  aids in characterizing Raskolnikov  this is only partly true  Instead of feeling like they re rounding out the story or adding meat to the bones  these portions come across as being mostly filler  bogging down what could have been a shorter and more thematically effective work  It s not that these parts are particularly dry or tedious  but they pale in comparison to the dramatic ground unearthed by Raskalnikov s crime  Basically  when the novel strays too far away from Raskolnikov  the heart and soul of the story is lost  Another small gripe  and I may be in the minority on this point  but I found the relationship between Raskolnikov and Sonia to be unnatural to an extent and used as a tool to draw Raskolnikov towards redemption  I can certainly see why he is attracted to Sonia  noble and abused  his type   but her sudden and undying devotion to him is dubious at best  even considering her penchant for sacrifice  This may just be one of those things the reader has to swallow without question  but it doesn t exactly sit right with me  Their relationship leads us to the redemptive ending  which I m still not sure about  I found the epilogue to be bizarre in its brevity  and the optimism expressed in the very end did not exactly sit comfortably after 500 pages of anguish  I understand that imprisonment in Siberia gave Raskolnikov  fresh air   a new perspective and atmosphere   but it came off as gently forced  Despite whatever comparatively minor faults exist in the plotting  Crime and Punishment is a thematically dense work without being at all pretentious or difficult to read  and that is the source of its greatness  Dostoevsky s coherence belies just how deeply thought and felt every page is  It is a wise character study from someone brimming with insight and life experience  The author suffered greatly during his lifetime  and the impact of said suffering was certainly indispensable in creating such a great writer  just as suffering was necessary for Raskolnikov s growth as a person  To say anything more about it may be overkill  so I ll end with a simple recommendation  Read Crime and Punishment  but if possible  read it in a time of inner conflict or anguish  I cannot see a truly happy and content person enjoying it as much as someone who is experiencing the consequences of their own  great mistake    I surprisingly really like this book  I kind of expected it to be wierd and boring cos the books you learn about in school are usually like that  Maybe it was good that I waited to read it way long after my school days  I didn t remember how it ends so I was on the edge the whole time  waiting for someone to finally say  You are the killer   I was thinking about Sonja  how could she fell in love with Raskolnikov so quickly to follow him to Siberia  Is it just because everything is allowed in books or could it happen in real life too  I guess they were just two poor  lost souls needing each other and Sanja knew it from the start  Russians know that Americans read Crime and Punishment  I love this book  It has a gruesome murder scene  The narrator wonderfully follows Raskolnikov through his whole psychological roller coaster ride to confession  It definitely takes a long time to read  but it is worth it  I liked the theme of  resurrection  and how a person can fundamentally change for the better  There is so much to this book  I just can t list it all  This book was serialized  and that s what gives it the grip  The sort you look for in a dimestore thriller  Nietzsche vs  Kierkegaard  Battle of the century as only Dostoevsky can write it  Dostoievski este scriitorul meu favorit  primul pe care mi l am propus sa l citesc integral  Crima si pedeapsa  a fost al doilea roman al sau care mi a picat in maini   primul fiind  Idiotul    si cel pe care l am indragit cel mai mult  in ciuda faptului ca nu e atat de elaborat precum  Demonii    Idiotul   ori  Fratii Karamazov   E totodata una dintre cartile la care revin frecvent in gandurile si intrebarile mele  bulversanta si rafinata in profunzimile analizei psihologice  Ani mai tarziu  m a facut sa scriu asta  https   dianasasarman wordpress com 2    Das Buch ist naturlich bekannt und zahlt zu Recht als Meisterwerk  Aber was mir an dieser gunstigen Ebook Version sehr gut gefallt sind die vielen Fussnoten  die die franzosischen Ausdrucke erklaren  Ich kann namlich gar kein Franzosisch  Das ist schon praktisch  Oh Rodion Raskolnikov  How sad and sick you are  It s quite beautiful isn t it going through this book and wondering what exactly could cause his means to shed blood  It was not until the very end did I figure out what was his meaning to live was for  I do not see Raskolnikov as a psychopath  but a sick young man whose mind was inflicted by this parasite of delusion  Moments of this book touched my soul  Crime and punishment can be analyzed and rationalized in two steps  First is the crime  the murder  the article depicting Raskolnikov s belief in becoming a genius through surpassing the conscience reality of normal men through the act of murder in which he justifies through the slaying of a vile creature  The crime was committed perfectly  Nobody suspects him  nobody has a clue  However  punishment Is what is the true meat and potatoes of this book  The suffering Raskolnikov is amazingly accurate in the case of a criminal with a soul  If psychopaths do not have feelings and Raskolnikov feels constant torment and sickness essentially a living hell  fueled by paranoia  contradictions and loathing then he is not a psycho  The worst punishment of all that I witnessed in this book is admitting to his family and friends his deed  Nothing can be as difficult as that  Imprisonment is a cake walk compared to withholding this terrible secret that gnaws and eats at your very heart and soul  And to be loved  Raskolnikov was loved by so many  yet to bear the cross of crime is the most heavy cross I have ever encountered in my literature and in life  Estaba molesto  me parecia una injusticia  Intente de darle vueltas al asunto pero ni modo  lo unico que obtenia como respuesta era    Luego volvemos    Mi padre no accedio ese dia  asi que tuve que esperar otra semana para volver a la libreria  Queria llevarme una recopilacion de varios libros de Sherlock Holmes en un solo volumen  La semana siguiente  cuando volvimos  ya se habian llevado el libro  No era de sorprender  para ese momento ya habia salido la primera adaptacion de Downey Jr  y se habia avivado el interes en Doyle Aun asi  queria castigar a mi padre y decidi llevarme cualquier otro libro que pareciera interesante  Aun no habia leido a Dostoyevsky  asi que no tenia idea de a que me enfrentaba cuando sostuve esta obra entre mis manos  Lei la contraportada y decidi llevarmela  En el camino de regreso  en las primeras dos paginas del prologo  se hacia un resumen detallado de la trama  Quise decirle a mi padre que se devolviera para intentar cambiar el libro  pero me dije que era absurdo reaccionar asi    Despues de todo  en la contraportada siempre revelan gran parte de la historia   lo que no hacen es decirte el hecho de mayor climax  En fin  leer Crimen y castigo fue un acto de descubrimiento  donde  aun sabiendo el asesinato principal de la obra  me di cuenta de que lo importante ante muchas historias no es precisamente lo que cuentan sino como lo hacen  De hecho  a lo largo de la lectura me puse a dudar seriamente y pense en la posibilidad de que el propio autor hubiese cometido un crimen con sus propias manos o  por lo menos  hubiese conocido a un criminal y lo hubiese interrogado exhaustivamente   lo mismo que hizo Capote para su obra A sangre fria    Claro esta que  al menos para mi  la primera posibilidad era mucho mas interesante    Porque  divagando al respecto  cabria pensar que Crimen y castigo habria sido concebida como una catarsis necesaria para purgar el sentimiento de culpabilidad  Mas aun teniendo en cuenta que generalmente no notamos la realidad detras de lo evidente De cualquier forma  sin importar la principal inspiracion de esta obra  la descripcion interna de los personajes vale mas que la historia misma  Y es lo que caracteriza a Dostoyevsky  haber sido un psicologo sin licencia  Action and consequenceI have long considered Dostoevsky to be the Shakespeare of Russia and always considered  Crime and Punishment  to be his  Hamlet  with its tortured and deliberating protagonist contemplating his way through a tragic epic and  to stretch the comparison   The Brothers Karamazov  his  King Lear   another epic tale of  filial ingratitude  This is my third reading of  Crime and Punishment   the first time reading the Richard Pevear Larissa Volokhonsky translation  and the  Hamlet  parallels continue to a certain extent  In  Hamlet  the hero reasons and procrastinates through five acts and multiple deaths until justice is met  Raskolnikov commits the fatal act early in the story and spends most of 500 pages wrestling with his conscience  and everyone else s  until his transgression is acknowledged and punishment accepted  Raskolnikov even has a Horatio like friend  confidant and survivor of the drama  the enthusiastic and honorable Razumikhin  Yet  Crime and Punishment  is unique to Dostoevsky  It is a thriller of the mind as well as of external action  a thriller of ideas  impulses and philosophies  all at war with each other Although there were undoubtedly previous literary works that dealt with murder and its aftermath  probably none before Dostoevsky probed the inner recesses of the killer s mind with such acuity and the psychological maze he travels until finally accepting the consequences of what he has done  Even people who have never read the novel are familiar with at least certain basic plot elements  Dostoevsky plots and paces the murder as skillfully as anything Hitchcock ever put on film  The dilemma of cleaning up  removing evidence  retracing steps  trying to retrospectively reconstruct the entire crime scene and attempting to determine with certainty who saw what  all of these elements have become cliches in hundreds of subsequent thrillers on the page  stage and screen Yet Dostoevsky s purpose is more far reaching and thematically dense than simply laying out the elements of a murder plot and the ensuing suspense of  will he get caught   or  how will he get caught   Dostoevsky possesses the gift of creating fully dimensional characters that are also inseparable from philosophical stances  Raskolnikov  the quasi nihilist who justifies murder of one human being in the service of a greater benefit to humanity in general  is a soul in torment  His name  Raskolnikov  is derived from the Russian word for split  or schism  The ax is a perfect weapon for this individual who severs himself from humanity  dramatized by his decision to throw the money given to him by a generous stranger into the river  Near the beginning of the novel  he encounters a man in a tavern named Marmeladov  an alcoholic former official drinking himself into a stupor and neglecting his family  Marmeladov personifies the victim and his death from being crushed under the wheels of a carriage is a literalization of his thematic role in the novel  In the last portion of the novel  Raskolnikov has another encounter in a tavern  with Svidrigailov  the depraved former employer of Raskolnikov s sister  who uses his knowledge from overhearing Raskolnikov confess his crime as a threat to hang over his head  Svidrigailov is the polar opposite of Marmeladov  the victimizer who feels compelled to seek victims that will enable him to achieve temporary satisfaction  Raskolnikov sees himself as a victim who feels he needs to become a victimizer in the cause of universal justice Dostoevsky s characters are highly reactive and emotional and his dramas unfold at extremes of human behavior  His prose  rendered with a natural spontaneity by Pevear and Volokohonsky  follows labyrinthine mazes of thought and impulse  like wandering through highly dense yet colorful woods in which the path is sometimes smooth and at others is paved with thickets to eventually reach a level clearing  None of the characters are exempt from being swept up by this whirlpool of a drama  Although Raskolnikov reaches the decision to confess and accept his punishment he continues to separate himself from humanity even in Siberia by chastising himself for his blundering crime rather than sincerely repent until the next to last page when his heart is finally cracked open by Sonya  the meek prostitute who accepts life with faith and an open heart and who has vowed to follow him through his penance  At the very end of the novel  he finally accepts himself as part of humanity and accepts Sonya s religious faith in renewal and regeneration Of course  this comes at the very end of a long and tortuous journey  too intense for many readers who prefer their characters to be either heroic or villainous  Dostoevsky s genius lies in his ability to render humans in all their messy complexity  an awkward mixture of noble and base impulses  Russians are often thought of as highly strung and intense  Dostoevsky s characters are in that sense the most Russian Russians one could ever expect to meet  While his stories could only take place in their fullness on Russian soil  he finds the universal spark in his Russians that characters from all nations possess and continues to speak to us with relevance across the centuries  A novel for forever  Ugh Russian Literature  I think I have like three different Dostoyevsky s on my to read right now  This was my favorite book from AP Lit in high school  When I think  literature   I think Russians  Crimen y Castigo es una novela psicologica de gran intensidad y dramatismo  los personajes nos muestran sus intimos secretos  sus complejidades  su forma de enfrentar los acontecimientos  Es una obra de las que tengo como manual del escritor  hago anotaciones cada vez que la leo  cada ano no puede terminar sin que haya revisado nuevamente varios de sus capitulos   One of those works that feels cleansing  and one of the few long books I ve read in basically two  long  sittings  I remember reading this book  really depressed  in an unlocked classroom in Fayerweather at Columbia just during the ending of Spring Break  I suspect that the Volokhonsky translations is the best  rwyh  ly lrGm

novels are a dreary bunch  Anywho  Rask  what a character  I want to hate him  because Lord knows he s crazy  but on the other hand    I feel bad for him  I was absolutely disgusted when I read the chapter about the mare  I felt so bad  Animal cruelty always gets me  I also had a feeling it was foreshadowing Rask s murders  I do not believe he was correct in his reasoning for taking the pawnbroker s life  or her sister   She obviously had a reason for being the way she was  curmudgeonly and all that  She didn t deserve to die    To be murdered  But does anyone   Well yeah    I can think of some people  I like it so far        Just finished part two  wow  Rask is one strange little man  I didn t see Marmelodov s death coming at all  Jeez  that poor family  Maybe something with happen with Sonia and Rask  but maybe not  cause he s crazy  We ll see       I finished it this morning    Oh my god  one of my new favorites  I can understand why it is a classic  I thought the ending was kind of cheesy though     Love saved them  LOL I really wanted to know what happened with Luzhin in the end    Dostoevsky kinda left me hanging there  Svidrigailov    I still don t know how I feel about him  I m sure glad he didn t do that    But I don t think he should have killed himself  But  I can see why he did       It s been a month since I ve finished this  and I m still thinking about it  Probably because we re supposed to be reading it at school    But anyway  I ve been contemplating all the twists and turns in the novel  and the truth is  Svidrigailov is my favorite character  I m sorry but he is  Pip pip  aamaar prthm dstyybhski paatth  bchr paaNcek aage ekbaar khub aashaa niyye shuru kreo hoNctt kheyyechilaam  shess krte paarini    aar ebaar purottaa prrlaam

myself at a loss to see it s direction  but I am enjoying it every step of the way  Who doesn t love being a fly on the wall of a Russian basket case  I do believe that it will develop more depth as It progresses  So far  I would suggest this to anyone  as it is an easy read as far as classics go      OKAY  SO I HAVE FINISHED READING C P   I am really impressed by the ideas and concepts within this book  Dostoevsky  I must say  is a law maker not a law breaker  a superior rather than a material person  I walk away from this book with a generally satisfied feeling and almost wish that I could read it again  although I must say that it is a little lengthy and that the beginning seems to drag  It is necessary  however  for periods to drag as they are essential to the character development which is incredibly vital to the whole purpose of the story   Although at times it is tedious to get through  I really appreciate Dostoevsky s detailed writing style  He develops the main character wonderfully  and always gives the reader great insight to the inner workings of his characters  mind  On any other book  the ending would be unsatisfying and incomplete  however  it is perfect for this novel  Don t be intimidated by the length of the book  it s definitely worth it  Much to my surprise  this was a thoroughly enjoyable novel  Like Kafka  Dostoevsky focused on the great internal drama  which I find wholly more ingrossing than writers who focus on the setting  While the publication of C P I read was 500 pages  it read like a quick paperback  There s not much more I can say  but  wow  I admit  I probably did a  bad thing  while reading this  I switched between three translations    let me explain  I began with Signet Classic s Sidney Monas Translation  but the book was so old that the pages began to fall out of it  so I returned it after getting about 10  into it  I then checked out a brand new copy of the Penguin Classics Oliver Ready translation from the Brooklyn Public Library  I ll say about 65  of what I read was the Oliver Ready translation  I read the remaining 25  of it through Project Gutenberg  which offered the Constance Garnett translation  The differences were slight  but palpable The cover of Ready s translation for Penguin  really  a most excellent cover     is strewn with praise that this translation has faithfully retained the humor of Dostoyevsky s original  Now  I don t know much about that since I don t  and will probably never  read Russian  but the there is certainly a sense of humor which clearly came through when I was reading the Ready translation  Yet  it was the Monas translation which plunged me into my feverish reading of  Crime and Punishment   so that I could not let go of this book once I began  I can t help but feel that this was an excellent start to this book  and I truly can t imagine a better approach  Yet  the drama of Garnett was incredibly engaging  and it must be said that some of my favorite passages from the novel came from her translation  Hell  I may not be much of a critic  but I loved  em all So  what s there to love  A whole lot  A story of the redemption of a student who becomes so swept away in theory  his theory of supermen  that he attempts to justify murder  What seemed to me to be the focus of C P is the rift between theory and practice  or  the horrors of mere theory in application  Or  it s the righteous individual at odds society  To think  C P predates the horrendous social experiments of the 20th century  In such a way C P is  the  quintessential modern novel  As mass society would begin to grow to proportions never before known  the question remained     how must we control them   Many nations in fear would appeal to that of a Napoleon figure  a leader who would tell the masses what was at stake  who would kill whom in the name of  what  Our protagonist  Raskolnikov  justifies his murder of the old woman and her daughter thusly   The old woman was a mistake perhaps  but she is not what matters  The old woman was only an illness     I was in a hurry to overstep     I didn t kill a human being  but a principle  similarly  in another passage from the Garnett translation  This is a fantastic  gloomy business  a modern case  an incident of to day when the heart of man is troubled  when the phrase is quoted that blood  renews   when comfort is preached as the aim of life  Here we have bookish dreams  a heart unhinged by theories  Here we see resolution in the first stage  but resolution of a special kind  he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime  He forgot to shut the door after him  and murdered two people for a theory   Raskolnikov s journey is long and complicated  In this book there are hardly any epiphantic moments  only slow realizations  All climaxes occur through conversation  namley between Raskolnikov and Porfiry  His gradual development as a result of the steadfastness of his sister  Dunya  and his love  Sonya  is what saves him from utter ruin  while his seemingly aloof nihilistic pseudo character foil  Svidrigailov  makes an unlikely disintegration  falling victim to his own empty way of life  In this book  Dostoyevsky argues for none other than the realization that in no way is the transgression of murder permissible  as this makes for the foundations of a society of The Good  That to be human is to set limits and be faithful to them  and this  friends  is the beginning of society To put it less abstractly  maybe  part of what makes for a healthy constitution is our openness to throw ourselves at someone s feet  to learn from others  and to exercise mercy and forgiveness  to humbly be amongst others  Much like Raskolnikov  many young budding intellects are swept away in juvenile wet dreams of theory and abstract knowledge  thinking that they know it all  overcoming this unhealthy sentiment is  perhaps  the true tendrils of what may be called wisdom  Il percorso di un giovane uomo che commette un delitto che passa dai sensi di colpa e la pazzia    Al suo rinnovamento dopo aver confessato ed ad aver iniziato ad espiare le sue colpe  Una vera rinascita  Un libro fantastico     3 We are all Raskolnikov  Yes  let me say it again  Let it sink in  We are all Raskolnikov I know what I am saying can be taken as madness  Raskolnikov is not only arguably the most famous literary murderer  but he is also arguably a monomaniac elitist schizophrenic  Yet I rest my case  We are all Raskolnikov But don t misunderstand  My view of humanity is really not so grim  Nor is Dostoevsky s  I believe  So let me explain I think what I believe about Raskolnikov can be best likened to Sufjan Stevens  view of John Wayne Gacy  Jr  in his creepy confessional ballad   And in my best behavior I am really just like him Look beneath the floor boards For the secrets I have hid   Stevens  audacity of comparing his own  secrets   his own darkness  his own  sins   to those of a serial killer is admittedly startling  But it is not so much that Stevens has an unreasonable compassion for Gacy  who murdered  possible raped and mutilated a string of teenage boys  Even though Stevens points out a tumultuous childhood   His father was a drinker His mother cried in bed    his fascination with Gacy  while it may involve some compassion  is definitely  something different   It s not about sympathy for all the miserable  despicable devils in our world  it s about sympathy for ourselves  When we feel miserable and despicable ourselves  we can extend our arms and help get ourselves back on our feet And that s exactly how I feel toward Raskolnikov  I don t particularly sympathize with him  no  that is not it  nor do I condone his crimes  certainly no   His  extraordinary man  theories are incredibly muddled and intentionally confuse the reader  He treats others like dirt  In more than one way he appears to be out of his mind  yet I  like  him  Dostoevsky does magic with his storytelling  and I m left to  see  a muted brilliance in Raskolnikov  one mangled by an environmental misery of poverty and drunkness that envelops him  Even when he spits on those who try to help him  notably likeable and  bright  characters Dounia  Sonia and Razumihin   I long to hug Raskolnikov and put an end to his torment  His self imposed darkness  his internal self prisoning is greater and more punishing than any bars and locks  And I want so desperately to believe that we all can undo that darkness and redeem himself Buddhists use the term  samsara  to explain this darkness  Since  sin  is such a loaded term that emphasizes human flaw and implies punishment by an outside force  it is obviously avoided in Buddhist practice  Yet the concept is similar  when stuck in the dire pits of samsara  we listen not to reason and let our own neuroses control us  Even when we are  offered the cross  as Raskolnikov is offered in Crime and Punishment by Sonia  we refuse  We are so stuck in habitual samsaric patterns  more focused on ending suffering and embracing pleasure  or escape   that we can t get out  Buddhists believe  though  that we can pull ourselves out of samsara with meaningful and reflective practice  that we can control our negative  self harming  and often directly or indirectly other harming  emotions  called  klesha   Crime and Punishment certainly is a groundbreaking novel  particularly for its use of psychology  I find it to be a masterwork of plot and pacing and character  To critics who find the book too long  I would say that the book would lose its universal scope and human vision  Without Svidrigailov s perverted sins  without Marmaledov s drunken ones  without Katerina Ivanovna s hysteric ones  Pyotr Petrovitch s self involved sins  or Sonia s self sacrificing ones  Raskolnikov s journey would just be a morality tale about crime and punishment  And as such  it would still have value  for Dostoevsky asks incredibly provoking questions about ethics and morality  it gets the mind literally moving But in its full vision  Crime and Punishment becomes one of the best statements about redemption  a generous extension to humanity that we do not have to be stuck in our habitual  self induced prisons  For this reason  the Epilogue I find to be powerful and necessary  I was surprised to see on this site that the Epilogue is a point of much discussion  I love it  If we are all Raskolnikov  it does not mean that we will all kill pawnbrokers  It only means that we are bound to transgress treacherously against others and ourselves  We are bound to know darkness  We are bound to get stuck  That is a part of being human  So thankfully I know that with the wisdom of Buddhist practice  the love of others in my life  and the forgiveness  and redemption  I can freely offer myself  I know I can get unstuck  as many times as I need to  Dostoevsky says that the  gradual regeneration of a man  is another story altogether  but oh  now there would be one hell of a book  If I don t get to write this one someday  I guess I can always live it  This is my absolute favorite book  I actually own two copies of it  One in paperback and one in supreme expensive hard copy      Paid some big bucks for the hard copy  I think this is the essential understanding of cause and effect  Something alot of people don t learn  This book should be taught at all schools  It is a very valuable lesson  I rarely enjoy reading a book this slow  With that said each word is a pleasure to digest Finally  After years of procrastination  Months and months of reading as slowly as possible  I can now say Crime and Punishment is finished Crime and Punishment is one of the few classics that is actually worthy of the title  More or less a psychological thriller  this book has relevant themes for today s reader  This is a story about poverty  desperation  blind ambitions  and the ultimate good self versus bad self wrestling match This book make my list of books that I am wanting to read on a yearly basis  Maybe next time it won t take me 9 months to read  but then again I won t hold my breath on that either  We had to read this in tenth grade  and I remember only partially understanding it  I m so glad I re read it   it s a masterpiece on the meaning of sin  grace  and redemption  Of course  it is necessary to memorize the multiple names of these characters    that may have been part of the confusion for me in tenth grade  One of my favourite novels of all time  The writing  the pace of the book and the way Dostoievski guides you through the decaying mind of the criminal is masterful  Psychedelic and haunting  Dostoyevsky gives a glimpse inside the mind that is twisted and corrupted enough to commit murder  And yet the arrogant and self absorbed owner of that corrupt mind was a sympathetic character to me  So interesting that his arrest marks the end of his punishment and the beginning of his repentance   mn rw  m qr t    tjsyd ry   llnfs lbshryh w lSr  lzl  byn lkhyr w lshr

in psychology and criminology  great how books can spark an interest like that  huh  The weird part is  it gave me a slightly better understanding of an uncle of mine    such perfectly unexpected happy ending  like a light at the end of a dark tunnel   a rebirth  I like how Dostoyevsky begins the story with logic and theory  shows how that falls apart  and then ends with love and faith  Yes  it s love after all   I bought the kindle version which was free and an audio version from audible com  An excellent novel that explores conscience and shows how it unravels throughout the book  The book deserves its classic status and the quality of Dostoyevsky s writing compares with the very best  Crime and Punishment is the first book that I have read by Dostoyevsky and it won t be long before I read his other classics  In particular  I liked the scenes between Razkolnikov  the murderer  and Pifori  the investigator    This book follows my love for the great classics of the past  The Russian writers write such complex  layered stories  Their names must inspire all things to be complex and analyzed to death  Most of these books from the time frame of the late 1800 s early 1900 s usually deal with those people that are impoverished and those that are not  Each class has some with morals and some without The story centers around a young man who decides to commit a murder  Whether it was inspired due to his station in life which was without any funds to live on  or due to boredom  or due to a psychological belief that certain people are exempt from morals or certain circumstances make it alright with society to commit murder  it was unclear at the end of the book  What was very clear was the guilt he endured due to his action  The book goes through the stages of his guilt  suppressing it  denying it  recognizing it  confessing it and accepting his punishment It was clear that even if he was never caught he would always be punished for his crime  By far  the best book I have ever read  There were moments where I felt sick with anticipation  A truly masterly work of fiction  ou   whad did you expect Mr  Raskolnikov  Very good story  with long dialogues in which flies page after page  I can not remember that I would by bored in some part of the book  It is true that after the murder I was impatient what exactly will happen I liked nervousness of the main character  Mr  Dostoyevsk was very inteligent and perceptive man  I wondering how he managed so many details  This classics should read everyone  Fantastic  i found this book very hard to read  it seemed that i would read a couple of pages  and then i had to put it down to digest all that was happening  but that is what makes it amazing  It is intriguing  superbly written and thought provoking   Amazing Dostoyevski has a huge and considerably profound world in his head which leads him to reflect serious cases  situations  events  fears emotions daily and deeply worries of a person very well adding some routine behaviours and reactions of people  Even in a simple incident or situation  he can show a deep thought or phenomanon  Firstly  I can add that  a book worm is to read Dostoyevski or he would be kind of imperfect upon this book stuff or something    And an autor is to start writing after truely understanding the ephocal inteligence of him  Crime and Punishment was a surprisingly enjoyable book  It was not as difficult to read as I feared it might be  Dostoevsky s writing makes one participate in Raskilnikov s guilt and ultimate punishment  Phenomenal  This is a perfect example of why people consider Dostoyevsky one of the best that Russia ever had and ever will have to offer  A gripping storyline that delves you into the psychology of a sensitive murder  a Dostoyevsky archetype  and his internal struggle with admitting that he did the deed but did so for charitable reasons  Most of the characters are likable and his persuasive and enchanting writing even makes you feel sorry for the criminal  Raskolnikov  from start to finish  This novel has inspired me to read everything else that Dostoyevsky has to offer and I would recommend it to anyone  There are more than enough reviews on Crime and Punishment  so I will confine my review to a concise one The first time I tried to read C P I could not even finish 1 4 of it  I felt that I was not in the mindset to read something that explored philosophical ideas  essentially I felt that the themes in it were too deep for me  In a way  I felt that I was not smart enough to really understand and appreciate the intellectual depths Fyodor explored in his novel  The second time I attempted to read C P  I was intrigued and better yet   I was riveted and engrossed in the novel  Nihilism is also something that I am interested in  and as a Law student   I felt that it appealed to my legal theories and education more so  The way the themes  characters and plot interlocked was superb  I think it flowed very well and Fyodor does it beautifully Additionally  I did not find this book difficult to read  but I felt at times it was slow  So I understand if someone who is in a rush to read a book  this is not the title for you  However  if you have the time and patience  you will fully grasp and appreciate the genius that is Fyodor  I must add though  that Russian names are very long and quite difficult to remember for an English speaker haha  All in all  An amazing book  that left me questioning and thinking afterwards   Qualifier  I dislike more of the supposed  classics  than I like  I couldn t get through The Scarlett Letter  I think Moby Dick is the worst thing  not just the worst novel  in creation  I think Anna Karinina could be 300 pages shorter  at least   With that said  Crime and Punishment is one of the best things I ve ever read  It s brilliant on a Lolita level  and if you know me  that s saying a lot   I cannot believe it took me this long to read this What makes is great  The psychology  The way the subplots embellish  rather than distract from  the central narrative  mostly   The conflicted feelings Dostoyevsky forces you to have for the protagonist and even some minor characters  I don t know if I can explain it  It s just great  You re going to have to trust me   All the time of reading  and it took awhile reading russian  I felt guilt and was sleeping bad   waiting police to come for me  So deep Dostoyevsky got under my skin  Somehow ties to D Lessing saying that it takes so little  of right influence  for anyone to make kill  It well may be self influence  It was a bit dramatic but still incredible  I felt like I was reading a soap opera with some AMAZING writing and some fantastic philosophy  No really  You should read it   As a lawyer all i can say tht this book is a masterpeace and cant be surpassed by any other book of the same kind which tries to analyse the psychology of a criminal  This pyschologic novel gives you all about it The dilemmas of the Rasky before getting in action about his crime are also described professionally and clearly  I dont recommend this for the people who doesnt like to read and comprehend pyschologic desperation of a main charachter  Because this novel indicates this heavily  This is Dostoevsky s most important work  The shifting of tone and plot gears that occurs about 2 3rds of the way through this novel is pure genius and will stay with the reader forever   Dostoyevsky had a lot to say and he said it all in eloquence  much of which I feel was captured in this translation  I felt like I got to know each of the characters and catch a glimpse at life in St  Petersburg during the time of the story  This is a worthwhile read for those who enjoy literature for its art as well as anyone looking for a complex story   An incredibly pleasant surprise  I was thinking of it as a book that I had to read it to be a real reader  but I was completely taken aback at how accessible  gripping  and relevant it is  I read it on the beaches of Mexico this summer and it oddly worked quite well as a  beach read   An intelligently written  highly philosophical cat and mouse game that questions our concept of morality and highlights the often violent seeming and immoral criteria that we use to select our heroes   Freakin  awesome  I read this book to be more literary  to make myself  smarter   Lame reason for reading a book  I know  But lame reason or no  it was great  Personally  I felt I identified quite a bit with the protagonist and it made me a bit uneasy  Russian names turned out to be a little confusing for me  Also  I had attempted to read it once before and stopped reading a hundred pages in    I guess I was nt ready for it at the time  But be aware  that when the time was nigh I devoured this book  reading it on the toilet  on the bus and in the breakroom  You may find this book painstaking to get through  grasshopper  but I swear it ll all be worth it at the end   Such a good book   such a great story    such a clean line but in the same time a very complicated existance I was struggling in the beginning  I thought that the book was written in a  heavy manner   But when I got to about 100p   got used to Dostoyevsky style  I truly started to appreciate this masterpiece  Brilliant  Author let s you step deep into the killers mind and all the mental struggles and mind games his facing  Wow  What do I write about this book  This man  And what do I write about his unbelievably brilliant understanding of the human nature  I actually physically felt anxious  sick  delirious  I felt like a madman  I felt the hope  light at the end of the tunnel  and the despair  I felt the pain and the suffering  the hunger  the brilliance of the mind  I felt contempt and I felt respect  Oh the hope  Oh Fyodor what must have made you write like this  What must have you been through  One can only imagine    Reading this book in high school is the reason I decided to be a comparative literature major  It is definitely dark  but it is a great character study and fully puts you into the mind of a murderer  Of all the classics in all the world  this book  not this audio version  is my all time favorite of the classics  I am very lucky that I did not have to pick it apart in school and got to enjoy it to simply enjoy it  One of the worlds best and earliest psychological thrillers  A masterpiece of literary fiction  don t read it expecting genre fiction  even though Mystery Writers Of American named it one of the 100 greatest mystery novels ever written  Expect numerous sub plots  page after page of dialogue  and just lots of pages  cuz it s kinda long  So much symbolism that you ll wish you had a tour guide  most of the symbolism went over my head but I still enjoyed the novel  Dostoyevsky pulls you into the setting  giving you a free history and sociology lesson with your novel  making mid 19th Century Russia fascinating  even while convincing you that people aren t that different no matter where or when  The basic plot reminded me of Poe s  The Tell Tale Heart   as this is a clearly disturbed person who murders for no rational reason and then makes himself crazier by way of guilt and paranoia  Novels are only as good as their characters  and this one certainly has them in the killer  his victims  his pursuers  real and imagined   and his loved ones  Let me put this in a very straight forward  and perhaps in a little rude  way   The first few pages will bore you  The start   The story of a guy murdering two women and confessing in the end  That s it    Rasolnikov  you want to kill the old pawnbroker  Go ahead and Kill her already   Why spend 200 pages reading the trivial   Now this is what happens when you ve read lot of lightening speed mystery novels  A piece of advice   Stick to it anyway  The middle   The book speaks to you  in the most weird ways  Marmeladov s blabbering suddenly starts making sense  Like me  if you ve always liked psychology  you are going to love Dostoyevsky  The psychological analysis  the theories  the justifications the inner conflicts and most importantly  the portrayal of characters  You re going to see the underlying human emotions   the self loathing  the hatred  resentment  mother s love  sister s care  a friend s worry  fear  every bit of it  How a man who has just murdered two women intimates you  how the protagonist also becomes antagonist and how you start liking a murderer is just beyond me  A scholar who thinks he s a super human and therefore above or aside from others  Someone who I d hate  And yet  a fear creeps in when he even thinks of giving up  So you re gonna say   All right  I ll go for this ride  I don t like what he s doing  but I understand    Avdotya  the woman I respect  Sacrifice and Tolerance  the reactions when she finds out her own brother is a murderer   Incredible  The crazy Marmeladov s wife   You ll hate and pity her at the same time  How is that even possible  And yet you will  Such is the power of human sensation  Razumihin   A perfect friend  And Sonya  Oh  How much I adore that girl    An angel  The reading of Lazarus   My favorite part  The tears  the anxiety  her sudden excitement infinite faith  his cunning smile   The master of human behaviors does the magic again  At times  you ll realize there are parts you don t understand  But you don t have to  let it be  Someday you will and that would be one of the greatest revelations ever The end   Marvelous  A heart warming tale of redemption  For he who has found love  has found everything   Enough said  I did miss out on a lot of stuff  Like the beautiful mother  the smart inspector  Avodtya s husband  Svidrigailov s sad death and the list goes on  You get the point  Every character is perfectly described and every page is a memory which will be carved in your heart  This could be one of the best books you ll ever read  Or  one of the worst  But never mind  Someday  I hope you will join me P S   This was more of a  Highly Recommended  post rather than a balanced review    But that s how some books are   blkhrh tmwm khrdm yn khtb rw  fkhr khnm tqryb

liudei na  pravo imeiushchikh  i  tvarei drozhashchikh   Dostoyevsky might not have had the turn of phrase of some of his 19th century contemporaries  but as a work of moral and philosophical complexity  together with a truly dramatic narrative  this novel is unsurpassed and remains riveting  I am wondering why non one has turned this into an opera   What can I write about this book that will give it even half the justice is deserves  I will try  this book is like living in the mind and soul of the murderer  with a conscience  who violently struggles with his conflicting feelings over what he did  The book is really an examination of the soul of a man   every man  At many points you see an out to go one way and an out to go another way  I think what separates us are the ways we choose because we know there is evil in every man  I read this book in high school and fortunately I had the most amazing English AP teacher who forced the students to really dissect the book and analyze the character  I highly recommend it for everyone to read  It can be a difficult read so you may want to read with a companion such as Cliffnotes because the symbolism is heavy in the book   Another one of the Russian classics that I originally read as a teenager   and re read for a college Russian lit course Dostoevsky presents a character who deserves absolutely none of our sympathy  Raskolnikov is despicable   and yet as Raskolnikov rationalizes murder  it almost makes sense  You are with him   in his head   as he makes his plans  and you find yourself completely understanding how a man could get from reasonably respectable to murderous simply by  overthinking  In my opinion  this is one of the most brilliant books ever written  A study of psychotic behavior at its finest  Dostoevsky is the master of the novel and a master psychologist  Crime and Punishment is probably his best novel with The Brothers Karamazov  Who can t relate to the struggling student Raskolnikov and his ensuing remorse for the murders he commits  I don t really know what I expected from my belated reading of it  but it was more genuinely suspenseful and gripping than whatever I was expecting  Which is good  because the ideas haven t aged in pristine form  I m also not sure I m convinced of Raskolnikov s motivation for committing the crime in the first place  But what great depictions of introspection  what unforgettable characters  what dialogue  It s an odd thing to say after 629 pages and in light of my withered attention span  but I didn t want it to end   One of my favorite novels of all time  If you read this or any other Russian novel  you must get the Volokhonsky and Pevear translations  They are amazing and all other translations fall flat in comparison  This was an amazing novel written with the thoroughness of the 19th century Russian literary writers  As a psychological thriller it should be considered a must read for those who appreciate the genre   Crime and Punishment  Oxford World s Classics  While I m reading this novel I kept asking myself the same question  Can a human life  no matter how worthless  be sacrificed for some noble ideal   Raskolnikov and I learnt the answer through a very painful process   I always find it difficult to review a great work such as Crime and Punishment    but what I can say is that this novel is absolutely mind boggling  The character development  the plot development    everything is superb and surely yet none can compare to the psychological depth that I found It s amazing  heart wrenching  and thoroughly a novel which explores the extent to which the mind can be twisted  Dostoevsky creates an actual human being in Raskolnikov  he is an insane mixture of hero and villain  Dual personalities    a tangled look into the scattered psyche of a human intellectual with an inhuman theory  I asked my self   Can it be the main character the hero and the villain at the same time  This novel is the epitome of superiority versus the inevitable  His thoughts are to be reckoned with  unchangeable cycles of life  for no human has the capabilities to truly look past his conscious  if there is one present  That is the hero  Dostoevsky explores a depth of the human mind which he himself quite possibly cannot fully comprehend  One of the best books I ve ever read  and I d read it again  Not because of the brilliant prose  translated from Russian  I m sure a lot was lost   nor because of the incredible thematic imagery  although there is much     rather  it s simply the philosophic elements of plot that blow me away  The book goes to the heart of the question of human morality  Me cuesta leer clasicos  sobre todo si ademas son de  lejos   La combinacion de distancia cultural y espacial a veces me supera  Pero aca no  no se porque pero despues de un rato me parecia normal que en el San Petersburgo de antano la gente tomara interes por personas o que apenas conocian  lo declararan en voz alta y despues se pasaran mucho rato ocupadas en hacerse visitas  O que la gente pobre y que no pagaba la renta igual tuviera un sirviente que le lleva comida  Igual el mundo se veia coherente y natural  me imagino que eso es simplemente lo que se llama escribir bien  Svidrigailof se roba la pelicula  Todo su viaje y estadia en la ciudad debiera ser un cuento aparte  con un notable final     su ultimo pasaje en el libro de hecho me recordo un cierto cuento de Salinger  Notabilisima la escena de los suenos que tiene  nunca me gustan las partes oniricas pero en esto voy a hacer la excepcion  De hecho todos los personajes secundarios son mejores que Raskolnikov  que probablemente es el padre  o abuelo  de todos los protagonistas postmodernos   Igual ahora siento un vacio  No se que esperaba de esta novela  pero ciertamente no trae la respuesta a la vida  la muerte y todo lo demas  Y se acaba despues de la parte de  castigo   Dostoievsky deja entrever que la redencion es otra historia  pero supongo que esa nunca la escribio   Wonderful book  Psychology  philosophy  crime  passion   it is all here  It is a book that once read will not be forgotten  The characters are vivid and complex  Their innermost thoughts and feelings are exposed to the reader more completely than almost any other book          In generale  di uomini che la pensino in modo nuovo  anzi che siano appena capaci di dir qualcosa di nuovo  ne nascono pochissimi   perfino strano quanti pochi ne nascano  Un capolavoro  posso solo caldamente consigliarlo  impossibile riassumerlo o sintetizzarlo o votarlo e ancor meno giudicarlo Leggetelo E un suggerimento  saltate tutte le introduzioni pre postfazioni e critiche degli specialisti e se dicenti professori  come posso decrivere il sapore di una ciliegia se non mangiandola o come posso sentire i brividi dell amore se non innamorandomi    it was a book about the excuses that people make for themselves and for others  imaginary

gentle manner  Being a Christian Orthodox  Dostoyevsky stays away from the dogma and allows room for doubt  Descending into human soul s dreadful depths  he doesn t cease to seek the inner beauty everyone has  His main conviction is that love is capable of lifting a person and giving him a real goal in the life If I were asked what book I would read if I had to choose only one  I would answer  Crime and Punishment   Oh Raskolnokov  A poor martyr of an idea you are  If you primarily read modern NYT list best sellers  you are in for a treat  This is quite possibly the greatest book I have ever read  a few others may equal it  but none exceed it  The accomplishment  perhaps the quintessential fiction exploration of the human condition  contemplative and philosophical but still exciting and loaded with action  all draped in that unique russian  something   depth  melancholy  russian ness    I ve put it back on my  to read  list because once is not enough  Not Brothers    but still damn great  Dostoeivsky really was a genius  I am rather interested in the phenomenon of confession and this is a classic meditaion on guilt and confession  as well as redemption  I was 12 years old when I read this book   I was completely taken by the greatness of this book  It was my first ever  more than 200 pages book  to read I remember I couldn t put down the book till I turned to the very last page w  tears running down my face  This book has a special place in my heart  will always do  beautiful story   worth reading  loved it  Muy buena novela  no por nada es un clasico  el autor relata todo el contexto de un asesinato  desde los motivos que tuvo el asesino para llevarlo a cabo hasta su resolucion  Durante el proceso  el autor describe con lujo de detalle los sentimientos  escenarios y personas que influyen en el  Tambien personifica varios pecados capitales como lujuria y soberbia mismos que acaban sucumbiendo ante la bondad y el amor de otros personajes Los dialogos son excelentes  uno que personalmente se me hizo el mejor es el del asesino con su madre cuando se va a despedir  revela el amor indispensable de la madre y no importa lo que sea o haya hecho su hijo  eso no lo cambia  The main character tests his hypothesis that some people are born rebels and therefore above the law  If he succeeds in his crime  then he will be one of the chosen  Instead  he finds himself just another flawed human  Then he finds redemption through the love of a woman   Really succeeds in making the reader feel like he is doing the crime and is going to receive the punishment  Contrived  melodramatic  overly coincidental  and at times sentimental  Crime and Punishment is nonetheless one of the best novels ever written  Amazing  a MUST   Do you believe in Lazarus  rising from the dead     I     I do  Why do you ask all this     You believe it literally     Literally  3rd Read  The most insightful book I have read till now  Everyone needs to experience this book   Aunque no he leido mucho de literatura rusa aun  el placer que tienen por los detalles que lograr meterte tan profundamente en la historia que la llegas a sentir y resonar en tu mente  Termine apreciando a Raskolnikov  de pasar a ser de extraordinario a ordinario aceptando el devenir  Sabes que no terminara bien     Not everyone has what it takes to be Napoleon  That is a main theme of Dostoyevsky s great novel to be sure  but if mere differences of talent were the point  it wouldn t take 500 pages to put it in a literary way  It would suffice to paraphrase Borges who simply pointed out that  many artists take solace in thinking of all the greats who were not admired during their lifetime  while forgetting all the bad artists who were not recognized either   Whether Raskolnikov can get away with it or not is not the real philosophical question of the book  or at least not it s true scope  The concern is with a society where _everyone_ is infected by the idea and ready to try their hand at moral relativity  In that regard I think the dream sequences are the best summaries of Dostoyevsky s feelings but I won t ruin those insights with spoilers  Whatever the truth of the big philosophical questions might be  the book s main pleasure for me is in Dostoyevsky s gaze into the small details of human nature  which is incisive especially when he turns it towards the ickiest corners  Scenes like the the funeral of the hopeless drunk Semyon Marmeladov are priceless and justify the whole book as a masterpiece  Katerina Ivanovna s delusions  Svidrigailov s depravity  Luzhin s pettines are all so full of veracity it is impossible to look away  cringeworthy as they are   As a Christian  I really appreciated Dostoevsky s deconstruction of human nature and the consequences of hubris Watching Raskolnikov s slow descent into madness is eerie  As we listen to him justifying his decision to commit the crime that kick starts the novel  he makes an uncomfortable amount of sense  It s scary to think that  with a little madness  we could follow the same course of action as our story s anti hero It s also a sobering reminder that none of us is above the law  And it s a sobering reminder that we re all part of  us   I read this to discipline my mind when I was going through a painful divorce  And it worked  Then I read several more classics and took piano lessons  It s good to have something substantive to sink into to distract oneself from life s everyday travails  Na tyhle knihy by mela byt jina skala  jak muzu dat pet hvezdicek Dostojevskemu stejne jako Conanovi  Kazdopadne je to opravdu vyborne cteni  zcela aktualni co se tyce atmosfery  psychologie postav i moralni roviny  Navic je to napsane tak dobre  ze to cloveka primo fyzicky ovlivnuje  nekdy bylo docela tezke se odtrhnout a nebo knihu znovu otevrit v predtuse nejhorsiho  Proste ruska skola  vedle Bulgakovovy Marketky urcite nejlepsi s jakou jsem mel dosud cest  I appreciate how Dostoevsky focuses on the power of guilt  I ve never read a character who embodies this emotion in such a realistic manner  Furthermore  we see how Rodya transforms as his guilt compels him to blame others for his crimes  He is criminal  but his behaviors and reasoning are overwhelmingly and primally human  The monster in Rodya is one I would suggest lives in all of us  This seemed like one of the books that most people were forced to read  if not for a class  but by another passionate Dostoyevsky fan or nihilist  And I  for one  loved this book  The character development was subtle throughout  but none of the many facets of Raskolnikov were ignored  The plot was much darker than I was used to  at the time I read it  but this was a darkness that left me wanting to reach the end of the book to see where the light was  I need to read another book by Dostoyevsky to compare his writing style  but the initial style finally grew onto me as the book came to an end  Read it to read something difference  and read it to understand the kind of existentialism nihilism that exists in pretty much everyone  ho divorato tutti i libri di Fedor Dostoevskij  I drammi dell uomo scritti in una delle maniere piu eccelse The Indian father who names his son Gogol  in a book by that name  tells his son to read Russian Literature  I have tried to follow that advice  reading roughly one Big Book of Russian Lit  each year  This year  thanks to the Maine Humanities Council Winter Weekend selection  I read Crime and Punishment  I was not disappointed and  in fact  was amazed at what a good story Dostoyevsky tells  not to mention the deep philosophical issues he addresses  I was also amazed at how much Dostoyevsky foreshadowed the existentialists  especially Nietzsche and Kierkegaard  Next on the list is the Brothers K   An amazing literary work  Although this is clearly a book of ideas  it does so in an unpretentious manner  given that Raskolnikov is based on Dostoievsky himself   It presents different angles through a series of characters and events  and this leaves the reader with the freedom to reflect on what is written  The result is that everyone who reads this book should do so with his wits at hand  as subjective misinterpretation is easily possible  It is also important to read this novel in context of Dostoyevski s time period and surroundings  Though you may or may not agree with the ideas proposed  the literary masterclass alone is worth the trip  I would love to read it in Russian  but given that my knowledge of Russian is nihil  i read the english translation by David McDuff  One of my first introductions to Russian literature  but certainly not my last  A must read  There are many valuable lessons in this book  The characters all develop nicely and the story involves various aspects of personality traits  from the selfish  to the martyr  and more  I loved this book and walked away with a deeper insight into the psychology of a guilty  criminal mind and the one power that can overcome despair  The real lesson is deep  I will not write more than that as I fear revealing too much  A true classic  Have never read anything like this before and I loved it  I thought this would be a difficult read but the translation was great  Only tough part was sometimes keeping track of the different names but other than that it was a very compelling read  one of my 3 favorite books  others being tale of 2 cities by C D and Da Vinci Code by D B the way Dostoevsky portrays the guilt of a young man can not be explained by anyone but him HAVE A COPY OF IT AND READ SOME CHAPTERS WHENEVER I REMEMBER IT I HAVE READ IT 4 times  Let me start by saying I hated the ending  It went from a realistic portrayal of a guilt wrecked murderer to some sort of tragic hero trying to cleanse his conscience accompanied by a nicely idolized Mary Magdalene type girl who seems to have no other occupation in life then  well  being saintly  Luckily  that all happened in a few pages  the last pages to be exact  So I didn t really mind  The writing is as good as everyone said it would be  You  or at least I  really don t really feel for Raskolnikov  you feel Raskolnikov  which can be a slightly upsetting experience  And most likely exactly what makes the book that amazing   Effin  brilliant  How insane must Dostoevsky have been to create something like this  A few hundred pages perhaps needed a bit of editing although I m sensing that this can be said about all those Russians  It s an awesome feeling when you read a classic and see its greatness   shq yn khtbm

like  this is the only work that I eventually returned to as an adult and have read  enjoyed  and re read over and over  I really love this book  Oh my God  Fyodor is outstanding  he gave an elaborate description of the characters  their actions  appearance etal with so much precision  i felt like an unseen observer while reading the story  and the story  superb The best book i ve ever read  Totally fascinating from beginning to end  A psychological detective story  if there ever was one  In 1993  I visited Russia and met with members of the police force in the police station in the district where it took place  They were totally shocked to learn I had read it  much less that I had heard of it  They were also very pleased by the news  but even more so when I told them I had read it in 1960 and not just recently  A very worthwhile read that keeps you wanting to go on to the next chapter immediately  Finally  I did take me a little while to get through it  I kind of just wished I had a long weekend at a coffee shop with this book  I really liked it  but it was kind of a loved but difficult read  Mainly because the nature of the story  I would find my stomach in knots while reading this book because the characters and their thoughts and feelings were so well developed  And even though I knew the whole premise because of the intro I found myself wondering what was next  So is there a second book to this story  I was very pleased to find that Dostoyevsky  having been hailed as one of the greatest authors of all time  is not particularly difficult to read  He develops his characters incredibly well  setting the stage for an incredibly vivid psychological novel  He writes with verve    I found that there was almost never a dull moment throughout its six hundred pages  The personages speak in monologues half the time  especially Raskolnikov  essentially stringing you through their streams of consciousness  It s a stylistic choice that  for the most part  I thoroughly appreciated  Extremely thought provoking  I can t think of much else to say other than that Raskolnikov was a truly mad philosopher that made some good points but was too insane to see that it they clashed with society  A nice story with a very satisfactory ending   ry    mn rwy   l db  l   lm Ht  mn  yn ymkn  n  bd  l Sfh Hqan rwy  yjb  n tqr h  I had been wanting to re read this for ages and just finally made myself do it  I don t know what I was waiting for  I would read this again and again Being a mental health advocate and bipolar  I really get Raskolnikov  Granted  I m not schizophrenic  but I totally understand the disease and many of my symptoms are shared with this diagnosis  Freud said   Dostoevsky cannot be understood without psycholanalysis   He regarded Dostoevsky as one of the greatest literary psychologists in history  second only to Shakespeare The craft that went into the creation of such a unique and tormented character goes without saying  He is beautiful and haunting all in one breath  I could read his thoughts as he would have them   BTW   when I read this in highschool  I totally made my mind up that I was cheated by not having my room be in a turret  I decided then and there that I was destined to own a victorian home   so that I could have a teenage daughter  who  when stuck in her goth phase  could live in a turret  A masterfully written novel  While reading this book  I thought for a while there that I actually was Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  Dostoevsky really makes it possible to place yourself into the position of a mad man and experience his degeneration first hand  This doesn t exactly sound like a lot of fun  but I thought it was an excellent novel  You should read it  When I first read Crime and Punishment in college I enjoyed the book  but read it too quickly  My second reading was at a slower pace and I am totally fascinated with the nuances and the characters   One of the best novels I have yet read  I had to put it down two times because it was so grimy  grizzly  and putrid dark  yet I had to pick it up again two times because I had to know how it would all end  Dostoyevsky is like a doctor assessing the modern human soul and his prescription is nothing but prophetic  Excellent  excellent  Amazing you can wait to complete the book      Perche vivere  A cosa mirare  A cosa aspirare  Vivere solo per esistere  Ma anche prima era pronto a dare mille volte la sua esistenza per un idea  per una speranza  perfino per una fantasia  La sola esistenza era sempre stata troppo poco per lui  aveva sempre voluto di piu  Forse solo per l intensita dei suoi desideri allora si era considerato un uomo a cui era permesso piu che ad altri    Che cosa puo aggiungere la mia piccola opinione a quanto si e gia detto o scritto su un romanzo come questo  La mia vita ne e completamente schiacciata  Ho conosciuto Raskol nikov per la prima volta qualche settimana fa  ha 150 anni  ma se li porta piuttosto bene  E studente fuori sede  a San Pietroburgo  la madre lo mantiene con la pensione del babbo  I soldi  pero  non sono abbastanza  cosi ha lasciato l universita  non paga l affitto e passa tutto il tempo coricato sul divano del suo appartamento  uno squallido abbaino in cui non riesce quasi a stare in piedi  Qui  morso dalla fame  dal freddo e dalla nevrosi  cova torbidi pensieri  sa di essere intelligente e forse destinato a grandi cose  ma la miseria annienta ogni sua ambizione  sa che  se solo avesse 3000 rubli  potrebbe tornare all universita  gettare le prime basi per una sua carriera e offrire una posizione solida alla madre e alla sorella  che tanto ama  Inoltre  sa che quei 3000 rubli sono senza fallo posseduti da una vecchia strozzina  egoista e malvagia       da una parte una vecchietta stupida  balorda  insignificante  cattiva e malata  che non serve a nessuno  anzi e dannosa a tutti  che non sa neanche lei perche vive e che domani comunque morira per conto suo        Dall altra parte  forze giovani  fresche  che vanno perdute inutilmente senza sostegno  e a migliaia  e ovunque  Cento  mille buone azioni e imprese  che si possono organizzare e aggiustare con i soldi della vecchia  destinati al monastero  Centinaia  forse migliaia di esistenze indirizzate sulla giusta strada  decine di famiglie salvate dalla miseria  dalla degradazione  dalla rovina  dal vizio  dagli ospedali per le malattie veneree  e tutto questo con i suoi soldi  Uccidila e prendi i suoi soldi per consacrarti poi con il loro aiuto al servizio di tutta l umanita e della causa comune  che ne pensi  un unico  minuscolo delitto non sara forse espiato da migliaia di buone azioni  Per una sola vita  migliaia di vite salvate dalla putrefazione e dalla corruzione  Una sola morte e cento vite in cambio  dopotutto e aritmetica  E poi che cosa significa  sulla bilancia generale  la vita di questa vecchiaccia tisica  stupida e malvagia  Non piu della vita di un pidocchio  di uno scarafaggio  anzi non vale neppure quella  perche la vecchiaccia e dannosa    Sembra un conto facile  ma la bilancia generale della vita non segue le regole dell aritmetica  Oppure Raskol nikov non sa contare  Qualcosa va storto  nel delitto e nella sua mente  e quello che doveva essere l inizio della sua ascesa alla vita si trasforma invece in una discesa  uno sprofondamento nel gorgo che e dentro di lui e che e la stessa San Pietroburgo  capitale putrida  sfarzosa e corrotta  ricettacolo di profittatori  usurai  ubriaconi  prostitute  affittacamere  ruffiani  pedofili  Raskol nikov si trova intriso fino alle ossa in un mondo di delirio e di sofferenza  di ingiustizia e di perversione  il suo percorso si incrocia con quello di veri angeli e di veri demoni  E il 1865  ma il 2015 non e diverso  Attraverso Raskol nikov ho fatto la conoscenza di altre persone indimenticabili  Sonja Marmeladova  il suo nome  cosi dolce  mi si scioglie in bocca  e non posso non pensare che la salvezza alberghi nel suo parasole bucato   il candido Razumichin  l arguto e buono detective Porfirij  Svidrigajlov dal nerissimo cuore  La vera Vladimirka   la via per la Siberia   e separarmi da loro  Mi rifiuto di credere che Dostoevskij sia stato un uomo come noialtri e che tutto questo non sia che una sua creazione  Una creazione  forse  ma del tipo che infonde la vita e che profuma irresistibilmente di divinita   this book is my favorite  3    Nadie como Dostoyevsky para introducirte en los mas oscuros rincones del hombre Sente se o peso da autoridade que um classico confere  logo ao virar a primeira pagina   Crime e Castigo vs Leitor  ou  grande parte adora o  sera que o compreendo  Fa lo ei meu   Ou  como Nabokov   sera aborrecido  A reter  Dostoievski e dos melhores autores de sempre  igual a Tolstoi  Gogol  Steinbeck  Hamsun  Twain  Dickens  etc  Posto isto  a desconstrucao do mito  nao  nao e dificil distinguir as personagens em funcao dos nomes e a mais recente edicao da Relogio D Agua explica o emprego dos mesmos  e nao  nao e aborrecido  muito pelo contrario  Temos aqui um estudante de Direito  Raskolnikov  que  vivendo em condicoes miseraveis e quase sem meios de subsistencia  vive da caridade alheia   empreende assassinar uma velha usuraria e  logrando tal homicidio  a sua convivencia com o acto que praticou  Durante a narrativa acompanhamos sobretudo Raskolnikov e a sua sucumbencia a doenca fisica e mental  mas tambem as accoes determinantes de algumas personagens  inserindo se nos pequenos desvios a trama principal  Ao longo do livro questionamo nos frequentemente sobre qual a justificacao para cometer crimes  o que se protege com a criminalizacao de certas condutas   e se o castigo punicao se adequa aos crimes A escrita de Dostoevski e rica sem ser demasiado tecnica  desta forma consegue apresentar uma narracao cuidada e bastante fluida  Do estilo melodramatico do autor  perpassa o impacto psicologico da accao pelo leitor  empolgando nos nos trechos mais tensos e deprimindo nos com os mais tristes  O desenrolar da trama surge nos quase instintivamente  em funcao do acompanhamento interior dos personagens e seus sentimentos  conferindo lhes bastante densidade  Assim  como Nabokov reconheceu  a veia dramatica de Dostoievski e muito forte  e os seus livros leem se como se estivessemos a assistir a uma peca  sem ver os actores  conhecendo apenas as suas motivacoes e percurso  Retira se demasiado deste livro e com bastante deleite  pelo que  vou apenas vincar os aspectos que retive mais fortemente apos a leitura  a doenca de Raskolnikov e indissociavel do crime que comete  seja a loucura lucida ou debilidade fisica e social  e em jeito de critica ao sistema de classes russo que o nosso psicopata favorito dividia as pessoas em  vulgares  e  invulgares   sendo quase anedoticas as referencias a mujiques e nobres  e tambem interessante a forma como Dostoievski  reabilita  Raskolnikov  parecendo algo forcado  talvez nao pegue numa segunda leitura   mas funcionando como um alivio para o leitor  Resumindo  Um dos livros a ler antes de morrer  Eagerly awaiting the rest of the group to finish  I won t hate them if they hate it  but I might cry  Inside  I have a bad feeling about the upcoming discussion  I should ve kept the Russians to myself  Too soon  I know better  I m almost in a delirium myself after reading this    damn   Beneath all the ambiguous dreams  the irritable tempers  the somber St  Petersburg streets  there lies a painfully honest humanity  It never shows itself very easily  though  Not when there is so much poverty  so much preoccupation  But even less so when a young man builds himself up with reasons and convictions  blinded from the very human world around him  and in such a hazy state that s what finally brings him to commit a senseless murder  That s the crime  but the true depth of this novel lies in the punishment  And it is this relentless exploration of the man s consciousness  wavering dangerously between concealing the truth and confessing  that constitutes most of the novel  I have to say  this exploration left me in a wordless daze  There is so much suspense and tension in this plot  which masterfully draws together three seemingly distinct storylines  The characters  too  are well drawn and enigmatic enough to leave you feeling alienated with nearly everyone  just like the narrator  And through the absence of his empathy for others  one almost starts to empathize with his character    to understand how one can be swept away by calculations  how one can simultaneously hate and love so fiercely  and most fundamentally  how one cannot live with guilt forever  Powerful  Has left me stunned  lost in thought and nameless feelings     He had not a minute more to lose  He pulled the axe quite out  swung it with both arms  scarcely conscious of himself  and almost without effort  almost mechanically  brought the blunt side down on her head  He seemed not to use his own strength in this  But as soon as he had once brought the axe down  his strength returned to him  It s all about redemption  kids  An intriguing peak into a man pushed to the brink  and the action that leads to a series of events fueled by his inconsolable guilty conscience  He s pushed from one scenario to another through actions  and through his crime he manages to do some good for a family in need   which raises the question  was it really a crime after all  And was the punishment he was inflicting on himself worse than going to prison  With engaging characters  a tragic setting  and the underlying suspense of whether or not Raskolniknov will be apprehended   Crime and Punishment  illuminates questions of morality  judgement  and human existence  I love this book  and the way Dostoyevsky writes  translated beautifully in this edition   If only I spoke Russian and could read the original text  This is not a review I will say this though  The Idiot may lack a substantial storyline   but what makes it such a heartening read is the little burst of rants Fyodor goes into every five pages or so Not much of that here   probably because this was his first book  Plus the alarming nature of the few so rants perhaps makes up for lack of them A thrilling storyline surely  bringing up the age  old conflict between what truly is good and bad and where the line stands   the theme I love about C P is that never does Raskol actually repent his crime   it torments him  brings him to the brink of his sanity and bends him till he breaks   but he doesn t repent it  He believes in this  theory  all through the book  save the very last page   perhaps Fyodor didn t want to end his first book on a depressing note   I llforgive him for that  I would have very much preferred an Alex deLarge s  I repent nothing  end shot but I digress  Raskol is a perplexing character   vain  egoistic  and sadly for me  lacking the nihilism   who decides he is one of the greats and in order to prove that to himself   decides to follow the footsteps of all  Great  men before him   plots to murder  I loved this story  truly   but I wouldn t read it again  The Idiot   I would  but C P   not so much  Maybe the morbid nature of the themes here make up for lack of rambling here   but I don t know I wanted more   SorryNotSorry Li aveva resuscitati l amore  il cuore dell uno racchiudeva infinite fonti di vita per il cuore dell altro  Essi si prefissero di attendere e pazientare  Restavan loro ancora sette anni e fino ad allora quanto intollerabile tormento e quanta infinita felicita  Ma egli era resuscitato  e lo sapeva  e lei viveva soltanto della vita di lui  Crime and Punishment was probably the first dark book that I read and I was totally impressed by the language and the psychological torments of the main character  My only problem  which is common in all his writing  was with the Russian names  I could not believe how many names a person can have   Wow  I read this book back in high school for an independent reading class and it blew me away  The author pulls you into the mind of his main character so thoroughly that you will be regarding everyone with suspicion  I found this story deeply fascinating as a translated idea from our author passed into our protagonist Raskolnikov  Through various sub plots  it all circulates to ideals and what seems to be generational opinion in the 19th century along with various opposition  agreements  and so on  The strongest display of Dostoyevsky s powerful narrative is Raskolnikov s turmoil of dealing with his written and thorough view on the division of the  ordinary  and the  extraordinary   Impressively we consistently see how this corresponds to his crime  The protagonist leads us through a journey through an unveiling discovery of where he stands as a  Napolean esque  figure It wasn t just the ideas that were masterfully portrayed  The emotional turmoil and descent into madness as well as Raskolnikov s questioning of his own character were also brilliant  He shows these post traumatic spells and emotional evasiveness from all acquaintances and overall a strong social distaste growing from before his crime to a heightened level after  From what I noticed  the story isn t merely the crime  but the emotional handling of the killing  If any of you readers are expecting an onslaught of mass murders in a 500 page book you aren t looking in the right direction  Expect mostly the after effect of a serial killing  Above all else you will notice these psychological roller coasters post murder from him that mainly lead toward the negative or docile manner The only real problem I had with the story may be attributed partly to the common writing of the 19th century  but also to Dostoyevsky s relentlessness to boast well thought philosophies without subtlety  I could have done without some of the tangents in the monologues along with some long and tedious side stories and moments  for instance a landlady and Sonya s mother bantering for about a whole chapter   All in all the novel is quite large for the timeline it entails and I noticed some much needed shortening and quickening to the point  I also wasn t too concerned or mightily interested for some mini plots that while thankfully tied into everything  were perhaps dragged too long   spoiler  I also think the ending may have been a bit too upbeat and positive Going back to our protagonist s theory however and my final thoughts  perhaps what struck me the most was Raskolnikov s logic in questioning if it was indeed a crime  of course in line with his theory that he more so saved others than destroyed two in the murder of a  louse  and the innocent witness  Not only this aspect  but as well as the law as a rather questionable and perhaps even weak guideline in moral behavior  Dostoyevsky did not fail in providing a thought provoking narrative  Perhaps he was more of a brilliant philosopher than a writer  at times zoning in on brilliant questioning of morals and food for debate for whole chapters  His writing may have not been the best I have seen craft wise  but he is sure as hell brilliant  A classic in the true sense of the word  The book was great  It seemed really depressing toward the end but I loved the ending  The book was great and to think I wouldn t have read it if it wasn t for AP English  One of the most captivating and engrossing books I have read  From the start  the author builds up the suspense through the most minute details  Even the most mundane activities are described clearly  making you feel that you are living with the characters in the moment  Of course  the title gives away the clue that a crime will be committed  Yet I found myself at the edge of my seat when it actually happened  Such was the effect the writing produced  It was as if I am there and I am watching Raskolnikov as he goes about committing his experiment  the experiment to prove his theory that some mortals are above the law  in fact  they are exceptional  If they were to break a few rules or laws that were binding on mere mortals for the greater good of mankind  it was because they are entitled and privileged to do so  Raskolnikov comes across as a brooding  sulking person who is at times  tormented  and at other times  absolutely indifferent to the hunger and deprivation of his circumstances  And yet  he may unthinkingly and readily help someone who  he thinks  is in more dire need than himself  This is how he gets acquainted with Marmeladov  Katerina Ivanovna and eventually  Sofia  What to say of Sofia  she seems to have a heart made of gold that is untouched and untainted by the filth that she is forced to live in and to embrace as a livelihood  Razumihin proves to be a loyal friend to Raskolnikov and firmly resolves to look after the latter s mother Pulcheria and sister Dounia  Of course  he cannot help falling in love with Dounia  who comes across as remarakably strong willed like her brother  Poor Porfiry Petrovitch fails in his evil designs to ensnare Dounia taking advantage of her poor financial position  Of course  the greatest surprise of all might be Svidrigailov  who is painted as a monster but turns out    well  for that  you must read this remarkable story to find out   a classic  it speaks for itself  the first book that i decided would be my favorite i ll probably write more about it later  it has so much philosophy  theology  and politics wrapped up in it  and at the same time  is surprisingly easy to relate to  we are all humans afterall     This is not a novel This is THE novel   Era evidente que ya no cabia escudarse en melancolias  sufrir pasivamente  so pretexto de que hay problemas que son irresolubles  sino que urgia hacer algo  cuanto antes mejor  Tenia que tomar una decision  fuese la que fuese  o de lo contrario      O de lo contrario  renunciar por completo a la vida   grito de pronto  frenetico    Aceptar mi sino tal cual es  de una vez para siempre  ahogar en mi cuanto llevo dentro  renunciar a todo derecho de obrar  de vivir  de amar   Nabokov wrote Dostoevsky s writing is adolescent   I read a different translation when I was 16 and it was life changing   just what I needed to get through that summer but it remains my favorite book of all time  and this translation is accessible enough that even friends and family frightened by earlier more  flowery  translations have dared to take it up  Mille volte e stato detto quanto Dostoevskij abbia saputo scavare a fondo nell animo umano  aggiungo solo che leggere le sue opere e come aver puntato addosso un occhio che scruta nei recessi dell anima  Il dubbio si insinua in ogni scelta o non scelta che i suoi personaggi compiono  In Delitto e Castigo l uomo e la donna si muovo come in una piece dove una realta claustrofobica non lascia tregua  Il capolavoro  This book was SO SO SO interesting  yet  as one of my friends put it  dense I often found I had to re read passages to double check what I d just understood  and to double check the speaker  I d found myself using a dictionary once or twice to get the meaning of certain key words But ignoring all that  this book kept me interested until the end There were scenes that kept me on the edge between Raskolnikov and his interrogator It was interesting to see the contrast between raskolnikov s actions and his thoughts I d definitely recommend this to anyone  even just for fun   Loved the psychological cat and mouse game that Porfiry Petrovich played with Raskolnikov in questioning accusing  him about his crime  My next favorite book  after Notes From Underground  The storytelling is captivating  The characterization of life in St  Petersburg is superb  and the final two dream sequences color the narrative with an ethereal passion unlike anything else I ve read  If you read this book  you ll see why Dostoyevsky is among the greatest writers  Besides the narration  the dialog  too  is engrossing  Most of the action unfolds over four days  so the timing is compressed  Adding to the tension  the action is compressed further into a single city  This technique of the storytelling accentuates the sense of life in the Russian capital during the 1860 s  One s sympathy is engaged  as the plot unfolds  by the dawning realization that the urban  anonymous life we take for granted now was an unprecedented  frightening and disturbing phenomenon to the people who lived at that time While all the sub plots are jewels in themselves  for me one especially affecting story arc concerns the woman with tuberculosis  which the author depicts with amazing talent  Another striking aspect of the book  for those who live in the vacuous scream that passes for discourse in our modern media  is the author s ability to represent all his characters  opposing lifestyles and opinions in a way that would be fair  even sympathetic  to each person  Dostoyevsky demonstrates this unusual grasp of differing points of view in all his works I ve read  and this singular talent of his makes the difference between a good book and a superb one in every case  I thought the ending was a bit overdone and a tad out of key with the rest of the story  although many readers will disagree with me on that score  Even so    For those who have read it  My favorite character    Svidrigailov  The book exudes an unusual power to draw the sympathies of modern readers onto the special problems of 19th century lives  No  I shouldn t say  special   Rather  it causes you to feel for the people on a highly personal level  Yes  that s it  that s what gives the book its exceptional power   Okudugum en etkileyici ve bagimlilik yaratan roman olabilir  Tekrar tekrar okuyabilirim   Se voce matar uma pessoa que e ruim e muito rica  mas usar seu dinheiro para muitas boas acoes  existe culpa no crime  Mil boas acoes anulam uma ma  Um ser humano tem a permissao de matar  roubar  ou fazer o mal a outro se o fim sera benefico  O fim justifica o meio  Dostoyevsky retrata essas questoes como um genio  Comunista na epoca  em uma Russia miseravel  consumida pela pobreza e pela fome  o autor abordou a injustica de forma fenomenal  Em uma passagem  o personagem diz acreditar na divisao da sociedade em dois tipos de pessoas  as ordinarias e as extraordinarias  As ordinarias sao aquelas que nasceram para servir as regras  as leis e o padrao imposto pela sociedade  As extraordinarias sao pessoas que representarao uma mudanca da estrutura  do padrao e das leis  como Napoleao  Jesus  Darwin     e todas as figuras que foram contra as regras ate entao estabelecidas   O personagem Raskhonikov ainda questiona  se Darwin precisasse matar dezenas ou milhares de pessoas para atingir seu objetivo  suas ideias  considerando que sera um grande favor ao mundo e as geracoes futuras    Ele teria o direito de cometer tais crimes para cumprir seu dever de fazer o bem ao mundo Importantes figuras da historia da civilizacao que tiveram grandes conquistas e ajudaram

mesmo sendo uma ma pessoa  a velha nao deixava de ser um ser humano Livro maravilhoso  This is one of the finest examples of criminal psychology ever explored  With enormous scope  Dostoyevsky dissects poverty  rationalization  the criminal mind  guilt  confession  religion and redemption  It also provides an exquisite look at overwhelming paranoia  A perfect  breathtaking masterpiece  yazildigindan bu yana raskolnikov un oykusu bir kez de benim icin sonlandiginda kisti  geceydi  bir yurt odasindaydim ve 17 yasindaydim  Review at   Mama Kucing Meow   Crime And Punishment by Fyodor DostoeskyReviewed on   23 January 2011There are many interesting and thought provoking sub plots to the main story  like stories of his family  friends and acquaintance  And how everything is entwine to one another What do I think of this book  It s a masterpiece  Dostoevsky managed to bring out the mental anguish face by Raskolnikov when he was contemplating the murder and after the murder  Very dangerous book also as the reasons for the murder which seems so wrong could be viewed in another point which makes the murder seems alright Definitely a book for a serious reader   I ve always been a huge fan of Dostoevsky  and this novel certainly didn t disappoint  Very dark  several scenes of startling  powerful violence  but it s balanced by Raskolnikov s rare but shining moments of transcendence  Long and complex  but definitely worth absorbing  Someday I hope to have the ability to express how I feel about this book    Don t know which translation I read  but after watching a play based on the book  I remembered how much I enjoyed this gripping book  Might actually read it a second time  rare event   high praise   Florencia   just to say that some of the books I am adding to GoodReads   like this one   are books that I knew 20 or 30 years ago   I am arriving to the age where rereading is better than reading   You are still far from that nostalgia    This was the first Dostoyevsky I read a few years ago  I have read several since then and decided it was time for a re read  This time around it absolutely solidifies itself as my all time favorite of his works followed probably second by The Idiot and third Brothers K  I m sure this won t be the last time I pick this book up  The journey into the mind of a maniac  The game of cat and mouse between Raskolnikov and Petrovich  The torment Rodion goes through mentally and physically within himself living with the consequences of murder  Dostoyevsky always does so well in portraying the wretchedness of man and his struggles  He tends to favor characters of the poor  desolute and depraved  I think these common and even base characters versus the upper class and rich characters often used by Tolstoy is why I greatly prefer Dostoyevsky s work   Mon premier Dostoievski et probablement pas le dernier  Un roman presque en dehors du temps  une forme avant gardiste du thriller psychologique   Des personnages tous ciseles qui  dans une trame non moins fine  servent a merveille un propos  une vision  sans l ombre d une lourdeur  A l inverse l histoire regorge de passages vraiment haletants  de suspense  Maintenant  je comprends pourquoi j ai tant entendu parler de cet auteur  c est parce qu il est incontournable  A lire   There is no word to review this novel It s one of the greatest novels I ever read  Reading the title would give an immediate judgement that it ll be about a tangible punishment  However  it s far from being a tangible one  it s an intangible punishment which is ever severer than tangible The depiction of the psychological conflict of Raskolnikoff was written in a way makes you live it as if it s in your mind  While reading Rodia s speech  you can feel the disturbance   clash of thoughts in his mind   his attempt to convince himself he s not guilty   his deed was normal The feeling of uneasy and continual perplexity was the punishment not the jail The writer could depict a state that we all pass through  when we re perplexed with many thoughts in our mind and reach a state where we would wish to cut our head down to get rid of those tortured thoughts I empathized with Rodia and while reading  I I wished he would denounce himself ASAP   in some parts  just to release himself from his confusion  Although I finished it now  I am still clung to it  Mentally  Its after a long time I got to read some terrific characters and such novel and scintillating philosophy in a book  Last time I such an effect from the novel was from The White Tiger For the most part  I found the book quite scintillating  The epilogue though  takes some sheen off from the book at the end Incidentally  I saw Crimes and Misdemeanors while I was reading this book  and both dwell on somewhat similar undercurrents in the story  Review to come  Great book  I reread this in 2004 for another class  I m glad I had to read it again because I felt I caught a lot of things I didn t see the first time  Also  I remember doing a project for this book and finding an image of a weird lady with an axe on Yahoo  I believe it was  Peri_with_an_ax jpg   When I searched for this book by title two John Grisham books preceded it  This is a problem  Modern Pulp and serial writing probably can t touch this  I ve never been one for page turners  I m a slow reader and I read this within a week  The most fun book I ve read  I could not put this book down from the moment I started it  It s amazing how intimidated I was all throughout my high school years by the size of the volumes I would see of C   P when I was totally judging this book by the cover  I m sorry  I had to   Dostoyevsky masterfully weaves character development with cliff hangers  creating a depiction of St  Petersburg that almost makes the city another character of the novel  I went further and sought out filmed interpretations  like BBC s Crime and Punishment 3 part TV mini  series  Starring John Hurt  who you may know from the film version of 1984    This is my third go round with Crime and Punishment  I avoided it for years because everybody told me I MUST read it  and I d LOVE it etc etc  Being stubborn  I decided not to pick it up at all  When I first read it  I was 26  which is maybe too old for your first Dostoevsky encounter  Anyway  I LOVED it  if you haven t read it yet  you absolutely MUST  etc etc  Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is a young student  except that he s dropped out of college  who is living in a crappy neighbourhood in Petersburg and getting poorer and more and more miserable  He sits around brooding  and as a result of the poverty and or the brooding  depending on how you read his motivations  he decides to kill an old pawnbroker  This is not a spoiler   it s the point of the book  Things get out of hand  his plot doesn t come off the way he d hoped  he gets ill  he almost gets caught  he almost gets himself caught on purpose  goes round the town blathering to himself and looking suspicious  There are various   well  I suppose you d say sub plots  but because of the way it unfolds  every character seems centre stage while they re there  Rodya s mother and sister  Dunya  turn up from the provinces  with the sister s rich but nasty fiance  Rodya meets a hopeless old drunk  once a respectable civil servant  who has been reduced to living off his 18 year old daughter s prostitution income   The 18 year old girl is Sonya  who ends up being Rodya s love interest   Rodya s friend is related to the man investigating the murder  The sister s old employer  a truly horrible man  turns up and becomes enmeshed in the plot I don t know how he does it  but it reads really really vividly   honestly  it s like you re right there  even though it s 150 years ago in a faraway country  And this isn t always a good thing   I was dreading reading this again  because I knew bits of it were really distressing  There are various horribly upsetting scenes of child abuse and animal abuse as well as  of course  several violent deaths  also implied but still sickeningly vivid child sexual abuse and suicide  Loads of poverty  degradation  madness and forced prostitution  I find the scene in which you see Sonya s siblings for the last time particularly difficult to read   felt like it would never end  not in a boring way  but in the way you can t take your eyes off some disaster unfolding in real time but feeling like slow motion  Also the various dreams   I was muttering to myself   it s just a dream  it s just a dream   but it still felt horrible  In theory  Rodya has a rationale for his murder   he has written an article in which he explains his theory that there are some geniuses  amazingly special people  for whom everything is permitted  and to whom normal rules do not apply  In the end  he renounces his theory  but long before  as in from the first few pages  it becomes clear that his theory is not what is driving his actions  Similarly  one of the characters is always spouting various radical theories which are shown to have laughably little to do with any of the character s real lives  Here he is on Sonya s prostitution  As to Sofya Semyonovna personally  I regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society  and I respect her deeply for it  I rejoice indeed when I look at her  To which another character witheringly replies  I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings  I ve never read anything about the book  as opposed to just reading the book itself  but I ve always assumed that the contrast between high flown theories and the utter misery of his characters  lives was somehow Dostoevsky s point   And I m vaguely interested to see that that s still the case  in that I ve come across various arguments about the liberating and anti bourgeois nature of sex work which run up hard against the hard reality of the job  Anyway  it s an amazing book  and you MUST read it  You ll LOVE it  No  really you should read it if you don t mind feeling like you re there  with  there  being a terrible place  I know people sometimes say that they get put off because Rodya s such a tool  but honestly  I think Rodya s meant to be a tool  Nobody feels sympathetic towards him  he s basically awful  Don t read it for him   read it for Dunya and Sonya   Dar aici incepe o alta poveste  povestea regenerarii treptate a unui om  a renasterii lui progresive  a trecerii lui nesimtite dintr o lume intr alta  intr o realizare noua  necunoscuta de el pana atunci  Aceasta ar putea fi tema unei noi povestiri   cea scrisa aici s a sfarsit    Pe de o parte ma bucur ca s a sfarsit aici  pentru ca prea aparuse iubirea acolo si ii salva pe cei doi neferciti  Not fair  Pe de alta parte imi pare rau ca s a terminat aici  ma atasasem de Raskolnikov intr un fel ciudat si chiar imi placea de el  Apoi da  de acord  oamenii care comit crime sunt impartiti in cei care sunt omorati la randul lor pentru ca  we kill people who kill people because killing people is wrong  si oameni care sunt aplaudati de o lume intreaga fiindca crimele lor au fost de folos societatii  si in cazul carora nu se mai ia in considerare savarsirea unei actiuni impotriva firii  Not fair x2  Poate daca Raskolnikov ar fi fost in alte facultati mintale si s ar fi reusit pe plan profesional  devenind un Napoleon  uciderea babei nevinovate ar fi ramas un eveniment inteles  poate chiar laudat impreuna cu taria lui de caracter  Prin toata asta nu am sesizat decat ca oamenii sunt prosti si ca nu merita sa te zbati ca sa te faci inteles  ei vor reactiona oricum in functie de principiile lor sau de gandirea curenta  Ar mai fi multe de spus  dar probabil am sa mai revin asupra cartii  Highly recommend  This is a book I used as a reference many times to describe human nature in some way  The characters are very real  become intimates  Can not say more without giving away the story  If you are working your way through the classics  this one requires plenty of time to stop and absorb  then return  sometimes in a hurry to turn a page  sometimes in dread  not wanting to know  Finalmente sono riuscita a finire Delitto e castigo  Sebbene fosse una rilettura e stato ugualmente lungo arrivare alla fine  il mio professore di filosofia al liceo soleva dirci   Leggete Dostoevskij un estate e crescerete   E crescere non e mai una faccenda breve  in effetti per me resta uno dei romanzi assolutamente da leggere nella vita  La vicenda e delle piu semplici  un omicidio  il senso di colpa  la redenzione  Ma il modo in cui tutto e sviluppato non ha paragoni  la psicologia di ogni personaggio e un piccolo capolavoro che si svela come una matrioska  Come direbbe Steinbeck  e la storia simbolica dell anima umana   ognuno ne cogliera qualcosa di diverso ma tutti ne siamo accomunati        hmyshh hmyn bwdh  wl gryh myknnd b d hm  dt myknnd     Penguin edition  translated by Oliver ReadyI discovered this new version via a best books of 2014 article   They work for some of us     Seeing a comment by a translator from Russian  it sounded like this was what I d been looking for  At last we have a translation that brings out the wild humour and vitality of the original  A N  Wilson  who also chose this as a  Book of the Year   is right to call it a  truly great translation   I d heard already that Russians often describe Dostoevsky as humorous  but this never came through in any of the five or so translations of which I d read early pages  Just over a year ago  I ended up with a second hand copy of Jessie Coulson s OUP C P because it flowed better than the Pevear   Volokhonsky  and cost PS1 49  but I still wasn t convinced that it was the right one  And for years earlier  I d had a copy of the McDuff  which I d eventually got rid of without reading Oliver Ready s Note on  this  Translation says The most widely read translations of Crime and Punishment have tended  in my view  towards a polish  and therefore tameness  absent from Dostoevsky s text  effects gained in large part by judicious trimming or padding   or else they have clung so closely to the Russian that the spell cast by the original is periodically broken by jarring literalism  and the author s peculiarities of style  smoothed over in other translations  are made odder still  Well  exactly  When I started War   Peace  I read dozens of articles for and against the literalism of Pevear   Volkhonsky  I like the arguments against absolute literalism  I fell into reading their translation  it seemed livelier than Edmonds  and the Briggs  which I preferred  isn t available as an ebook  plus I just wanted to know what people were talking about  The double entendres  including liberal use of the word  entering   which P V actually fought against British editors to retain  were always distracting  In most of the relevant scenes  they set a porn version running in my head in parallel with Tolstoy s story   Some bits of which are more memorable than the real scene     Unconscious innuendo might have a place alongside old fashioned  out of touch grandeur  a fair representation of someone who doesn t know a vulgar meaning of what they re saying   which fits perfectly well with the idea of Tolstoy  But a grubby story like Crime and Punishment should surely mean what it says This month  reading  and reading reviews of  recent Russian language comic novel The Good Life Elsewhere has given me a stronger sense of how a clumsy  cluttered wordiness in English is a result of near literal translation from Russian  and how it can detract from humour  The concept is funny  but something seems off centre and it means no actual lol  When I looked again at the preview of P V s Crime   Punishment  I saw exactly that kind of word clutter  Ready communicates the same things as they do  in the pages I read in parallel  but his sentences have a more elegant construction  a hint of dry wit  subtly rather British  perhaps  though the text doesn t feel entirely anglicised  The narrative fairly gallops along with an almost manic energy  not so much that it isn t also thoughtful    it was compulsive reading and I didn t really want to stop once I d read the sample  delighted also to have been seized with enthusiasm for a book that had been hanging around my collection in various forms for the best part of fifteen years  When I finished it  I segued straight to In Siberia by Colin Thubron  whose flowery prose was much slower to read and showed just what immediacy and simple clarity Dostoevsky via Ready had  If you value a translation that s well written and enjoyable in and of itself  I d certainly recommend this one over P V The notes are excellent  Ready explains many word choices  underlying Russian meanings  and their significance to the story  very satisfying and never boring  There is lots on the historical and philosophical context and background academic scholarship  Anonymised place names are explained   though as usual I ll lament the lack of maps in a novel  if you haven t been to St Petersburg  these can t be placed without putting down the book  Only a handful of notes seem superfluous for a fairly well educated reader who is nonetheless unfamiliar with recent scholarship on Dostoevsky  all of those translate elementary phrases of French and German Some time last year  I noticed what appeared to be the books that the most Goodreads friends had read which I hadn t  Don t think I made a note of them all  but at the top were Lolita  read last autumn  and Crime and Punishment   Karamazov isn t far behind  You lot prefer Dostoyevsky over Tolstoy  more than average for the site  and now I can see why   The people in my feed really don t need another review of the book in general  But I write these things at least as much for the sake of remembering as telling  At first the book was incredibly familiar  I knew I hadn t read more than a chapter before   presumably it was instead because this is an ur text  Raskolnikov may have had his literary antecedents  but surely he s the granddad of all those usually criminal  sometimes merely a bit dodgy  unreliable narrators that are arguably a subgenre to themselves in twentieth century and later English language fiction  John Self  Patrick Bateman  Humbert himself  and Alfie being the first well known ones who spring to mind   Not to mention the starving artists and existentialists teetering on the brink in Hamsun  Camus  Sartre etc etc   Raskolnikov s opinions  and the scene of cruelty to horses as he falls into madness  prefigure Nietzsche  Having read GR posts by people who generally come across as calm  who yet felt that Raskolnikov had got under their skin  I was apprehensive about where this might take me  I didn t want to feel again like I had when reading Money  which needed a lot of breaks  or Lolita  which I read much of whilst sunbathing outside   when it wasn t quite warm enough   because visual and physical awareness of self would help displace my consciousness into non narrating characters  At my age  that s obviously Charlotte   But third person narrative  with scenes entirely between other characters  saves me from feeling half possessed  We come up for air with long breaks from Raskolnikov s mind  and the book is far more interesting for the number of other characters it contains  But we re still stuck inside the close  humid world of white nights in the slums of St Petersburg  It invited immersive reading  stewing in bed or sofa as crockery  cartons and cups piled up around  The third person made it easier to disentangle what makes such narrators feel contagious  Raskolnikov s nerves are universal  the pressure of some impending but unfixed deadline  most readers can presumably remember times when they ve felt nervous as that   but it wasn t because they killed anyone  Sometimes  when he s concerned with family problems  it s as if he s forgotten what happened  what he did   from less serious bad things at least  this kind of denial seems so accurate  something that novels don t often get into   it s not that he isn t troubled  it just isn t there for a while  Though what I often got most caught up in was the outlook of several other characters who just assume he needs to get better and sort himself out  have a decent meal and pay off his debts    then like the bombshell of a drunk remembering what they did the night before  back into Raskolnikov s mind and the enormity and horror of the murder  Classics are generally classics because they re universal  but it s a long time since I found any nineteenth century novel this pertinent   And if I ever did I can t remember which one  Some of it s in the smaller things  the to ing and fro ing between what are essentially bedsits  half living in other people s houses  visitors forever turning up  feels terribly similar to  post university life over a hundred years later  A chord that won t strike the hardier among you  but how often characters are ill  with fevers  mostly    I felt at home in a world where other people also say  Now of all times I d have preferred to be well   where it s evidently a regular consideration  And maybe novels set amongst poorer people more easily seem  relevant  and  universal  than stories of aristocrats  Mostly the significance  though  is in the big philosophical questions  These days aspiring political leaders would not be respected for having killed people   that s a difference from Raskolnikov s idealisation of Napoleon  But his  stepping over  idea  to what extent some form of greatness negates damage done  does still seem to matter in debates about the relevance of artists  lives to their work  And I know I accept things from a few people I consider hugely creatively talented that I wouldn t from those who aren t  and that others don t make exceptions  The biggest question is about the causes of crime  Notes indicate that Dostoevsky was philosophically opposed to those who considered all crime to be prompted by the environment  at that point in history it sounds as if this meant external factors such as poverty  The environment is now understood to be more entangled with the individual  via upbringing and  epi genetics  and points like the very high incidence of mental illness in prisoners  which makes this story all the more complex   as a case study it still works because Raskolnikov s character and the question of his responsibility is not straightforward and can be seen through the lens of whatever current society  As regards the very end  view spoiler  whilst I don t know about this point WRT serious violent criminals  I think it s excellent that Raskolnikov s sense of feeling and empathy starts to kick in as he gets a little older  Plenty of people are rigidly elitist and unfeeling to those unlike them in their late teens and early twenties  and become much more  human e  as they grow up  Much popular comment seems to think that it s set for life  but I ve seen people change to one degree or another like this   not to mention examples in textbooks  and it s evident it s a spectrum not a binary  Dostoevsky shows Raskolnikov as someone with the potential to grow out of it to some unknown extent  but he also acknowledges that some people don t really  in the character of Luzhin  Svidrigailov seems to have placed the orphans in a vulnerable position  but he has tried to make some amends and has been haunted by his victims  Dunce point  did he really kill himself  And not shoot  Achilles   dress him up in his clothes and run away to America   hide spoiler  Crime and Punishment is remarkably free from that perennial irritant in nineteenth century novels  the generalisation  old men do this  young women think that etc  I only noticed four in the entire book  and only one of those was dodgy to our eyes  a long winded clause essentially saying  all Jews look miserable    Russians  have an exceptional propensity for the fantastical and the disorderly   His characters do  anyway  I like to think that Dostoevsky s unusually broad and harrowing life experience made him see there was too much variety among human beings to warrant the usual Victorian upper middle class generalisations pronounced from on high   Of the remaining two  one seems impossible to argue with  like children who  after a good long cry  are finally beginning to cheer up  but could easily start sobbing again at a moment s notice  And the other seems so obviously  amusingly  a local observation not marked as such  Katya drained the glass in one go   without a break  in twenty gulps  as women do  Having downed plenty of drinks   when younger to show off  later merely through thirst   I feel no objection  only wonder whether it would take a starving singer  who must have good breath control  as many as twenty to drain a pint or similar  Everyone mentions Raskolnikov  but I d never heard anyone allude to his sister Dunya  and how much she rocks  In War   Peace female characters appeared to have a bit more licence than those in its British contemporaries  Still  I was amazed that the women of Part 4 chapter II were written by a genuine nineteenth century novelist   view spoiler   Later  near the end where it has moments of turning into an adventure novel in the scene with Svidrigailov  I saw her as a prototype of the Russian Bond Girl  hide spoiler    There were so many little things familiar about their mother  Pulkheria  that I could easily imagine her as an extra aunt  Generally  I had not been led to believe that there were many likeable characters in Crime   Punishment  but there are   Razhumikin  too  Raskolnikov on his own could get exasperating at times  not as exasperated as he himself felt   yet whenever he was in conversation with anyone else the story became fascinating again  and I always wanted to know what was going to happen to everyone else  Not that there aren t a few possible faults to pick  Some seem a result of writing for serialisation   view spoiler  Luzhin and Svidrigailov could have had more disparate roles in the second half  I wondered if in the original serialisation  Dostoevsky was trying to reprise and amplify popular plotlines with Luzhin as antagonist  as there were a few too many similarities in what Svidrigailov did later on  Even though his denouement was enormous fun  Right now it also seems particularly contemporary to have as villains rich men who exploited impoverished children and teenagers    hide spoiler   Investigator Petrovich was perhaps too mad and rambling in conversation  too strange and fantastical in his actions  but that s when compared with modern fictional detectives  There are bits which are existential gritty realist and philosophical  and others pulpier  Sonya has  of all the characters  aged least well  a cross between Little Nell and the hooker with a heart of gold  she doesn t ring true to the modern reader  I read a lot of the big English nineteenth century classics in my teens  and for all that I might see them differently now  there has always been that feeling of having got something basically done  All the references in this volume make me aware of a huge gap in not having read the Russians which I didn t think that significant before   if only they were all as compelling as this translation  they would be nothing but a joy to discover   There was a bit in some novel I read as a teenager in which a heroine asks  why does Juliet never have a cold   and similar re   other well known characters  Herkes kendisi hakkinda kendisi karar verir ve kendini en iyi aldatabilen herkesten daha neseli yasar  i just ugh mn

qtny  khr    didn t listen to the audio book  but this book doesn t seem to have it s own page sans audiobook    anyways the point is this is one of my favourite books of all time  You can feel everything in your guts  the anxiety  the terror  the insanity  Highly  highly recommend  Dostoevsky s understanding of the human nature has single handedly changed the way I view crime and punishment   Crime and Punishment is a comprehensive and troubling look into the dark mind of a Russian intellectual who murders an old pawn broker and her sister  Money was only his secondary motive for the crime  His first premise was to test his idea whether extraordinary men have a right to transgress the law  and whether he is that extraordinary type of man  In the novel  Dostoevsky explores the paradox of the human condition in live action  between abject wretchedness and merciful kindness  Raskolnikov is a soul torn between the two  a base contradiction  alienated from society  family  even from himself  In his psyche  he is forced to navigate between the terror of guilt and police  rejecting friends  providing charity unthinkingly  all the while constantly irritated by both his conscience and self justification  At times it made my heart sick to read  but this is a journey from darkness to light  from pride to humiliation  from isolation to love and ultimately salvation  Classic book that I couldn t put down  Loved it  A number 1  A book that everyone should read especially those questioning the law  the changes in it  the hope for the future of law  ones personal prayer for the perfecting of it  Dostoyevsky is undoubtedly one of the great masters of literature ranking with Melville  Shakespeare  Forster  Words fail me to express how amazing this novel is It is prophetic  pointing to the coming of the 20th century  the bloodiest in history  summed up in R s dream in the Epilouge   It delves into the depths of the human condition  sin and grace  judgment and redemption  like nothing I have ever read  Raskolnikov s Christ like journey to confess his crime is beautiful  From  taking up his cross   Sonya s cypress wood trinket  he makes his way through the mocking crowds while Sonya follows at a distance like Mary Wow I highly recommend the Norton Critical Edition  Zonder commentaar     Buiten misschien het iet wat  te   vlug afgehandelde einde epiloog

mwm  How many times in one s life can one state   I just read the greatest book I ve ever read in my life    Today  I can enthusiastically do just this  I m too small to attempt a review of such a work   Before beginning this book  I was a bit terrified  Terrified of a dark place it might take me to  The name of the novel couldn t be more heavier and dark natured  But on the contrary the reviews I read about this book weren t so  And so I took it up  With a fear still present of course  And moreover  being a classic and all  and that too Russian  I assumed it would be a very heavy read All my perceptions were shattered page after page  And that too quickly  beautifully  This is easily one of the most smoothest prose I ve ever read  The poverty  the city din  the dark dirtiness of the mind and the street is wonderfully emphasized line after line  I still wonder how the author could possibly keep the read bright and hopeful through all this darkness  The novel starts in a hot suffocating city with no hope and ends in a sickly freezing Siberia with all hope restored  A classic indeed  Awesomeness   One of my most cherished books  I would liken it to a miniature version of Dostoyevsky s real masterpiece The Brother s Karamazov  I first read this book in high school and was mesmerized  When my book club was considering reading some classics  I recommended it  and I find that I still love the book  It is a classic psychological thriller  First reading  April 1966 Favorite book of all time  This book is friggin amazing  I read this book in 1991 or 1992  and I can still remember that scene where Raskolnikov forces Sonya to read the Lazarus story to him  It is maybe my favorite scene in literature  like  ever  aside from Mr  Darcy s proposal speech in P P  swoooooon   I need to reread this but with the new fancy translation    Disclaimer  I cheated and  read  this book on audio CD  In my defense it was the unabridged version and my job had me spending long periods of time in a darkroom  Regarding the book  loved it  Wonderful work by Dostoevsky that is what the title says  a story of a man s crime and his punishment  It tells of the struggle of conviction  how it effects others around you  and the power and freedom in coming clean  I m excited  as I did with The Brothers  to flip through the novel and see things that I possibly missed   Absolutely mind blowing book  I think it must be read slowly to absorb what Dostoevsky is saying  but the time spent will be worth it   Pure masterpiece  an insight into human mind and spirit It took me over 4 years to complete  I could only read it in spurts before the haunted feeling that followed Raskolnikov crept off the page and began to follow me  There are so many things to say about this book  I have not the words  I love this book  I first read it years ago  as a senior in High School  and then re read it just recently for the first time since then  Dostoevsky s characters  his feel for dialog  and his clear  deep humanity are stunning  The book is long  and typical of nineteenth century literature requires a degree of patience not often asked for  most authors no longer dare  in an age of communication dominated by emails and texting  There are times less is more  This is an occasion when more does just fine on its own   Probably my favorite novel of all time  A swirling whirlpool of philosophy  politics  personal redemption   the real story of an outsider criminal character s personal struggle with morality and destitution   this book almost brought me to tears in its final pages   and i m not a very emotional person   thats how powerful it is  Dostoevsky was a grand master of literature  i find myself relating to this book frequently when trying to understand how highly intelligent and upstanding people can do highly deviant immoral acts and attempt to overcome their guilt by intelligence  i read it in high school and got a great picture in my head of the themes  then i read it again much later in life and got a really good picture of the psyche of how man can justify his sins  but eventually they catch up with him  This is one of my all time favorite books about the human condition  Might have even been one of the books that eventually  consciously or unconsciously  affected my decision to enter the field of psychology  I would read this ten times over if I could and would recommend it to anyone  Duzen icerisinde gordugumuz pislikleri bireysel olarak temizleme istegimizin kotu sonuclara yol acabilecegini gosteren  kahramanlarin ya da olmaya calisanlarin cogu zaman temiz calisamadagini masumlara da zarar verdigini gozumuze sokan  vicdan azabinin en guclu itirafci oldugunu hatirlatan harika roman  Klasikleri okurken banal gelen bazi yerler oluyor ama bu yerler zamanin ruhuna gore degerlendirildiginde gayet yenilikci olabilir  Yer yer asiri hissedilen ogreticilik kaygisi buna ornek verilebilir   No one is able to capture the disorderly and unkempt mind of the paranoid and desperate like Dostoevsky  Brilliantly penned and marvelously disturbing and as psychologically revealing a novel as you re going to find  There is a crime in this book  And punishment  But the thing that sets this book apart as one of my favorite of all time is the redemption  It is set literally in the neighborhood in which I lived in St  Petersburg  Hay Square  This book is depressing and shows a realistic life in revolutionary era Russia  which clarifies a lot of reasons Russia HAD a revolution  My favorite character is Sonya   I could not read all of the book as it was so devastatingly violent in all ways  no tenderness whatsoever  duty  actions driven by necessity and desperation  a shocking record of the poverty of Russia during the 1800 s  I should finish it though  it might help me    This particular edition is the best I have found  While I cannot vouch for the quality of the translation itself  the map  list of character  and critical essays make the Norton Critical Edition superior  in my opinion  This is a classic  Anyone interested in reading something really material in fiction genre  go for it without thinking twice   ExcellentA very striking book  Every couple of chapters I had to put it down and conemtplate the ideas running through my head  Raskolnikov s theory and demise  his strange infatuations  all very enticing  Very satisfactory ending also  I expected something more on the lines of  An American Tragedy   I m deffinantely reading more Dostoevsky  This book was actually pretty good and turned out better than I though it would  The only bad thing is that my teacher made us read so much in a short amount of time that reading it actually turned out to be a hassle   I read this book with two Study Guides because I understand  from a lot of cultural research I have done about the Russian culture  the importance of the confession of a crime  I find it to be a beautifully written story  and it is what secured my love for the Russian Authors  An existential masterpiece in which the main character commits a horrible murder for unclear reasons and spends the remainder of the novel torturing himself and searching for redemption while evading a very intuitive police officer  I could not put this book down  I needed a bit of light summer reading after I left my job in the summer of 2010  With the major life changes I was also experiencing during that summer i also needed a book that would effectively remove me from my present reality and almost like a magnum of vodka drown my senses and drown out all the noise in my life  This book did that for me  I had it with me poolside all summer long  and it managed to retain the smell of chlorine and coconut scented sunblock lotion between the pages by the end of the summer  Sorry I m not writing my review of the book here  just wanted to reflect and share what I felt and how the experience of reading this book was like for me that summer   Before you think this book is a philosophical wall of text that everyone reads just to add to their literary street cred  my initial reason for reading it   keep in your mind that as demented as Raskolnikov is  as much as he rants about his Nietzsche an ideals and as much as Dostoyevsky wants to smush your face into his philosophies  this is actually a brilliant melodramatic romantic soap operatic tense mystery  Somewhere  deep inside all that fluff and insanity  is the story of a man  a man who loves his family  a man who although flawed  who happens to think that carving the face of a woman in with an axe can propel him to a superman like status  is probably a beautiful human being But I have to admit  that ending came out of nowhere  And Ponfiry is a goddamn badass 20 04 13   Read David Foster Wallace s review on Dostoevsky s biographies  It will make you look at Dostoevsky in a completely different light altogether  the review  haven t read the biographies     The more we intellectualize  the more imprisoned we become   This is my first read of Dostoevsky and I am intrigued I loved the read and it s the best book I have I ever read so far   How can someone create such an authentic picture of human psychology of emotions I felt as if I was feeling everything myself    Book is about a highly intellectual person Raskolnikov and the crime he commits in delirium     he is a genius  a mastermind who has every single explanation for justifying his vileness   To go wrong in one s own way is better than to go right in someone else s   Dostoevsky s characters are so exaggerated that they seem to shoot their emotions at each other all the time He has not left grasp of a single emotion throughout his way Crime is committed  if a man has consciously done it then he has to suffer whole life punishment in the form of pain and suffering which is inevitable It will be harder for a large intellect and deep heart   Nothing in this world is harder than speaking the truth  nothing is easier than flattery  In this world  there are hardly a few individuals who has the courage to follow what they think is right and true   Taking a new step and uttering a new word is what people fear the most  This book has really enlarged my senses and perspective towards the way we look at the world  every single detail of it      Looking forward to reading other books of Dostoevsky and definitely this one more round      A page turner  don t be intimidated  Took me about 3 weeks  A great  relevant story about depravity  shame and redemption we should all relate to  How he manages to use ten pages to make a simple point I ll never know  Pretty sure they were paid per word in those days  My favorite book of all time  Read it for AP English as a senior in high school  and re read it every year  Dostoevsky created something truly magical If you hadn t read this book  I don t take anything you say about literature seriously  I found this novel to display a wonderful depiction of human morality and conscience  Dostoevsky s portrayal of society and the the distinct character of the people that reside within it I feel was truly insightful  To view the main character s personal development was inspiring in it s  what I believe to be accurate  projection of how some of us may feel at times  I believe this book to be timeless  My personal favorite work of fiction  There is nothing more beautiful than being able to write for generations and generations of people ans still keep the message fresh and clear  That is exactly what Dostoevsky has done  I read this when I was a teenager    thought is was fantastic  Now I am listening to it on tape    many decades later    and find it even better  Dangerous while driving  though  because it is so suspenseful   My Mom was attending summer session at the University of Montana and was taking classes that included Russian authors including Dostoyevsky  This book still haunts me when I think of it  I should read it again    ndm yqr  lmr ldystwyfsky yntbh lkhjl   l n dhlk lrwsy lnHyf  jd lGwS fy   mq   mq lnfs lbshry    shkhSy  rskwlynkwf jdyr  tmm b n tkwn lGz fryd  m  lm lnfs  fy hdhh lmlHm  yDj  lktb

GmwD rhyb     A brilliant tale  Of course  the plot  its execution and the pace of the story all do it merit  However  what keeps the reader hooked  absolutely and resolutely hooked  is the whole idea  the genius of Dostoevsky  How deeply he understands the human nature  the beliefs and inclinations  the fantasies we all harbour perhaps  and yet he presents it as extraordinary  as something entirely new  The narrative is raw  and it will make you raw  the misery and poverty will make your heart churn  make you shed tears  others like Luzhin will evoke contempt and disdain and curses  there is compassion despite suffering  there are radical ideas about the duties of man and society  and amongst all that  the question of right and wrong   right by law  right by conscience  right by intellect  or simply right according to history books  In the end  I was impressed not only by the story but also by the character and the intellect of the author himself  How I would have loved to have had the chance to meet him  or listen to him  But I must be content with reading his works  I would recommend this book without hesitation to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading  for this is without doubt  in my head  amongst the best literary pieces man has ever created  Nesmotria na vsiu svoiu  tiazhest    opredelenno  odna iz liubimykh knig  Dostoevskii ne nuzhdaetsia v dopolnitel nykh kommentariiakh  Genial no  Moshchno  Potriasaiushche  If you think killing is a crime  think again   4 20 09  SPOILER ALERT Fyodor Dostoyevsky   Crime and Punishmentdate written 185819th century  author spent time in prison  4 years  and some year in military afterwards  it was after this time period that he wained in and out of delerium and struggle with hypochondria  The protagonist of the story is Raskolnikov an earlier twenty something university dropout  he lives in a small dungoen of a room in st  petersburg and comes up a strange theory  that brilliant men are above the law and step over it easily on their way to greatness  it is because of this idea and his self conceded vision that he is destined to be a brilliant man that he decides to test his theory and kill an old women of which he owes money  his methodical plan is executed without leaving any evidence and only his paranoia betrays him  A crafty police detective petrovitch clues into his physchological guilt and plays tricks on him to push him over the edge and make him repent  he even gets someone to follow him around and then confront him and call him a murderer saying that he knows he did it  The subplot exists in the familial ties between his sister and mother  they come to st  petersburg towards the end of the plot with his sister s contriving groom who ends up to be shown for the ass he is by raskolnikov during sofya s father s funeral  the frail peasant girl turned prostitute is the first person to whom raskolnikov shares his ugly secrets   later the same day to his sister Dounia  In the end Raskolnikov confesses to his crime and spends 8 years in siberia for his crime  he lets down his guard about a year after his incarceration and confesses his love for sofya who followed him to siberia  his sister dounia gets married to raskolnikov s best friend an former classmate Razumihin  he was spared a life sentence based on his agitated state and not even caring about hte money he stole from his victims   he actually kills the old women s younger sister as well when surprised by her appearance  I really liked this book  It was not a walk in the park  but it was definitely worth reading  It s one of those books that you should read in your lifetime  Sometimes it was hard to keep the characters straight because they re all called different names in the book  but it was a really good book and good story line  Very worthwhile reading  I literally cried during the end of this book  It was that good  I would definitely read this book again   One of the many reasons Dostoevsky is my favorite author is that he can argue against his own beliefs just as strongly as he argues for his own side  Ivan Karamozov makes such a convincing case against God in The Brothers Karamazov that many people feel Dostoevsky must have been a closet atheist himself  despite his avowed faith  In the introduction to my edition of Crime and Punishment  Joseph Brodsky is quoted as saying that Dostoevsky subscribed to the classical dictum that  before you come forth with your argument  however right or righteous you may feel  you have to list all the arguments of the opposite side   I m going to take this same approach  and list all the reasons you shouldn t like Crime and Punishment  Plotwise  it s a bit of a sprawling mess  While the main story centers on Raskolnikov s failed attempt to prove himself a Superman by moving himself beyond good and evil  I love that he refutes every Nietzschean argument years before Nietzsche ever made them   there are way too many sidetracks along the way  An editor would have probably cut most of Marmeladov s opening monologue  the romance between Razumikhin and Dunya  and possibly even Svidrigailov entirely  None of these are vital to the point of Raskolnikov s battle with his conscience  and in fact distract the reader from this central point again and again  The murder happens before the motive is fully explained  We don t find out Raskolnikov has written an article expounding his views on the right of the  superior  individual to be above the law until much later in the book  Logic would dictate that we would be much more engrossed in the crime if we knew his reasons for committing it  As it is written  he comes across just looking like an inept criminal until we later find out his twisted reasoning  There are entirely too many coincidences in Crime and Punishment  Svidrigalov just happens to rent a room right next to Sonya  and also happens to be in when Raskolnikov confesses to her  Zamyotov  the police clerk  somehow is a good friend of Razumikhin  Raskolnikov is at the market right when Lizaveta Ivanovna tells someone she ll be out of her sister s house the next evening at seven leaving his intended victim alone  And  Sonya and Lizaveta are friends  St  Petersburg must have been a very small town  Despite these  shortcomings   Crime and Punishment remains one of the all time greats  It s a masterful look inside the mind of not just a criminal  but a man who truly believes his crime will set him apart from humanity as one of the few who are bold enough to step above law and morality  He quickly learns that this is not the case at all  His ineptitude  killing her sister as well  leaving most of the money in the apartment  and never profiting from the robbery at all  immediately shows him he is no Superman  And  afterwords  his mounting sense of guilt and despair prove to him that not only did he not live up to his theory  but that this theory was completely wrong as well  Also  the repetitive nature of Raskolnikov s dreams  his walks through St  Petersburg  interviews with the police  and discussions with Sonya only serve to bring us into his fractured state of mind after the crime  And  while some of the side stories are the result of Dostoevsky blending two novels  one with the working title of The Drunkards  into one  others probably result from his usual habit of writing a serialized novel so close to deadline that the first chapters were in print before he had finished writing the last  This meant that even if he later decided a character or scene introduced early on wasn t integral to the plot  he couldn t just cut it out  since it was already in print  Again  this is one of my all time favorite books from one of my all time favorite writers  It is amazing how much tension is built into a novel where we know who the murderer is right from the start  It s not a  who done it   it s a  can he get away with it   And not from outside sources   even though Porfiry Petrovich  my favorite fictional detective  knows he did it from the start  there isn t any evidence to convict him  And Porfiry lets Raskonikov know this  leaving it to his conscience to do the rest  And to Dostoevsky  conscience is proof that God exists  For   without God  everything is permitted    5  Romanzo perfetto  reso ancora piu immenso dal protagonista  Raskol nikov e tra i piu grandi personaggi letterari di sempre  Grandissima analisi della realta umana  che mostra l uomo in assenza della ragione  Raskol nikov e l esplicitazione dell uomo irrazionale  che agisce per proprio istinto  ed arriva  in alcuni passaggi  persino a raggiungere la forma di un essere quasi  superiore   che sta sopra le parti  che  c e e non c e   One of the best books ever written  The depth of character is amazing  The only things I struggled with is the translation didn t fit perfectly and many sayings don t work in English  A classic for a reason    My absolute favourite book   fkr  dwstwyfsky ttlkhS bstHl  m rf  lnsn Hq m rf   whdh m myz shkhSy  rskwlnykwf b nh mHwlh lfhm lshkhSy  lnsnyh lm qd  w bdhlk kn  kbr  dd mn tSrfth tSrft mkhlf  llmnTq  Dostoevsky is a very different writer than Tolstoy  He focuses on the dark side of the Russian experience  with it s dirty cities and intense  inescapable poverty that leads good people to despeate acts  The writing in this book is oppressive  and completely believable  Only in the last few pages does a look toward redemption and a light at the end of the tunnel shine through  For all that  the text is rich and has a lot to offer those who can tolerate the darkness of some thoughts and actions  Okay  I know  I know  many great readers hate hate hate this old style novel for its indulgences  its ruminations  its many nicknames  and its lack of action  But it is simply one of the most adult novels I have ever read  even after six or seven reads  the novel never fails to dazzle me with how it develops its deep and nuanced psychological portrait  It s unbelievably mature and reverent  even to someone  like me  who does not share the author s rigid faith  Maybe not a novel to revel in  but it s certainly one to appreciate  this is an all time top five for me  even though I recommend it far less often than I do my other favorites The essays in the back of this Norton edition are really fascinating too  Don t miss the Mochulsky  I think that s it  about how this could be conceived as a tragedy in five acts  FD s parts II VI  sandwiched by a prologue  FD s part I  and epilogue  FD s epilogue   The fragments from the Soviet Union s state curriculum and how this book was taught over the years also catch my eye every time I need to read another translation someday  Someone recently told me that a new translation improves on the Coulson  I thought overall this was a great book  It incorparated many deep facts about life and it dug deep into your conceince  It made you think about life and its devilish and depressing ways  That is  of course  if you survive all 600 pages of it and the hard to understand russian phrases   I am not so certain that contemporary people will resonate too much with the conflict mechanism Dostoyevsky used  It is not so evident in the 21st century that someone conscience is such a strong reason for suffering after a murder  Especially after so many Hollywood examples of conscienceless characters Let alone this small discrepancy generated by the 150 years difference between the time when the book was initially published and today  I liked most the well rounded characters  I believe there are few writers that can portray characters so well without using interminable descriptions My copy of this book is in Romanian  this is a great book  i ll read it again sometime  I particularly liked Raskolnikov s and Svidrigailov s dreams  The best scene is where Sonia reads from the Bible and Raskolnikov listens  Favourites  This is  by far  one of the best told stories I have read   The depth of the main characters and the journey he takes into insanity give a very honest look at the human mind and spirit  It is a must read for any adult reader  I was fifteen or sixteen when I found an old copy of this book in the basement of our house  I remember the conflicting thoughts and questions going through my head about Raskolnikov s actions  about right and wrong  good and evil  It s a fascinating book and Dostoyevsky was brilliant in defining the human soul  The book was revolutionary for me at that young age  For many years after I referred to it as my favorite book and Dostoyevsky was declared the best author I d ever read  As for what I think now  I still think he s up there with the best and so is this book   i dont think there is any other book that can be SO over analyzed but stil amazing at the same time  dostoyevsky is a genius and makes this book so much better and more enterntaining then i honestly expected    Crime and PunishmentThis is the beginning of a new story  the story of the gradual renewal of men  the story of our gradual regeneration  of our passing from one world of nihilism into another in truth  of our own initiation into a new unknown life in Grace   My favorite book   Loved it  I read a lot of Russian literature and some of Dostoevsky during the 80s  Reading this made me want to go back and reread  Brothers Karamazov  and  The Idiot  and to read more of his works  I absolutely love the way Dostoevsky penetrates the inner workings of the mind and delves into all the psychological reasons and emotions of his characters   Multiple interwoven storylines make this book rich with complexity  in a good way  It starts off slow  but gets pretty damn dramatic  The 5th star is for the main characters  who in a single conversation can be generous  ashamed  fearful  arrogant  confused  hopeful  regretful  indignant  etc  all believably so  It d probably be rewarding to read it again  My favourite book of all time   I don t often revisit a book but I ve read this several times   Brott   Straff ar utan tvekan en utav de basta bockerna jag last  Trots att den bestar av ca 600 sidor ar den vart det  Fjodor Dostojevskij lyckades halla spanningen uppe under hela boken och gjorde det intressant for lasaren att hanga med i resan  Det kan ibland kannas trogt p g a  att inget kanske hander och bokens storlek men det gor inget eftersom man far kanna vad det ar bokens huvudperson kanner  Jag rekommenderar definitivt denna roman for spanningens skull  This book stands on the top of the greatest books ever written  I cannot begin to describe how it is or what it talks about or how much this book is a very fine piece of literature  I can only tell you this  Go read it now  rwy  ry    tbqyk  l  Hf  lhwy  lm rf  ttly lHdthshkhSyth mrswm  bdq  w br   l mthyl lhm Dmn mHyT jtm y w sysy mly mkhb  mly bnhy  hdhh lrwy  lkn hdh l ynqS mn rw th lbt     I cried  Not because of the story  which is riveting  or because of the characters  which are as complex as any ever drawn up  I cried because of the brilliance  knowing that it will be harder than ever to get up tomorrow and write  Why bother BTW  it s the greatest novel that I have ever read  Sometime you read a classic because you feel you ought to  more than because you want to  For me Crime and Punishment was one of those books  but after finishing it I can now say that this is one of my new favourites and I can see why this has lasted the test of time and is indeed a classic novel Don t get me wrong  this is not an easy read in any sense  It is very intense  and has long  sometimes unnecessary  dialogs between characters  and I would find myself putting the book down for a week or two and coming back to it Still  I could very easily comeback to it  and I found the further I got into the book the harder it was becoming to put it down  no Rodion is not a particularly likeable person on the surface  but that to me is what makes this even better  You still become intrigued to Rodion s fate and mental state  Some of the reviews on here have refered to Rodion as being mad  but I think the point Fyodor Dostoyevsky is trying to make is that an act such as murder and the guilt that follows is what makes you mad  This isn t really about spirituality either  as a psychology student I see this as a great insight into the human conscience and the deterioration of sanity   Am I the only one who liked it more than The Brothers Karamazov  I ve been thinking it may have been because this was my first experience with Dostoevsky but I m undecided  What I do is rate my experiences with books  I can t tell you whether The Brothers Karamazov is a 5 and this a 4  but from the beginning  to the middle  to the last  this book has been a 5 for me  I give my relationship with BK a 4  Really enjoyed reading this book  I enjoyed the literary use of  change of perspective   It has been awhile since I have read Russian Lit and I feel I am once again hooked as I was when I first read Dostoyevsky 5 years ago  Read this book   This book is gruesome and dark as most Russian classics are  Yet it is a brilliant book  I would say this is the first Russian psychological novel and maybe Dostoevsky s finest Can a crime be acceptable if it serves a higher purpose  Brilliant  An essential must read  What if man is not really a scoundrel  man in general  I mean  the whole race of mankind then all the rest is prejudice  simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it s all as it should be    When I started reading Fyodor Dostotevsky s books  I never wanted to read any other book    I see myself in most of his characters   Crime and Punishment was a good book   I loved Raskolnikoff for his generosity and simplicity Sonia was also a heroine to me for her self sacrifice  devotion and love to her family Razhoumukin for his loyalty and friendship towards Raskolnikoff The novel generally brings the best out of people  people who society might want to hang or put away  people who have been rejected by society A lot of lessons to learn  rwy  t khdhk l   mq lnfs lbshry  wkyf ymkn  n tjtm

libri per i quali ogni commento e sprecato  Si puo solo dire  BISOGNA leggerlo Ma attenzione  Chi l ha letto all eta giusta  dopo la coca cola e prima del vino  direi  lo rileggera tutta la vita Letto troppo tardi  potrebbe essere troppo tardi   Gorup de bir yorum yapasim geldi  Butun hikaye boyunca kendimi Raskolnikov un yerine koyup vicdan muhasebesi yaptim  Kimi zaman tefeciye sovdum  kimi zaman hayata sartlara    Ve o kacinilmaz an geldiginde solugumu tutup karanlik sokaklardan mantom ile gectim ve    Iste Sibirya dayim ve iste sucumun cezasini cekmekteyim  Ama asil Sibirya benim yuregim ve dusuncelerim  Ve bence asil cehennem belki de bazen dunyadir  Hayatimda beni cok derinden etkileyen nadir kitaplardandir  Kalemine saglik Usta Dostoyevski    this is one of the best book of 19th century  it is a physiological story about the crime and it s result the main character Raskolnikov is a poor student but he can understand that he is not alone and there are thousandth of innocent people suffering from the same problem Raskolnikov decides that he have to kill one of the reach and that would be a protest against the structure  but he was very wrong an instead of reach he killed a poor innocent woman  He was also wrong when he thought that the crime would do nothing to him he felt very lonely later  He says he wanted to kill old terrible rich women  but he committed suicide instead another character Sonia who is very poor as well thinks that you have to buy happiness with suffer and only with suffer you can repent your crime  she is full of love and later she makes Raskolnikov believe her  which can be heart s win against the cold mind  This book was an incredible re read for me  A chilling insight into the inner turmoil of a delirious and insecure but brilliant young man  One s inability to warm to the character of Raskolnikov  our secretive murderer who guilt weighs upon him  is contrary to those around him who seemingly adore him  He can do no wrong  The fact that we  the readers  know he is a loathsome and cold blooded murderer  feel no sympathy for him  then makes for the most interesting sections of the book  when we see him attempt to live with his guilt  and swither from his own inner revulsion one minute to his delusional high opinions of himself and his  right  to stamp out someone insignificant who had more in life than he did  He views himself as a genius and that this step was something small and unimportant in the scheme of his great life  A terrifying childhood nightmare told near the start of this is one of the most grueling and disturbing passages in the whole book and the murder only comes along after this so I took the character of Raskolnikov to be already at the lowest ebb of his life  in complete poverty  ignored when he felt he should be exalted  due to his intellect  The other characters in the book were interesting from the businessman Svidrigailov who stalks his sister and his surprising demise to the cunning methods of the policeman Porfiry who  plays  with Raskolnikov and causes his paranoia to be his own downfall Dostoevsky in undoubtedly one of the greatest writers ever in terms of uncovering and exposing human nature in all its glory and equally in its horror  Told in a simple uncomplicated style  this is a truly great and compelling novel and one which I feel most would read and enjoy   This is a marvelous book that everyone interested in crime should read  It is truly a masterpiece   This is my FAVORITE book  I find myself seeing scenes from the book play out in movies  tv shows  and life on a pretty regular basis  What a wonderful depiction of the struggle between  good  and  evil  we struggle within ourselves  This has to be my favorite book of all time  One of the reasons I love it is the tremendous depth of Raskolnikov s character  He wants so desperately to believe that he is superior to other humans and that he needs no moral restrictions  but he knows that he isn t  He wants to believe that he did nothing wrong  but through his actions it is clear that he knows he needs to make amends somehow  Another reason I love it is the themes of rebirth and renewal  especially with the biblical story of Lazarus  All in all  it is a wonderful story about spiritual death and rebirth  and the many ups and downs along the way  This is a book I will never forget  I remember specific parts of it at the weirdest times   his writing will stick with you  The main character  tortured by his guilt  is all of us   E verdade que demorei muito tempo a ler o livro  mas trata se de um classico imperdivel e recomendado para qualquer leitor Raskolnikov e a personagem principal deste enredo que passar por um enorme ensaio da condicao humana  poder e sofrimento  recompensa  grandeza  castigo e inutilidade Um  vaivem  de contratempos e avancos  numa roda vida daquilo que e a vida humana   The classics are called classic for a reason  This is one of those  This is the second Russian novel I ve read in the past year  C P is a psychological drama of the first order  Much has been written about this book  so I won t bore you with my humble attempt  and just leave it as   it s a classic As a writer  I felt the presentation of the war in Raskolnikov s mind after his deed was one of the most gripping I ve ever read  The philosophical aspect was disturbing   when can a murderer feel justified in doing so  Perhaps it was the sign of the times for this to be the focus of Dostoyevsky s story   Russia in the beginnings of revolution  questioning the power of the powerful  Definitely a book to put on your reading bucket list   The long lasting consequences of a short almost instinctive crime drove me off into the land of insanity  The way that Raskolnikov overthinks situations and perceives things to an extreme level due to his  suspicions of the suspicions  of Petrovich and Zamyotov have about his involvement in the crime   The parallelism between the mental guilt of Raskolnikov and that of Svidrigailov s was really interesting  On one of the spectrum  Raskolnikov was overcome with guilt over the murders while on the other side Svidrigailov was in a way   freed from his bond  However in the end  the instability of Svidrigailov s behavior consumes his unconscious moral attitude expressed through the dream he had of the five year old girl  I especially enjoyed Dostoyevsky s style of writing from the perspective of a  criminal   it allowed me to understand the inner wiring of the human brain and process of returning back to sanity on a  whole new level  I m not sure what to say about this book that hasn t already been said  A stone cold classic  it earns every plaudit ever given it  I ll throw in my two cents by saying that the next book I read after C P was a book of F  Scott Fitzgerald short stories  I am a huge fan of FSF and I really enjoyed the book but while reading it I couldn t escape the feeling that what I was dealing with something much lighter  I missed reading C P  I missed the struggle of it  I want to read other authors this summer but I don t know how I can avoid going straight to another Dostoevsky novel  Excelente  atrapante  los personajes tan bien delimitados  las descripciones tan bien realizadas que hasta puedes sentir el olor de las cosas    Algo de la trama me recordo el cuento El corazon delator de Allan Poe  muy recomendable  I hesitated to give it 5 stars because there are some things that bug me about this book  but oh boy is this a good book  I m no fanatic about Russian literature  but then it s been 10 years since I my first reading  My second reading  accomplished largely over the course of 2 or 3 very early morning reading sessions  was absolutely thrilling  It s a book meant to be devoured  and it s just so full of everything  The structure is fascinating  the characters are great  especially the vilest ones  reminded me of Dickens in this way  except really really dark   And the psychology is like lighting on the page  The police inspector was my favorite character  altho I really liked the scenes where Luzhin started some awful sh t and then got called out on it  It s nice too to read a  great  book that doesn t devour one s own self  the way 2666 did  of course there s really no comparison here at all   let me just say it was nice to read something brilliant and original and still fresh after 140 years   Wow  This book is amazing  I feel like it could be a great Lenten read if time is made for it  Particularly with the end s turning of focus towards Resurrection  I have to confess that I lost interest around the halfway point for months  but once I hit part three it was like a steamroller  A deep look into the human spirit  the Gospel  sin and identity   If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake  That will be his punishment  as well as the prison  Crime and Punishment was a very different literary experience for me  it was the first novel that I found myself completely immersed into the psychology of the protagonist not knowing what to expect next I felt as if I were there in place of Raskolnikov experiencing his tortured emotions of feverish despair and trapped in his own maddening thoughts of the grave crime he had committed  The novel reflected several themes that are still prevalent in today s society  the varying motives of criminals  poverty and religion which makes it still relevant  He had suffered for almost the entirety of the novel and is only actually showing hints of redemption and reflecting a renewal of spirit during his later years of his sentence  I honestly can not express in words how much this novel has created an impact on me  and no doubt has affected other readers as it is quite relatable  We are drawn in by the apt use of language by Dostoevsky channeling his own tortured experiences relating human suffering be it economical  pathological or emotional  He also gives us hope at the end of the novel  that sometimes we just need to start again despite what has transpired in our lives  I am greatly impressed by Dostoevsky and I look forward to reading his other notable works  The Brothers Karamazov and Notes from the Underground   Def one of my favs  i finished in 3 days  even tho it has like 700 pages in Chinese version   really hard to put down  and literally haunted me in dreams for quite a while  truly a masterpiece  also my favourite of all his books  Actual rating is like 4 59 because of the ending I didn t think it would be so easy to read  but it was  I don t know if I got the entire anti Russian nihilism  but I ve read a bit of Camus so the ideas did not fly completely over my head It was a nice story  nice progression  great names that I finally remember characters after the first 1 3 of the book The ending  Why  Why did you have to kill my poor Raskolnikov like that   not literally kill Could have skipped the epilogue  I think The character of Raskolnikov was well written  and I found his inner monologues interesting instead of having to trudge through them  Just how the character was so extreme  it was thought provoking to see how he  our Napoleon  would react to such a crime I feel like I know a lot more about Russian culture at that time  just what people communicate about is so interesting  I know that characters do not really talk about their philosophical ideas for 6 pages and on  no its more like how religious everyone was  how people would debate ideals for fun This was my first Dostoyevsky book  I m currently reading Brothers Karamazov  which seems to run faster  and keeps my attention for longer  I got through 1 4 on the first day  so it is pretty quick  and I find a lot of the characters way more interesting   Some of the names are the same  and that confused me for a second  see  Katerina Ivanova  or  Lizabeta   a name Dostoyevsky seems to dislike On a side note  can someone tell me how much a ruble would have been at that time  This book is easy to read and clearly understandable  The reason for this is that Dostoevsky is an extremely good writer and his language is addressed to all centuries  Especially  the best part is how well he describes the characters  You learn and understand the main character as if he is your brother or son or any of your relative  I strongly recommend it for young reader who likes to read classics   We all make mistakes  Some people make big mistakes  And try to cover them up  Other people make it their business to bring hidden deeds to light  The interrogation scene in this book is extraordinary for its perspicacity  a clarity of vision that penetrates to the heart of the human psyche  Winner  Ucuncu kez okudugum  insanin okudugu her donemde farkli tatlar aldigi basyapit  Insan psikolojisini anlatmakta zaten zirve bir yazar Dostoyevski  bu zirve yazarin zirve eseri de Suc ve Ceza olunca alinan zevk cifte katlaniyor  This is a GREAT book of literature  It is a mesmerizing  hypnotizing  fascinating look at the human mind and its drives and motivations  The book s central concerns are so varied and so relevant as to take away one s breath  What is covered  Only the nature of man  the nature of evil  the conflict between fate and free will  the effects of poverty and environment on the psyche  the significance of dreams  the moral dilemmas inherent in utilitarianism  the significance of suffering  the effects of guilt  the nature of existential action  the difference between ordinary and extraordinary human beings  and perhaps most importantly  the possibility for redemption   Crime and Punishment  takes us into the congested  stinking  summer streets of St  Petersburg in 1865 and forces us to contemplate the geography of our own mind by following the sick anxiety of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov as he contemplates murder  and does it  then suicide  and rejects it   The punishment that follows is gothic  thriller like  We meet doppelgangers and doubles  and we watch as the detective Porfiry Petrovich hunts him down using psychoanalytical tools new to the time  Dostoyevsky is acutely aware of the troubles inherent in the modern mind  the conflict between spirituality religion God and the desire for free will greatness social progress  Some people find Raskolnikov  whiny   and in a way he is  but what he is whining about concerns mankind s social ills  and they are not trivial  I first read this novel in high school  I did not find it an easy read then  But I could not get Raskolnikov out of my mind  His behavior fascinated me   and although my situation was nothing like Raskolnikov s  I couldn t help but understand his anger and his self loathing  Alfred Kazin said that Raskolnikov is Dostoyevsky s Hamlet  his  deranged prince   a prince passing through great turmoil  unkind to those who love him best  suspicious of everyone  a prince who has killed          out of impatience at his own weakness   yet a prince nevertheless  one of the true souls among men   To me  he is also a prince of suffering  He is one of the most tortured souls in literature  and although I was never a complete fan of the epilogue  I always loved him and wished and wished that he would find his peace in that pastoral Siberian prison Dostoyevsky puts him in  The writing is concentrated  purposeful  Every scene works to advance the possibility of Raskolnikov s confession and  resurrection   All of the primary symbols of the unconscious are here  blood  water  enclosed spaces  coffins  closets  are but to name a few  Characters pop up as if they arrive from  underground  as reminders of guilt  There are rumors of women raped  children who hang themselves in garrets  and beatings  There is nowhere that Raskolnikov can go to escape the violence  the depravity  and worse  the horror of his own crime  This is a marvelous book  Do not let the complexity and the length deter you from reading

principio asusta tanto por su longitud como por su dificultad  Mucho pensamiento metido en los dialogos  seria interesante leer trabajos criticos de la novela  sobre todo la teoria polifonica que hizo Bajtin sobre la obra   En fin  personajes inolvidables y una carga filosofica  etica y moral muy grande  Una obra sumamente compleja  repito  Probablemente vuelva a leerla otra vez por si se me perdieron detalles con la primera lectura  Me parece interesante destacar que  habiendo sido escrita a mitades del siglo XIX  sigue siendo actual  tocando temas que siguen estando en boca nuestra hoy en dia  Un lujo haberlo leido  Paso a formar parte de mis novelas favoritas instantaneamente  I loved this book because it was challenging     although it did get a little boring at first it did keep me interested    whoever is intrigued by the art of crime I highly recommend you to read this especially if you are into Law   Order  This book was great I think anyone who has ever read  Beyond Good and Evil  should definitely read this    I feel like they re very much related  due to Raskolnikov s thoughts on morality As great as this book was  I am DEFINITELY not reading it again  Ever  It s a struggle to get through after 50   If you re going to read this book  you had better be committed  Another of my favorites    again because of the character exploration  It really gets into the psyche of a killer  Hits home for me because it ultimately denounces the death penalty and shows how a person can change for the better  100  Psicologia  con unas conversaciones entre Raskolnikov y Porfirio Petrovich que son la repera limonera  Dedicado a todos los que ven el asesinato como un tramite para un fin mayor  y la razon dio paso a la vida  Favourite book of all time One of my favorite books all time  In my top 3  probably takes  1  but it switches with Moby Dick or The Whale from time to time  I can t even talk about this book it is so good  You don t read this book  you live it  Yes  one of my favorite books  rwy  shhyr  lldyb lrwsy lkbyr dystwyfsky 1821 1881  tnwl fyh qS  qtl mrby  mn qbl shb y ny mn fqr wzm  nfsy  wblrGm mn Dkhm  Hjm lrwy  l nh t tbr fy qm  ltHlyl lnfsy lbTl

I am a Russophile when it comes to literature  as anyone who knows me fully understands  my diatribe is in a Chekhov review   This novel fully portrays the mind of a man in desperation  desperate for money  desperate for purpose  desperate for companionship  desperate to be with his own demons  At the end is it the hunger that drove him to murder or just to see what happens when you cross the line  I think it s more the latter  The human condition is so complex and the matrices that make up decisionmaking are so intricate  At any time we can make the wrong move and it can be life changing  This book shows that we really are closer to Raskolnikov than we care to admit  Reading this book again  First read it in high school because it seemed to be a classic  and loved it  Remains one of my favorite tragedies  not the downfall of Raskolnikov  but arrogance  the downfall of man  I plan to read some of his other works soon but this was definitely a great novel  and I don t know if he could top it  Recommended if you like books that keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end   Very difficult book until I got into the flow  The story is so relatable and vulnerable  It does take effort to understand the Russian culture but mostly  he s writing about all of us who acknowledge our human weakness  covering and exposure  I m not sure about the  rendering  from another  author  as they suggest  I m all about unabridged versions from the original author     At least until I need help understanding  which does happen  Read this book for the first time this year in school as a junior  Although the over analytic perception of my english teacher made me a bit apathetic  I loved the storyline  Raskolnikov is truly a character that surprises you  but has enough substance to his character that may or may not make you adore him  Honestly   and I don t know if this is a spoiler or not     I felt like the actually murdering was done really quickly  but then everything around it  the suspense  made me want to keep reading  Keep in mind that the murder happens fairly early in the book   its the  punishment  part that leads the story to it s inevitable  sorry   ending  This is my favourite book  For a book to be a classic such as this it has stood the test of time  yet still I find some to be quite a hard read  But not Crime   Punishment  it feels in some ways like it could have been written today  Love the writing style  the way I connected and could visualise everything  sooo goooooodddddddddd  sooo goooooooooodddd  I loveeeeeee thisssssss booookkkkk  love it  the writing the story  I bet its so much better in Russian  I dont know  its entertaining and I like it   An amazing and frightening story  What is very interesting   the narration allowes you follow the main character s  Raskol nokov s thoughts and the development of his consciousness  And it describes distinctly the everyday life and problems of poor Russian families  like Marmeladov s one  The book impressed me  though I didn t read it when I should have done it   in the 10th school grade  in fact I read it last summer  4 years after graduating from school  I think  the book shows what the real clemency can be like  The clemency which is able to forgive  to understand  and that is narrowly connected to love   Or maybe it s love the thing that contains clemency Though I think I coulnd t act like Sonya Marmeladova  I understand her  Her thoughts and feelings  emotionals seem closer to mine  Anyway I understand WHY she followed and forgave Raskol nikov  I think it s an example of goodness  And it s important to have goodness in your heart  we are human beings first of all  If you understand what I mean  I count myself quite lucky that I read this after visiting St  Petersburg last month  Found having been to the city lent much to my reading of the book Also pleased that my general vibe of the city was repeated by Dost  to a T  Bleak  depressing  smelly  enormous divide between rich   poor  general feeling of hopelessness  Or maybe I just identified too much with our main character  So lovely to read great literature after that spate of 3 books from Walmart  Ahhh  the intricate examinations of minute by minute changes in humor over the course of conversation  Brilliant  Reminded me of Butler s  The Way of All Flesh   On the brink of stream of consciousness writing Have to say the anti Semitic character descriptions and phrases were a bit of a downer  Tend to get terribly depressed when read yet more evidence of what a  bad rap  Jews have gotten throughout the ages  And this was written right before another fierce spate of pogroms in Russia  though not as fierce as the ones in 1881 following the Tsar s assassination  when Jews were blamed  Of course Germans get a bad rap too  On the whole  an excellent example of how the  new world  really did promise a new beginning  an escape from brutally confining stereotypes  Yeah  it s great to be a Puritan nation   So lovely to read a book written before the coming of movies  Not plotted like books today that are written so as to be easily be turned into a screenplay  Ah  the longing for the great serial novels of the past  Come back  Dickens  Oh Wow  I can t simply believe my stupidity in putting off reading this book for so long  It is a poignant masterpiece which sheds light on human emotions and general state of human ness  From depravity to vanity and simple minded devotion  it touches on everything  This is a magnificent book  Read it   WOW   what a thriller  It is like ancient CSI and Criminal Minds  I can now understand why it is such a classic  VERY well written and paced  it is a nail biter the whole way through  I found myself to be sympathetic and disgusted with Raskolnikov   and I was as equally perturbed as he was by his mother and sister    rolling my eyes   I will definitely read more Dostoevsky  This was a GREAT read and well deserved of the 5 stars     Have you ever thought about the insane  Murder  death  or how about love  Ever give those strong words a thought  If you have  then I got a book for you  Crime and Punishment by the author of Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a thrilling novel that takes you through the mind of a corrupt man  Is there anything worse than murder  Raskolnikov commits a crime  but is never found guilty  He finds anger towards his mother and sister  for not telling him of his sister s fiance Porfiry Petrofich  Both end up battling each other to see who is more intelligent and who will win the heart of Raskolnikov s sister  Detectives linger on trying to find the man who committed the crime  Clues are sought and the race against time is on  but what will happen  Will Raskolnikov get together with Sonia  the only girl who has attempted to comfort him  or will be caught  and die in prison  Why don t you read and find out  If only questions were easier to answer  This book takes us through emotions and fate  Can one battle against his destiny  and what gives a man the  right  to kill  Crime and Punishment takes us through it all  but beware  it can bring emotional downfall  Are you brave enough to venture through the dark depths of the corrupt human mind  Simply Brilliant  I will have to say that there were pages upon pages that may seem dry and difficult to get through at times  but overall  I loved this book and it actually changed the way I saw the world  huge  for me at least   Simply a great piece of literature and a stunning peak into the mind of someone so unlike myself  I actually started thinking like the character  Dostoyevsky manages to convey Russian sentiments like no other   wl qr  ldwstwyfsky wll db lrwsy  mwman ln tkwn akhr qr   bdan   hkdh lrwyt tktb     ytHsr lmr  l  lmstw  ldhy wSlt lh

lnfsy   jyb  k nh hw mrW btjrb  mmthl   tmn   n   wd lqry th qryb jdan    This is one of those books that you re almost afraid to admit that you like  I love Russian lit because of its verbose nature  I discovered that writers got paid by the word so that s why Russian novels are seven day long   Raskolinov is one of those characters who is so caught up in his own grief and guilt that he creates his own world with its own moral code  Only problem is  he never bothered to let anyone else in on the rules  It s one of my favs but it always takes me several days to read and process the meaning  I actually really liked this book  despite the fact that half my class didn t  Though the writing style was a little dense at times  it was necessary to completely portray the protagonist s psyche and his warring mental states  I have not been a great fan of all the classics  This is an exception  I felt every single pain Raskolnikov  This book describes a tortured soul that is feeling the guilt of committing a murder  The internalized torture of the protagonist is real and as accurately depicted as it could have been  The great thing about the book is that it offers a way out for the tortured soul  even if the result is not the most desirable  I would suggest this book for anyone who enjoys analyzing the human psyche  I first read this novel in high school  and found it so compelling that I carried it with me and read it during moments when I was supposed to be doing something else   Crime and Punishment  is a must read for all serious lovers of literary fiction  Readers interested in history  psychology  sociology and related topics should read it as well  Worth every day I spent reading it   I read this before I went on holiday to Russia because I thought I would learn something about the country    It was harrowing     no food   no shoes    no rubles etc   Every time I went to read the book I felt similar to when I go for a run  IE  DREADING IT but glad afterwards  It was one of the best books I ve read  I can t be bothered describing why it is so good  but it made me enjoy my time in Russia even more   This is one of the great books in literature  I found that this was a slow book for most of the story but what makes it great is that the author makes you think and often question yourself  In life today  many of us will always job to one side of a particular kind of problem but Dostoyevsky doesn t let that happen for too long in this book  The main character s actions throughout the book will make any reader rethink any assertions that had created while reading this book  The author does a great job of keeping the reader guessing  struggling to put the book down  He does this not with the action in the book but with many of the small decisions the main character has to make  The life that the character portrays can be related to many peoples  lives  The choices we make are sometimes very good and sometimes very bad  which makes the book and the main character so likeable and human  I found myself rooting for him throughout the story  regardless of his actions  Read the book if you want a suspenseful  crafting story of good and bad  Many people will be horrified with the actions displayed in the book but they simply don t realize how many things in common they have with the protagonist   I would have been happy with just crime  This is  of course  one of the great novels of all time  Fyodor Dostoyevsky created a number of truly wonderful works over time  such as  The Brothers Karamazov    The Gambler   and  The Devils   or  The Possessed    The  Translator s Introduction  to  Crime and Punishment  provides useful context  David Magarshack  the translator  observes that  page 11        the main theme     had occupied Dostoyevsky ever since he gave up his career in the army to devote himself to literature   Shortly thereafter  Magarshack quotes Dostoyevsky himself from an earlier work   White Knights   with the author saying  page 11     It is said that the proximity of punishment gives rise to real repentance in the criminal and sometimes arouses remorse in the most hardened heart  it is said to be chiefly due to fear   Thus  there is a psychological element to this novel  whether is approximates reality or not  I have my doubts that a lot of criminals really repent and show remorse  but that is neither here nor there   The novel itself was important for Dostoyevsky since  as was not uncommon  he was in dire financial straits  He signed a contract to provide a serialization of the work to a literary publication  This is apparent at some points  when different parts of the novel may not fit together so well or when certain strands of discourse aren t fully developed  The protagonist  Raskolnikov  faces a series of problems  For one thing  he is a student who faces dire poverty and has a difficult time just making ends meet  At another level  he has a sense that special human beings can be above the law and so on to do great deeds  These two factors plus others are interlinked to lead him to murder a pawnbroker to help gain enough money to survive  On being  superman   Raskolnikov says at one point  page 276    I simply hinted that the  extraordinary  man has a right  not an officially sanctioned right  of course  to permit his conscience to step over certain obstacles  but only if it is absolutely necessary for the fulfillment of his idea on which possibly the welfare of all mankind may depend   And  in a following commentary  page 277         I maintain that all men who are not only great but a little out of the common     must by their very nature be criminals         After committing the murder  he begins to come apart  as he suspects that people know of his deed  In another plot twist  after meeting a civil servant  Marmalodov  he comes to be attracted to his daughter  Sonya  He comes to confess to her of his deed  Later  he falls in love with her  but his imprisonment means that they would need to delay a life together  She follows him to Siberia  and the novel ends with hope for the future  This is one of the great novels  no doubt  There are problems  as noted above  with the development of the story and with its ending  almost deus ex machine   Nonetheless  an interesting psychological analysis of the human mind  Still worth reading long after he completed writing it in 1866  Raskolnikov remains one of the great characters in literature  and his slow unraveling after the murder creates gripping drama   tHfh nsnyh   n  shq kl Hrf yktbh dstwfysk  qr th bjzy h lsth w tmn  lw ytsn  l  n qrh mrr f  Hyt  rGm n  l Hb n  yd qrh sh  m Hbk y dstwfysk  b mq    it has a great and special significance  we need the kind of love that can inject our lives with fresh meaning brilliant story that illustrates the importance of loyalty and purpose along with the idea of existential despair and then maybe we can understand the correct course of humanity  One of my three most favorite books of all time   The other two being The Brothers Karamazov and David Copperfield I was 13 or 14 when i first read it for school  it was the first grown up book that i had read  and it ended up being the book that made me fall in love with the classics I have re read it since and I m definitely planning to read it again A must read for every Dostoevsky fan The book is thrilling and exciting from beginning to end  It sucks you into its world and there is no way out until you finish it  A long read that took me a long while    but worth it  Psychological  meticulous  a simple story told profoundly   WOW this book was the biggest surprise EVER for me  After reading War and Peace earlier this year I decided I no longer needed to be intimidated by classic Russian lit  but I never expected to enjoy this book as much as I did  I DEVOURED this story  One of my top 5 favorites I ve read all year    This simply blew my mind  Easily the best novel I ve read till now  Brilliant characters that are as much flesh and blood as they are fantastical  Most of them are round characters whom we see transform throughout the course of the novel  Raskolnikov is the perfect antihero  Svidrigaylov  the incredible conundrum  Sonya  the solid rock  Razumikhin  the male maternal figure  Porfiry  the infuriating justice seeker  and Dunya  the sacrificial figure  But what s awesome is the fact that none of these can be limited by these descriptions  and are far more This novel changes the way we look at crime and absolution  The imagery is terrifying and yet beautiful  There are scenes that are disturbing and yet are bound to touch your heart  Surely  this must be what they call a masterpiece  Read this way back in high school for my senior research paper  It s been quite a while since I ve read it  but at the time I remember it being very long  very smart and VERY intense  Magnificent  I m almost convinced Dostoevsky murdered someone for this book Ouch  This book opens with one of the most brutal looks at internal guilt  Picture a constant barage of inner demons driving someone to insanity  I read it during a season of my life when I was being attacked with guilt over a difficult decision  Fortunately  the book  and my life moved on from the punishment theme to other themes  The book is filled with hilarious characters  So is my life   I don t do long reviews  Maybe I ll go into more detail at a later date As far as I am concerned  this novel is among  if not  the   greatest work of literature ever written  Realistic and beautiful  Despairing and in a way  hopeful  A novel that makes almost every other attempt at examining guilt and conscience look like  Blues Clues   How do you think  does it worth reading  Definitely not  if you aren t ready to continue living with a broken and sick mind  Although  they do feed us this book in schools  school is not a suitable place for it  Re read it later  and you ll change your mind again and again  That s how it works with Dostoevsky   he is an every age writer  Dostoevsky was a brilliant psycho  A true damaged mind of his own time  If you are familiar with his own life story  you know what I mean  And his characters are never alright themselves  Like Rodion Raskolnikov  who is a promising character  He could make a great macho or an unforgettable rebel  But poverty draws him to committing a murder  And there it begins  a detective story where you are left on the wrong side of justice  Wondering what justice really is  Personally  I think I will never forget being physically sick along with Raskolnikov  But well  we have social topics  we have moral questions  and we combine them through philosophy  There it is    Crime and Punishment  is a way to share a philosophy that Dostoevsky created  but wasn t ready to support  So he used Rodion to do it for him  Mesterlig krimi  og er smukt eksempel pa klassikere  der er blevet klassikere fordi de fortaeller en god historie  der bliver ved med at vaere spaendende og vedkommende  i modsaetning til dem der blev kanoniseret og nu bor laeses for deres historiske vaerdi  fordi de er klassikere    Raskolnikov er Nietzsches overmenneske og undermenneske og Gud er  maske ikke  dod  Men det er Nietzsche der har laest Dosto  ikke omvendt  Sonja Marmeladova er bade luder og madonna  og sadan er der hele vejen store tematikker pa spil  Romanens alder maerkes kun i beskrivelsen af fattigdom og usle kar  jeg ser meget arbejdermuseum for mig   for hele persongalleriet er yderst levende og nutidigt beskrevet   det er en overraskende moderne roman   mon ikke det til dels skyldes Jan Hansens friske oversaettelse  I hvert fald yderst laeselig og uden brug for  oversaettelse  pga  sproglig eller indholdsmaessig aelde  Og et vaerk fra 1866  der kan klare sig med 4 siders noter til at tage lidt russiske titler  sorgegrod og tiltaleskik er enten brandgodt oversat eller en eviggyldig klassiker   jeg mistaenker at der her er tale om et bade og  Smuk oversaettelse   faenomenalt vaerk Jeg har ikke laest de russiske klassikere for  delvist fordi det lod sa besvaerligt at holde styr pa stor persongallerier af folk der hele tiden blev kaldt noget nyt   men det er egentlig ikke sa besvaerligt at holde styr pa  Raskolnikov  efternavn i omtale  Rodion Romanovitj  fornavn   paternym  i hojlig tiltale   og sa Rodja som kaelenavn nar mor og soster er pa banen  Det gar snildt  Sa bare se at komme i gang  det er alle 678 sider vaerd  folk bliver frygteligt imponerede over det og du har den jo alligevel staende pa reolen fra et optimistisk bogklubtilbud engang  ikke  This book contains the themes of guilt  redemption  forgiveness  and love amongst other things  A young but isolated intellectual murders a pawn broker to prove that he is an  extraordinary man   Supermen are not bound by the laws that lesser men have to follow  Supermen can judge inferior beings and murder for thier own personal gain without a shred of remorse  However  Raskolnikov does not achieve this goal because he still has humanity and a heart  He is soon torn apart by guilt and to make matters worse he finds out that one of his victims was the only friend of his love interest  He wishes to confess his crimes to Sonya  but is afraid that she will reject him when she finds out his horrible deed  Eventually he does confess and she amazingly forgives him  He then goes through a Christian rebirth and seeks out redemption  This book is amazing in its character psychology  storytelling  and philosophy  C P boldly rejected the cutting edge theories of morality coming out of Western Europe especially Germany  at the time  The ideology of the  extraordinary man  that Raskolnikov follows in the beginning of the novel is similar to Nietzsche s ubermensch  although Nietzsche didn t write Zarathustra until after C P was written  It is interesting that Dostoevsky rejects the works of Nietzsche and others like him from the approach of an intellectual and not a close minded bible thumper like so many of Nietzsche s opponents  Dostoevsky was a socialist in his youth and member of a radical group that ended up causing him jail time in Siberia following a mock execution  Dostoevsky became disillusioned with the new Western ideology because he saw its infinite potential for exploitation by tyrants as outlined in The Demons  Dostoevsky converted to Christianity and believed that Christian morality and the Golden Rule were the best path for Russia to follow  Dostoevsky was indeed correct that when anti Christian communism and post moral philosophy came to Russia it wasn t long before Stalin came into power and killed millions to further his own power  The fact that Dostoevsky s rejection of post morality is well thought out and not simply a knee jerk reaction is one reason why Nietzsche had a profound respect for Dostoevsky despite thier differences of opinion  This book is very dark and fairly depressing  so it isn t for everyone  It is though one of my personal favorites  I have to admit  this might not actually be the translation I read  I can t remember the translator  But as for the book itself   well  it s just one of the best  A lot of people have said that  and I never really understood why they said it  But upon re reading it  I realized that the reason it s so good is that it really makes you think  Raskolnikov s trials are not so unique to him in literature  but his reactions to them are  and the way his mind works really does start to affect you  and it makes you think about a lot of different social and personal topics  Cannot recommend enough  Crime  Punishment  Sin   Redemption  Brilliant Book  I meant to read this novel when I was in my 20s  but somehow never got around to it  in part  because an intellectual friend of mine  who was given to dark views of human nature  would sometimes  especially after a few stiff drinks  work dramatic references to Dostoevsky into his dour laments on the human condition  It sort of scared me off  why make the commitment to such a long book from another century and another continent  I reasoned at the time  only to be reminded that my life is dreary and struggle is futile I m glad I finally decided to read this masterpiece even if it is thirty years later  although choosing to read it during the week of final exams  when students and faculty alike are stressed out by deadlines and demands  and rationalizations and excuses for work left undone multiply around me  was probably not a wise timing  The novel did not tell me life was futile  though it did cast a remarkably astute look at the grim inequities of the social condition for so many  in a realistic way that kept making me stop and remind myself  Dostoevsky wrote this in 1866  What a literary groundbreaker he was And his deep psychological insights  before modern psychology had developed  startled me  So much of modernism has ancestral roots here  I had never understood that before  He made me truly identify with and care about the perspectives of a cold blooded murderer  and was a demonstrated master at creating a sense of hopelessness in the throes of bureaucracy  or one s conscience  for that matter  well before Kafka  Of course I would never support anyone actually doing what Raskolnikov did to that greedy old pawnbroker  but  both philosophically and spiritually  I think I am actually a better  more reflective person for having vicariously gone through that exercise and its subsequent aftermath with him  Thank you  Fyodor   Lapsed student Raskolnikov  finds himself almost compelled to carry out his plan to murder the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna  and he then also kills her sister Lizaveta when she walks in on scene of the crimeMotivation appears to be combination of desire to secure funds to rise from his current status and reduce his dependancy on his mother and sister and avoid their having to make sacrifices  such as ill advised marriage  to secure his future  and in part in his belief that normal moral codes do not apply to so called Napoleons  exceptional individuals for whom their extraordinary ends should justify the meansRaskolnimov is continually ill during the novel and is consumed by his shame Best character for me is Porfiry Petrovich the cheif investigating officer  with his apparent bumbling ineptitude and habit of confiding in the suspect   precursor for Inspector Columbo This is my new favorite book  It beat out Wuthering Heights  Once again Russian authors trump all the rest  Dostoyevsky has a magical talent that makes you fall in love with Raskolnikov and hope he ends in good spirits  despite his actions  I just finished it a month ago and already want to reread it  During  I couldn t wait to find out what happened  but also never wanted it to end  Make sure that you are mature when you read it  Just like an adolescent might think Romeo and Juliet is a love story instead of an infatuation  there are some things I don t think are well understood unless you re older I have to laugh at one point   a pattern I ve noticed in Russians  They laugh harder  stay angrier longer  get into a deeper depression compare to any other  and argue intellectually more abstractly than any other group I can tell   Most definitely one of the best books I ve ever read  In my opinion Dostoyevsky s masterpiece   Taking a new step  uttering a new word  is what people fear most   I ve had a bit of an affair with Russian authors before chancing upon Dostoyevsky  From Nabokov s Lolita to a few short stories of Tolstoy and Gogol  Russian works had a special corner of admiration in my heart  After finishing Crime and Punishment  I can very well say that this corner has grown into a large  spacious room  a room full of reverence  Such is the effect that every eccentric character of this genius work left upon me  Rodion  the central character of great intellect  undergoing through great misery and circumstantial pressure  part of which is a false construction from his excessively paranoid brain   finds himself plummeting towards a hideous murder and the guilt that follows soon after  Rodion has all qualities that one may ascribe to a hero or an anti hero  he may even be loathsome to several readers  His monomania  self obsessed behavior and ruthless  flawless intellect renders him as a charming personality  What is crime  What  in essence  it really is  Who defines it  And why  And how  Isn t morality only a matter of perspective  Dostoyevsky points plethora of such poignant questions  on a backdrop of the evils of then Russian society  which is very relatable to that of urban India  through his formidable array of characters  and leaves the reader biting his nails in what is also a  what will happen next  kind of thriller  While the prose is mainly governed by dialogue and little authorial observation  it s the characters  introspection and psychological analysis of each other that bowled me off my feet  This is one of those novels in which you  only few pages in  become aware of the potential of literary treasure that you hold in your hands  Final Verdict  If you re slightly eccentric  have occasionally looked down upon your fellow human beings  and live in a self constructed invisible bubble foaming with delusions of grandeur  you ll love this book  And of course  go for it  if you re otherwise sane and have a great interest in human psychology   classic literature  Overall  it can be a highly disturbing book for the common reader  and hence recommended with caution   This is a fantastic book  one I would suggest to any brave and dedicated reader  I thoroughly enjoyed it  although I would not suggest it to those people who need lots of action  This is a thinking book     The philosophies set forth are entirely interesting   This book is a classic for a reason and I highly recommend it  The sweeps of emotion from base desires Roskolnikov lets loose  to his guilt  to his redemption are powerful  The people who care for him are well drawn  i e Sonia  Razumikhin   I ve always particularly enjoyed the cat and mouse game the unstable Roskolnikov plays with Porfiry Petrovich  Crime and Punishment first came to me in college  almost 50 years ago  I m sure I read the Constance Garnett translation then  A couple of years ago I read the McDuff translation and sent a copy to a friend in prison  I wanted him to read something that impressed me when I was his age  And I wanted to be able to dscuss it with him  I looked at bits of several translations  both online and in bookshops  It is astonishing how different the translations are  Do you want to read it in the English of the 19th century or in the American of the 20th or 21st centuries  Well now I want to read it again in Russian The book is about guilt and atonement  fear and a sort of absolution  If that comes through  the translation is okay  The most in depth and gripping look into the psyche of a broken yet plausible man  who s sense of morals and justice twist along with the plot  What is crime  who is a criminal  and do we have any right to judge these people  Crime and Punishment presents questions that we don t think of on our own  and makes us question a concept which has existed within humanity for hundreds of years  I see Crime and Punishment in Everything now  From Nouvelle Vague  please try and tell me A Bout de Souffle isn t so C P y   to The Mountain Goats songs  Love its permeability and applicability  Love it   This book was really hard to read for me  It was pretty slow  all the Russian names were confusing  and it was morose  I really was on the fence about it going into the last twenty pages  but it concluded so well that I loved it  I can t exactly explain why the events were as redemptive as they were  I just know that the smallest bit of grace in a sea of morbidness was nearly euphoric  Brilliant  Assume mankind is divided into two classes  ordinary and extraordinary  Do extraordinary men have an obligation to abide by their own moral code and transcend societal law  If no  then governing principles may remain forever stagnant   divorcees would still be stoned and atheists executed for their speech  But if yes  are men not self centered egoists that would each wrongly consider himself extraordinary  If all men followed their individual moral codes  we d follow mankind straight into anarchy This vital argument that threads itself throughout the novel is framed by a broader  older philosophical question  Is despotism preferable to anarchy  I m convinced that this is true  and thus the epilogue left me wondering if God is truly a despot   But a million different readings of Crime   Punishment could produce a million different answers to this essential question  It s up to the reader to pick up on cues in the raw  realist and still currently relevant dialogue and to see into the brilliantly  imperfectly crafted minds of each character  Whatever your answer  Dostoevsky s classic is an absolutely quintessential read for philosophical   psychological   Russian   19th century literature  N B  Referring to man and mankind and using male pronouns was done out of convenience  not in any way a stylistic choice  Obviously  moral conundrums apply to women  too  A page turner  a compelling case against radical ideologies  and  above all  a masterpiece I will come back to  I read the romanian translation of this  Love it  dr  jnyt w mkhft  b hzrtwhy dhhn

days ago  I felt guilty about reading other books while another was currently lying at my bedside  Resisting the urge to crawl comfortably on the sofa  I grit my teeth and kept reading and reading it seriously for two nights  I was a bit confused at first because I couldn t remember anything  But gradually it all came back to me I was only glad that I didn t have to read about Raskolnikoff s  Did I get his name right   delirious state again  One of the most boring experiences of my life I was satisfied with the ending  Old Rasko got what he deserved  Yes I say so even when I like him  He s a complicated character governed by his life s theories  I liked his personality and his self possession  Even though this book must have been the longest I ve ever taken to finish  my review ends here  I m finally going to start another book without feeling bad for the first time in months  Crossing my fingers that it ll turn out to be a good one    It is an understatement to say that this is my favorite Dostoyevsky novel  or that it is my favorite novel EVER  It s funny to think that this novel was forced on me in AP English Lit in high school  especially since it is my all time favorite novel  As an English and Psychology major  i love that i can analyze this novel from two different perspectives  but i tend to learn towards a psychological analysis more  The psychological aspect of the novel is so beyond amazing that sometimes i wish Dostoyevsky was alive so that i can have a conversation with him  to find out why he went about creating Raskolnikov s diliriums  and hallucinations the way he did  I wonder what Dr  Freud would have said about his state of consciousness  and the human psyche  probably that it is a matter of principle  as in how his psyche conditions  his impulses  and his actions relate to his principles  To summarize this novel in one sentence is as follow  the novel is about the fluctuating mental state of 23 year young Raskolnikov as he commits a hedious crime  becomes tormented about being caught  and finally turns himself in  A lot of readers will say that he was tormented by guilt  but i am not most readers and i immensely disagree  I believe that he never felt guilt or remorse for what he did to the pawnbroker  in fact i think he was tormented because he didn t commit the prefect crime  The novel starts with Raskolnikov planning the perfect crime  he wants to murder Alyona because he considers her a  louse   hates her for cheating people  and inslaving her younger sister  He feels that he is doing a good deed for society by punishing  killing  Alyona  in a way it seems that he has label himself a  judge   or perhaps a  God  ala Light Yagami Kira from  Death Note   It s easy to see why  especially since he considers himself a part of the extraordinary people  I bet he thought it was his  duty  to kill her  this beings me back to the viewpoint that he did not feel guilty about killing her  he felt anxious that one of the construction workers saw him leave the pawnbroker s place  and thus the police would find him  Dostoyevsky s explicit discriptions of Rodka s pysche  nuerotic tendencies  diliriums  hallucinations  and cosciousness make for a great case study read of a literary character   I bought this edition  the Constance Garnett translation  for a dollar at my  friends of the library  bookstore  That was the best dollar I ever spent  For a book written in the middle of the last century  it seems surprisingly modern  Dostoyevsky had a good handle on psychology  The characters are believable down to their inner lives  The author also has a Dickensian gift for capturing the essence of people in different strata of society I liked this novel far better than The Brothers Karamazov  which came later  In fact  it s in my top five favorite novels  maybe number one   Since I don t speak Russian  I have no beef with Garnett s translation  Dostoyevsky scholars seem to think that she murders the text but  as the Italians say   traduttore  traditore   It would be interesting to read the Pevear   Volokhonsky translation someday but I m fine with the one I read for now  Sin palabras  Soberbio  magnifico y maravilloso  Wonderful sketching of how external stimuli from society shapes the inward struggles of a man  The entire story was told in a rather dark and brooding manner  depicting the often depressed and raging thoughts of the hero  It made me depressed as well  but what can I say  it s definitely worth the read  Absolutamente genial y 800  recomendada  toda muy envolvente y emocionante y magnanima  y a rasgos generales un thriller muy bueno  si  un thriller  tanto verdadero como psicologico   Con su buena carga tambien de cosa filosofica Lo malo  es una novela 100  Fedor Dostoyevsky  lo que significa algunas partes de lo que hoy dia yo considero melodramatismo y algunas otras cosas exageradas  pero era otra epoca y otra cultura y una gente que no conocemos  Just fenomenal  Dostoyevsky is a pure psychological genius  Please  in a long review like this  it is bound to have some spoilers  I have tried to limit it  and tried not to make this into a summary for students This is one book I cannot help but rant like a fangirl  To me  this is the  ultimate book   In a light perspective  it is an awesome thriller The grotesque but fascinating description of the murder  accompanied by the  delirious  thoughts of Raskilnikov    Later on with all this internal torment  and Porfiry s creepy way  which I just loved  with all those  hee hees    of pressuring Raskolnikov to confession  In a more serious perspective    it is awesome nevertheless But hark  There is more There is angelic Sonya and hedonistic Svidrigailov If I should throw few more in  we have demoralized Mermaldov and depraved Luzhin  With those characters  Crime and Punishment is a book that questions morality  Whether it is about life  fidelity and responsibility    it just somehow incorporates them all  Some are quite subtle  some are not Lizaveta s death  kind  devout sister of Alyona Ivanovna  who just had to step in when Raskolnikov just murdered Alyona  was what broke Raskolnikov the most   As in  oh the guilt  It s unbearable  It does make sense  because we are talking about the blood of an  innocent   When one works for the  greater good  or a  higher purpose   not only is there the extermination of  evil   though different from point of view and with a possible replacement word   there is always the sacrifice of the  innocent   similar to evil in this case   In war  we have death of the   evil   enemies  along with countless numbers of   innocent   civilians  During hard times  a company may fire people so that they don t go bankrupt  extermination of potential bankruptcy   However  aren t those people just as desperate to sustain their life and family  I could even talk about  heaven forbid  Dumbledore s antics with this one  Nevertheless  there is the moment when we trouble our ethics  for the  greater good  If I could add a bit more with this rant  which must bore you people all  I will say that this thinking also comes out in The Karamazov Brothers  or The Brothers of Karamazov  depends on what publisher   In Book 5 Chapter 4 Rebellion  Ivan  an intellectual   atheist  asks Alyosha  little brother  character which I see as Dostoyevsky s version of the Little Prince  Then again  I am not finished with this book   He asks  Imagine that you are charged with building the edifice of human destiny  whose ultimate aim is to bring people happiness  to give them peace and contentment at least  but that in order to achieve this it is essential and unavoidable to torture just one little speck of creation  that same little child beating her breast with her little fists  and imagine that this edifice has to be erected on her unexpiated tears  Would you agree to be the architect under those conditions   When Alyosha replies no  he goes on with  And could you accept the idea that the people for whom you are building the edifice have agreed to buy their own happiness with the price of the unexpiated blood of a tortured child  and that  having accepted this  they could remain happy forever   There is redemption  absolutely  at least for Raskolnikov   Probably the reason why I do not see Dostoyevsky based on his rather dark reputation for depressing stories   If we see authors in that perspective  Sir William Golding was a villain   When Raskilnikov  for inner peace confesses and finds love with Sonya     Both of them looked pale and thin  but in these ill  pale faces there now gleamed the dawn of a renewed future  a complete recovery to a new life  What had revived them was love  the heart of the one containing an infinite source of life for the heart of the other    Epilogue  Chapter 2   we see a happy ending  We have to understand Sonya being just too kind and angelic in this book  I am not a fan of such characters  and sometimes dislike hate them  I find them unattractive  for the lack of better words  However  I made Sonya an exception  even when she moved so that she can visit Raskolnikov in jail  The action is unrealistic and foolhardy  but it is nice  not irritating One word  ahem    few sentences  about  redemption  before I go on  Redemption in this book does not merely mean getting rid of guilt  It also means finding life  There is Svidrigailov  who is considered Raskolnikov s darker counterpart in some way  He ends with committing suicide  failed to find  life    I remember that it was strangely    sad  Not in the usual detached way when reading books  I felt that weird feeling crawling  more like  smarming   over me  At least that was my initial impression of his ending  It happened at the end of Part 6 Chapter 6  After going forward few pages  I came back and reread his nightmares  which he dreams just before his demise  and his death  I will just say I was not trying to be sentimental  I was in a beach  reading while other people were playing  splashing water against each other  and having fun  After rereading  I closed my book  looked at the horizon  and began to cry  Someone save me Oh  and concerning the drama of Russian novels in general    well  just get used to it  I once thought      I don t think anybody would actually act like that in real life   Hey  it takes time  Especially with this one filled with anxiety and delirium  At the end  it is one book I desperately wish to read again  I actually do  going through it time to time  I could say this book has changed my life  Perhaps it is because I am young  and I have yet to read hundreds of great book  Nevertheless  the moment I read this  I declared myself an avid fan of his   While I have authors I like  I was never a fan   It is powerful  It is more than a mere didactic novel  It is something I would recommend with fanatic craziness to anybody  One of my favorite books I ve ever read  An interesting mixture of the macro and the micro and how shifting societal platforms influence the ragged veins of a murderer that is somehow sympathetic in his clumsiness and self validation  The turmoil is absolutely wrenching  while the horror of the crime drifts throughout the ambiguity of the city  Disappointed in myself that it took me so long to finally begin it   Un viaje dentro de la psicologia de un joven atormentado por sus conflictivas ideas  Dostoyevsky es un maestro a la hora de describir el mundo interno de sus personajes  como si cada percepcion y reaccion fuese un hecho positivo y observable  y por lo demas esencial dentro de la trama  Esta atencion al detalle da lugar a que los cientos de paginas de esta novela describan solo un par de dias  y a cada evento se le importante se le dediquen decenas de paginas  A mi me atemorizaba este aspecto de la novela  pensando que su lentitud podria hacerla aburrida  pero en cambio dota a cada accion de gran peso e importancia  Desde el primer dia que lo lei no queria despegar los ojos para saber como resolveria Raskolnikof las consecuencias internas y externas de su crimen  o en que acabarias la historia de su hermana y otros personajes relevantes para la trama  A final de cuentas la conclusion ha sido suficientemente satisfactoria  con algunos episodios bastante intensos y memorables mas algunos temas dignos de analisis  como aquella que pudieramos considerar un antecedente a la teoria nietzscheana del superhombre  el problema de la culpa  la responsabilidad  la moral  la fe religiosa  etc    pero lo mejor ha sido la capacidad de Dostoyevsky para pintar cuadros en la cabeza del lector para una grata inmersion dentro de su turbada Petersburgo  Mencion para la traduccion de Jose Fernandez en la editorial Juventud  muy grata y fluida  con un mas que adecuado vocabulario  Perhaps one of the greatest novels ever written    you take this  and  Hamlet   and  The Grapes of Wrath   and that s all you need     mayhap  if not gratuitous to say   Year of the Golden Monkey  for dessert    Yes  okay  alright  fine  I ll stop       perhaps   I think this may be my favorite book of all time  I think Fyodor may have a future in novels    Dostoevsky  What more can I say  Pretty sure I need to read it again considering it s been years  Will probably appreciate it  and understand it better now   I would hope   I have it on here to swap because it is an older version  62  with small type that I can t read  fy kthyr shy lzm Hkyh

the translator was amazing as well   He is so good  I could have sworn he actually killed someone  They way he analyzes the criminal s mind and interior life is too accurate   scary  But excellent  Este cartea care mi a marcat adolescenta   si prima la care ma gandesc atunci cand ma intreaba cineva de ce sa citesc cartea cand pot sa vad filmul     Nu am intentia sa tin prelegeri legate de avantajul si farmecul cartilor  si nici nu vreau sa ponegresc lumea filmului  Sunt ecranizari foarte bine facute    succesul unei ecranizari sta in ochii privitorului   cum si a imaginat lumea descrisa in carte  cum vede cu ochii mintii personajele etc   dar nu am intalnit una sa fie mai buna decat cartea    Poate nu am citit eu suficiente carti  sau poate nu am vazut filmele care sa imi schimbe parerea Dostoievski este considerat un autor greu de citit  mie nu mi s a parut greu  ci profund  Personajele lui chiar daca nu sunt ancorate in realitate sunt asa de real descrise si creionate incat este imposibil sa nu empatizezi cu trairile lor  Lupta interioara a lui Rodin   revolta pe care am simtit o vis a vis de situatia nefericita in care se afla ca si tanar ce vrea sa faca ceva in viata si nu este sprijinit material  dezamagirea pe care am simtit o atunci cand a savarsit crima  m au fermecat si nu am putut sa las cartea din mana  Trebuie sa recunosc  apasarea pe care o simti dupa ce inchizi cartea trece greu  imi aduc aminte ca timp de o saptamana nu am inceput alta carte  simteam nevoia sa las timpul sa treaca   sa  rumeg  tot ce am simtit  sa filtrez informatiile Recomand cartea celor ce vor povesti reale  fara happy end  trairi profunde  personaje schitate fin si clar  Numai citind cartea poti sa iti faci o parere   iar cuvintele mele sunt mult prea sarace  I loved this book  It is a beautiful descent into the human mind as it s being destroyed by the guilt of murder  On top of that  the investigator is trying to find who the murderer is  Dostoevsky sets up some really nice scenes  my favorite being one beautiful conversation between the investigator and Raskolnikov  5 varskvlavi araa sakmarisi amist vis     I don t care who you are  what kind of literature you like  or what s happening in your life  you need to read Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky if you haven t already Just do it  Everyone should read this book  Only Dostoevsky could successfully portray a murderer with whom I could so closely identify  He gives us a window directly into the workings of the human mind  I often found myself reading a line of Raskolnikov s inner monologue and thinking  I think I ve done the exact same thing before  Also  Raskolnikov is not the only likable character  Everyone is flawed  but most of the characters have at least some admirable qualities  except for maybe a couple who are mostly just disgusting   And Rodya s school friend Razumikhin is downright charming  In short  this book is amazing and will make you feel a lot of things  After I finished it earlier today  all I could do was sit dumbly and bask in the warmth of a perfect story completed so effortlessly before my eyes   When Raskolnikov embedded his axe in the pawnbroker s head  he forfeited his humanity and embraced godhood  He abandoned his sanity and soul in the name of justice and extirpated a dangerous parasite from society  The idea of a man who breaks society s morals in the name of justice and becomes able to build a new ethic code haunted Western Literature for decades  which culminated with the idea of the ubermensch as stated by Nietzsche  However Raskolnikov himself became a monster when he killed an innocent woman in an attempt to save his own skin  He could become a victim of a justice seeker himself  However he found redemption in the hands of an ordinary woman  Sonia  The pawnbroker found justice in the form of punishment  Raskolnikov found it in the form of guilt and redemption  Pain cleansed him and led him to find illumination  As Baudelaire wrote  Praise be to You  O God  who send us suffering As a divine remedy for our impurities  It is a masterpiece and the characters are brilliantly sketched  It is dark and oppressive at times but the story held me to the end  Unlike a book I simply could not get into  Dorothy Sayers  Whose Body    Tense and disturbing  Great reading  This is definitely the most determinative book i ve read  I were in a strange period of my life  and my teacher recommended it for me   first  i didn t want to start it  but it entrained me  and i just forgot all the things around me  when i read  Miserable  disturbing  depressive   sometimes we need it  I can experience all the monologues  all the situations  and it affected me in a strange phisically way  i almost feel the pressure on my chest  Raskolnikov  Sonia   two ways of suffer  two ways of thinking  yet their souls are related to each other   For me  their monologue is  The Chatarsis    Really  you can just feel the pain  and in the and of the novel  the relief  the shelter  I didn t want to explain  or interpret this great work  I wanted to write down my feelings   This book gives protection to me  It shows me  that there is light in the shadow  Quote from  Paradise Lost    Long is the way and hard  that out of hell  leads up to light   I think it describes the ending  This might be a poor review  i don t have the worlds to describe this amazing piece of art  i m just a student   BUT I think everyone should read this   at least once       k dth  bqr      k dth mktshf m lm yktshf f  lnfs lbshry

back in 1996  I vividly recall spending my lunch hours sitting by Peoria s Civil War monument reading this book  followed by  Notes from the Underground  and  Brothers Karamazov    Since I decided that 2014 was to be the year  Kevin Re Reads the Classics   C P seemed an appropriate place to start  At some point  I plan on publishing my progress and writing about each book on The Peorian  ThePeorian com   So in actuality  it will be a combo of  Kevin Re Reads the Classics  and  Kevin Reads Stuff So You Don t Have To   Next up  the Brothers K  This is my third reading of this absolute classic and Ill probably read it again  It s so thought provoking and absolutely cleverly written  So typical of all the great Russian writers  I wish I could give it more than a five star rating  Gaynor As a former prison teacher  this book is especially important to me  Certainly one of the most powerful and important books of all time  I only regret that I can t read it in its original Russian  I add it now only because I wanted to vote for it  how silly  and the only edition currently listed is an abidged audiobook   Where does one begin    I ve been trying to think of something meaningful to say  One thing is for certain  as Jonathan has pointed out  Dostoevsky doesn t like it when people think too much  But beyond this  what conclusions can be drawn  Any conclusions one might draw also have an antithetical negation  Is it possible that Roskolnikov is a philanthropic misanthrope  Although reducing human relations to a cold calculus  does legal positivism safeguard us from an otherwise terrifying   arbitrary sociology  Is religion necessary even if it s not true  in the ultimate sense The psychological depth of the characters  particularly the main character  is breathtaking  chilling  and disturbing  Dostoevsky s ending  is  well  surprising  The moral of the story  it appears  is that intellection can only take us so far  we cannot dispense with affection  and that we are never beyond hope  even the most wretched among us  How lovely    Dostoevsky s a sentimental fool     Favorite book of all time  This book is absolutely deserving of its status as one of the greatest literary works ever created  The philosophy and layers of this book could be endlessly explored and discussed  Dostoyevsky is now one of my favorite authors   One of the most memorable books I have read  You can feel the guilt in the story    Crime and Punishment  was my first taste of the writing style of the renowned author  Fyodor Dostoevsky  and I was thoroughly impressed by the depth and insight it contained  The book tells the story of the introverted Raskolnikov  a man living in a pre Communist Russia that is filled with poverty and injustice  There  he meets a man named Marmeladov  a pathetic drunkard who buys alcohol from the money that his daughter Sonya makes from prostitution  Marmeladov s wife  Katarina  is a woman still wishing that she lived in her past  before her former husband had died  Raskolnikov s core belief in the story is that he can become an upper being   a man who is better than the society that he lives in and commit crimes without remorse  He wants to become a man like Napoleon  In his dream of becoming so  he is driven to kill a corrupt Landlady and her sister  After the crime  Raskolnikov realizes that his intellect was not enough to stifle his emotions  as he finds his mental state deteriorating   The book s incredible length was a minor discomfort  but I was left turning the pages to observe the developing characters and story  Each character in the story is very symbolic  expressing the themes of the book  Raskolnikov sees the world around him and thinks of himself as a man who is better than it  so he decides to try to change it  Rasumikhin  Raskolnikov s brother  is the complete opposite of him  He sees the world as a dark place  but prefers to look at it in rose tinted glasses  Marmeladov represents giving up while his wife represents a fall from grace  His poor daughter  Sonya represents a small kindness in a dark world   The book starts off with themes of poverty and crime  but later moves on to the themes of guilt and redemption  Raskolnikov is tortured by the memory of the crimes  and he tries everything to redeem himself    What do you think  would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds    I strongly recommend this book to those who like to think deep  and not to those who have been forced to read it in high school   In this work  Dostoyevsky presents a dark and twisted murder followed by the torturous progression of guilt like a terminal disease on the human spirit  But the heart of the question he presents is not about the double murder  but alludes to a larger concept encompassing the abilities of all men  Very engaging  troubling  and transforming   While Notes From Underground suffers immensely from her rendering  even through the imperfect lens of a Garnett translation Dostoevsky s intensely metaphysical statement in Crime and Punishment on the dual natures of transgression and restraint  of suffering and rebirth  comes through astoundingly clear  If Gilead is a novel about the challenge to forgive  this is a novel about the challenge to repent  A book that every man should read once  Forordet till upplagan sa det mesta man behover veta  Leta inte efter budskap eller dolda avsikter  Allt kommer till dig anda  Det har ar ingen bok som forsoker saga en specifik sak  Den forsoker beskriva manniskan  Och vem har kommit narmare an Dostojevskij  Han stiger standigt i min lista pa forfattare  Psykologin ar fruktansvart verklig  Den griper tag om en och far fem sidor langa brev utan styckeindelning att bli spannande  Tur att han skrev sa mycket    This book was hard to read    But it was also very good  Very bleak and morbid but quite scary when you re inside his head  I imagine it might be what it s like inside a psychopaths mind  Very intelligent man but using his brain to go against morals and society  then using his imprisonment to repent  grieve even  Also this book really makes you feel the hopelessness of the prison camp  Hard read but I d still recommend it  great  n nhr   bTrsbwrG   lmtrmy  mdWa lbSr tHt qdm mHdWthyh lrGbyn f  lq nfshm l  HDnh  lWh tkwn mnfdh l  lkhlS mn qsw  l lm lm tkn sw  fyD mn dmw  lthkl  w l ytm  w

STyd Try dh mn dhw  lqlwb lnbyl  Ht  yq w f  shrk ljrym  w ykwn l qb     My favourite book The real greatest love story ever told plus his rant about hipsters is both hilarious and brilliant  Great book  Love how you can follow through how his guilt builds in him more and more page by page  Read this book in a week  just couldn t put it down  The synopsis does little justice to the enormously complex themes and characters  Dostoevsky deserves every bit of credit that he gets as a literary god  He offers a complex and believable look into the mind of a murderer who considers himself part of the intellectual elite  and who killed in the name of a higher moral order  The story is told in third person omniscient mainly from the main character  Raskolnikov s  point of view  and it unfolds with suspense and various subplots  Really  it s like reading an episode of  Law and Order  Criminal Intent   but better  Much better Only Part I really addresses the murder  and the incident itself is described in merely 2 3 pages  The rest of the novel deals with Raskolnikov s psychological and moral  punishment   which is far more tormenting than the legal punishment itself  Was he justified in killing a  worthless  pawnbroker because he was doing mankind a favor  Or was his guilty conscience eating him from the inside out and isolating him from the world he knew  Yes  no  yes  no  Those are the questions that Raskolnikov struggles with after the murder as he becomes increasingly delirious and paranoid  Dostoevsky explores the human condition  not only from the perspective of a criminal  but also from those around him    the shrewd police detective  the unconditionally loving sister  the loyal friend  the emotionally wounded older man  and finally  the misunderstood but kind hearted woman of ill repute  He also explores various questions of morality and existence   When is it okay to kill  And who has the right to kill  Crime and Punishment is a psychological thriller that makes you stop and think about the nature of crime and criminals   Spoiler Alert For me  the most interesting aspect of this novel was that it explores the psyche of a middle class murderer  someone who considers himself learned and is well respected by the community  Though he thinks of himself as better than everyone else and cleverer than most petty criminals  he eventually succumbs to the gravity of his crime and realizes that he is no better than anyone else  The story rests on the premise that even the most self centered individual who commits a crime will eventually succumb to his conscience and realize that he did commit a sin  However  what about sociopaths  or those incapable of feeling guilt  Do they ever go through the same kind of  punishment  as Raskolnikov  And if not  does that confirm Raskolnikov s  extraordinary man  theory  The original page turner  Quite a thing  a study really of what s inside a criminal s head  Or a mean s head  is he a criminal  Think of this book as solving the mystery backwards from how Agatha  or Mrs  Marple  if you prefer  does it  Honestly  I don t know what it was about this book that I liked so much  The translation I read was the most recent   Volokhonsky Pevear   so perhaps the more modern language factored in  I really enjoyed the footnotes and the Russian naming system and I don t think I would have understood the book half as much without them Inexplicably  against my own expectations  I found myself sucked into the book  and I m almost afraid to reread it in case it is not as good the second time around  Literally  I went from   well  I suppose I ll have to read it on a 9 hour drive to Disney World  to  I wish I had it with me so I could read it in this godawful long line   though throughout the 600 odd pages  I continually thanked God I never had to annotate it And  weirdly enough  themes from this book have been popping up ever since  Raskolnikov is the perfect foil to Meursault in  the Stranger   which was frustrating beyond belief come IB exam time  and Woody Allen s  Match Point  is a flawed skewed foil to the book as well  Cliff s Notes    which was just a weird coincidence that I watched it mere weeks after finishing the book No idea why  but  Crime and Punishment  is one of my favorite books  and I m half proud and half embarrassed of that fact  I mean really  who reads  Crime and Punishment    I believe Cypress Hill said it best when they said  Here is one thing you can t understand   how I could just kill a man  So true  so true  That is  until reading this book  I m not a communist  nor do I think very highly of Russia  what with their tundras  meltdowns  and backwards R s  Not to mention their furry hats  I get it  it s cold  but really  you just look goofy in that hat  Did you ever see that episode of Cops In Moscow  Exactly  I also think people who think that Dostoevsky is the greatest ever are boorish snobs  Ha  Boorish Anyway  this book can be described with the following word  Incredible  I can t say that this book changed my life or anything  I mean if it did  then I may have murdered someone  But an incredible look into someone  seemingly stable and normal  who for a moment in time  loses focus  kills  and then is left to deal with their new reality Insane in the membrane   Teton County Library Call    F DostoyevskyAdam s rating  5 starsThere s a reason this is a classic  Devastatingly dark  but too compelling to put down  I found myself thinking about Dostoyevsky s characters even while I wasn t reading the book  and they ve provided a platform by which to judge other characters in other books  I ve caught myself thinking  is this character as depraved as Raskolnikov  If you want to be impacted by a story and left with your head spinning  than pick this one up   If you ever have to explain the feeling of guilt and coming to terms with major wrong doings to anyone  this book is the best to show a perfect depiction  from committing an almost  justified  and understandable murder  in the terms of fiction  of course  therefore allowing more leeway for unlawful behaviour for storytelling effects  to being a man completely crippled by guilt and remorse  the main character depicts all the tragedy and pain of taking someone s life  A classic read  People who should not play Raskolnikov in the upcoming  and entirely hypothetical  Hollywood adaptation Shia LabeoufChad Michael MurrayWill SmithAnyone from Gossip GirlEthan HawkeSting The example of classical book that contains in itself the intensity of the thriller  rich and developed characters  time stamp and psychological background  A must read to any reader of any language  Dostoyevsky is always able to capture your mind and submerge you into the story to the point that you will feel the shame of poverty  the compelling need to justify the shameful plans  the fear of being discovered and the reality of the shame being the most powerful punishment that anyone could ever have  His masterful pen will make your heart pound with fear  you will smell the rubbish rotting in the heat of St Petersburg summer and the despair of human weakness  I have been finished with this novel for about two days now  and could not bring myself to write a review of right away  I needed some time to ponder what to possibly say about this novel  I wanted to write a long  intelligent review of this great novel  but that would have been impossible to do without placing spoilers throughout my review  which not what I intended  My passion for literature began with my love for classic African American literature  One of my favorite authors in that genre of literature is Richard Wright  His novel   Native Son   told the story of Bigger Thomas who lived in a poverty stricken racist community  struggling to obtain an identity of integrity and respect during a time when African Americans were degraded  disrespected  and treated unequally  Bigger Thomas becomes a product of his negative environment  which created an insatiable rage within him  He responds to the social injustices and racial inequality by committing two horrendous crimes  and is put to trial for them  Wright is unapologetic to the systematic inequality and the inevitable reaction within the main character  Like Wright  Fyodor Dostoevsky created a character  Rodion Romanovitch Roskolnikov  who similarly became a product of his environment as a poverty stricken  failed student  and degraded by his community  Feeling hopeless  Raskolnikov decides to commit a crime to whom he felt was a devious and hated person  for the pursuit of a higher purpose  He then has to deal with the destructive moral and psychological consequences as a result of the crime  Dostoevsky does an amazing job depicting the inner battles and demons of a troubled man within the main character  Like Wright  Dostoevsky creates a literary genius that is sure to remain in the mind of readers  this book is a need for anyone who wants to understand the human psyche it s an unbelievable book  for me it was hard to read at times  as i was only just starting to read books  now i wouldn t be without it   This is one of my all time favorites  I ve read it three times  The only action happens in the first 50 pages  and the rest is all just what goes on in the protagonist s mind  Amazing book  Dostoyevsky s master pieceThe character of Rodion is so intriguing  he is so intelligent yet so disoriented I loved how Dostoyevsky portrayed his physiological and mental struggles  and how he described the Russian society with the utmost accuracy through his lamenting and destitute characters  This is a book that every avid literature lover needs to read upon my word I was furious with the ending though  just because Rodion mentally suffered and because he had a history of good conduct and goodwill doesn t exempt him from punishmenthe was punished alright but why was it a light sentence   Are you saying that regret and dejection is enough redemption for any crime  If one is torn by remorse over his crime to the point that they almost lose their sanity does that mean they are cleansed from sin  All would ve been fine if that was true  but the character of Rodion was not feeling guilty all along  He was so resolute and determined that his crime was fully justified and that he had the right to get away with it He only gave up himself because he was tired of running away and because he needed peace of mind after all his mental torment and bullying by the detective   and only towards the end of the book when he realized that he actually was capable of feeling love that he thought of redemption as means of purifying his soul  to deserve the pure feelings of his loved one See this is why this book is genius it raised a question with a ready answer and then provided the opposing argument I hope you like this book because it is very very very dear to me  C est tres bien ecrit  les personnages ont de l epaisseur  l intrigue est relancee dans chaque partie  c etait tres bien    book about the psychology of a criminal  600 page difference between the committal of a crime and the punishment  this book is more about the degrading psychology of the criminal  that the internal punishment is infinitely worse than the external punishment  if you cannot be mentally strong like Napoleon    but is this really true in today s context    nihilism  purely materialistic  similar to utilitarianism  Rask did not care at all about feelings  human worth  or the desire of others to help him  too focused on a principle   love for Sonya was what pulled him out of the selfishness  self isolation from humanity due to Superman complex was what triggered downfall  is this saying that stronger people  like Napoleon  would have no need for human love  that human love is only for those who cannot cruelly uphold principles    is Rask weak and not born to commit these acts    Rask s identification for Sonya is mistaken  he sacrifices himself for his own vision whilst Sonya sacrifices herself for others  parallel  Jesus   self imposed social isolation VS uncontrollable social isolation  there is no similarity   Svid as a foil to Rask  Rask believes that the ends justifies the means  Svid has horrible thoughts  means  but he always ends up doing good  ex  paying for the children  for Sonya   Svid is able to accept reality for the way things are  rather than going mad  and thus  was permitted to die a dignified suicide  what is the significance of committing it before an Achilles helmet  Achilles heel  what was Svid s one downfall  rejected love of Dounia was not 100  contributive  socio economic contrast   sanity is regained in the clean Siberian winter side  as opposed to the closed and dirty St  Petersberg   before the murder  barbaric beating of the mare  compassionate reaction of the young Rask serves as a foreshadowing to Rask s ultimate repentance of the crime   Furthermore  he keeps searching to procrastinate and justify himself to avoid being accused  avoiding trying to take responsibility for the crime   since fate is conspiring to allow him to commit the crime  he was chosen  but unplanned murder of Lizaveta destroys all of his justifications   selfish act to avoid detection  burying under heavy stone symbolises smoldering of conscience  not benefiting from the act  neither materially nor in principle  ChronologyIntroductionFurther ReadingNote on the TranslationA Note on Money  Crime and PunishmentNotes I cheated and

Richard Pevear and Larissa Voloshonsky   they truly bring Dostoevsky s voice to life  All other translations are inadequate and should be avoided   This was the first book of Dostoevsky s and it shall not be the last  Despite my initial reservations  this story about the nature of guilt and redemption captivated me from start to end  As between Sonya and Raskolnikov  these themes run throughout the story and unify it as a whole  leaving behind a sad yet hopeful vision of the human spirit I learned from this novel that the great Russian storytellers are people whose work I should definitely read

would be my favorite book of all time if someone put a gun to my head    convinced me they would use it    and insisted I select a single title  I thought the writing in this novel was excellent and I loved how the main character was written  I felt all the gloomy emotions he underwent in this novel  I can t wait to read another of this author s classics  While not a light read by any means  for a long novel it goes quickly  This upholds my fondness for Russian literature  We never had time to read this in class  which is an utter shame  I also did not know much about the plot before going in  While a crime is committed  that of Raskolnikov murdering the pawnbroker and her sister  the real crime is his arrogance and feeling he is above the law  Despite this  before the denouement  his punishment already begins  as the guilt over his actions begins to drive him mad  Dostoevsky combines SO MUCH in this novel  I can t say enough how fascinating it all is  I haven t actually read this version but an older Danish translation from 1941  translated by Carl Nutzhorn Kjersmeier  as I thought that would be closer to Dostoyevsky s original text  It s so beautifully written that I m tempted to learn Russian just to be able to read the original  I shall not tire you with a review  Suffice to say that there is a very  very good reason this book is considered one of the greatest works on literature ever written  I will definitely reread this Second reading   First reading   oxford  Often I would think of absurd actions and plan them  It is in the grip of my freedom to do any absurd action  The law may punish some of the more vile expressions of my freedom but it doesn t prevent the expression itself  The law is there for the establishment of justice  and has nothing to say regarding my freedom  If I shall not act in accordance to my freedom  it should then be my will to do so  But  then  what if I don t will to restrict my freedom  and decide to display my freedom in its most absurd  First let s ask if I am capable of it  An understanding of whether I am fit for freedom in its most abstract definition could only be understood in practicing it  Therefore  only by acting I discover whether it is fear that prevents me from acting or simply that I don t will it  What use then is this exposition  It may serve to show that by putting fear of the law aside  I am not an ordinary being   not better than the ordinary  but something different  After all  people around me act in the most mechanistic manner  living for existence itself  Wouldn t I by putting myself beyond good and evil  destine myself for greatness  Or at least know that I have the will power to change history  Haven t all the great people put themselves beyond the law  and at times even allowed murder for themselves  Am I great These are some of the ideas that were troubling me as I was reading Crime and Punishment   I didn t know before hand that Dostoevsky would examine similar ideas through Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov demands to know whether he is great  and whether in a different existence he may have been a Napoleon  Raskolnikov commits murder  He supposes that the great don t reflect over their transgressions over the rules of the ordinary people  they simply regard it as a necessary step in the development of history  In a sense  the crime is the murder  while the punishment is the psychological suffering  Raskolnikov s journey tells me a lot about myself and the human condition in general  To some extent  Raskolnikov represents my suppressed ego  and a certain shade of my being Crime and Punishment blends an unforgettable cast in an uncompromising setting  and the end result is a classic that i am not soon to forget  Loved it  one of my all time favorites  Fyodor Dostoyevsky made me sick  Why  Because of his incredible writing abilities  He himself has known poverty and punishment  perhaps this story was his own emulation of what it would be like to have the mind of somebody truly guilty  What an incredible feat  For an old book  C P read very well and did a strong job at building intense scenes  Heavily dialogue driven the text is rich with social nuances and queues flying everywhere  At times I felt sad that I was reading a translation  but other than that  I think it is now my favourite nineteenth century novel  Highly recommend  First intro to Dostoevsky Sophomore year and loved it   Obviously I have nothing original to say about this classic  but want to rant about its awesomeness in case any friends were on the fence about jumping into this book  I thought it would be a heavy undertaking  but was so pleasantly surprised to find it is instead an engrossing  smoothly flowing  easy to read page turner  once you ve figured out all the names   How one man can know so much about human nature from so many different perspectives  on the superficial level of conversation and behavior as well as at the core of our psychology  is unbelievable  But reading the thorough descriptions of Dostoyevsky s numerous perfectly complicated characters never gets old  as there is not a single person in this book that is either simply  good  or  bad   and they become more and more real as we learn more details and try and place them on the spectrum on which real human beings exist  Somehow at it s core it is both fundamentally absurd and strikingly real  it is also so witty and hilarious I laughed out loud dozens of time  Biggest flaw  however  is that some character  fall s ill  on pretty much every page so that gets a bit old I guess    Now I get it all   I do understand now  why Dostoyevsky is considered by some people as the greatest writer of all times  I just found out that even life itself   is like a big novel written by Dostoyevsky   and we re the doomed heros  playing our roles till the end of our lives  A masterpiece This is the first of Dostoyevsky s book that I have read and yet it is amazing in every sense The author succeeds in capturing the internal struggle within a criminal s mind while alluding to several other issues in the society  Having traversed quite a number of Dostoyevsky s shorter works  early works  and short stories  The Double  Notes From the Underground  House of the Dead  Poor Folk  The Gambler  White Nights  An Honest Thief  Bobok  The Dream of a Ridiculous Man  and a few more short stories   I knew that it was high time that I whet my philosophical knowledge against Dostoyevsky s larger  more famous novels written in the latter portion of his life  Picking up first Crime and Punishment  having scheduled to go through Brother s Karamazov in the next few months or so As it is with Dostoyevsky  Roskolnikov  the twenty something year old former University student protagonist  is completely and utterly maniacal  The depths that Dostoyevsky dives psychologically into his mind is beyond impressive  and to be sure  carries the main motif and theme of the book  While I m not going to use this review to simply summarize the contents therein  which you can find on any other website if you want to know the plot narrative  but rather  express some of my concluding thoughts upon completion of the novel Roskolnikov kills an old pawn broker  to be sure  he murders her in cold blood and kills her sister Lizaveta too  hacks them violently with an axe he stole from the local butcher shop  This is not your sophomoric and trite murder mystery  nay  it s psychological  Roskolnikov  who had gotten one of his University papers published in a Russian journal  had postulated an abstract theory about mankind being divided twain  viz   that there was the ordinary and the extraordinary   Ordinary men have to live in submission  have no right to transgress the law  because   don t you see  they are ordinary  But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way  just because they are extraordinary   205   The ethic propounded is one that allows for the individual to transcend morality  or at least the consequences therefrom  this is reserved only for the extraordinary class of humans  and for some sort of teleological purpose  Roskolnikov draws from the idea of a Napoleon man  a great powerful man  whom all is permitted  who  storms Toulon  makes a massacre in Paris  forget an army in Egypt  wastes half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vila  And alters are set up to him after his death  and so all is permitted   217   Roskolnikov has a seething  brooding lust to embody this type of extraordinary man  and to be sure  wants to see if this theory can be lived out existentially by not those written about in history books  but by himself  For he divined that  power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up  There is only one thing  one thing needful  one has to dare    328   And so  as though fated by his circumstances  and propelled by the devil himself  self admittedly  he axed the pawn broker and her sister to death  later claiming that he  didn t mean to kill a human being  but a principle  I killed the principle  but I didn t overstep   217  While Roskolnikov serves to capture the nihilism that had so engrossed his soul  and to be sure  acted upon principle in the frenzied and hysterical double murder  he failed to surpass one obstacle in his way  conviction  Embodied as truly delusional  and a schizophrenic maniac  Roskolnikov seemed to leap over whatever ethical bounds had been laid upon humanity  only to be continually tormented in his soul for something that he  in principle  did not think was morally wrong  but even  perhaps  morally advantageous  since after all  he merely  killed a louse   a useless  loathsome  harmful creature   327   And even while he didn t feel remorse or regret for his crime  and certainly had no sense of either duty or obligation to become contrite and heart and repent  no mater how hard Sonia urged him to do  the religiously observant prostitute who becomes Roskolnikov s faithful lover by the end of the book  a paradox in itself  he could not shake the impending and dreadful feelings of panging conscious that plagued his soul   I longed to throw it off  I wanted to murder with casuistry  to murder for my own sake for myself alone    It wasn t to help my mother    and  it wasn t the money I wanted   I wanted to find out something else  it was something else led me on  I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everyone else or a man  Whether I can step over barriers or not  whether I dare stoop to pick up or not   329   By the end of the novel  Roskolnikov turns himself in  and is exiled to Siberia for eight years in a work prison  Upon reflection of his past crimes  vis a vis his original ethical theory  he ruminated what hurt him most was not his feeling of remorse  or even his miserable conditions in prison  of which he declared are even better than the wretched conditions he was living in theretofore  Nay  what Roskolnikov was dejected by and utterly humiliated from was his wounded sense of pride  He had jumped over the ethical  only to be suspended by the universal  halted forthwith in his tracks by the pangs of his tormented conscious and soul  And worst of all for Roskolnikov  upon deliberating whether or not he was going to turn himself in  he had wanted to commit suicide  for the absurdity of his situation indeed called for him to do so  His sister s benefactor who was wealthy and fearful of death had the day antecedent to Roskolnikov turning himself in had done just that  blown his brains out   Why does my action strike them as so horrible  Is it because it was a crime  What is meant by crime  My conscience is at rest  Of course  it was a legal crime  of course the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed  Well  punish me for the letter of the law   and that s enough   425   And yet  Roskolnikov faltered  and something within him urged him to cling to life  but not in a heroic way  for he was not displaying Sartre s conception of the absurdity of live in light of radical freedom  but rather  in the most loathsome and cowardly way   He suffered too from the question  why had he not killed himself  Why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess    425 426  Dostoyevsky s religious  ethical  and psychological themes of Crime and Punishment embody various other philosophical strands that I find utterly fascinating  First of which is the Kierkegaardean conception of the ethical as presented in his Fear and Trembling  The idea in the simplistic way possible is that there is in a sense the idea that the Knight of Faith usurps and transcends the ethical by an infinite resignation and by believing  faith  on the strength of the absurd  thereby setting the individual in absolute relation to the absolute  In contrast  the Tragic Hero utterly fails  why  Because he submits to the universal  or that is to say  the ethical  and in doing so  crumbled beneath the weight of the universal and becomes a martyr  and as such is praised for being one  But the latter character has not done anything noble indeed  but merely submit to the ethic already in place  and in this sense  he is ordinary  while the former is extraordinary  he is the Napoleonic in essence  Moreover  Nietzsche s concept of the Ubermensch also transcends morality altogether  and makes decisions by the  Will to Power   c f  Dostoyevsky   power is only vouchsafed     supra   from such lofty heights as he has broken from not only ethically  but psychologically as well   He who climbs upon the highest mountains laughs at all tragedies  real or imaginary   One does not kill by anger but by laughter  Come  let us kill the Spirit of Gravity  I have leaned to walk  since then I have run  I have learned to fly  since then I do not have to be pushed in order to move  Now I am nimble  now I fly  now I see myself under myself  now a god dances with me  Thus spoke Zarathustra   Nietzsche  Thus Spoke Zarathustra  I  aphorism X  On Reading   Writing   While Zarathustra and Roskolnikov s  Napoleon  share similar traits  the latter fails where Zarathustra succeeds  indeed  for Zarathustra has thrown of all conscious or conviction  and laughs at others in his lofty heights  whilst Roskolnikov is burdened to the point of surrender  cursing only himself for his lack of courage  to at least kill himself in light of his despicable circumstances From the foregoing  then  what can be concluded  Dostoyevsky  who spends literally four hundred and twenty five pages to pain  torment  madness  psychological insanity  suffering  and absurdity thereupon  in concise yet profound manner  spends the final two pages with his last and greatest motif of the novel  such a subtle nuance that one could hardly even pick it up if they were not paying attention  redemption  Unlike the Ubermensch who had succeeded in throwing of the pangs of conscience  Roskolnikov failed  and while he may have not understand in the moment the reason for his feeling so dejected and downcast  it was only upon later reflection that perchance  the truth of the matter came out  namely  that deep  way deep down in the bitter  resentful  egoist  nihilistic and cynical soul of Roskolnikov  he didn t kill himself quite precisely because  he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions  He didn t understand that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis  of a new view of life and of his future resurrection   426  Yes  the absurdity of life  the sufferings therewith  and the innate and devious ways essential to human nature are all guaranteed in this life  and these might  perhaps  all be atoned for as Roskolnikov  in the end  realizes  with what infinite love he would not repay all her sufferings   he was  now  simply feeling  Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind   Under his pillow lay the New Testament   but that is the beginning of a new story  the story of the gradual renewal of man  the story of his gradual regeneration  of his passing from one world into another  of his initiation into a new unknown life   430   Yes  as it was for Dostoyevsky  so might it be with us  perhaps infinite love will save us all  b Rus edebiyati ile tanismam Dostoyevski yle oldu ve ben bundan ne kadar mutlu oldugumu anlatamam  Dostoyevski nin kitaplarini okurken kendimi kaybediyorum  yarattigi karakterlere burunuyorum resmen  En sevdigim klasikler arasinda Dosto nun eserleri hep bir numarada olacak benim icin Suc ve Ceza  olay orgusuyle  karakterleriyle  onlarin yasadiklariyla sizi 19 yuzyila Rusya nin yoksul kesimine goturuyor  Raskolnikov  hukuk fakultesini birakmis  hastalikla ve yoksulluguyla savasan bir genctir  Psikolojik sorunlari vardir  Isledigi cinayetten sonra akli dengesi bozulur  nobetleri ve sanrilari artar  Ailesi ve arkadaslarindan uzaklasmaya baslar  Gururlu ve kibirli yapisiyla ondan suphelenen insanlarla alay eder  Cinayeti kendisinin isledigini aciklamaya birkac kez yaklasir ama bir turlu aciklayamaz  Susmayan dusunceleri  teorileri ve yeni tanistigi insanlara daha ne kadar dayanabilir peki Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov   intense and thrilling  it represents the ongoing struggle of a human soul when dealing with what is fair  deserved  and what human life is worth Crime and Punishment is one of my favourite novels  I love every bit of it Sadly  I don t have a copy now  I gave my copy to my friend  I promised myself that I will read this once more and will continue to read books by Fyodor Dostoyevsky I love Constance Garnett s translation and it left me with a good impression which made me want to read all of Dostoyevsky s novels  I want to try a different translation for Crime and Punishment and see if it will be as good or maybe better  I wish to be blown away a second time Finally  it s hard to write a review of a book you loved  I see no flaws in this one    Perhaps the next time I m going to read this  I might contribute something essential in this review    For the meantime  let me go back to my novels that doesn t require much reasoning  I adore this book  The characters are rich  the story is unique and compelling  some of the dialogue is truly memorable  emotions are intense    Re reading this was a pleasure  and I m sure I ll read it again soon enough The book has a few slow parts  but the good parts are just so good  I have such a clear picture of the scenes in my head and there were certain sentences I wanted to read over and over because they were so impactful and I just wanted to soak them up  I am a big Dostoevsky fan in general  and this is without a doubt my favorite book of his and one of my favorite books overall I started my second reading of Crime and Punishment with the free Kindle edition available on Amazon  which is the Constance Garnett translation  while on an airplane  When I got home I wondered if the paperback edition I owned  and had read first  was a different translation  the Kindle book  felt  a bit different   and it was indeed  The version I read originally was translated by David McDuff and published by Penguin  For a while I had fun comparing the two different translations  Constance Garnett  which is an older translation  and David McDuff  and I ultimately chose to finish the last  70  of the book with the McDuff translation  I of course can t comment on translation accuracy  but the McDuff translation is more engaging and easier to read   And now that I ve seen what a difference translation can make  I wonder about some of my other favorite foreign books  like The Count of Monte Cristo  The Brother s Karamazov  and Anna Karenina  and how I would feel about them if I read different translations  I read very old translations of The Three Musketeers and its sequel Twenty Years After  and both were challenging to read  In contrast  I read a new translation of The Man in the Iron Mask  which was a more fluent reading experience than the first two books even though the story itself was less enjoyable   I was frustrated in the beginning by the character s perplexing antisocial behavior to the point of almost not continuing to read the book  But it progresses and develops into something absolutely beautiful  Very romantic notions  it is much more of a defense of what must have been the  old world  of Dostoyevsky against the  new and modern  ideas of the time  But in those romantic notions one often finds truth  I am never sure what I should have expected  I find Dostoyevsky an incredible writer and does a phenomenal job on character development  I found some of the long parts  really long but in all I do understand why this is one of the greats of literature and wonder why it took me so long to get to it  Put quite briefly  Crime and Punishment  focusing on an event in a young man s life and his purpose for his actions  is an exploration of life  death  circumstance  poverty  conscience  conviction and confession    This is a heavy book  but it s also an amazingly detailed look at the inner workings of the human mind and the repercussions of committing a crime  Woody Allen once said   Ready Dostoyevsky is like having a full meal  I cannot agree more  This translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky is as close to the original Russian as one could ever find  While other translations offer the text in English  this version gives one the full flavor of the writing  The characters come to life and the words by Dostoevsky himself show his true mastery as a writer  I found this book riveting and difficult to put down  When Raskolnikov commits his crime I felt as if I was right there  my pulse was actually racing This translation has made me hunger for more works by this writer  Thanks to Pevear and Volokhonsy s for taking the tedium out of reading Dostoevsky that the other  boring translations had done  They breathed incredible life into his work  Excellent  Excellent  Excellent  I took a class called Dostoevsky and Kafka in college  which is when I read this book  I bet I was loads of fun to be around that semester  Ingesting this book was a watershed moment This is literature  We re starving  murdering  drinking and freezing to death in the back alleys of Petersburg  We re watching despicable people do horrible things to good people  sometimes getting away with it  sometimes not  We re seeing people who simply cannot and will not elevate themselves out of venality  This is humanity  right here Dostoyevsky is the final word on the abject emptiness of human morality  showing us that the material world favours the strong and the merciless  and that redemption is a sugarpill for those too weak to embrace the nihilism of the cosmos There is a small set of transcendent novels  whose ideas confront us and fill our minds more fully and efficiently than any philosophical treatise could  The book is foremost amongst them  Another true Dostoyevski masterpiece  The story centers around the main character  Raskolnikov  a student who believes himself to be above the moral rules and  inhibitions  of all those around him  His philosophy is that  everything is allowed  to certain people  if only they have the guts to reach out and take it  In order to test his philosophy  he murders an old woman  The rest of the story focuses on his internal struggle with guilt and his own feelings of grandeur  He ultimately learns about love and humility from a young prostitute  It is difficult to describe this book  because I interact with it at a deeply emotional level  Dostoyevski has a way of constantly surprising me with such incredible little morsels of truth about human nature  I have yet to read any other writer that creates such soulful characters  so vibrant and real  Religion also plays a significant role here  as it does in most of his books  Overall  a fantastic read  extremely enjoyable and entertaining  not to mention deeply philosophical  questioning the very foundation of morality and right and wrong  Amongst my top ten books of all time Just a note  I took a class on Dostoevsky in college  and was actually lucky enough to have a leading Dostoevsky scholar as my professor  She swore by the Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky translations as being the most true to Dostoevsky s writing  so those are the only ones I will read   Dostoyevsky is one of the most detailed writers  He pulls one into the story and make you feel like you are a fly on the wall taking in all the minor details  Crime and Punishment is my favorite Dostoyevsky book by far  While working on a TV show of this name  I was given a copy of the book  I felt it was my duty to read it  50 pages in I couldn t put it down  A simple crime and the fascinating character that goes about it are so well drawn that it makes you wonder if it is fiction  It is a true masterpiece and there is no question as to why we are still talking about this book   Crime and Punishment is a poignant look at humanity  the laws we create  and the ways we deal with what we see as truly right and wrong  Theory versus reality is an important theme  I highly recommend this book  Zlocin i kazna   Asocijacija na Greh i Iskupljenje  na novi zavet   Raskoljnikov je tipican tragicni lik  Pokusava da se otme slepoj subini koja ga vodi

adore this book I picked it up warily  thinking  well  it s a classic  I had no idea what it was about and bought it because of obligation  Reading this book was a fantastic choice of mine and I m so glad I bought it  even if my edition is extremely roughed up and  well  well loved  First of all  the way Dostoyevsky portrays human character is so fantastic  He doesn t confine his characters to one mode of being  ex  Susan is a positive person  Joe is a negative person   In fact  his characters are beautifully inconsistent  which absolutely strikes me as realistic  although Rodya Raskolnikov s quick changes of mood might come across as irritating to others reading  One moment Rodya could be grovelling and weeping and the next he s skipping and laughing  I think Rodya is a character that displays appropriate behavior for someone in deep depression  and I really did adore him throughout this book despite his questionable behaviors and actions  Rodya kinda reminds me of Hamlet    his personality is so flexible and human  such a damned hero  the tragedian    I couldn t help but love them The plot was extremely interesting and very well thought out and detailed  even if I had some trouble following it  I think this is my own problem due to not paying enough attention to the names of characters and such   I love the little arcs of storyline    Raskolnikov s crime  meeting Marmelodov  Porfiry Petrovitch trying to get with Dounia  Katerina Ivanovna s little arc  Svidrigailov s story  and then finally  the story of how Rodya s life goes on with Sounia  Speaking of that  I think this book had one of the most wonderful endings I ve ever read  As someone accustomed to reading tragedies  I thought I knew where this was going   Oh   I thought   Rodya will surely end his life before he d ever confess and go to jail  He s too intellectually restless to be confined for years  and the thought of being killed for his crime scares him too much   This was wrong of me  as I failed to recognize the themes of the road to redemption in this story  Rodya faced his crime  his actions  and feeling genuinely remorseful  turned himself in to that life  He recognized that he had done a horrible deed even if he spent almost the entire book trying to convince himself that he was just  And  man  it just tears me up so much that Sounia was still willing to live with him and love him despite his attitude towards him  Their love is so messy and real  Rodya Raskolnikov was not like Svidrigailov  He didn t give in to his cowardice  he didn t give in to the fact that he wasn t getting what he wanted  He didn t give in to his suicidal thoughts  or his depression  or his anxieties  He looked at his fate head on and said   It s going to take 8 years  but I am going to put this behind me and start a new life with my friends and family   MAN  I LOVED THIS BOOK  Sorry for the ramble  I m just really excited and happy and MAN  DOSTOYEVSKY  YOU GENIUS   My friend in College gave me some Dostoyevsky to read and it really spoke to me  This is a bit of a saga and if I remember correctly it tool me a bit of starting and restarting to get into it   Amazing how much twenty years can completely change my perception about a book  Need to re read the entire Russian literature  Did not like reading about suffering back then  It s two am and I m finished  I m dumbfounded and sad and relieved that I m finally finished I m not going to be able to give Crime and Punishment a real review because I cannot do it justice  In the future I ll read this again and I ll know more and better and deeper what the author was driving at  and hinting at   and whether I agree or disagree Mostly I am struck with how ingenuously Dostoevsky handled dark matters  There wasn t a single chapter that wasn t physically uncomfortable to read  I can t decide what I disliked more    when I recognized elements of myself in the murderer in the story  or when I felt myself judging him for not being punished as much as I thought he should be  How the author combines meditations on God with the most grimy  shameful underbits of human psyche should seem mutually exclusive  but they really aren t  Dostoevsky doesn t shy away from exposing every ugliness a human being can commit or be subjected to  from murder to poverty to prostitution to rape to suicide  I think he had to discuss these matters in full in order to show God in full  or maybe the lack of Him This book was so relentless  It s entirely unusual and I ve never read anything like it  It was an incredibly worthwhile departure for me  I look forward to reading more Dostoevsky in the future  Que manera de orquestar que tiene Dostoievsky  todo de la manera mas extraordinaria y minuciosa posible para describir personajes y estados psicologicos  Al leer sentia cada conducta y pensamiento en un vaiven de justificaciones para desconcertantes actos posteriores  Genio lucido  Easily the best book I ve ever read  Amazing characters  gripping story  very thought provoking premise     and I ll be damned if the  bad guy  isn t my favorite character No I m not talking about Raskolnikov I m not much in favor of analyzing this poor book to death  in my opinion  it s better to read it  let it bother you  discuss it with a friend over coffee  then read it again and again and again  Five stars are never enough for Dostoevsky novels  The difference in Russian name usage for formal and informal situations makes it hard to keep characters straight at times but if read carefully this book is a true dive into the fragility of the mind  An incredible and insane story of a man s battle with himself to find reason  and to justify his own ego  But in the end when logic and reason fails  something more precious is found instead  life and love  A simple lesson  but hard to learn  khnd w khwy khh dstyfskhy dr mGz i  rdywn rwmnwwych rskhulnykhuf  dr rmn  jnyt w mkhft  mykhnd bynZyr st  srshr z ndyshh st yn khtb

way Dostoevsky brings the reader to go inside the character s psychological life is excellent  However  he is always bringing us back and forth and full of unimportant narration  but still  all is going very good  I like the idea of the book and even the layout  but it wasn t the most well executed in my opinion  Dostoyevsky seemed to dwell too long on certain points  having his characters go on and on forever  Decent read  but there are a lot of other books I prefer to it  There are not very many works of literature that are as vastly entertaining and as immensely thought provoking as Crime and Punishment  Not much else to say except  AWESOME   First of all  I was amazed by this book  I have heard a lot about it  have seen the movie and read parts of it before but never the whole book  I was kind of sad that I haven t read it in the grammar school when I was supposed to read it  but I think I am much more happier that I have read it now  I feel like this is a book you should read after the adolescence  after gathering some life experiences when you can actually comprehend everything that s been said in it and the whole experience of Raskolnikov  his ideas  thoughts  acts and finally redemption  Loved it   This was the first Dostoyevsky I read and I found it a wonderfully disturbing read  The slow unravelling of the psyche following the crime  against the bleak Russian backdrop gives the novel a claustrophobic tone  almost making one feel as if you are inside Rascolnikov s head experiencing his mental breakdown  The punishment aspect is interesting as it appears to me that his self punishment on a psychological level is far worse than anything the outside world could ever inflict  For all theworks greatness the surprising theme of redemption contained in the denouement almost makes me feel that Dostoyevsky sold out and I have to be careful not to allow this to ruin everything for me  Perhaps this ending was influenced by Dostoyevsky s mock execution at the hands of the Russian government  using the redemptive aspect as some kind of catharsis  Anyway  this is a surprisingly easy read and though it s no Brothers Karamazov it s still very very good For some reason it took me quite a lot of time to finish this book but  to my defence  I finished my bachelor degree and read about twenty or thirty other books for my thesis and finals during this time  Anyway  this is an amazing peace and I loved it  One of my favourites for sure  Easily my top 1 book  full stop  detailed review to come  I read this in high school and loved it  I saw it on my shelves the other day and was flipping through it  then got caught up  I lent it out before I finished it again  Such an interesting look at the psyche of someone who could persuade themselves in the justness of a murder of an old women  Fascinating  Only downfall is it s difficult to keep track of the names   This might well be the best and most complete and fulfilling book I have ever read  Unbelievable  Read and read again  especially if you were told to read the book in high school when you maybe didn t catch the incredible depth of Dostoyevsky s vision  Dostoevsky changed my life  I first read Notes from Underground when I was 18 or so and it was like a switch flipped inside me and I felt connected to literature as I never had been in younger days  His books are sort of flawed but it doesn t matter at all because they are just so good  it s like the flaw lets you feel the emotion or intent behind the work even more than if it were technically perfect  like a great singer who doesn t have a great voice   I don t know  though  I haven t read him for years  I might not be so moved now  I should reread   Yoksulluktan ogrenimine devam edemeyen universite ogrencisi

first read this book for my Russian Lit class in college  I was hooked  Since then I have read it during different times of my life and each reading provides me with a different insight  one that I had not considered before  In college it was about idealism  is one above the law  The concept  the ideal of the Superman was very real to me back then as one is  arguably  at the peak of one s idealism when one is surrounded by the free flowing ideas and dialogues that a collegiate environment provides  What a great classic  A fantastic story  Even thou I never got to like the main character  I did respect his act at the end  I very much liked a few of the other characters  witch Dostoevsky described very vivid and accurate  I like the little conversations  that some characters had among each other  even thou these conversations did not directly have anything to do with the story  but they were very important to understand the story  and the actions of some characters  I also liked that you had to think a lot in the beginning  as in who is who  because Dostoevsky kept using similar names  very smart idea to confuse the reader   Over all a great book  My second book of Dostoyevsky  another classic  This for sure feels more finished than   The Brothers Karamazov    no surprise really as the latter was meant to have sequels  The book itself is riveting  I read it in every free moment I had  and couldn t wait to find out how things would turn out  The thoughts and actions of the characters are so well described that one cannot help but be involved in the story and be slightly convinced by Raskolnikov s logic  I also found the description of life in Russia to be extremely interesting and I feel like I learnt a lot from it The book is like a murder mystery seen from the point of view of the murderer and it really conveys welll the thoughts and actions of the murderer before  during and after the act  The ending is a bit too   so the moral of the story is    but still enjoyable  It s a must read and an easier read than Brothers Karamazov  I wish I had read this before Brothers and I would recommend anyone starting on Dostoyevsky to start from here  An exhilarating  enthralling ride  filled with subtle  complex messages about conscious  faith  and dehumanization  Some would say there are useless subplots  and the ending was a slap in the face  I retort by saying  every little detail in the book was of huge importance  and the ending was suitably symbolical One of the few books to have an impeccable impact on me  I was traumatized whilst reading it  and was even more traumatized when it ended   Loaded with interesting ideas and lengthy dialogue   Finished reading one of the longest books i ve ever read     More classics   more classics please     Almost 150 years ago Dostoevsky penned this brilliant piece of psychological crime fiction  As philosophical as it is thrilling this bit of classic Russian lit  will not leave you disappointed or bored  I highly suggest the story of Raskolnikov to anyone interested in Dostoyevsky or Russian lit in general who is looking for a starting point  very easy to read especially in comparison to his contemporary Tolstoy  at just about 400 pages the pacing is great and definitely worth your time   Just   wow I can t really describe how I feel about this book apart from saying it is excellent  as every part of it felt so well composed and planned out  it is probably as close to a  perfect  book as I have ever come to read While Ulysses might be an expansion of the internal monologue  C P explores guilt and existentialism in a way almost superior to that of Camus  which is really saying something  You have to hand it to Dostoevsky   he can write some really dark subject matter if he wants It is one of the only books where the plot is almost secondary  you don t need every waking detail of the situation  the story is told through the mind  and that s what got me  The thoughts  the questions  the solipsism  the self hatred and the guilt of Raskolnikov just combine to make a powerful  if sometimes obtuse read I won t push this to be read by everyone  because it isn t for everyone  I had to read this five times to really get a grip on what was going on  and often I found myself just filtering words without understanding them  Reading a chapter twice  once unaided then once with a study guide really adds to the book  as you get to understand the deeper meanings of the novel  and also what the hell is going on in this guy s mind All in all  C P lives up to it s reputation  It is a classic  that clearly sparked many author s interests  an is to thank for almost all psychological thrillers around today 5 5 Es uno de los mejores libros que he leido    el autor se sumerge en los pensamientos de cada uno de los personajes y relata de forma extraordinaria cada instante de lo que acontece en la mente de cada uno  Es una obra maestra  Excellent  due a re read There are some uneven patches because Dostoyevsky  like Dickens  is a genius working too fast  But whatever the flaws  genius is so rare that it always scores 5 stars  Reading the book you are drawn into a feverishly heightened reality as Raskolnikov s mind unravels under the strain of St Petersburg s  gloomy  strong and queer influences on the soul  until the whole city feels like an embodiment of his unacknowledged guilt The translation I read was by Constance Garnett  whose choice of words seemed occasionally to come unstuck  particularly when reaching for a colloquial expression  But that does create a sense of strangeness that she may have intended  My first  and still favourite  Russian book   This book was beautiful  and I didn t even manage to read what seems to be widely regarded as the best translation  Crime and Punishment definitely began my love for all things Dostoevsky  Luckily  I happened upon a Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of The Brothers Karamazov for whenever I get around to reading it  Though not as thought provoking as the Brothers Karamazov  Crime and Punishment is still an exemplary novel  Through Dostoyevsky s brilliantly portrayed character Raskolnikov  the reader is able to feel the torments and anguish that Raskolnikov goes through  In essence  it brings us into the mind of a murderer who is philosophically conflicted as to whether or not there is such a thing as an acceptable murder for the greater good of society  Furthermore  the novel brings into question if  superior  beings can transcend the laws set forth by their society  Lastly  the scenes dealing with the resurrection of Lazarus are amazing  Though Raskolnikov rejects religion  he finds redemption and his own resurrection in love  It s awe inspiring how Dostoyevsky portrays his own ideals into a fascinating novel  After reading this alongside The Brothers Karamazov  I guess Dostoyevsky provides the best cliffhanger endings that bring to light the experience of hope   Crime and Punishment is a great novel that really puts you in a certain environment and you actually feel like you are there  The recurring themes of alienation from society  the psychology of a criminal are all great  You get to explore Raskolnikov s  the main character  mind  his doubts  fears  deliria  This is the real heart of the story  It s not nearly as much about the crime  as it is about the punishment  psychologically  especially   You can really feel the poverty  the dirty city as you read on  Some chapters feel slow  but in hindsight I think that actually works to the advantage of the novel  because everything pays off The only thing I did not like was that I found the names to be very confusing  especially at first  Overall  a great novel 9 5 10 This is the book I just recently lost   in my house   I m so bummed  I want to re read  I d love the philosphy behind it  well not the ACTUAL philosophy but rather just how it came it linked together   loved it  again  oh  but this is a flawed translation  they think every kind of impassioned discourse is  propaganda   had to look these passages up in the Russian original to understand  This was my first foray into Dostoevsky    I don t think I would ever want to read a different translator s interpretation  Specifically  I read Richard Pevear   Larissa Volokhonsky s translation  I only hope they have translated more of Dostoevsky s works What I noticed immediately was that  even though the author had only described Raskolnikov walking around  interacting minimally with a few minor characters  it was so engaging that I didn t want to put the novel down  The entire book was like that  putting it down to go to sleep was SO HARD At the end  when Raskolnikov was in prison  in exile    he ended up in the prison s hospital  very sick again  I had thought the worst was about to happen  The ending was a pleasant surprise My only words of advice    this could be true for every book with a foreword or introduction included  would be  DON T READ THE INTRODUCTION FOREWORD FIRST  Even though it s at the beginning of the book    it s natural to want to read it first  it gives far too much of the story away  It would be good to read after completing the novel   reading it over again to look for a different viewpoint  but it s not to be read first If I could give this book more stars  I would  It s a simple  direct translation that is easy to read  but so engaging it s hard to stop  I couldn t recommend the book    the specific translation  more  From the very start of the novel  the audience witnesses the dynamic of a character who is in a civil war   with himself  Rodion Raskolnikov  the protagonist  and quite arguably the antagonist  of this story thinks himself an extraordinary man who is above the law  In order to prove himself  he unfolds his plan to follow through a crime  However  he could never have predicted the unraveling of psychological distress that would ensue  and lead him to his true fate  I would highly recommend this novel to a friend because it does not follow the traditional views of good versus evil  Every character has a blend of  morally correct  and  immoral  qualities  which causes them to seem more human and thus more relatable  Combined with the novel s remarkable portrayal of psychological downfall  the concept of good and evil makes Crime and Punishment both an interesting and refreshing read K C  Grade 12CLPK Young Adult Readers Advisory Board Member  Crime and Punishment is my all time favorite book  and one of the few that I have read more than once  Written by Dostoevsky  this Russian masterpiece is truly one of the greats in literary classics  A dark  psychological tale  Crime and Punishment delves into the mind of a killer  Raskolnikov  the main character  is a highly intelligent young man who has a philosophy that there are people in the world who are ordinary  and others who are exceptional  He believes that he is one of the exceptional  and that sometimes exceptional people can be above the law to better humanity  Raskolnikov plans and carries out a brutal murder of a pawnbroker  He tells himself that he is justified as she cheated her clients  and also because her money would give him the start in life that a great man should have  But it is not the murder that fills most of the story  rather it is the psychological consequences of this heinous act  as Raskolnikov slips into a deep paranoia over his guilt  causing him to become more and more sickly  As time goes by  he can hardly stop himself from telling others about his crime  People  who care for him  along with his new companion  a policeman investigating the crime  cause Raskolnikove even further psychological stress  deepening his paranoia  The characters are interesting  and well developed  and the deterioration of Raskolnikov s psychic  and the building toward the ending  kept me interested to the very last page  I could even call this classic tale a page turner   Fairly difficult to get through if you re an impatient and visual reader like me  but WELL worth the effort  Beautiful commentary on the human condition  as I suppose all good literature is   Now easily in my top 5 favorite books  I was not expecting to read this novel with such ease and excitement  It is both a suspenseful crime novel and a psychological thriller  It reads like modern day fiction but with an undercurrent of much more depth and reason than seen in the genre s current execution Terribly excited to read it again knowing there is much much more to take from the novel  Also  i am now terribly interested in the life of Dostoevsky from reading the afterword  I couldn t tell you exactly why today  but this book hit me hard when I read it as a senior in high school  I haven t been able to work my way through it ever again  but for a time I called it my favorite book in the whole world   A book that truly transcends time Set up in 19th century  poverty filled St Petersburg  the book is devoid of almost any hope for most part  Hope is sucked out of the main tale uncompromisingly  The torturous effects of the abject environment on every major character s psyches  resulting in their stupefyingly intriguing interactions leads to a narration that is undoubtedly  simply a classic As sipped in its time and place as the tale is  the book will connect with person of almost any time and age  Few books in nearly 150 years hence have perhaps had subtleties and nuances of human behavior and actions exposed the way this book has  In a way  the book almost makes one feel that any human s ability to introspect and internalize was at least as evolved in the nineteenth century as now if not more Some of the scenes in the book are absolutely mind boggling  The Marmeladov s tale of self degeneration  the murder  as well as all the other chilling deaths   Raskolnikov s interactions with Svidrigailov and Porfiry  Katerina Ivanovna s dinner are not only shocking in the way they unfold but also impacting in the vividity and succinctness A must read for anyone in to serious reading  This is one of my favorite books  I re read it every so many years and each time I find more meaning  Certainly there is apart of me that seems to enjoy darker works  who knows why  I ll ask my therapist  This is a classic  it leads the reader into Russian Society and it makes us ask important  universal questions regarding crime and our capasity to commit senseless acts   I would have to say that this is my favorite book of all time  It s so amazing to follow a man through a murderous thought process  I can t believe this book was written when it was  It s as though it was written for modern day  Amazing  amazing book    Best  Classic  Ever  amazing Read the portuguese translation  Amazing author that explores the introspection of the mind in its characters like no other author can  Finally  shy introverted people have found a voice  Great writing technique  I read this book years ago for a Lit class in high school  but I had to add it because it s one of my favorite books  I m glad I was forced to read it for an assignment because I probably would not have read it otherwise  After I read this book I couldn t wait to read more classics  The author gets into the head of killers in a way that is almost scary  I loved this book when I read it and it is still one of my favorite books   A mystery in reverse  complete with lively sketches of St  Petersburg and eccentric characters  While Crime and Punishment is very tense and psychological  it s greater triumph lies in it s exploration of moral philosophy and peasant life  A stunning  brilliant book  masterpiece  heavy heavy    I feel like I m inside Raskolnikov s head all the time    feeling every guilt he feels  getting depressed with him  sometimes even feel delusional with him  D  I love this book  and even yes    the ending  To accept that this was not a deus ex machina ending it is important to see the time and scope that this was written in  Firstly the mid 1800 s was a time of modernization  much of this book is written as a struggle between the old and the new modes of though  This modern reform was a product of Alexander II and his reform was that of the free peasant and the liberal intellectual  Dostoyevsky was writing in the beginnings of communist Russian thought  and his ultimate reaction against it is seen in the end of Crime and Punishment  Raskolnikov finds his old ways  he finds his old religion  and he finds family  These things are the things that have kept Russia  and many other societies alive through the worst struggles and downplaying their importance on the human condition compared to  rational intellectual thought  is a common mistake of the collegiate   Crime and Punishment  may appear depressing at a first glance  but actually I think Dostoevsky s view of human nature is rather optimistic here  Among the many subjects tackled by this book  I could see a couple of ideas that seem to pop up repeatedly in different characters  stories 1  Everyone can be a master of their own destiny  as long as they have the determination  faith and courage to endure some suffering along the way   view spoiler  Sonya the prostitute manages to find a purpose in life just by having faith and persistence  her mother manages to stay alive and take care of her children against all odds  until she personally decides to give up and abandons her belief in God and in herself  Marmeladov loses his job and his life not because of unlucky circumstances  but because of his own weakness  Razumikhin does not have any money  power  or influence  but gets along and successfully helps the people he cares about  because of his persistence and positive outlook  Porfiry solves the crime because of his dedication to his work  even when he has no witnesses or evidence to work with   hide spoiler  2  However  nobody can control another person s destiny  if they try  they will fail   view spoiler  Luzhin tries to trick and manipulate Dunya into marrying and worshipping him  he fails  Svidrigaylov tries to use force to obtain what he wants  and fails  Raskolnikov tries to prove he has the right to decide who lives and who dies  and fails   hide spoiler   What s interesting is that  ultimately  their failure is not caused by some external factor  deus ex machina or whatever  They personally set themselves up for failure   they make mistakes and fail even though they have the intelligence and power to carry out their plans perfectly  It s as if people are genetically wired to mess up when doing something that they  deep inside  know is wrong  This was an audio book that I completed on my daily commute  First I will review the audio production  The voice acting was top notch  the characters were differentiated but not flamboyantly done  The pace seemed a bit slow at times  but there is a ponderous feel to much of the book so this was suitable  In places  when Raskolnikov s thought and emotions were particularly fevered the pace picked up marked giving a gripping  edge of your seat type of feeling Now for the book  This is the second Dostoyevsky novel that I have consumed  and it was an incredible experience  Much of this novel is spent dealing with the philosophical nihilism of late 19th century Russia and you can see the seeds of the Bolshevik revolution and Soviet atheism playing out  Raskolnikov has an idea which is a play on Ivan Karamazov s thought that without God all things are lawful  He has determined that truly great men have no responsibility to follow the law  and indeed all great men leave a a trail of blood in their wake  Raskolnikov idolized Napoleon  The novel move through Raskolnikov s crime  his mental break down  and finally his redemption  It is a hefty novel  but well worth the time and effort  Dostoyevsky has a robust view of redemption that doesn t involve the saccharine sentimentality that you see in much writing of this sort  There s always one or two turning points in your life  and if you re lucky  sometimes you can pin the exact moment  This book was a turning point for me  this was the book that truly made me fall in love with literature  made me truly consider my life  made me stare out of the school bus  blankly  realizing there was no turning back  The world hadn t changed  but I had  and it was  amazing    Why do I love a book about a man with a murderous Napoleonic complex  whose path to redemption ultimately has questionable results  I don t know  Because  like in all Russian lit  I ve read  the language is gorgeous  Because the detective is so cunning  and yet has that bit of mercy to him  Because every single character is so crisp and clear in my head  in a way that just doesn t happen in the average book today And maybe in part because I ve always pictured Raskolnikov as Patrick Dempsey  a la the 1998 version  though I ve never seen that  I really must   I wonder if I would find him less sympathetic now that I truly can t stand Derek Shepherd  haha But I don t think so    not after having read this twice  Besides  young Dempsey and current Dempsey are hardly the same person in my head  It s the hair  It makes all the difference Wow  Lisa  you took that from intellectual to shallow in  15 seconds  I have to admit this novel took a lot out of me  The depressive nature of the Soviet life put me in a bad mood at times and I had to put it down for a while  But I got through it  As my girlfriend says  it has a good Russian ending   the worst thing happens and everybody dies    Completely without question the best book ever written  Read it first in 1967 and again this spring  Better than I remembered  Unites humanity  There is no character in this you don t understand because all their feelings are ones you ve had  What a genius   The most fantastic book EVER  One of my favorite books that I reread every couple years  My last copy was so well loved that it was held together with a rubberband because whole sections came unglued  Now I have a copy on my reader  Everyone talks about this book so I figured it was about time I give it a read  True to what I had heard  it s a fabulous book  I am still not sure how Dostoyevsky made such a cruel main character also somehow sympathetic  but he does just that  As is the case with many of the great novels  Crime and Punishment is a rich book with many pauses in the main narrative for philosophical and historical discussions  Some may not enjoy the slower pace  but I find the side discussions fascinating  they add so much more nuance to our understanding of the characters and how they think  I highly suspect that this is one of those books that you can read over and over  picking up new details each time  O mais impressionante nesse livro e a influencia que este exerceu na obra de Nietzsche  assim como Rodia  o filosofo e um produto do seu tempo  Crime e Castigo e quase perfeito  se nao fosse aquele fatidico ultimo capitulo do epilogo  que evidentemente e belamente escrito  mas que poe por terra tudo que havia de mais brilhante na personagem principal  Din punctul meu de vedere  Dostoievski ramane titanul literaturii universale a reusit sa transpuna in miile de pagini scrise adevarata realitate in care personajele  bine individualizate  au devenit prototipuri pentru orice tip de societate Sunt puse in lumina o aglomeratie de situatii in care  cu siguranta  se regasesc foarte multi oameni din ziua de astazi  An interesting mix of philosophy and plot  It kept my attention and made me think  My favorite book of all time  although I read the Richard Pevear translation  not this particular translation  It also helped that when I read it  I had an out of this world professor whose lectures made the book so fascinating  I rate this book a 4 68 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being best  Determined to be a powerful man  the protagonist sets out to exercise his will to power  As he discovers  there is more than mere willfulness required and his attempt to put the Nitzschean  Superman  philosophy into action leads to an unexpected result  Like all Dostoevsky  this book is a working out of philosophical ideas using real  well drawn  and engaging characters  The wonder is that the book works so well on so many levels  It can be read as a philosophy  theosophy  or simply a crime novel  An amazing portrait of the struggle between the intellect  and the conscience the mind  and the heart I didn t know it was possible to put some of the psycological struggles endured by Raskolnikov into words A work of genius   I don t often read books a second time  Bulgakov  Pelevin  Douglas Adams  Gene Brewer  Harper Lee  but this is on my list to read again  Can t say much more than that  Crime and Punishment easily goes down as one of the best books I have ever read  Not only was the plot itself extremely engaging and mysterious  but the idea fueling the plot was astonishingly interesting as well  This  of course  being a story told from a seemingly innocent murderer s perspective  and also the subject of the main character s article  whether certain individuals have the right to disobey societal law  Being one who likes to ponder different philosophies and theories with people  the book very much appealed to me  Also  with an entangling plot with twists and turns that I can only compare to Great Expectations  Fyodor Dostoevsky kept me glued to the book from page one  I strongly recommend this book to anyone with interests in law  mystery  philosophy  or just a good read in general   After reading The Brothers Karamazov  I just had to read more Dostoyevsky  Crime and Punishment did not disappoint me  As in Brothers  I enjoyed the dream sequences that torment Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov just as much as those that troubled Ivan and Alyosha  I also found Crime to be surprisingly tightly constructed  and filled with quite a number of surprising events that interrupt the course of the story  I found myself gleefully anticipating every encounter with the inspector Porfiry just as much as Raskolnikov dreaded them  This is a book that is still remarkably relevant to the modern literary landscape  and I could not help but draw parallels between the grandiose motivations behind the protagonist s violent act and the charged rants of today s bombers and mass shooters  One of the final dream sequences in the book s end  in which the protagonist  now in penal exile in Siberia  envisions all the world infected with the same self righteous anger that has brought him into exile  left me fearful for the state of the modern world  At the same time though  it reminded me that feelings of rage and disenfranchisement among men are not new to my own little slice of time and space  I suppose that the love of Sonya for Raskolnikov  which seems to shrink the seven remaining years of his sentence into a time that seems as short as seven days  reflects how Crime and Punishment remains a great book to a twenty first century reader  It may have been published about 148 years ago  but the depth of its characters ensures that they still feel as relevant as ones written half a year ago do  This comes highly recommended  it is well worth the time commitment  Crazy Russian aristocracy are still crazy  but at least in Crime and Punishment they are clever  Like most classics of Russian literature Crime and Punishment is amazingly written  philosophical  complete  and entertaining  Yet this time  finally  I d actually enjoy having a conversation with many of the characters  Especially Porfiry   E a 2a vez que leio este classico e so posso voltar a dar lhe 5   E sem duvida uma obra prima E uma leitura lenta  que nos obriga em muitos momentos a parar para reflectir E um retrato mordaz da sociedade da epoca  Cidades imundas  onde abundam os pobres e prostitutas  onde as instituicoes publicas nao funcionam  onde a miseria humana e explorada ao mais alto grau  Durante todo o romance existe a luta entre o bem e o mal  o ter e nao ter  o ganhar e perder  o eu e os outros  que divide a mente  o que faz com que Raskolnikov sucumba ao dualismo  A crise de consciencia que se abate sobre ele  que quase o leva a loucura enquanto consumido por uma tortura interior  chega a ser angustiante As conversas que Raskolnikov tem com o detective responsavel pelo apuramento dos crimes  Porfiry Petrovich  sao um tratado filosofico sobre o valor da vida humana E interessante verificar que Raskolnikov nunca se arrepende de ter cometido os crimes e que consegue sempre arranjar justificacoes para tal acto  Alias  o proprio Raskolnikov quando fala com o comissario da o exemplo daquilo a que ele chama as pessoas vulgares   gente normal   e as pessoas invulgares   as quais nao se aplica a lei e que podem por si so mudar uma sociedade As personagens foram desenvolvidas na perfeicao por Dostoyevsky que as criou todas tao diferentes umas das outras  mas com alguns pontos em comum como as fortes personalidades e a coragem que sao caracteristicas transversais a todas elas  Sao tambem elas uma ferramenta para a critica que e feita a sociedade russa   gente miseravel  louca  sem consciencia e ma    Man grows used to everything  the scoundrel   What if man is not really a scoundrel man in general  I mean  the whole race of mankind   then all the rest is prejudice  simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it s all as it should be   Crime and punishment is an elegant treatise on the tragedy of crossing the civil line that lands Rashkolnikov in a delirium borne of guilt and realisation of his own folly at grandeur  A former student  who is taken with the idea of committing a crime  but not of the physical act it would propose but rather of the psychological border that would open up  wherein it closes upon and strangles the common and the ordinary  He is frantic at the realisation of his distinction of superiority  for he imagines himself a regular Napoleon  But he succumbs to his own mortal ideas and the journey that unfolds is a grand look  even dispassionate at times  on the moral accord  Though the protagonist is by all means a cold  hard murderer  colder still that he did not undertake the program for personal gain  since that would suggest necessity and desperation could afford a relief at such times  but rather to prove a point to himself  for at the moment the person is selfish and for all accounts inconsiderate of others close to him  Dostoevsky presents a frank analysis of the psychological trickle effect that assaults him  thereafter   It is interesting to note that the story was based in a time  when the ushering of the Industrial Revolution had sunk the poor and the destitute to the harrowing depths of unimaginable drudgery  yet our protagonist  who is himself a victim of poverty  sought to commit the crime  as a means to pull himself out of the common  and afterwards refrains from making use of the gains so afforded  Rashkol  even on the way to commit the crime speaks of walking to his own execution  so in his rationale he had a hint of the breakdown of his faculties at the horrendous scheme  but still ventures to do the same  if only  by accident   The implications of the story are a great many  From the cat and mouse game played by Svidrigalov  who by all means is a filtered version of Rashkol himself  Sonia with the yellow ticket who despite her social transgressions is awarded all the considerations in the story  a triumph    the proud and honourable sister  etc the long and interesting list of characters  each a veritable repose of the social theory  The theories on the subject of crime proposes some credulous but interesting arguments  For instance  the idea that  crime is a protest against abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more  and nothing more  no other causes admitted   laying all blame on the environs  influence might seem ludicrous at first sight but demands a twice look when backed by the argument that  if society is normally organised  all crime will cease at once  since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant   It s veracity is pulled apart in shreds when taking into consideration Rashkol s own motives  still it is interesting to ruminate on the concept to some degree  There is a theory of the red string of fate in Chinese philosophy that propounds the belief that an invisible string of fate connects everyone in an intricate spider web  such that though each living soul be dancing to its own rhythm is inevitably connected and hence  influenced and in turn influences  the others  Though loosely connected to the novel at hand  I found myself inevitably reminded of it  again and again  throughout my reading  For when Rashkolnikov s crime sets him on journey of self realisation  he seals the fate of those connected to him  It would seem childish folly to imagine one exempt from the trickle of the elegant design  but the suffering carved by one s own intentions bestowed  however unintentionally     but well  like Rashkol  maybe I am playing a fool s gambit  But a case has been made for suffering In the Notebooks for Crime and Punishment  Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky puts in writing on the main point of the novel  Man is not born for happiness  Man earns his happiness  and always by suffering  There is no injustice here  because the knowledge of life and consciousness  that is  that which is felt immediately with your body and spirit  that is  through the whole vital process of life  is acquired by experience pro and contra  which one must take upon one s self   By suffering  such is the law of our planet  but this immediate awareness  felt with the life process  is such a great joy that one gladly pays with years of suffering for it   After reading this  I am bemoaning my late discovery of Russian Literature  I have yet read only a few that belongs to this distinction  but of all that I have read I am amazed at their sheer brilliance  So much so that I am considering moving full time to this part of the literary world  Although that might be unrealised  I am ready to remedy the sparse collection of the greats of Russian Literature currently adorning my shelves   Made me realise why they call him  The Father of Psychology   Like all the really great ones  it is his compassion and insight into the human soul that is remarkable  It s a long  slow read  and quite dark in many places  Yet  he somehow extracts  eventually  a sense of peace and even hope from all this  as the book closes with the deranged murderer slowly making his penance to society  It is as if dostoyevsky sat on a bench in Petersburg  and lived an entire life within his soul  This life he led while he sat on that bench and people passed by looking strangely at him  is the story of it all  the misery  the true fleeing realizations of why we live that never last  and the people whom surround us but do not know us   swny

 but  classic  This book shows the magnitude of how ones choices effect the psychological makeup  I think this book is crucial for anyone who is retrospective in thought   Simply put  Dostoevsky s prose is brilliant  An excellent writer  With that being said  there are some problems with him as a novelist  however This is one of Dusty s early  serious  writings  It is by no means in league with the Brother K and has obvious marks of a progressive  but immature  novelist  This book was written right after Notes From the Underground  and in that novel Dusty essentially lays out what his earliest existential ideas  i e  the first fifty freakin  pages contain a pseudo intellectual self acknowledging contradictory ranting about individualistic validation  One could also take away that Notes is an obviously immature novel as not much happens plot wise beyond  I think  five examples of the existential individual reacting to his environment  Crime and Punishment is an expansion on those concepts laid out The end result  about two hundred unnecessary pages of sometimes sloppy plot and seemingly round but in reality flat characters that exist only to parallel the main characters  punishment   I guess that s a Russian flaw though  I ve heard War and Peace has about fifty irrelevant side characters  To sum it all up  Dusty uses his excellent prose to throw some really cool  and at the time  groundbreaking  ideas around  e g  individual enigma  existentialism  nature v  nurture concerning morality  mind body relationship  etc  but does so in a way that polarizes the reader by loosely exploring every possible rabbit hole existing between the two main events  the Crime and the Punishment  A must read for aspiring writers based on the style and diologue alone  but for the casual reader  the story is too simple and the names are kind of ridiculous for this to be considered a light read  Raskolnikov felt sick  he did indeed   While initially a little difficult to get into  the factual details of the first half of the book  which can be somewhat laborious  pale into insignificance as the psychological drama in the second half of the book unfolds as a remarkably telling expose of the human mind  Especially liked the parallels between Svidrigailof and Raskolnikof  which only became apparent after I had finished  Fyodor Dostoevesky  Crime and Punishment  Trans  Constance Garnett  New York  The Heritage Press  1938 Dostoevesky   Russian writers   influenced me greatly when I was in my early twenties  so I decided to reread a few  and I started with this one  I forgot that Raskonikov is described as handsome  4  and even though he is despicable  and extremely difficult to like  his friends and family forgive him his crimes  I remembered the book correctly  The crime is premeditated and Raskonikov hasn t a good reason for the murder  which turns into murders  Raskolnikov even thinks about the hat he is wearing  which he feels is too conspicuous and must be changed to blend in with a cap of a common sort  He muses and dreams about murdering the neighborhood pawnbroker for days and decides to do it after he overhears a conversation between an officer and a student about good and evil  They discuss the pawnbroker s sister  Lizaveta  whom they describe as good and who is abused by the old  hag    80  Raskolnikov thinks that the murder would serve as an example of how the world would be better off if the evil pawnbroker were dead    Listen   on one side we have a stupid  senseless  worthless  spiteful  ailing  horrid old woman  not simply useless but doing actual mischief  who has not an idea what she is living for herself  and who will die in a day or two in any case   On the other side  fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands  on every side  A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped  on that old woman s money which will be buried in a monastery   The old pawnbroker wouldn t even leave the money that was earned on the back of the sister  for one  to the sister  She wanted all of it to go to the monastery so they would say prayers for her soul      dozens of families saved from destitution  from ruin  from vice  from the Lock hospitals   and all with her money  Kill her  take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all  What do you think  would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds  For one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay  One death  and a hundred lives in exchange   it s simple arithmetic  Besides  what value has the life of that sickly  stupid  ill natured old woman in the balance of existence     This is what R overhears and this is exactly what he had been thinking  It s his rationalization for murder  Later he happens by the market and hears the pawnbroker s sister  Lizaveta  talking to a couple who convinces her to come by that evening at a specific time  He realizes that he now knows that the pawnbroker will be alone in her flat  He decides that because he overheard both conversations it means he should do it  R goes to the flat  tricks the pawnbroker into letting him in and then brutally  free of guilt or regret  and proceeds to bludgeon her to death with an ax  He does steal a few things  but it is later pointed out that he left a huge sum of money still in the flat  When the sister  described as sweet  passive  good  and kind  returns early  Raskolnikov does not hesitate to kill her as well  He does not show any remorse about her death either Sub plots abound   his sister  Sonia  the Madonna like character who had to turn to prostitution to save her family financially  the evil fiance of his sister s  a strange man who exploits his sister when she was a governess in his house and who eventually kills himself  and the deaths of Sonia s father  who when drunk is run over by a carriage  and  later  his widow  who dies a terrible death by TB  Russian writers of the time do not lack for drama Long discussions take place among the many characters about democracy  nihilism  early communism  science  psychology  religiosity  criminology  free marriage and communal living  424   and women s equality  423   There is talk about the mental environment of a crime  392   It s very interesting because the lead lawyer detective plays with R  He believes R committed the murders even when someone else confesses to the murder Raskolnikov proclaims to Sonya that he has only  killed a louse   479  and that he murdered two people because he wanted to  have the daring  Sonia  That was the whole cause of it   Despicable  She s shocked by what he says  but she stays by him   481   I wanted to murder without casuistry  to murder for my own sake  for myself alone    I did the murder for myself  for myself alone    Raskolnikov believes his has the right to murder because he is not common   the  genius  rationalization  He is above everyone else and doesn t have to live by society s rule  He is like any dictator who brings death and destruction to his country or to the country of others  Is there any greater evil  After he confesses and is sent to Siberia  where Sonia follows him  he does not repent  In fact he spends a lot of time thinking and describing  in different ways  the strength of anarchy  Dostoeyevsky ties it all up in the end and not all that convincingly  One of the best books I ve ever read  Psychologically deep  very intriguing and fascinating  Dostoyevsky knows how to describe people and places with some short remarks as lively as a 3D movie  This is one of my all time favorite books  It is such a human story  It includes such a range of human conditions and emotions  but it ends with redemption  Everyone should read it once   I DID IT Profonda introspezione dell animo umano   Delitto e castigo  e un libro che non puo lasciare indifferente il lettore Tutto ruota attorno al protagonista  Raskolnikov  ma la storia si popola di altri personaggi che non compaiono solo come mere macchiette  ma vivono di una propria tangibile umanita  sullo sfondo di una desolante Pietroburgo In una societa come la nostra in cui nessuno si fa piu carico delle proprie colpe e delle proprie responsabilita   Delitto e castigo  appare  quasi 150 anni dopo la sua creazione  ancora perfettamente attuale  Crime and Punishment is obviously a classic  Everyone has heard of the book  and pretty much everyone who s read it can only praise it  Like that of most Russian novels  the story is psychologically very deep  It tends to be dark and sinister  but the theme is extremely intriguing and the characters very real  Characters  names are tough to pronounce and often hard to remember  but other than that  the story is extremely readable and understandable  This is one of the best 100 books of all time  Moral of the story  DO NOT TALK TO THE POLICE  This book deserves to be here if for no other reason then it takes my breath away  I have read it a few times now but will never forget my first foray in Dostoyevsky s dark world     sitting in a darkened room in France on the hard floor with my back pressed into a heater for warmth and just being sucked into this book     seriously  WW3 could have started around me and I would not have moved from my spot  To this day  some 9 years later  I still get a shiver up my spine thinking about it  Not for the faint hearted  show what a book  what a dialogs  Written in such a way you get sucked into the feverish state of mind of the main character and killer  struggling with his intellect  his philosophical reasoning  his hubris  his naivety  his anxiety  his personal circumstances and in the end it is still about love and recognition  Ormai ho imparato a conoscere un po  Dostoevskij  tanto da poter trovare dei tratti comuni nei suoi romanzi che ho letto  tanto da potermi sentire in confidenza tale da poterlo chiamare  Dosto      ma soprattutto tanto da poterlo annoverare tra i miei preferiti  Ho iniziato le lettura di Delitto e castigo un po  titubante  come mi accade sempre quando inizio un libro da cui mi aspetto molto  e devo ammettere che all inizio ho faticato un po  a farmi coinvolgere  Poi  ecco il colpo di fulmine  ancora una volta  pur descrivendo un uomo che vive a Pietroburgo nel XIX secolo  ecco che il caro Dosto parla di me  E allora mi sono sentita sempre piu attratta dalla narrazione  e non solo per Raskol nikov  ma anche per tutti gli altri personaggi e per le vicende che  come ormai il Dosto mi ha abituato  si intrecciano  evolvono  modificano tra loro  Ti fa affezionare a tutti  il Dosto  anche agli assassini e ai depravati  Ancora di piu dopo questa lettura voglio proseguire con la Bibliografia del Dosto  Se penso che la prima volta che mi approcciai ai Karamazov non mi stavano piacendo e li abbandonai     Sacrilegio      http   www naufragio it iltempodilegg    Haunting  excruciating  and perfect  I read it on the subway  a few pages at a time  over several months  That worked well because I couldn t have borne much more than a small amount of this story at any one time  Still  I m glad I read it  Reason for reading I had never read The House Of The Dead    or The Brothers Karamazov    or The Idiot    or any of Dostoevsky s works  There was a gaping hole in my literary knowledge and while I am similarly unaquainted with Tolstoy  neither War   Peace nor Anna Karenina have ever enticed me  Maybe one day  Dostoevsky was different  He had epilepsy and died from a hemorrhage as a result of a seizure  That is one reason I am drawn to him  The fact that I love St Petersburg  although it was Leningrad the two times I went there  is another  A mix of politics  religion and psychology  The presence of the roots of existentialism  Agonising reflections on his time in exile in Siberia  And ultimately the fact that Crime   Punishment appears on just about every list of  best greatest most influential  books of all time is a pretty good reason to pick it up to find out why About the book A destitute former student  Raskolnikov  plans and incompetently commits a murder  It seems at first this is done purely with the aim of easing his parlous financial state  but it transpires that he has a long held belief that there are those with a higher purpose who can act in ways that are above the law in order to achieve greater things  He sees himself as a Napoleon figure and wants to test himself to see if he can  step over  such an act into greatness  His own punishment of inner torment is at the core of what is largely a bleak tale of human suffering  He plays mind games with the police chief investigating the crime  His relationship with his mother and sister and his sister s various suitors of all backgrounds provide a series of complex entanglements for him to cope with  And the prostitute Sonya and her family offers some chance to persuade him into an act of redemption Quote  unquote He walked out  he was reeling  His head was spinning  He could not feel his legs under him  He started down the stairs  propping himself against the wall with his right arm  It seemed to him that some caretaker with a book in his hands pushed him as he climbed past on his way up to the office  that some little mutt was barking its head off somewhere on a lower floor  and that some woman threw a rolling pin at it and shouted  He went on down the stairs and out into the courtyard  There in the courtyard  not far from the entrance  stood Sonya  pale  numb all over  and she gave him a wild  wild look  He stopped before her  Something pained and tormented  something desperate  showed in her face  She clasped her hands  A hideous  lost smile force itself to his lips He stood a while  grinned and turned back upstairs to the office What was good Raskolnikov is possibly the finest protagonist to grace any tale that I have ever come across  He makes the book as exciting a read as you can imagine and the frantic pace as he lurches from one psychological trauma to another  with explosive human relationships combusting all around him is staggering  There are mental cat and mouse games played with the police chief  Porfiry Petrovich  to match ones you ve read in any thriller  His sister  Dunya  friend Razumikhin  and the array of wonderfully created other characters light up the book  It means that the appalling oppressive poverty of pre revolutionary Russia is never suffocating even though the book is a very dark one  You are sucked in though  to Raskolnikov s world and his fevered state of mind  There is a twisted love story with his powerful relationship with the young prostitute Sonya and real comedy offered at the funeral wake for her father  Every word is worth dwelling on  even with some of Dostoevsky s single paragraphs running to three pages  although a spell binding plot drags you along at breakneck speed  This truly is a great work and is on all those lists for good reason What wasn t good The epilogue wasn t quite what I had hoped for   or at least in the final pages  Whether that counts as a flaw or not I don t know  It s more a reflection of my own beliefs I suspect  On Tuesday  I was telling Robin after we voted about one of my favorite novels of all time  Crime and Punishment  I explained to him in detail about this book regarding the plot and how it reveals so much about society  the difference between right and wrong and then finding out what the meaning of life is truly about  This book tells that story Last night I cleaned out one side of my closet  And wouldn t you know it in the midst of heap of books this one fell on the floor  It s a sign  Yes  I believe in fun things like that  I haven t read this book since the mid 1990 s and I am thrilled to be rereading it again  What a perfect book for me to find  to anchor into and to remember and discover deep and darker secrets in this life  I cannot wait to reach it s end  Sonya   I am rooting for you  Take time to re read one of your favorite classics  Nothing could be more nourishing to my soul right now m The best classic I have ever read  Not since  A Cather in the Rye  has a book affected me as much  I first tried reading it when I was 16  but threw it away after the first 100 pages  At the time  without realising  I wasn t ready  Recently I picked it back up and couldn t put it down  Masterpiece   ch  aejybae       Dostoevsky s Crime and Punishment is largely a meditation on the nature of freedom and self determination  wherein the protagonist  Raskolnikov  makes an important decision to commit murder and is forced upon an intricate quest to rationalize and justify his crime while discovering the consequences it imposes upon his own identity  The implied author makes use of secondary characters as  doubles  of his protagonist  representing possible identities of Raskolnikov in his search for his own selfhood and its meaning  With the character Porfiry Petrovich  Dostoevsky mirrors Raskolnikov s superficial mannerisms as well as essential components of Raskolnikov s identity  the coldly rational  educated intellectual  and the dedicated ethical idealist  This mirroring of Raskolnikov eventually helps him to come to terms with his own identity through moral expiation of the crime  Firstly  the implied author uses the character of Porfiry Petrovich to mirror his protagonist s superficial peculiarities  While Raskolnikov is often ill and feverish throughout the novel  Porfiry Petrovich  too  seems to be prone to constant ailment  He complains about his weak constitution  and confesses that he s  often afraid of an attack of paralysis   273   Similarly  both men are prone to inappropriate outbursts of laughter  as Porfiry Petrovich himself confesses  Ibid   The implied author s likening of both men s proneness to sickness and their peculiar tendency towards fits of laughter helps to draw attention to less superficially obvious similarities between the characters  their staunch rationality and ethical idealism   Raskolnikov  especially in the beginning of the novel  attempts to view his murdering of Alyona Ivanovna as a rational  emotionless and deliberate decision  and Porfiry Petrovich serves as a manifestation of this kind of intellectualism  During their first encounter  Porfiry Petrovich addresses Raskolnikov s concerns  coldly  and with a  businesslike air   204   This frank  utilitarian disposition parallels Raskolnikov s own coldly calculated motives for murdering Alyona Ivanovna as outlined in his article on the conditional permissibility of the criminal behaviour  211 212   Here  both the examining magistrate and the rational Raskolnikov seem to have alienated themselves to some extent from ordinary sentimentality in favour of a calculated  rational mentality  Like Raskolnikov  Porfiry Petrovich is quick thinking and constantly calculating  as when he deals with the surprise of Nikolai s unwelcome confession by immediately attempting to logically refute the confrontation and observing that  it s not his own tale he s telling  286   Throughout the novel  Porfiry Petrovich remains determined and collected in his pursuit of Raskolnikov  and this steadfastness embodies Raskolnikov s own adherence to rationality  As Marina Turkevich Naumann writes  Porfiry uses his own rationality to convince Raskolnikov of the error in his own reasoning  She writes that  Porfirij is cognizant of the fact that Raskol nikov cannot live with this guilty conscience   and that he starts  echoing all of Raskol nikov s theories  to  drive  him into a frenzy  of doubt    48   Porfiry thus uses his capacity for rationality to appeal to Raskolnikov s own reason  and by  doubling  his own premises causes him to reject them  Having thus disarmed him of his rational justification  Porfiry Petrovich is then used by the implied to double Raskolnikov s idealism and drive him towards confession  As well as  doubling  Raskolnikov s quick rationality  Porfiry Petrovich mirrors Raskolnikov s ethical idealism  Like the idealistic Raskolnikov s motivation for murder  Porfiry Petrovich s primary concern in solving the crime is also moral one  He describes himself as  a man of heart and conscience    369  not unlike Raskolnikov with his warped utilitarian motivation for murder  He seems to take a genuine ethical interest in Raskolnikov s spiritual redemption through confession  as though his foremost objective in solving Alyona and Lizaveta Ivanovna s murder is to redeem the perpetrator  Porfiry Petrovich s own ideal is that confession and punishment lead to a morally  great expiation   376   Indeed  he is so passionate about Raskolnikov s moral redemption through confession that he displays such sincere  alarm and sympathy  towards Raskolnikov that Raskolnikov himself   looked  at him with wild curiosity   279   This fervent idealism parallels Raskolnikov s attempts to adhere to his own moral imperative  Both men seem to have devised their own ethical frameworks  and both are profoundly devoted to their respective ideologies  Thus  the character of Porfiry Petrovich is used by the implied author as a double of the protagonist with regards to his strong and profound idealism  This notion of Porfiry Petrovich as a mirror for Raskolnikov s conscience is strengthened by his foreshadowing of Raskolnikov s later redemption through confession to himself under suffering  377   William Burnham writes that   What makes Crime and Punishment a true psychological thriller  however  is the fact that the confession before Porfiry Petrovich is a legal necessity for Raskolnikov s undoing   1236   This  however  overlooks the fundamental importance of Porfiry Petrovich as a double of Raskolnikov s idealism  the confession is necessary not for Raskolnikov s undoing  but for his redemption  Porfiry Petrovich is not interested in ruining Raskolnikov  but in redeeming his  conscience  through  punishment   215   By compelling him to confess  Porfiry Petrovich represents the reasonable and ethical dimension of Raskolnikov which  having rejected its initial criminal theory  now longs for redemption through confession  Thus  Porfiry Petrovich urges Raskolnikov to confess not in order to ruin him  but to make atonement for his wrong  In this way  Porfiry Petrovich s  doubling  of Raskolnikov s ethical idealism ultimately induces his own repentance and moral expiation  Thus  the implied author in Crime and Punishment uses the technique of  doubling  Raskolnikov s superficial peculiarities  adherence to rationality  and ethical idealism through Porfiry Petrovich to depict Raskolnikov s own struggle with his identity in the aftermath of his crime  By mirroring Raskolnikov s character  Porfiry Petrovich both disarms him of his rational justification for the crime and appeals to his idealistic nature to induce his repentance  Dostoevsky employs this technique of  doubling  his protagonist to develop the novel s themes of guilt  repentance  and the search for identity  WORKS CITEDBurnham  William   The Legal Context and Contributions of Dostoevsky s  Crime and Punishment    Michigan Law Review  Vol  100  No  6  The Michigan Law Review Association  May 2002

book so captured my hideous existence at university  distilling everything and dovetailing seamlessly into my nightmare world  as to make the portentous reality merely an extension of it  so that I was forced to recognise the nature of my situation  to confront it and to deal with it      only  Dear Reader  I didn t      No comments  This book is a masterpiece  It is so called   must read   book  What can I add to what everybody knows  What a great book  no wonder it s a classic  Having taken a long break from 19th century literature it was hard  but worth it  getting back to the brutality of the industrial setting and the philosophical musings of the characters  The book being Russian  too  I thought there was an interesting element of economical philosophy as well  And the title  it should actually be  Crimes and Punishments   there are so many in there  LOVED IT  This book will make you pale and lean  as someone once said  And possibly give you a twitch  You don t finish Crime and Punishment  Crime and Punishment finishes you   I suppose everybody who actually pulls this book off the shelf to read thinks it s great  But surprise  it actually is great  And not in the way I expected it to be I read this at a time when most books  especially contemporary books  come across as not just boring  but also pretentious  What s so refreshing about this book is it s a suspenseful story about passionate people in twists of fate they don t understand Also  I can t remember the last time I read a book with this many good scenes and dialogue  It s rare to read a book where the author relies almost entirely on conversations between characters to run the story  Oh Raskolnikov  you so crazeh Bloody loved this long winded door stop of a book  The moral ambiguities and Nietzsche esque ideas are all dealt with by Dostoyevsky like he knows human nature inside out I can t say the book is easy to read  not that it requires a genius to read it s just exceptionally detailed about almost all thoughts and feelings the characters have  but it s alldone in a way that you need to keep reading I also don t think Svidrigailov is the bad guy he s made out to be  I felt quite sorry for him  The reason i think so highly of this book isnt because it is so fast paced but because of the depth of understanding and exploration that the author gave to it  It was fasinating to me how the things we do effect our perspective of people and events  Very good book  This is definitely my favorite piece of classic literature  I love the constant struggle between what is  right and wrong   I constantly found myself changing my stance on whether the character should come clean or not  Definitely a book I will read over and over again     While it is probably not the ideal novel for a school project  I do not regret reading it  I chose this novel because I read War and Peace over the summer and it was my first exposure to Russian authors  I enjoyed that novel immensely  and would have read another novel by Tolstoy if I hadn t encountered this quote from Nietszche   Dostoevsky the only psychologist from whom I ve anything to learn   Nietszche was famous for the claim that  God is dead   while the little I knew about Dosteovsky was that he was an avid Christian  This contradiction led me to read a novel by him  Crime and Punishment  as it was his most acclaimed The portions of the novel that I enjoyed the most were the one s involving Luzhin or Pyotr Petrovich  the rather pompous fiance of the protagonist s sister  Dunya  The atmosphere of the book was very heavy at times and the mishaps of this character provided some sort of relief  There were many occasions in which he attempted to impress  outwit or trap Raskilinikov  only to be ripped to shreds by the main character s sharp mind  acid tongue and furious temper  A good example of this is Raskilnikov s late interjection into an argument about the recent death of a pawnbroker and the relevance of traditional morality between Pyotr Petrovich and Razumikhin  a student  Raskilnikov ridicules Pyotr Petrovich  and then accuses Luzhin of taking advantage of his sister  Luzhin is utterly lost       if I were told  love thy neighbour   what came of it   Pyotr Petrovitch went on     It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked    Science now tells us  love yourself before all men  for everything in the world rests on self interest  You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole  Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society    better is the common welfare organised too          another circumstance interests me in the case   what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes  too  crime is increasing proportionately  And if this old woman  the pawnbroker  has been murdered by some one of a higher class in society  for peasants don t pawn gold trinkets  how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society   What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes   Everybody is getting rich one way or another  so I want to make haste to get rich too        Replied the student  But morality  And so to speak  principles       But why do you worry about it   Raskolnikov interposed suddenly   It s in accordance with your theory    In accordance with my theory    Why  carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now  and it follows that people may be killed       Upon my word   cried Luzhin  Raskolnikov lay with a white face twitching upper lip  breathing painfully   There s a measure in all things   Luzhin went on superciliously   Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder  and one has but to suppose       And it is true   Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly  again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him   is it true that you told your fiancee     within an hour of her acceptance  that what pleased you most     was that she was a beggar     because it was better to raise a wife from poverty  so that you may have complete control over her  and reproach her with your being her benefactor    Upon my word   Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably  crimson with confusion    Whenever the investigator Porfiry Petrovich interrogated the protagonist  I felt increasingly uncomfortable  Dostoevsky was able to create an incessant  prickly atmosphere in these scenes  I often felt as if I  and not Raskilnikov  were being toyed with  The possibility of him giving himself away  added to the anxiety  These scenes were also quite long  and it took patience  perseverance and maybe even resilience to plough through them  An acute example of this occurs when Rodya Raskilnikov is summoned to explain his relationship to the deceased woman  Idle details  circular discussions and Raskilnikov s self awareness combine to agonise the reader   I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me     formally     about my acquaintance with the murdered woman   Raskolnikov was beginning again   Why did I put in  I believe   passed through his mind in a flash   Why am I so uneasy at having put in that  I believe    came in a second flash  And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry  at the first words  at the first looks  had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions  and that this was fearfully dangerous  His nerves were quivering  his emotion was increasing   It s bad  it s bad  I shall say too much again    Yes yes yes  There s no hurry  there s no hurry   muttered Porfiry Petrovitch  moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim  as it were making dashes towards the window  the bureau and the table  at one moment avoiding Raskolnikovs  suspicious glance  then again standing still and looking him straight in the face   His fat round little figure looked very strange  like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back   We ve plenty of time  Do you smoke  have you your own  Here  a cigarette   he went on  offering his visitor a cigarette   You know I am receiving you here  but my own quarters are through there  you know  my government quarters  But I am living outside for the time  I had to have some repairs done here  It s almost finished now     Government quarters  you know  are a capital thing  Eh  what do you think    Yes  a capital thing   answered Raskolnikov  looking at him almost ironically   A capital thing  a capital thing   repeated Porfiry Petrovitch  as though he had just thought of something quite different   Yes  a capital thing   he almost shouted at last  suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him  This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious  brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor  But this stirred Raskolnikov s spleen more than ever    Dostoevsky s ability to create complex  realistic characters is his greatest strength  Each character has an almost contradictory dual nature  Luzhin is progressive yet elitist  Sonya  a prostitute  is hardened yet innocent  Svidrigailov  Dunya s former employer is depraved yet generous  Dunya herself is assertive at times and submissive during others  Finally  Raskilnikov is cold hearted yet pitiable  The most telling example is Svidrigailov  who is infamous for attempting to seduce Dunya while she was under his employment  despite being married and a great deal older  The duality is exhibited in the scenes when he attempts to blackmail Dunya and then gives away a great deal of wealth  Svidrigailov tells Dunya that Raskilnikov is on the verge of arrest  and that he is the only person who can  save  him      You     one word from you  and he is saved  I     I ll save him  I have money and friends  I ll send him away at once  I ll get a passport  two passports  one for him and one for me  I have friends     capable people     If you like  I ll take a passport for you     for your mother      What do you want with Razumihin  I love you too     I love you beyond everything     Let me kiss the hem of your dress  let me  let me     The very rustle of it is too much for me  Tell me   do that   and I ll do it  I ll do everything  I will do the impossible  What you believe  I will believe  I ll do anything  anything  Don t  don t look at me like that  Do you know that you are killing me       Later  he visits Sonya   I may be going to America  Sofya Semyonovna   said Svidrigailov   and as I am probably seeing you for the last time  I have come to make some arrangements  Well  did you see the lady to day  I know what she said to you  you need not tell me    Sonia made a movement and blushed    Those people have their own way of doing things  As to your sisters and your brother  they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments  You had better take charge of the receipts  in case anything happens  Here  take them  Well  now that s settled  Here are three 5 percent  bonds to the value of three thousand roubles  Take those for yourself  entirely for yourself  and let that be strictly between ourselves  so that no one knows of it  whatever you hear  You will need the money  for to go on living in the old way  Sofya Semyonovna  is bad  and besides there is no need for it now   While Svidrigailov is a minor character  the duality is clear and in high contrast  At one moment he is a lechy  creepy old man  the next moment he seems a considerate benefactor  Svidrigailov is under no obligation and gains little from this generosity  Svidrigailov was at most an acquantice of the impoverished Sofya Semyonovna  However  the reader is not disbelieving  since this gesture is within the spontaneous  generous character of Svidrigailov  Svidrigailov  old yet childish  matures after this confrontation with Dunya  This duality allows Dostoevsky to surpass conventional narratives of not only  good  and  bad   but also complex yet static characters  Dostoevsky s characters are always in transformation  and that is really what provides them authenticity  It is difficult for an amateur writer like myself to comment on the weakness of an iconic author like Dostoevsky  However  in my opinion the negativity of the book would probably be its greatest weakness  The numb  drilling thoughts of Raskilnikov are explored for pages on end  Furthermore  each scene is experienced through his eyes  making even a party scene frustrating and agonizing  Possibly the most depressing image is the childhood flashback of a horse being beaten to death  He ran beside the mare  ran in front of her  saw her being whipped across the eyes  right in the eyes  He was crying  he felt choking  his tears were streaming  One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face  he did not feel it  Wringing his hands and screaming  he rushed up to the grey headed old man with the grey beard  who was shaking his head in disapproval  One woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away  but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare  She was almost at the last gasp  but began kicking once more     I ll teach you to kick   Mikolka shouted ferociously  He threw down the whip  bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long  thick shaft  he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare        It s my property   shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow  There was a sound of a heavy thud     Thrash her  thrash her  Why have you stopped   shouted voices in the crowd And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare  She sank back on her haunches  but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force  tugged first on one side and then on the other  trying to move the cart  But the six whips were attacking her in all directions  and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time  then a fourth  with heavy measured blows  Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow        She ll fall in a minute  mates  there will soon be an end of her   said an admiring spectator in the crowd     Fetch an axe to her  Finish her off   shouted a third     I ll show you  Stand off   Mikolka screamed frantically  he threw down the shaft  stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar   Look out   he shouted  and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare  The blow fell  the mare staggered  sank back  tried to pull  but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log   No doubt this image is effective  It brings to light the pointless cruelty that often forms part of human nature  while foreshadowing Raskilnikov s own thoughtless homicide  However  the sheer helplessness of the horse in this scene  which happens to occur towards the start of novel  can put the most perseverant reader off  It may be possible to highlight these same issues with less negativity  however  perhaps it is Dostoevsky s intention to force the reader into an uncomfortable reflection Crime and Punishment  being a classic  intends to provide some sort of insight into life  A more literal examination of the book would lead the reader to draw parallels with the Crime and Punishment in Western liberal democracies  USA being the best example of this  The United States accounts for 5  of the world population  yet 25  of the world s prisoners  leading the world in gross prison population  Yet  every year  one out of five Americans are victims of crime  amongst the highest in the world  Dostoevsky s insight in prisons role in criminalizing people  is relevant  and seems to be backed up by the statistics  However  it is the contrasting  dual traits of characters that provided the deepest insight for me  The realization that people are characters in transformation is not only interesting  but has practical application for any member of society  While it may help one to be empathetic towards others  it also encourages one to transform and surpass oneself  Possibly akin to Nietszche s  Superman  philosophy  which may account for his praise of Dostoevsky This book is not very entertaining  Except for Luzhin  few moments offer comic relief  However  the heavy  toxic atmosphere forces the reader along a path of uncomfortable reflection  The reader is made to face unhappy truths about human nature  irrationality and cruelty  In addition  the reader sees the world he knows painted in the dull  depraved shades that color Raskilnikov s mind  Seeing the world through this lens  along with the transforming characters that the reader is introduced to  encourages the reader to change his outlook on life  While one is not meant to adopt Raskilnikov s negative view  one must just acknowledge that these views exist and are valid  Thus  the real value of this book lies in this uncomfortable reflection that might result in a change in perspective While I can t say I enjoyed this book  reading it was probably one of the most important things I did this year  While it was unable to permanantly mar my optimism about life  it has added a certain amount of caution to my thoughts and actions  Along with A Brave New World  this book led me to write my latest piece in the Hawks Eye Newspaper  easily the most pessimistic piece of writing I have ever written  In fact  this novel caused me to fling away my usual enthusiasm for school  and replace it with a listless attitude that was probably not very beneficial for my Grad year  While diction used ia rather simple  the complexity of the mainly gloomy situations  emotions and dialogues makes the novel surprisingly challenging to read  On the other hand  for the characterization alone  this book is a worthwile read  Nietschze s praise may not have been that off the mark  after all  The greatest study of psychology and tale of redemption ever conceived or penned  Dostoyevsky captures our imagination with the very Chapter and the novel never ceases to mystify  Undoubtedly  you watch as Rodion becomes a part of your very soul and you evidently seek redemption in your Sonia  Having said that  the redemption of Lebeziatnikoff is no less poignant  Porphyrius never gains his  quite happy for that  Though the redemption of Sonia is what tears your heart to pieces  even writing about it sends chills down my spine  so much provocation is in the event  With this  I say Adieu  though it would be better to say Au Revoir     Oh how wrong I ever was to judge a book by it s cover  Fyodor Dostevesky is a masterful author and the world he writes about comes alive with every fascinating character and the main  Raskolnikov is truly one of the most complex  disarming and genuinely unique figures imagined  I m so happy I pushed through the long rambling speeches the characters make in this book because in the heart of this book is a story that makes you think and think some more and I m really just so impressed with this and will recommend it to anyone who asks  A compelling story  told in a truly original way by a writer who knows what he s talking about  Wow  I mean  just wow  I m so happy to have found a book really worth reading  This was perhaps the most influential book on my young mind  The first time I read it I was enthralled by Raskolnikov  I related  He made sense to me and it was a thrilling horror show of the psyche  Then I reread it and could finally hear the voice of Razumikhin and it turned into brilliant comedy  I consider Dostoyevsky  like Kafka  to be the two funniest writers in the history of lit  I first read this book in a Russian literature course during my junior year of college  I was grappling with its weight while trying to to keep up with the reading load of three other lit courses    but was still pierced by this challenging text  I turned to it again post college and it remains one of the most powerful and captivating books I ve ever read  This sums it up   Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart  The really great men must  I think  have great sadness on earth    Do you think that a bad action could be erased if followed by many good ones  My all time favorite so far   I never read Dostoevsky before   and not such a voluminous book like this   but it is worth reading it   A sort of psychological journey where you are made to feel the nuance of human emotions ranging from the insanity of a criminal standing on the verge of lethal  the mental agony of a murder  the angst of a mother  the love of a caring sister  the friendship of a friend through hardship   the debouchery of Svidrigailov and his lack of moral sense overshadowing his benefactory nature  the helplessness of Sonia   Dostoevsky is the master of observing and portraying human mind  It is his own experience that he was able to transcribe all those emotions felt deep down in his heart  cerebral  seriously  brain fevers are all over this thing  I had previously read and immensely enjoyed the Constance Garnett translation  but hope now to read Coulson s for Oxford World s Classics when I can I was decided on the Pevear and Volokhonsky edition for a long while  but then happened across Avsey s translation of The Karamazov Brothers at the bookshop the other day and found that it read spectacularly  with a kind of force Garnett s version simply didn t achieve  though it should be said that her translations of Chekhov s short prose are the best I ve come across and her translation of Crime and Punishment did not fail to hold my interest in Dostoyevsky   Hopefully the Oxford edition doesn t disappoint here either  I love this book  It was the means of my re discovery of the fantastic world of reading  I had come to hate that mandatory school reading list  This was the book that reminded me how to enjoy reading  That  and my literature professor Antun Milovan  Hvala profesore  I loved this book  I was kind of depressed at the time which didn t help but I thought it was fascinating  I don t want to ruin the book but the ending was amazing  The real punishment is psychological I believe  That is the worst of all possible punishments but the one that comes with all crimes  I want to talk with someone about the book  it s been a while for me and I was young but I want to see what ya ll have to say   This is probably one of my favourite books ever  Read it when I was about 15yo and it sure did open my mind up to the complexity of the human mind and all the possibilities in life  At 15 it wasn t the happiest book to read but I loved it and I still do read it sometimes   The plot of Crime and Punishment is centered on the moral struggles and mental anguish of the protagonist  Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov was an impoverished former student in St  Pittsburg who dropped out of school due to financial reasons  He conceptualizes a plan to kill a pawn broker  for the benefit of the impoverished in his immediate community  What kind of a man would kill for the benefit of mankind  What benefit of mankind Raskolnikov goes ahead to murder the pawn broker  Alyona Ivanovna  with an axe  an act the author described in exhaustive details   Raskolnikov kills Alyona Ivanovna  and soon realizes that he forgot to lock the door  Alyona Ivanovna s half sister  Lizaveta  who unfortunately stumbled into the scene of the crime  was also murdered by Raskolnikov His plan is in line with his own hypothesis  something he had proposed in a paper he published in a Journal   that certain people have the tendencies of becoming a Napolean  a man God  by stepping beyond the moral and legal limits of man made institutions  As such  murder and all kinds of social vices are permissible  only to the extent that these kinds of people see their actions as a means towards the uplifting humanity  Rskolnikov was driven by the ambitions to become a Napolean  This thesis is to be reflected through the 20th and 21st century  in characters like Hitler  the Soviets  religious fundamentalists etc Raskolnikov in Razumikhin s company visits Porfiry Petrovich  They discuss about Raskolnikov s published work  In the scene  Dostoyevsky  speaking through Raskolnikov  lays bare the objective of the novel  He gives the reader the idea of the Napoleonic character he saw in human nature  It was a kind of prophetic hypothesis  My criticism of the novel is based on the fact that Dostoyevsky precisely analyzed and fore told the defect of human nature  He predicted a hydra headed monster and left mankind with his fate  in the middle of nowhere  As a conservative that he is  he offers no solution to this problem  a fundamental defect of Dostoyevsky s ideas  Like Raskolnikov said   its not my fault that this problem exist  After the murder  Raskolnikov steals the items of the pawn broker  He hides the stolen items under a rock  Thereafter  he falls into a deep feverish unconscious state and his conscience is deeply troubled over the crime  He had been mistaken in his thought that the act of murder would transform him into a Napolean  Instead of the boost of his ego  he got a charred conscience In his state of delirium  Raskolnikov was cared for by Natasha  the housekeeper at his apartment  a doctor named Zossimov  and his best friend  Razumikhin The story goes back and forth  and back and forth  in intense psychological drama  Raskolnikov is at times nasty  at others funny  and at others pitiful  He is tormented by his conscience  He behaves like a lunatic  arrogant  temperamental and self delusional  He roams the streets of St  Pittsburg  drawing suspicions to himself  On one occasion  he goes to the house where he murdered the pawn broker and asks to buy the place  On another occasion  he talks carelessly in a bar with Zametov  the police official  and almost confesses his crime  The story becomes the talk of the town and the police start to investigate the crime In a related sub plot  Raskolnikov receives a letter and money from his mother  In the letter  his mother asks for his consent for his sister  Dunya  to accept the marriage proposal of one Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin  a middle income earner in St  Petsburg  Raskolnikov resents the idea because he felt that his mother was selling his sister for money In another sub plot  Mamelydov  a town drunk  whom Raskolnikov had met in a bar in the period of conceptualizing his crime  is overriding by a horse  and dies suddenly  Here the deep altruistic  double  side of Raskolnikov begins to evolve  He gives the money he got from his mother to the family of Mamelydov to organize the funeral of the dead  He begins to develop emotions for Sonia  the daughter of Mamelydov  who had been driven into prostitution to support her family Raskolnikov s mother and Dunya visit St  Pittsburg  to see Raskolnikov and Luzhin  Raskolnikov s disapproval of Dunya s relationship with Luzhin becomes obvious  Raskolnikov makes his position very clear  that his sister should choose between him and Luzhin  Dunya chooses her brother  Raskolnikov  This coincides with the time that a police detective  Porfiry  begins to suspect Raskolnikov of the murder of the pawn broker In another sub plot  yet another character  Svidrigailov  is introduced  Dunya had worked as a governess for Svidrigailov s family  but was forced out of the position  Svidrigailov was attracted to Dunya  He comes to St  Pittsburg to see Dunya  He reveals that his wife is dead and intends to pay Dunya a vast sum of money The relationship between Raskolnikov and Sonya begins to develop at this point  Sonya happens to have some Christian values  Raskolnikov feels the urge to confess his crime to Dunya  He asks her to read him the story of Lazarus  Afterwards as their relationship develops  Raskolnikov confesses his crime to Sonya  By coincidence  Svidrigailov was taking up residence in a room next to Sonya s  He overhears Raskolnikov s confession  Svidrigailov begins to develop the tendencies to use the confession to blackmail Raskolnikov and his sister Dunya Sonya urges Raskolnikov to confess his sins and kiss the ground  Porfiry also coincidentally confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and tries to prod him to confess  so as to get a lighter sentence  Svidrigailov attempts to seduce Dunya  She had a gun pointed at him  After two failed attempts at killing him  he lets her go  He is convinced that she doesn t love him  The next day he shoots himself Raskolnikov kissed the ground  as demanded by Sonya  then he goes to the police bureau to confess  He is sentenced to eight years in prison and then taken to Siberia  Sonya  as she had promised earlier  followed Raskolnikov to the prison  Dunya eventually marries Razumikhin  Raskolnikov s mother fell ill and died  After some time in prison  and with Sonya as his companion  Raskolnikov begins to get redemptions While I maintain that it poverty and suffering brings out the sanctity of the human soul  suffering cannot be considered as a condition to redemption  Here lies my criticism of Dostoyevsky  Redemption  rebirth and spiritual regeneration are a consequence of the human will  God leaves us to the freedom of our choices  Light and darkness cannot meet  God cannot impose suffering on us  because he wants us to be saved  Excellent Nice novel  Painful insight in to human nature  A transforming story   Utterly fantastic  Some scenes from this novel will stay with you forever  A riveting exploration of both the human mind and Russian society in St  Petersburg 150 years ago  Dostoevsky peels your mind like a grape and takes you on a soul battering trip to transcendence  The characters are sometimes almost hyper real  I think I can feel Sdrigailov s breath on my face during his speaking passages  and it s a harrowing experience  Three cautions  the Russian penchant for multiple names used interchangeably may be confusing   two   I ve heard that the quality of translations varies considerably   and finally   the physical travails of the characters may leave you vicariously exhausted  This book was amazing and had such a deep and profound theme  There is so much symbolism in this book  and whoever translated it from the Russian was a genius  along with Fyodor Dostoevsky  probably the best or one of the best Russian authors of all time  Masterpiece for me  Knigata  koiato pronikna nai d lboko v dushata mi  Epokhalen roman The book  which penetrated most deeply into my soul  Epochal novel  Through a diverse cast of characters  dostoevsky asks us to consider the relationship between morality and legality  what is the definition of a  crime   why is it so often determined retroactively whether an action was justified or not  sometimes i wondered as a kid how the exact same action  say  jumping on the couch cushions  could be punished so differently simply by the difference in the outcome  did i break something or not   the penalty for jumping on the couch should be a fixed quantity  regardless of the near random consequences of the action  perhaps  more than results of the action  we should base our punishment on the intentions of perpetrator  take drunk driving for example  if you are pulled over for driving drunk  the penalty is loss of license and a litany of other annoyances designed to teach you a lesson  if  however  your exact same transgression results in the loss of an innocent life  a pedestrian   your penalty for drunk driving will be prison  you did the same thing  had the same intentions  only the outcome was different another great question dostoevsky poses is whether transgression of the law or of morality are permissible in the pursuit of a higher goal  raskolnikov believes that certain people were endowed with a greater intellect  a greater  will to power  to borrow a phrase  and are thus above the law when rising to their great potential  the people who move society forward are all criminals at heart  destroyers of the status quo  often their actions result in bloodshed  but all is forgiven when they achieve their aims  if they do not  however  achieve their aims  they are held accountable for the very same actions which would otherwise have been forgotten or even applauded for all the lessons in this novel  it s still a wonderful story  the 19th century dialogue translated from russian is tiresome and ridiculous  but you can get used to it  It is a great piece of literature  The way that the writer developes the characters is very special  There is detective in this book that the last dialogue between him and the protagonist really surprised me  I admit that I liked it And it is a journey to human mind  a difficult one  Rascolnikov can be any of us   A really different look at the concept of love  I m not really sure if I liked the way the character of women was created in this story In the last chapter  the journey seems to be finished  It seems that we are left behind and the protagonist is going on  The author says that a new journey is about to begin   And last but not least is that once was not enough  SHyH  n lrwy  lrwy y rwsy wtjry  Hdthh fy mjtm  rwsy shdyd lfqr lknh rwy  ttrk  thrh fy lnsny

But since the book lends itself to SO MANY themes and elements  keeping up with Dostoevsky s symbolism and societal commentary is a rewarding but tiring task  I was mesmerized at all the connections    and my boyfriend probably got annoyed of my random expressions of  OH   THAT S LIKE  insert sneakily related incident imagery here   AWESOME   D Needless to say  I LOVED this book  It really made me reconsider my own judgments of why people do what they do  Part of the fun of reading this was following Raskolnikov s thoughts  Dostoevsky s portrayal of Raskolnikov s suffering during his mental transition from believing he is above all  to an increasingly paranoid and insecure mortal was flawlessly illustrated  What struck me the most was that Dostoevsky chose to create Sonya s character as the book s moral center  She s a prostitute but her faith permeates through her every action  and she is the reason Raskolnikov does what he does at the end of the novel I strongly encourage everyone to at some point read this  The greats learned that humility is a weapon  And as Raskolnikov demonstrates  sometimes you have to fight your mind and try to find the present  Dostoyevsky s finest venture   dark  bleak  and impossible to ignore  What can I add to 7000  reviews  at the time I write   I think this book is fascinating because of all the topic it covers  Like the OJ trial  it is about many important interconnected things and those things remain important today  even though this book was originally published in 1865 Sure  it has a lot about crime and punishment  But also insanity and temporary insanity  the latter a legal plea that could be entered in Russia of the mid 1800 s  It s about guilt and conscience  long before Freud  In fact  this book was written at a time when psychological theories were coming into vogue  It s about false confessions  It s about poverty and social class and people who rise above their class and people who fall from the class they were born into  It s about the wild dreams and the follies of youth There is also mention of many social theories that were in vogue at that time  so  for example  if you want to  you can click on Wikipedia to find out about  Fourier s system  and his phalansteres  There is attempted rape  blackmail  child labor  child prostitution  child marriage and child molestation  There is discussion of marrying for money  There are ethnic tensions between Russians and the Germans of St  Petersburg  Should you give to charity or should you give to change the conditions that caused the poverty  Like me  you may have thought that was a modern idea  but here it is  laid out in 1865  There s a lot about alcoholism  Stir in a cat and mouse detective and a bit of Christian redemption  No wonder this is a classic   I just reread this for the first time since 1996  I loved it the first time but found it even more fulfilling  humorous  intoxicating  and brilliant this time  Definitely check out this translation   Intense  complex   Crime and Punishment is a fantastic novel  even though it can be tangential and convoluted at times  Dostoevsky s work explores how a murderer deals with his crime  One of the best summations of it is that Crime and Punishment is not like typical detective novels  where you know the crime and want to find the culprit  but in this book  you know the culprit and you want to find out if he committed any crime  While the book could probably be even more powerful if it was more condensed  the ending is great and the philosophy is really intriguing  A thrilling story that will hook you up from the beginning Raskolnikow  ein verarmter Student im St  Petersburg des 19  Jahrhunderts  sieht seine einzige Chance  an seiner Karriere weiter zu arbeiten  im Verbrechen  Ohne Geld kein Studium und da er der Welt sein Genie nicht verschliessen will  ist es seine Pflicht  irgendwie Geld aufzutreiben  um so sein Studium fortsetzen zu konnen  Was ist schon eine alte unbeliebte fiese Pfandleiherin im Vergleich zu dem  was er der Welt bieten konnte  hatte er nur das Geld fur seine Ausbildung  So reift in ihm ein folgenschwerer Entschluss Klassische Weltliteratur  das klingt immer nach schwierig  anstrengend  kaum zu bewaltigen  nach Arbeit und erinnert an dustere Schulzeiten in denen Literatur durch Zwang zu Folter verkam Nichtsdestotrotz habe ich mir einmal vorgenommen  mich an moglichst vielen Klassikern bzw  deren Autoren wenigstens einmal zu versuchen  so dass ich sie danach guten Gewissens in die Ecke pfeffern und alles weitere ignorieren kann  weil der gute Wille ja da war     oder eben auch nicht  namlich mich begeistern zu lassen  zu verstehen  was grossartig ist und Spass daran zu finden So hab ich mich dann auch an Dostojewskis Verbrechen und Strafe gemacht  mit einer Erwartung  die an die Situation am Fusse eines zu bezwingenden Berges erinnert  Man will es packen  man rechnet aber nicht mit viel Freude daran  aber andere haben es ja auch geschafft  Und siehe da  So schwer war der Aufstieg gar nicht  Verbrechen und Strafe hat viel von einem Krimi  spannende Momente  die Sprache ist dank der gelungen Ubersetzung Swetlana Geiers gar nicht so schwierig  manch etwas langatmige Stelle gibt es zwar  aber da ist man schnell druber weg  Und die etwas schwulstigen Reden und Dialoge passen zu der Zeit und lassen den Umgang der Menschen untereinander  die im 19  Jahrhundert in St  Petersburg lebten oder teils eher vegetierten  erleben So gehort Dostojewski nach der Lekture von Verbrechen und Strafe nicht zu den Autoren  die ich ignorieren werde  Anspruchsvolle Literatur  die sich aber gut lesen lasst  eine spannende Handlung  eine philosophische Abhandlung daruber  ob Grenzen uberschritten werden durfen  wer sich uber Regeln hinwegsetzen darf und gleichzeitig ein Krimi  der so manchem modernen Krimi in nichts nachsteht Uberraschung gelungen  Espectacular libro  Ultra Recomendable Good Books are like Pythons  They will take some time to get hold of you and then they will crush you into pieces before taking you down towards their climatic thought and what comes out of this experience is a different you altogether and then there are great books  They are like the elixir of our life  The more you take  the more your want of it becomes  This is of the latter and the joy it delivered is beyond anyone s expressions  Made me jump in joy literally  Bless Russian Literature for what it has given us   This is just such a multi layered novel that I know it will take multiple readings of this for me to be able wrap my head around all the depth that is present in this book  All I can say is Crime and Punishment is complex and nuanced  with Dostoevsky painting a glass clear portrait of the conditions present during mid 1800s Petersburg in Russia  particularly those of the severely destitute  There were a few things here and there that annoyed me a little  Raskolnikov in particular  with all his agonizing and fainting and nerves miffed me  Even so  I could understand his actions  given the situation he was in   and it was quite easy for me to sympathize with someone who much of the outside world would only see as a homicidal maniac  This is obviously not an easy task  and Dostoevsky is not only able to do it  but carry it out with grace and gravitas  Porfiry s little  hehes  and chuckles aggravated me too  but these are only simple things  They could not possibly overshadow how thought provoking and discerning this story is Raskolnikov s transition is a long one  fraught with tension  anguish  and death  In the end  you can not help but feel for Rodion Romanovitch  and all those who surround him   Qui si tratta di una storia fantastica e cupa  roba attuale  una storia dei nostri tempi  nei quali il cuore umano si e intorbidato  nei quali si dice che  il sangue rinfresca   nei quali si predica che tutta la vita consiste nelle comodita  Qui si tratta di sogni libreschi  di un cuore esasperato dalle teorie  qui si vede la decisione nel compiere il primo passo  ma una decisione tutta particolare    Scrivere questa recensione e per me un atto di coraggio  Perche sono incredibilmente spaventata all idea di sparare baggianate su questo capolavoro  Le mie dita tremano battendo i tasti  un po  per l emozione  ho appena appena letto l ultima pagina  un po  per l irritazione  Irritazione  si  perche so gia che non riusciro a dire tutto cio che adesso ho intenzione di dire  so gia che mi perdero a meta strada  so gia che le parole mi condurranno dove vorranno loro  Non riusciro mai a capire da dove traggono questa loro furbizia Si capisce che sto divagando perche non ho la piu pallida idea di come iniziare  Mi sento un po  come chi ride per non piangere  Sapete quella risata isterica e forzata  Io sto scrivendo con quello spirito  E si che da piangere ce n e stato  Ma io non l ho fatto Anzi  Non ho versato una lacrima  diciamo cosi  perche il mio cuore dalla meta del romanzo in poi non ha fatto altro che gridare e disperarsi e gemere  E  stato uno strazio  anche se dolcissimo  Ecco  ancora una volta le parole hanno trovato da se la loro strada e mi hanno portata dove non immaginavo di arrivare  Hanno trovato per me la descrizione perfetta di cio che Delitto e castigo ha rappresentato per me  uno strazio dolcissimo E qui dovrei profondermi in ringraziamento per quel geniaccio di Dostoevskij  ma diro solo che mi sarei sentita indegna persino di sfiorare la punta della sua penna  Avessi anche solo un quarto della sua bravura  del suo stile  della sua potenza narrativa  Una potenza che non sta tutta nell arte di comporre frasi  ma che trova continuazione nella capacita straordinaria che quest uomo aveva di capire   Inizialmente la mia intenzione era quella di dotare la frase precedente di complemento oggetto  capire cosa  Ma poi mi sono resa conto che Dostoevskij non capiva solo il  qualcosa   il particolare  lui capiva tutto nel suo insieme  Se questo insieme fosse l uomo  fosse la disperazione  fosse il tormento  fosse il terrore  non sono capace di stabilirlo  E che io possa essere dannata se riesco a comprendere come faceva a riportare cosi bene tutto questo nero su bianco  Una altro elemento che mi lascia sempre spiazzata quando ho a che fare con autori di questo tenore  e la loro sfuggevolezza  La loro chiarezza nell esporre le loro idee o quelle dei personaggi  e poi la tua frustrazione nell accorgerti che non riesci ad afferrare completamente cio che volevano comunicarti  E  una sensazione strana  ma alla quale il lettore riesce miracolosamente a sopravvivere  incolume e felice  Se volete un consiglio  cercate questo nei romanzi che leggete  le verita nascoste che avrete tempo di scoprire a poco a poco  Credo che sviscerare completamente certi libri alla prima lettura sia una violenza inutile  e bello invece  impadronirsene  col tempo  lasciando che cio che abbiamo imparato sedimenti dentro di noi Ma mi accorgo che delle normali cose che un normale lettore vorrebbe e dovrebbe leggere in una normale recensione ho parlato poco e niente  Bene  carissimi  cosa volete che vi dica  Dell autore vi ho detto gia qualcosina  forse della storia  Ci sarebbe troppo da raccontare  e percio dovrete accontentarvi del troppo poco che vi regalero  e che sono queste citazioni  dal momento che le mie parole sono oramai prosciugate   Allora  Sonja  finalmente capii    prosegui Raskol nikov in tono esaltato    che il potere spetta solo a chi osa chinarsi per raccoglierlo  C e una sola cosa da fare  osare     Mammima  qualunque cosa accada  qualunque cosa sentiate dire di me  qualunque cosa vi dicano  mi amerete sempre come adesso    domando all improvviso Raskol nikov  e queste parole gli proruppero da dentro come se non le avesse neppure pensate e soppesate prima   Sono un individuo abietto  Dunja     Un individuo abietto  che pero accetta di andare a soffrire  Perche ci andrai  non e vero     Si  ci andro  E subito  Proprio per evitare questa vergogna  volevo affogarmi  Dunja  Ma mentre gia mi sporgevo verso l acqua  ho pensato che se finora mi sono creduto un uomo forte  adesso non devo aver paura della vergogna    disse Raskol nikov  anticipando i tempi    E  forse orgoglio  questo  Dunja     Si  Rodja  e orgoglio     Is there any word to say for that book  Because I can t find  But i can say  it was the best book i ever read  This is my favorite fiction book of all time    which  is a bit weird  but there you go  I love that Raskolnikov comes from the word that means schism and is talking about the two sides of him that are at odds with each other  spirit vs  flesh  anyone    Except for the whole murder thing  I feel like this  Obviously it s Russian literature which can be difficult to get through  but well worth a read  and then re read 10 years later  if you re like me  and wanted to make sure it was still your favorite book      Not a nightly page turner like my YA books  though  Heh heh  This is my favorite book of all time  It is what inspired me to become an English professor  A journey into the mind of a killer  Crime and Punishment has you feeling guilty as though you had committed the crime yourself  Read this book  I read the Garnett translation  but I can t find the edition  I ve read that Garnett glossed over some of the seedier aspects of the novel in accordance with the times  Even so  I feel the theme transcends language  I must read another translation in the future  I absolutely loved this book  I read this when I was twelve   just a few months ago  laughs    and specifically enjoyed reading about how he responded to all the guilt  and how he would deal with the fact that he actually DID kill 2 people  one who had not wronged whatsoever  I don t think he was insane    Comment on this review about what you think  Was he insane or not  Raskolnikov that is    Her kitabin ustunde ve otesinde    One of the greatest novels I ve ever read  A fascinating exploration into the depths of the human psychology pitted into a suspenseful crime drama filled with dynamic and complex characters intersecting in the squalid underclass realm of St  Petersburg that festers with poverty  destitution and depravity  Raskolnikov is one of the most ingeniously profound characters of literature and his inner turmoil in the aftermath of his heinous crime that culminates in one of the most masterfully wrought and penetrating tales of redemption  Is the novel free of any errors  No  Sure it has imperfections  like any human creation  The characters function most importantly as symbols  the dialogue lacks some variety from character to character and the very end sort of slows down a bit and loses the suspense  However  this is certainly a masterpiece like no other  There are few other novels that have left me with so much to reflect on or contemplate  It s a brilliant exposee of human nature in its multi faceted string of contradictions and flaws  It s rich with motifs and symbols  it s powerful with emotional intensity  The narrative style is incredibly unique  permitting the reader an intimate scrutiny of the character s psychologies  particularly Raskolnikov who constantly wavers and alternates between different extremes  Surely no list of the world s greatest literature is complete without Dostoyevsky s Crime and Punishment  My favorite and  I suppose  the best known of Dostoevsky s great novels  Single Quote Review Am I a good person  Deep down  do I even really want to be a good person  or do I only want to seem like a good person so that people  including myself  will approve of me  Is there a difference  How do I ever actually know whether I m bullshitting myself  morally speaking   DFW  imitating FMD Slow books can be pretty boring  but I really liked this one  It s pretty interesting to read how this guy s mind worked  but I wouldn t recommend this book to someone who doesn t like books with barely any dialogue  Goodness gracious me  That was an ordeal  But  like Loreal  he s worth it  Don t be intimidated by the monstrous length of this book because once Dostoyevsky has your attention by the throat  you ll end up finishing it in a matter of days  Marmeladov  the rambling drunkard  was my favourite character  Immensely enjoyable  immersing  darkly funny and has earned its place in my favourite books  Not as dreary as I thought it d be  A monumentally important book  and surprisingly entertaining  I think I need a lie down   This book ranks with George Eliot s The Mill on the Floss as my favorite classic of all time Both Crime and Mill have such deep and complex psychological analyses   they show that the authors really UNDERSTOOD the characters  not just observed them I would say that Crime has even more psychology than Mill  which makes the former greater  yet Mill is about emotions I can relate to and understand more easily  which makes it more touching Also  both books go SO deep in their analysis of what will happen if an intellectual idea is taken too far  I love this philosophical point In such great amounts of psychological penetration into Rodya Raskolnikov and Maggie Tulliver  their characters become so developed  I have never seen such Hyper Developed characters like these before  Svidrigailov likewise was astonishingly well developed  spoiler The situation at Sonia s father and stepmother s was so distressingly sad  That a consumptive  blood coughing mother had to work hard and care for kids in a flat she s about to be kicked out of and that her husband had just died is just      too overwhelming   I also loved and was surprised  that Crime had a happy ending  It was so hopeful  so inspiring for my own life  If Rodya can regenerate and start a new life  then we  in our much better positions  can definitely do so too  Of all the novels that I have read in school thus far  Crime and Punishment has had the most impact on me  Throughout the entire novel  Dostoyevsky drew me into the story with Raskolnikov s psychological struggle   the realism of Raskolnikov s mental battle with ethics  logic  love  religion  and guilt drew me in like a magnet and carried me from cover to cover If I am grateful to AP Literature for just one thing  it is for the opportunity to read Crime and Punishment from beginning to end   Read it a more than a decade back  revisiting again  There was a time when I couldn t get enough of his writings  Excited to read this in between the breaks of reading my business books   Read Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky  What a classic crime novel   loved it  Great characters and tension from start to finish  which helped to paint the mind of a murderer   mental and moral anguish   claiming to have the right to commit such acts for a higher purpose  The entire book was amazing   the epologue was a little heavy handed though  Watching Raskolnakov  sp  circle the drain was fascinating  Sonya pulling him back again and again  I used to think that women didn t appear as main characters in older stories  Not this one  Dunya is a far more strong and interesting character that Rodya  raskol     I will read this book again  Enthralling in every tiny corner of it  Crime and Punishment is a novel that one doesn t simply read for pleasure  but a novel than one lives with and feels  Be it any kind of a reader you may be  this novel reflects the self in a way or another  Raskolnikov s crime might be considered heinous  but we all have committed crimes of some sorts  of varying degrees  It s not the Crime itself that tortures us  it s living with it that torments us  The only way out of this everlasting suffering is Punishment  And to have that we have  first  to confess to our crimes and face them and most importantly accept them instead of legitimizing them   Lo triste de acabar Crimen y Castigo es el de reconocer que nunca mas se podra decir  Acabo de leer Crimen y Castigo  por primera vez  Una obra maestra de todos los tiempo  un mosaico de la tragedia humana  la miseria y extremos a los que se puede llegar por un fanatismo de la razon  Solo nos salvara la conciencia es lo que unico que puede concluirse con certeza  Un libro que hace pensar mas alla de su propia historia I learned how to endure unlikeable characters for the big payoff  Dostoevsky is deep  Passionate  honest  raw  A very visceral experience  I didn t  get it  until at least half way through though so have patience  For years I ve heard about Crime and Punishment and how it is one of the most exquisite and powerful novels of all time  Hearing such accolades about a book makes me nervous about reading it  as they conjur up images of weighty  serious prose that reads more like a textbook than I novel Crime and Punishment is nothing like a textbook  Instead  it is a murder mystery told from the point of view of the murderer  The mystery is whether he will get caught or turn himself in  whether he repents or destroys himself  Some of the passages that depict the protagonis s decent into madness are hard to read  Others  such as the scene where the prostitute and the murderer read from the Bible are unforgettable  There is so much depth in Crime and Punishment that a close reading with add to the rewards of reading this book  A classic for all times  Some say Freud read this book and it influenced his development of the theory of the unconscious  Others say Nietzsche read it and it inspired his concept of the superman  I m not qualified to speak to either assertion but I can say with cetainty that anyone that reads it will be influenced  Un livre qui transperce l ame et la demystifiee      l ame a ses raisons que la raison elle meme n en saura point      A true masterpiece  After finishing the book I found myself dwelling on it for many more weeks  ykhy z bhtryn tfqt grwh khtbkhwrh khwndn

favorite book of all time  Crime and Punishment is my favorite novel probably ever  It tackles something that is always close to each and every person s life   guilt  Over and over again you think he will confess his sins  but no  He keeps it close to the chest where it mutates him  It eats away at him  morphing him into something worse than a murderer  Anyone should enjoy this incredibly in depth examination of humanity  This novel is a classic for a reason  it shows how the soul is morphable  It changes as it grows darker and lighter  Of course Dostoyevsky has a slew of character that are difficult to remember  He writes a gripping novel that is incredibly personal to each and every one of us  I recommend this for anyone  I also recommend that you read it on the Kindle Paper White  This Russian Lit classic has so many characters  each with multiple names  the X ray functionality on the Paper White will come in handy on this one   This is the second time that I ve read this book and it is amazing  even better the second time  The last four or five chapters are so brilliantly written  this is a must read for everyone  Truyen rat ro rang tren nen thoi gian khong ton tai  Doan

second favorite book after Catch 22  It can be read on many levels  from a simple yet gripping detective story  the TV character Columbo was based on Porfiry Petrovitch  to a chilling foreshadowing of the Nazis and their twisted theory of the  ubermenschen   My favorite book ever  Crime  romance  and cliff hangers move you from chapter to chapter  Plus  the bad guy is the star  Absolutely love this  One quick note  the beginning is rather slow but keep going  it gets WAY better     Este livro nao devia ter sido lido  porque ha palavras para as quais nao devemos sequer olhar se nao corremos o risco de acabar os nossos dias a gritar frases incoerentes pelas ruas cheias de gente  Nao sei como posso ter estado 55 anos sem conhecer o meu irmao Raskolnikov   que livro brilhante  com todas as palavras no lugar   O crime do protagonista e uma metafora para todas as dores e traumas que nao podem ser partilhados e que temos de sofrer em silencio  Poucos descrevem esse tormento como o Dostoyevski Este escrito contem revelacoes cruciais dos capitulos finais de Crime e Castigo de Fiodor Dostoyevski  A atencao dos hipoteticos leitores Estava numa Departamento das Financas  lendo um dos capitulos finais de Crime e Castigo a espera da minha vez de ser atendido  quando me deparei com uma passagem pungente do brilhante romance do escritor russo  em que ele dedicava a sua atencao a misteriosa personagem Svidrigailov  O pretendente da irma de Raskolnikov  completamente perdido de amores por ela  anda perdido pelas ruas de S  Petersburgo e vai parar a um hotel onde nao consegue dormir porque houve uma crianca a chorar por um qualquer motivo absurdo  Entao  sai e suicida se em frente a um agente da lei  Ja ha muito que eu tinha percebido que a personagem se ia matar  mas o meu estado emocional e a forma como esta escrito levaram a que eu me desfizessem em lagrimas a frente de toda a gente que por ali cirandava e eu nao pude fazer nada para as evitar  pelo que as deixei escorrer violentamente pelo meu rosto sem levantar os olhos do livro  Comecei a solucar de forma incontrolavel enquanto a minha alma dilacerada gritava  Svidrigailov  Svidrigailov  SVIDRIGAILOV  Os homens maus tambem se matam  os homens maus tambem se matam e morrem sofrendo de amores e dores insondaveis    Svidirgailov e uma personagem construida de forma meticulosa e ao qual nao e dado muito tempo  ate para manter a aura de estranheza que a torna tao interessante  pois e pelo facto de nos nunca entendermos bem o que Svidrigailov quer  quais sao as suas intencoes  que ele se nos afigura tao memoravel  E tambem pelo seu nome  que e lindissimo  como Raskolnikov  como Pulkheria Aleksandrovna  como Razumikhin  Continuei agitado durante alguns segundos  com as maos em frente aos olhos e a respiracao ofegante  mas depois voltei a concentrar me na parte final do capitulo e nas ultimas palavras do estranho personagem  sem ter coragem de levantar os olhos das linhas e encarar as pessoas que me rodeavam e que certamente teriam reparado no meu pranto  Enquanto enxugava os olhos repreendi me interiormente por ter dito que ele era um homem mau   Os homens sao todos mau s pensei para mim e reflecti sobre essa frase   Sim  os homens sao todos maus e as mulheres tambem   As palavras seguintes ja as murmurei audivelmente   Sim  as mulheres tambem  e soltei uma estrondosa gargalhada  tirando finalmente os olhos do livro  Todas as pessoas que ali estavam olhavam para mim como se eu fosse um louco  Soltei uma nova gargalhada e gritei  SIM  AS MULHERES TAMBEM AHAHAH   Levantei me e precipitei me para a saida  Posso tratar deste problema noutro dia  yn khtb b tHlyl stdnh y  shkhSyt rskhlnykhf  z jmlh shhkhrhy sbkh ry l w rmny shkhSyt mHwr st khh ngyzh w  ml prsnj r dnbl my khnd t

Just is another miracle of Dostoyevsky  There s really no reason to spend a lot of time offering a  review  of Crime and Punishment  It s place in the canon of Western Civilization literature is unquestioned  I ll only say that it s an easy  fun read that is truly timeless  Now  in terms of this particular translation  I picked up my copy of Crime and Punishment at the local Half Priced Books for a whopping   30  The translation was done by Brit  Michael Scammell and the back cover touts the edition as  the first translation into the American vernacular   Very well  I thought  But as I got deeper into the novel I noticed that Scammell s knowledge of the American vernacular was severely lacking  Using such British phrases as  cheeky monkey  and  bob s your uncle  it was clear that Scammell knew little of the way Americans really speak  After about a 100 pages I decided to do a little experiment  I downloaded the Constance Garnett translation to my kindle and started rotating between versions  every other chapter  It became quite clear that all Scammell had managed to do was tweak Garnett s edition   e g  swapping out the word  nonsense  with  baloney   otherwise things were exactly the same  Still  Scammell s version was worth the 30 cents I paid  after all  it did prod me towards this classic piece of literature   A masterpiece  Dostoyevsky deserved the title of the greatest psychologist in the history of literature  One of the best novels I ve read  It s so intense and real  couldn t get my hands off the book   I am more of a human being for having read this novel  I hope it lasts  This and Anna Karenina are almost tied for the best and most elevating novels I ve ever read  Thank you Dostoevsky for suffering and doing something with that suffering   If I had to choose only one book to take with me to an island  that would be Crime and Punishment  Literature reaches its highest point with this must to read Russian classics  Russian literature has been always my all times favourite  and this novel will endure in my mind and heart for ever  Tuvo que pasar mucho  pero mucho  tiempo para que me decidiera retomar y terminar este libro  tan extenso y lleno de matices que a veces desorienta de su argumento central  pero ya sabemos que leer a los rusos supone una tarea a veces titanica no solo por la extension  sino por la complejidad de su tematica  Algo que ame profundamente en este libro es el manejo de los estadios mentales de Raskolnikov tras el crimen  del mismo modo que sus moviles  Lo demas  caracterizacion de los personajes y otros conflictos  esta muy bien logrado  aunque debo confesar que por momento sentia que habian cosas de mas  No obstante  es un texto que sorprende porque muchos conflictos no se resuelven de la forma que una espera y por el manejo de referencias externas a la novela  Un clasico absolutamente recomendado   A true timeless classic from a genius  Crime and punishment is one of those books you continue to ponder even when you ve long finished reading it  Dostoevsky is a master at storytelling and accompanies it with an epically thorough exploration of human consciousness  Requires focus and concentration but you will be rewarded  4 8 because an author of his caliber shall never use the word indescribable which he used twice  The last ten or fifteen pages I read it out loud  crying my eyes out  How could words penetrate heart  fresh  sharp and untouched by passing time  A book out of time certainly  This book has had one of the most lasting affects on me  not necessarily in moral or narrative but imagery  The way he writes Raskolnikov s paranoia at being suspected  followed or found out through the streets of St  Petersburg haunted my dreams for months afterwards and still feature occasionally to this day  four years later  It is wonderfully and captivatingly written  if not a little too much so  A true classic  One of my favorite books that I read in high school English  The plot is absolutely insane and surprisingly relatable  The mind of the main character is so flawed and disturbed  but I couldn t help but think I would react to things in the exact same way if I was in his shoes   very  very  very slow to start  as is most of his work  but after you manage to slog through the first 400 pages it starts to pick up quite nicely and it s almost impossible to put down because you are completely sucked into the character s mind  and you can t get out  you are meshed into one and you have to see it through   https   www goodreads com list show

It s fascinating to read this in light of the history of Russia since then  and the current zeitgeist in the US  No matter the age you live in  or the culture you are from  the questions surrounding the problem of evil in the world are still poignant  And there still remains only one solution to it  We need to be changed inside  I tried to read this in highschool in one of the Constance Garnett translations and good goddamn was it horrible  Tepid  murky  ashy  turgid Then I was assigned this for a class in college and it blew me away  Pevear  Volokhonsky brought out the fire and the passion and the direness of the story in a way that pinned my ears back I reread it a couple of years ago  something I never do  sadly enough  to see if the burning lights were still shining and    yup  They were still kickin  This has to be read by everybody who can read  I turned on a couple of friends to it who had never been exposed to Dostoevsky s world before and they  too  were swept away Long hours spent roiling with the visions of St  Petersberg with Raskolnikov et al  Absolutely worth it  no question at all  This book has all the power and authority of a knife thrown firmly and fiercely into a wall  Would that all books were that sheerly sublime  Dostoyevsky has a non academic psychological insight that just leaves you bamboozled by it s depth and accuracy        definitely a good read for anyone who s into philosophy and psychology    I do not know how to begin  I am utterly troubled  What to do  What to say  In my opinion  to write a review of Dostoyevsky s great masterpiece is a very hard undertaking  To write a decent one  even harder  A week ago  if you asked me what my favorite novel was  I d greatly struggle with it  I might consider Joyce s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man  Nabokov s Lolita  or probably even Heller s Catch 22  I might give varying answers  It would probably depend on my mood  or the current focus of my stream of thoughts  But  alas  Now  now I have found it  A book  unquestionable enough to be the greatest novel and work of fiction that I have read  As I say this  please bear in mind that I have humbly read very few of the novels I intend to read  Let us say that I m still a novice of the classical greats  Call me a classical dunce  if you must  I have scarcely pierced through the surface of the greatest literary works  Scarcely  So forgive me  if you think that I overpraise this  Bear with me  Deal with me as a wise and knowing adult would deal with an inquisitive child  What I ask for  is your indulgence  if you can give it to me Crime   Punishment  Two words  Cause   effect  Low   High  Evil   Justice  Two words that are intertwined  knitted cheek by jowl  and always associated with the other  Two words that are close yet far as possible  The title s two words is reflective of Dostoyevsky s great masterpiece itself  Of course  it certainly is about the psychology of a crime and the punishment it measures  But more than that  the novel features exceedingly contrasting views  These views  contrasting and even paradoxical  can sincerely confuse a man  But  these seemingly contrasting views when scrutinized is really just the product of a struggle inside a man s very being  A man s final struggle of whether to finally detach himself from society  from life  from his humanity  or to finally succumb to it  These struggles  or contradictory ideas can be noted several times in the book  We have Raskolnikov s Napoleonic belief that he is of the elite  and should step over obstacles without being affected even if blood is involved  as was hinted in his article  Then  later on he would admit to Sonya that he was not of the elite since he was terribly affected  But again  when he was in prison he would declare that he was not there because he was guilty of anything but rather because he was weak and confessed  Also  we have his being generous and charitable  He would give Marmaladov s widow  Katarina Ivanovna  all the remaining 25 rubles his mother sent him  Then there was his helping of his schoolmate and the crippled father  and the saving of two children in the fire  Here was a man acting as a savior to strangers yet could not even bear to look and much less talk with his mother and sister  Here was a man who believed that anything could be sacrificed for the success of his career  who killed two women yet refused that her sister be wed to a rich man for his sake  Here was a man who regarded religion as nonsense yet read the gospel and asked people to pray for him  Here was a man who didn t care if he died  didn t eat  didn t care about his illness  yet refused to commit suicide  Here was a man suffering  A man  who because of his crime  suffered his punishment of madness  of guilt  of never ending anxiety and anxiousness  I fancy that Dostoyevsky reiterates that this punishment that goes on through a criminal s mind is far more potent than the punishment of being contained in four walls  As he pointed out in the epilogue  that in prison  the convicts valued life much more  While in this state of madness  of insane ecstasy  A man would undergo extreme suffering and lose his mind and matter  In the words of Sonya   Oh  what suffering  What suffering   The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin  That is his punishment   This struggle inside Raskolnikov  is enhanced by his intellect  He cannot help but disdain what is going on inside him  His reason rejects his will  If anything  the more intellectual you are  the more you are prone to detach from your surroundings  You reason that feelings and relations are merely nonsensical  You think of dialectics instead of breathing fresh air   Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart  The really great men must  I think  have great sadness on earth   As I give my conclusion  let me also give some remarks about my feelings towards the end of the book  It is hard not to root for a happy ending  I was glad that Rasumikhin and Dunya had gotten theirs  And after such pain and suffering  I have forgiven Raskolnikov and want for him peace of mind too  His final realization that he indeed had love for Sonya brought me intense joy  I do not know why  Maybe it was empathy  if anyone deserved happiness it was Sonya  Sonya whose happiness was only through Raskolnikov  Here was a Murderer and a Harlot  Two shameful transgressors who believed that their transgressions were justified  One out of vanity  the other out of charity  One who is vile and contemptuous  the other loving and loyal  Bound together by some irreversible force of nature  Intertwined  Like the words Crime and Punishment  Raskolnikov and Sonya are two people who are far different but are bound together  They are allegories of the words themselves  Raskolnikov stands for Crime  He is a murderer who is unrepentant  he is contemptuous  menacing  vain  and indifferent  A man who believes he is above the law  All for self gain  Sonya stands for Punishment  She is true  loving  loyal  charitable  a woman who deserved richly but lived poorly  A call for justice  Raskolinkov and Sonya  two utterly different people that are connected by suffering  Raskolnikov is crime  he cannot atone himself no matter what he does  Sonya is the atoning punishment  Only through Punishment  can Crime be atoned  Only through Sonya  can Raskolnikov atone himself  This enduring masterpiece is a beauty to behold  A complex  broad  and psychological mastery of not only crime and punishment but also of life  death  sacrifice  society  intellect  love  and ultimately renewal and hope  As I end this review  let me leave you with this excerpts   Go now  this minute  stand in the crossroads  bow down  first kiss the earth you ve defiled  then bow down to the whole world  on all four sides  then say aloud to everyone   I have killed     Accept suffering and redeem yourself by it  that s what you must do   He went on down the stairs and came out in the courtyard  There in the courtyard  not far from the entrance  stood Sonya  pale  numb all over  and she gave him a wild  wild look  He stopped before her  Something painted and tormented  something desperate  showed in her face  She clasped her hands  A hideous  lost smile forced itself in his lips  He stood a while  grinned  and turned back upstairs to the office   But all at once  in the same moment  she understood everything  Infinite happiness lit up in her eyes  she understood  and for her there was no longer any doubt that he loved her  lover her infinitely  and at last the moment had come      I have been reading at a furious pace for the last two years  as if I am racing someone  and I finally know what has inspired it  I got married two years ago  moved to the suburbs  and sometimes I feel as if the only major life event left for me is my own death  When I had that epiphany  I started reading  My voracious appetite for literature was an act of pure fear   fear that I would die before I had read what I wanted to read  and fear that my life could not be lived to its fullest unless I had accrued the knowledge that I knew lay in the great works of fiction I was thinking these thoughts as I read  Crime and Punishment   a book that inspires introspection by raising the big questions without providing any on the answers  Raskolnikov  our anti hero  is a young man who is  let s say  troubled and hatches a scheme to kill and rob an old woman  His motive is simple   he needs the money   but as soon as the deed is done  he begins to cloud his motive with philosophy  in telling himself that there is an entire class of special people to whom the normal rules of morality do not apply  He fancies himself one of these people  but the ensuing narrative proves him wrong A great  thought provoking read  It is surprisingly accessible  and its themes are not only relevant but maybe even urgent  Russian politicians may be ham fisted and tone deaf  but their top writers pursue psychological drama to its fullest  The crime is committed early and the rest of the book is dedicated to the detective  wearing down  the perp who s not in custody  Sound boring   not on your life   The darker the night  the brighter the stars  The deeper the grief  the closer is God      Fyodor Dostoyevsky  Crime and Punishment This is Dostoevsky s best  Dostoevsky  more than any other writer  was able to blend thrilling fiction with The Big Questions  is there a God  Is any man above morality   This is a book that changes lives  and makes one see the world differently afterwards  The Pevear and Volokhonsky translation reads pretty well  and seems smoother and more modern than the Garnett translation  Still  for loftiness  I give the slight edge to Garnett  The first major Russian novel I read  and it remains one of my favorite books of all time  This may reveal a bit too much about myself  or maybe it says more about how good Dostoyevsky is   but I identified intensely with Raskolnikov  from his poseur stance as an intellectual  to his belief in his inherent superiority because of that intellect  to his overwhelming guilt at his misdeeds  Very powerful stuff  Son zamanlarda en cok severek okudugum kitap oldu  Bu hikaye asla eskimeyecek  insanlik durdukca Raskolnikov un sorulari ve sorunlari eskimeyecektir  Just Amazing   Intense reading here  This was my introduction to  The Russians  and I ve never looked back  People are complicated  and here you can read all about the human psyche  spirit  and conscience  One of my favorite books of all time  With such beginning marred by a horrifying act of violence  this book could have easily been a depressing tragedy  But it is a book about redemption  forgiveness  and hope  I feel that this book gives the message that a person can always choose to turn their life around  They hold their fate in their hands by the choice to do the right thing  I started reading this book  not very happy that it was required reading  Before I knew it  I was eager to turn each page to see this man s journey from the pit of despair to a place where he could hope and could believe  This book had a very deep  profound effect on me when I read it  Wow  Heavy  as we used to say in 60s and 70s  Psychological thriller all the way Raskolnikov is tortured and blabs his thoughts to too many people  All the characters talk a lot  The plot moves slowly but inexorably along but Dostoyevsky holds it all together  This needs more than one reading  A word about Pevear  Look for his translations  In a way I liked it but I can t get through a few chapters of this without going  Gee  this is a bit depressing     He certainly doesn t like the people from the slums he wrote about  There is none of the later communist delusions of glamorising the proletariat poor in his writing  and that makes it all the more honest I liked his style  though I am told it is lost in translation by my native Russian speaker friends  A good translation is very important  this one seems pretty good compared to the previous one  can t remember the name of the translator  that annoyed the hell out of me     I do wish he had given Sonia a bit of Feminist Moral Fibre in her bones  It is also one of the great flaws of literature from that generation  www cecililayu com http   silenciosquefalam blogspot pt       Ao longo dos capitulos que se seguem a accao central do romance e ate ao seu termino  Dostoievski faz o leitor reflectir sobre a questao    E a doenca que engendra o crime ou e o proprio crime que  pela sua natureza especial  e sempre acompanhado por uma especie de doenca       This has been one of my favorite books since I read it in high school  The combination of ennui and it s effect on an intelligent man  along with how hubris can lead us to do greatly grotesque acts is very interesting  It also provides an interest insight into the self regulating law of our own conscious  This would have gotten 5 stars for a slightly different ending  There s something about salvation that I find needs to be contextually situated properly  Didn t care for the particular salvation at the end of this novel  but loved the novel anyway  nhyth fy Syf 2005 bms d  wldty lnh knt tdrsh fy hdh l lm qbl n stbdlh brwy  Animals

Karamazov in the Spring  and was surprised at how engaging such a notoriously dense work could be  C   P reads much simpler in its form  but is no less entertaining than BK  Can t wait to read The Idiot and Devils  Absolutely amazing psychological study of the human mind and soul  Oh the depths of evil it is capable of committing  I absolutely loved this book and felt the agony of the conflict in Raskolnikov s soul  I enjoyed the window into that period of Russian history as well  I love the way Dostoyevsky describes the human soul and how recognizable the human heart is even across cultures and more than a century of time  I think what I really love the most about this book is the depth of the redemption that happens in Raskolnikov s heart  I love Dostoevsky  Although not my favorite story by him  I feel a bit different about it every time I have a chance to re read this book  Guess it must reflect the maturity of my inner being   This book is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone  I thought it was going to be a tough read  but it was really pretty breezy  The  who dunnit  aspect of this novel is not the intriguing part  because you know who did it  The study of Raskolnikov s psyche makes this book the most fascinating thing I have read since the biography of John Adams   Brilliant  You don t really realize it until its all over  but Dostoyevsky explores the conscience and psyche like no other book I ve read  His tale takes the reader expertly through all the stages involved in true redemption  It is Russian  and sometimes the names are tricky to keep track of  being as how every character is known by at least three names   and it can be a bit thick to get through  but it is well worth the effort  E  sicuramente il suo miglior romanzo  Non fatevi spaventare dalla mole  e un libro che non annoia mai  Anzi e molto scorrevole  fluido  L assassinio e solo il pretesto per mettere in mostra i difetti e i tratti caratteristici della Russia di quel tempo  Tutto condotto con incredibile maestria  con la storia che si dirama in piu direzioni senza mai perdersi  Incredibly challenging and oftentimes very dark  I found that the overall suspense of the plot was enough to help me push through it  I have not read another work that comes anywhere close to the level of depth and detail that went into Dostoyevsky s psychoanalysis of his protagonist  Raskolnikov  And I will just say that the ending of this work is superb  I do not usually cry when I read  I did this time   My introduction to Russian literature  Great writing  Deals with the questions of do we really have a conscience and what later became known as the will to power  A crime story told from the perspective of the criminal  Maybe the first and finest psychological thriller  I am nearly done re reading this book for the first time since AP English 10 years ago  For high school English  reading Raskolnikov s story was an interesting  if slightly difficult  task  and not much more  For the here and now  it is a pleasure  If you ve the desire to read up on the highly cliched and much maligned  human condition   read this after New Year s  I especially recommend this to fellow travelers who also read it but grasped little in high school  This book is now added to my favorite list and probably one of the more cerebral reads  Crime and Punishment is about an educated young man who commits an unthinkable crime  His punishment isn t being convicted and sentenced to prison  but rather a lifetime of servitude   in hell   in his mind  Fyodor Dostoevsky did a fantastic job of taking a criminal  twisting the fate  and allowing the reader to feel compassion for someone who would normally be cast aside  While reading this  I discovered that books read like a meal  Some are potato chips  others are a backyard BBQ  This one is a buffet or a hearty steak with lots of side dishes  The descriptions are enough to seriously draw you in  like smelling an amazing BBQ down the street  I find this book is better to read in slightly longer sittings because FD creates a world for his characters  After a couple of pages  you can really get into his world  But one shorter reads  10 minutes or so  it s a little tricky to follow the storyline because there is a lot of philosophy and cool quotes  I ll reread this one many times because of the philosophy and I actually care about the characters  1st time in a long time  I m left feeling I truly know the characters   No spoilers but  FD knows how to serve up an ending  With a title like Crime and Punishment  the mood is a dark and stormy night  But FD never depends on cliches to describe things unless it s more powerful to do so  FD is consistent all the way through with the story and where he brings the characters  I m moved  Super moved by this book  I read the Bantam Classic version translated by Constance Garnett  March 1981 Version  Her translation is excellent   Classic  I never thought I d enjoy reading it because I was a bit prejudiced towards Russian literature being tedious but Crime and Punishment was  unputdownable   I literally couldn t put it down so I just took it wherever I went until i finished it  You just can t stop reading because you want to know if Rodia will voluntarily give himself up or will he get found out  Puts you on edge and makes you feel antsy  It was a terribly good read and I am astounded that we never took this on in Literature   that this was never part of our reading puzzles me   When people saw I was reading this  several warned that it was heavy and a tough read  I can t say I found that at all    I enjoyed the many entertaining and intelligent characters  especially Porfiry  It was nice to see even the conniving Svidrigailov committing some good deeds by the end  Plus plenty of intrigue as Raskolnikov wrestles with his concious   though perhaps the title ruined the ending a bit  I wonder if Dostoyevsky thought that through properly  J ai devore ce chef d oeuvre evidemment   analyse psychologique dans la Russie miserable d il y a 150 ans   bouleversante question   le crime est il permis s il peut aider beaucoup d autres personnes   J aimerais bien voir la piece de theatre     Crime and Punishment  was the second of Dostoevsky s most important  mature fictional works The novel is a psycho  logical account of a crime  A young man of middle class origin who is living in dire need is expelled from the university  From superficial and weak thinking  having been influenced by certain  unfinished  ideas in the air  he decides to get himself out of a difficult situation quickly by killing an old woman  a usurer and widow of a government servant Among Soviet critics   Crime and Punishment  fared the best of any of Dostoevsky s novels  because it lends itself better than any other to the view that it is an attack on the evils of capitalist society   poverty  recognition of birth or class rather than ability  and so on  The novel is a political pamphlet  written to attack the progressive ideology of the time  It is a social document  reflecting the evils of the time  despite Dostoevsky s clearly anti progressive sentiments  It is a psychological study  a realistic novel in which Dostoevsky has captured the workings of a specific period of history and a specific type of society on the minds of his characters  especially the character of Raskolnikov  The novel is not realistic  but symbolic  and portrays the conflict of different ideas on the battlefield of man himself  not historical  individual man  but man in all times and places   If you have the patience and tenacity to make it through this classic  you will be well rewarded  I am not an expert on Russian literature  but I felt drawn into the world of 19th century Russia  and into the mind of the protagonist  Raskalnikov  He repetitive language makes it a struggle  but a worthwhile one    This novel confirmed something negative about Dostoyevsky that I felt while reading his other works  The Idiot in particular  His major flaw as a writer is that he is bad with structure  This is because Dostoyevsky is more interested in the philosophical ideas he is expressing than the story he is telling  This means that rather than the philosophy of the work being expressed through the logical actions of the characters and their emotional arcs the characters often feel like puppets to the plot and mouthpieces for the author  Tolstoy had a lot of philosophy in Anna Karenina and often the novel would simply stop so that characters could discuss politics or another topic  but this only happened when it felt logical and it could develop the characters further   With this rather lengthy caveat out of the way  I will still say that Crime and Punishment may be a masterpiece  The ideas that Dostoyevsky expresses and explores in the novel overcome how clunky his structure is and the characters are rich enough that they overcome how they often seem to be manipulated by the author s whims  The protagonist  Raskolnikov  is a man motivated by ideas  so the style of Dostoyesky s writing fits this characters state of mind  This helps put the reader into a state where they can understand his committing of murder  even though the act is inexplicable from any kind of emotional reckoning of human behavior   While the work is a large ambitious philosophical novel  it is unavoidable that a contemporary reader see the tropes of twentieth century crime fiction appear  These are most obvious with the relationship between the protagonist and the police  It could be argued that it was Dostoyevsky who created these tropes in the first place and they would be later streamlined into the works of pulp of the early twentieth century   Like many crime novels  this work deals with the struggle against nihilism  Some later crime novels would give into it  often in an ironic or comic fashion  but Dostoevsky is fighting against nihilism wholeheartedly   Few books in my life actually altered   however slightly   my existing disposition  Crime and Punishment  however  was one of them Dostoevsky does a masterful job of presenting a tortured intellectual  a man with noble ideals that are easier to imagine than to implement  I found Raskolnikov s undulations from heroic Ubermensch to terrified inmate of his own conscience pleasurably tortuous I may one day make this the only book I ve reread among the hundreds I ve injested because the belied nuance and power of Dostoevsky in this novel make this his magnum opus  I think that Dostoyevsky s  Crime and Punishment  is not so far from a lot of Indian works of fiction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  Both referred to the deep and large cavity between the rich and the poor in an assigned community  The classical moral lesson  almost spiritual  that the good should be rewarded in those works  was always present  I m about half way into this  and it s rather gruesome  We ll see how it turns out  The author was a Christian  so I m quite curious to see how it ends UPDATE Finished it about two weeks or more ago  Was very pleased with the ending  Made for a satisfying read    Fyodor DostoevskyCrime and PunishmentNew York  Barnes and Noble Books  2007538 pp   8 95978 1 59308 081 5A fantastic peice of literature  Fyodor Dostoevsky s  Crime and Punishment  is a great read  and impossible to put down  The story of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov grips the reader from start to finish  Though it was first written nearly 150 years ago   Crime and Punishment  is still an engaging and absorbing tale Raskolnikov  a former law student and teacher  is a chracter of remarkable phsycological depth  into which Dostoevsky delves into in great detail  He leaves school and stops working  only to sit in his small  cramped room and think  When the idea to kill Alyona Ivanovna  an old spitefull pawnbroker  occurs to Raskolnikov  he initially dismisses it  However  the idea keeps coomiing back to him  causing him much grief  When Raskolnikov finally ends up acting on his idea to kill Alyona Ivanovna  he ends up unexpectedly murdering her sister  Lizaveta Ivanovna as well  He thought that he was justified to kill Alyona Ivanovna  but his killing of Lizaveta deeply troubles him The ensuing game of cat and mouse between Raskolnikov and the detective assigned to the case  Porfiry Petrovich  is of particular intrest  Their mutual knowledge of criminal phsycology and questioning of suspects create an interesting competition  though Raskolnikov has a major disadvantage  That is to say  his feelings of irritability  guilt  angst  and the effects  both mental and physical  that these have on him result in him seriously compromising himself  even foolishly so  on more than one occasion  Crime and Pucishment  is a must read for anyone interested in human phsycology  especially criminal phsycology   detective novels  or 19th century Tsarist Russia  Dostoyevsky approaches human nature in a critical manner  examining the rationale behind the actions which exceed mere existence  Entangling his reader in a web of understanding  Dostoyevsky transcribes the human spirit s capacity to bear fault  that of one s self and of others  Even if one repudiates their sins  that capacity takes on virtue  love among many  to acknowledge that the soul endures punishment in one way or another for a reason   Dostoyevsky s story and the ideas of the novel need little discussion  however  as I re read the Pevear   Vohonsky translation for the second time  I was reminded of just what a difference contemporary translations make  It s fair to ask why a frequently translated novel like this one might benefit from being translated yet again  and in this case  I feel that the translators  work is well worth reading the novel again   This treatise on the extemeties of the human condition and their impact to the mind  and the heart  is so fascinating to me  And it s so wonderfully nuanced and richly detailed  One of my most favorite books  Note to self  A required reading in

Four stars  not because  I really liked it   as the rating claims  but because of Dostoyevsky s intensity and compassion for poor people s suffering  I would have preferred to see the main character s redemption come about earlier than in Chapter II of the Epilogue  but Sonia s devotion almost makes up for that  Amazing and touching   4 5 stars  Absorbing and perfectly paced novel  Translation by David Magarshack just fine  This book has been waiting on my bookshelf  through five moves  for 25 years  Raskolnikov dreamed a terrible dream   His look frightened his mother  for in it she caught a glimpse of poignant suffering and of something unbending and almost insane  too   I remain amazed with the power of accessibility in speech that Fyodor had  It s far not enough to say that this might be one of the best novels in history  Along with Toltoy s War and Peace  Kafka s Trial  Homer s Odyssey  Eca de Queiroz  Couside Basilio and so on so on   My opinion  its a Tragedy book  its so sad and painful  in this book you read very clear fact of a period of time in russia  i think this book is a great work of art  It took nearly an year for me to complete this book  Raskolnikov s mental struggles are beautifully depicted here  Only an individual who had been gone through at least some amount of harshness in early life both financially and socially will understand it  and he will be reading the book with a heavy heart and will be at peace towards the end    rwy  lymkn wSfh bklmt lmkhlwqt bHsb qwnyn lTby   ynqsmwn bSwr   m  l  qsmyn lqsm l wl w hm lmrw wswn    wly k l ySlHwn l

novels that interest me  and this one caught my eye just in time for a week of vacation  It s the story of a man who commits a gruesome crime  and the moral struggle he goes through as a result The book takes place in Russia in the 1800s  and it does a good job of describing the society and peoples of that time  It also does a good job as a suspense story  Not only is Raskolnikov  the murderer and main character  wracked with guilt and increasingly sick as a result of his moral agony  but the police are closing in This book works primarily as a morality play  exploring the consequences on a man s soul when he does something as awful as murder a woman for her money  It looks very candidly at issues of good and evil  guilt and repentance  and ultimately grace and redemption I wish more writers today dealt with the ethical issues of our world  It seems that the modern authors are increasingly relativistic  amoral  and even nihilistic  Not so with this novel  It s almost philosophical in the way it asks the hard questions  and in how it deals with the inevitable answers I can easily see why Dostoyevsky is considered one of history s great authors  He deserves the title without question  This book is a great monument to his genius  Through Sonya  Raskolnikov is able to find love and salvation     While Svidrigailov is not     The slow start of this book is worth pushing through  I began it about a year ago  got through five chapters  put it down and forgot about it  I picked it up again  three days ago  starting from the beginning  and finished it  What an amazing story Dostoyevsky is a talented writer  what great insight to the human condition  Raskolnikov is a nihilist who imagines himself one of the superiors of the human race  the kind who cannot do wrong  for him there is no law  He sets out to prove it  Yet  in attempting to prove it  he realizes that he is not one of the superiors  and he must come to understand why The interactions between Raskolnikov and police officers  lawyers  friends  family  neighbors  and enemies are particularly insightful as to human condition  The psychology that goes into the cat and mouse question and answers  the games they play to conceal their true motives  intentions  and feelings  and power of their eyes  especially for the more aware and attentive  like his sister  Dounia  to see the unspoken  the unannounced  the concealed  are powerful  gripping  and moving aspects of the story It would be a great and enjoyable study to discover Dostoyevsky s meaning and usage of the color yellow  It appears continuously throughout the story  and is always mentioned with purpose  it seems  But  alas  that is for another reading of it  rskhlnykhf dr Dmn khh pysh my rft b khwd ndyshyd   dr khj

have never before read a novel with more character and style as this  The story and setting was dark and close  The ending blew me away  I d read it over and over again  This is probably one of the sneakiest psychological novels I ve read  Slolwely  Dostoevsky shoves the book s hero  Raskolnikov  into madness and despair  squeezing both him and the readers into the mindset of an escaped murderer with an overly active conscious  This book is wonderful written  swallowing the reader into Raskolnikov s mind and emotions A great read  I highly recommend it  I had three false starts with this one  Once  I remember throwing the book and thinking I could never read it  Those first 60ish pages were a slugfest     and then something happened and it became the best book ever written  Yes    it s absolutely worth it Someone recommended it and it CHANGED  MY  LIFE  This book  like all of Dostoyevsky s work  is  of course  a classic and  I believe  a must read for the modern reader  In this book  Dostoyevsky explores the themes that run throughout his work  including sin and redemption  the meaning of modernity  and the search for meaning in modernity  and  in another typical Dostoyevsky move  all in the midst of a novel about a murder mystery and family drama  Like all great novels  this book provides another means by which we can understand ourselves and others  Dostoyevsky s insights into the human mind precede and surpass those of modern psychologists  The introduction and afterward to this version of the book are also very interesting and insightful  The best book I ve ever read  although I haven t read that many   The conflict between morals and ethics is tricky  not just in the central plot but in side stories as well  which reflect the central conflict brilliantly  hl hdhh

takes us to the understanding of the human nature  a continous fight inside the head of Raskolnikov I advise to read it before Dostoyevsky s complete work which is  The Karamazov Brothers  I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would  It was a little slow but quite intriquing  The psychological aspects were super intriguing and the back and forth between characters was continuously fascinating  Overall great book if you enjoy the witty banter and thought process   If you like thrilling investigation of a mysterious murder case and deep psychological study of a mind of a criminal  this is the book you want to read   Crime and Punishment  is a suspense thriller book written by a Russian novelist  Fyodor Dostoevsky  that deals with murder  criminal mind  and investigation The story mainly takes place in the slums of St  Petersburg in the 1860s  which sets a grim and depressing atmosphere in the story  The streets crawl with drunkards and molesters and poverty is witnessed everywhere  Rodya Raskolniknov is the main protagonist of the novel who ends up murdering the pawnbroker and so begins the story  Other significant characters include Alyona Ivanovna  who is the pawnbroker that Raskolnikov murders  Dounia Raskolnikov  who is Raskolnikov s sister  Porfiry Petrovitch  who is the magistrate in charge of investigating the murder case  Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin  who is the stingy  rude fiance of Dounia  and Sonia Marmeladov  who is the person Raskolnikov eventually comes to love   The story revolves around the poor student  Raskolnikov  who lives in a small garret barely big enough to fit in a sofa and a small table  He despises Alyona for cheating him out of his money when he is already drenched in poverty and eventually decides to kill her after a long internal conflict with himself  which marks the beginning of the actual story  After murdering both Ivanovna and her sister  Lizaveta  Raskolnikov is thrown off into a deep confusion and delirium  Still mentally unstable  he confesses his crimes to Zossimov at Crystal Palace  but says it was all a joke  Later  he spots Marmeladov dying in the streets  ran over by a horse carriage  and brings him home which leads to the start of his relationship with Sonia Marmeladov  Afterwards  Raskolnikov ends up confessing that he is the murderer who killed the Ivanovna sisters to Sonia  After some more events occur including Porfiry s interrogation  he goes to Sonia to tell her that he is ready to turn himself in and he does  Raskolnikov receives an 8 year sentence in a Siberian prison  There  he recovers from his long  illness  and begins to change  coming to feel love toward Sonia  I did not get to finish reading the whole book  but I enjoyed reading it very much from the beginning of the novel to the point I ended up in  Dostoevsky s sophisticated interpretations and descriptions of Raskolnikov s state of mind which goes through many changes throughout the story impressed me greatly  He vividly illustrates the unstableness Raskolnikov is constantly thrown off into with writings such as   Suddenly he stopped  a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him   and       Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself      I shall get well and I shall not worry      But what if I don t get well at all  Good God  how sick I am of it all     p 105   This truly adds more depth and intensity to the book which draws the reader s attention and helps to engage more easily with the characters and in the story  I believe the target audience for this book is any adults in the society  I can easily tell that this book is definitely not for the kids to read since it deals with a heavy topic like  murder  and uses high level words such as  unscrupulous  and  prevaricate   This book is for people that are living in and experiencing a bigger world who are or have learned to interact and make bonds with newer and more variety of people  I think Dostoevsky wanted his audience to see the world through Raskolnikov s eyes and feel it with his state of mind under the situations he was in  which Dostoevsky s own character has a relation to  as a result of the kind of life he went through before writing this novel   I gave this book a five out of five stars because I honestly was fascinated to read this wonderfully written novel and even though it gave me many confusions because of the main character s continuous feverishness  I consider it as my lack of ability to fully understand the situations and also  one of the charms this book can give  I was not able to finish to the end  but it provided me with a fresh entertainment while I was reading it  so I would say this book deserves a five star rating  On my own time  I would like to give myself an opportunity to finish reading this amazing piece of work   I forst read this in high school and was mesmerized  It is the first book that I could not put down  Dostoyevsky puts you into the mind of a killer being chased by the police and makes you feel all his angst and panic   acikcasi kitabi okurken kendimi kitabin ana kahramani raskolnikovun yasadiklarina duygularina aklindan gecenlere kendimi hicde yabanci hissetmedim hatta bir cok yerinde kitabin gidisatina gore bende raskolnikovun icinde cirpindigi ruhsal durumlarda buldum kendimi     Dostoyevsky gets into your mind in the same way Raskolnikov s crime creeps into his  brooding in the corners and sometimes quiet but a presence that you can t shake off  There is nothing dated and off about Dostoyevsky s expressions or any falsity in the characters  relationships   everything was harsh and real  The key characters have such intense and vivid personalities  yet it is their flaws which make them so irresistible   best thing i have ever experienced   Fyodor just did it with perfection  I m giving this five stars for certain scenes and sequences that are tragic and funny and true all at the same time  Real classics  Be warned  though  you have to wade through a lot of dated philosophizing and psychological monologues to get to the good bits  When Dostoevsky sticks to the basic story he s telling  putting his characters through their paces and describing their world it s as good as literature gets   If anyone wants some insight to the Russian culture and human nature this is the book  I m prejudice just because I appreciate the Russians  How we live and were raised is a HUGE part of who we are   Okudugum en kiymetli kitaplardan birisi  Kesinlikle herkesin okumasi gereken klasiklerden Yorum icin  http   zeynepceydademirkan blogspot c    Una gran obra que refleja el amplio conocimiento del autor sobre la naturaleza humana  Recomendado    If you ve killed an old woman  and you re kinda going crazy  and you ve got two people pulling you in opposite directions  follow the humble  beautiful and pious Christian girl over the nihilistic  self loathing pedophile  I have not read this book since high school  and honestly  I thought I wouldn t get through the first 100 pages  I just thought I might end up teaching it next year  and I would give it a shot  After about page 35  I just couldn t put the book down  It is like Dickens only in this very accessible Russian way  and I just fell in with the characters and their plights and their triumphs  I couldn t believe the ending  not the way I remembered it at all   and I can see once again why the classic literature gives us new insights in each stage of our lives  I d recommend waiting until the late fall or deep winter to give this one a read  just for the mood and the need for steaming tea as you turn the pages   When I tried to take this book out of the school library in fourth year  my English teacher told me that    the day that you read Crime and Punishment is the day that I die   I read it last week and I m not sure how she s getting on but I am a whole lot better after reading this  I have never read a book that deals with so many aspects of modern life as this does  Poverty Wealth  Sanity Insanity  Love Hate  Life Death  Morality Immorality  Philosophy  Psychology  Culture  Religion  Science  Humanity   Dostoevsky is  without a doubt  the master of the associative mind in this novel  The entire book represents the working of a mind that relies on reason alone  without love or intuition  or God for that matter   He has masterfully made an intricate philosophical argument through fiction that  even today  retains its power  Though subtle  he is showing how the West s obsession with reason is a kind of monomania itself  an example that should not be followed by the Russians  The novel ends with the hope of an  unknown reality   perhaps the mysticisms that can be found in the East  and  perhaps  even in Eastern Orthodoxy itself  Crime and Punishment is probably my favorite book  Dostoevsky is an incredible writer who creates deep  realistic characters and impeccable plots  One of the reasons that I love this book so much is that it full of wisdom  there is so much to be learned from it about human nature and oneself  I absolutely adore this book and would recommend it to anyone  One might think of this as an inverse detective novel  Dostoevsky has a real talent for moving the reader from looking over the shoulder of the character to looking through the lens of the characters eyes  This story takes a bit to get going and the Russian names can be a bit of an encumbrance  but once the story begins to climb it keeps reaching higher and higher  Some of the scenes are truly stunning  Here are two of my favorite passages      power is only granted to those who dare to stoop and pick it up  There is only one thing  one thing needful  one has only to dare    And you mustn t suppose that I didn t know  for instance  that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power  I certainly hadn t the right     If I worried myself all those days  wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not  I felt clearly of course that I wasn t Napoleon  I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas I wanted to find out something else  it was something else that led me on  I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man  Whether I can step over barriers or not  whether I dare stoop to pick up or not  whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the right     The peasants have vodka  the educated you people  shut out from activity  waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories  foreigners have sprung up and are amassing money  and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery Definitely recommend it for anyone that feels that they endure a  battle of ideas  in scenarios where others float by  Cheers  Justin Worth reading  Najbolja knjiga ikad  Lo he leido hace mucho tiempo  Fue para mi un libro muy triste  donde el personaje estaba lleno de resentimiento  Aun asi me gusto  I read this novel in high school  as an accident and a teachers insisyence i follow through  I was never more thankful to read a novel of this size  It is beautifully written and remains one of my all time favorites     thanks Mr  Helmling  Was there ever a more exasperating character than Raskolnikov  He s so full of contradictory traits  that he s among the most realistic of all literary protagonists  Yet you ll find yourself yelling at him quite a bit  if you re the type that talks back to books  He just keeps shooting himself in the foot  all the while thinking himself superior to the others around him In addition to having one of the most fascinating characters  this novel is one of the most suspenseful page turners of all 19th century novels  It s also a great glimpse into Russian life and culture  The grasping plight of the poor  who are yet able to be incredibly generous  The fondness for wild philosophical discourse over tea or vodka  The  I ll scratch your back if you ll scratch mine  system of doling out bureaucratic jobs  The passionate emotional intensity  The gregariousness  The sense of hospitality  The way that 19th century Russian culture was in thrall to French and English culture Ultimately  this is a crime novel where the identity of the criminal is known  but the struggle is not between the criminal and the law  but between the criminal and himself   wow  this is another book I would ve enjoyed reading with a group as I feel there was much more to digest than just what I was able to glean from the writing  still  I really enjoyed the book and the stories therein  a sad tale all in all  until the very last chapter  but a deep look into the true punishment that comes from inherently criminal actions  It took me a while to read this   it was hard at first with all the Russian name variations used in the book  Once I got into it I couldn t put it down  This has to be one of my favourite books  Two things impressed upon me  they were Dostoyevsky s complete understanding of women and their plight  and his incredible insight into the human psyche  The setting is described in such detail that it would be hard not to imagine yourself there  This story will stay with you long after you finish reading it  I highly recommend it  i ve read this book three times  i first read it when i was 16 and i became fascinated by raskalnikov s character  i read it again at 20 and 26 and my fascination with it only grew more  a fantastic book that delves deep into the human psyche and all of its intricacies  This book amazed me  the style of writing is really good  the book is intense and different from other books which makes it more interesting  I love philosophical books and this is definitely one of them  Such a great novel  Absolutamente maravilhoso  Consegue passar a impressao de um sonho  ou antes  de um pesadelo  em que nao se sabe onde esta  como chegou e o que faz  sem ter o controle da sua consciencia  Angustiante  Muito bom  Maybe the best book ever written  Tip for the reader  Make a character list as you read  It gets confusing because there are so many characters and many are close to being the same  El autor crea un relato sumamente original  y reune las piezas de manera sutil  Cada parte del libro juega con las emociones y con el aspecto psicologico  Cada uno de los personajes es perfectamente bien logrado  hasta llegar al punto en que crees conocerlos  De principio a fin se proponen muchas cuestiones de etica y filosofia en los monologos del personaje principal  Es un juego mental fuerte e inesperado Nunca antes un clasico me habia mantenido tan intrigada  Es uno de los pocos libros que he leido de manera pausada para no acabarlo  Disfrute cada capitulo   Torments and tears  after all  that is life  too  But he felt no remorse for his crime  A haunting tale of the psychological torments one faces when he is up against his own conscience and that of the society  A life changing tale  a must read for anyone who hitherto didn t know the true meaning of redemption and resurrection and seeks to see them face to face  This is honestly one of my favorite books of all time  I think the moral dilemma that Raskolnikov is in  compounded by his illnesses which are brought on by his lack of food and maybe also by sleeping under bushes is something all students can identify with  though usually not on such a grand scale  This is the first book that I cried reading the ending and then for a few minutes after I closed the book  Phenomenal  Dostoyevsky puts us into the mind of a troubled young man dealing with the turmoil of a gruesome act  Beautiful prose transport us to a world that is dark and suspenseful  A must read for anyone looking for a great classic  I started reading this a few years ago and somehow lost interest  but recently picked it up again and read through slowly this time  savouring each word  Everything is vivid and poignant  Though I would like to befriend young Raskolnikov  the murderer  I don t want him to get away with his crime  his freedom would be his death   I ll admit to not  getting  this celebrated classic for a good chunk of the reading  It had plenty of dragging moments  with character reactions that were so over the top that it was jarring  And yet there were also plenty of moments that the story just zipped along  and I found myself enjoying it immensely  It wasn t until I finished the last page that everything clicked  and I realized just what the story was trying to achieve  In the end  it will likely be one of the most memorable reads I ll ever have    I had forgotten  or perhaps never knew  just how intellectual this book really is  Dostoyevsky asks many questions that make you stop in the midst of reading the story and think  Are there these so called over men who the law has no sway or hold over  Possibly  Can one horrible act be wiped away by a hundred acts that better all of humanity  It s a very difficult question  Especially when you consider in this situation that the  horrible act  at first was not all that horrible  The death of the despicable pawn broker was lamented by no one  When considering the death of the kind sister  one would truly see horror  but only in the act itself and not the intent of the original plan  Overall  anyone who wants to challenge themselves to think about humanity in a different way needs to read this book  Also  I really did understand and perceive things in a completely different way reading it for the second time after seven years  I m very glad I went back and read this book  Dostoevsky is one of those authors I ve always been meaning to read  but was kinda intimidated by and kinda like  Eh  I ll get around to that later   I m glad I finally followed up on the recommendations of many friends and took the plunge with Crime and Punishment  It just seems like one of those awful books you d have to slug through in high school and have weekly reading quizzes to make sure you were actually reading the thing and not the cliff notes  I was surprised that given its length it keeps moving along and maintains the tension  I think more than the whole crime and punishment theme I like the interactions between the characters in the story   they are so perfectly articulated  There are some histrionic moments and some character s musings that I admittedly skimmed through a bit  mainly Svdrigaylov  Like ugh  just get out of the story already   The ending seems to wrap up a little too neatly  but jeez you gotta end the 550 pages somehow  All in all I found it entertaining and thought provoking   Pure genius  My favourite book of all time  It s a story about a very educated young man who has a theory regarding the greatest  most influential and the most savagest people ever born  He so desperately wants to be included in this group  that he tries to act entirely out of his own character in order to fit in  Needless to say  in the end when he realises that he s never going to be anything but your average joe  he finds peace  love and happiness   Intenso  complejo  lleno de detalles sobre la psicologia humana  crudo  extenuante  revelador  Algo que distingue a una obra literaria clasica de una obra promedio es lo impactante del mensaje a pesar de la epoca en que es escrita  vemos como en este caso Dostojevski en esta obra hecha a mediados del siglo XIX retrata a fondo el alma y la naturaleza humana y hace una objetiva critica social  Es una novela de obsesion que termina con una nueva historia que comienza  la del hombre  en este caso Raskalnikov que despues de ser victima de sus decisiones y atravesar por un gran sufrimiento tiene la oportunidad de empezar de nuevo a traves de una regeneracion progresiva que como nos dice el autor es tema de otro relato  what a great novel to show the psycology of a clever almost mad man  i really loved his talks with porfiry  the examinig magistrate  knowing about russian society that time is like a journey into different culture and time Dostoevsky was perfectly acquainted with the new theories and ideas that people talked about and shared  His  Raskolnikov   was very helpful to many psychologists especially Freud  and to me it was fascinating to feel his madness  depression and finally his resurrection through love and suffering      El sufrimiento y el dolor son siempre necesarios para la conciencia de altos vuelos y para el corazon profundo  A mi modo de ver  los hombres verdaderamente grandes han de experimentar una pena inmensa en este mundo    anadio de subito  pensativo  incluso con un tono distinto del de la conversacion    The most complex and concise novel I have ever read in terms of character models  social anxieties  madness  injustice and life  this is the novel that leaves you feeling sick and engrossed at all times  You love and care for some characters  and you hate and despise others  but overall for me  it was the feeling of inevitability and pity that left me on edge by the end  It was 656 pages   just a note  Better minds then mine have analyzed and dissected his book  I ll just say that Crime and Punishment is one of the four books on the human condition that everyone should read  The others are To Killing a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee  In Cold Blood by Truman Capote  and Les Miserables by Victor Hugo  I will probably read this book several more times  zyb tryn ktby kh tw  mrm khwndm dr  yn Hly kh bh msy l bsyr  myq flsfy w khlqy my prdzh w bsyry z swlty kh hmyshh tw dhhn adm bwdh rw dwbrh mTrH my knh  rmn bsyr jdhb w gyryy hst  This is a book that studies the goodness and evils of humanity  The main character  Raskolnikov  commits the murder of two women  believing that in doing so he would help many more people than he would hurt  He believes that there are people who have the right to harm others if it will benefit the greater good  He believes that the world is separated into two kinds of people  ordinary and extraordinary  Naturally  he believes he is among the extraordinary people  evidenced by his utter disdain for his fellow human beings  The interesting thing about this book is how Dostoyevsky manages to portray different kinds of evil  There is Raskolnikov  but he also has foils for him  like Pyotr Petrovich  who is a pure materialist who cares nothing for anyone and wants to take Raskolnikov s sister  Dounia  as a possession  to be worshiped as a god for  rescuing her from the blight of being poor   There is also Svidrigailov who is smart and cunning  who exhibits depraved behavior towards women  but who ultimately cannot handle his fantastic delusions to be destroyed  On the other side  you have the good  Dounia  Raskolnikov s sister  is a strong  independent woman who takes care of herself  and her mother  while also trying to take care of her brother  She has an innate sense of goodness to her that makes her so different from her brother  and it gives you perspective of the sacrifices she is willing to make  Meanwhile  Raskolnikov is selfish and isolated to the point that he does not care for the feelings of others  even his own family  There is also Sonya  a girl who was forced to prostitute herself to get money for her family after her drunk of a father spends it all on booze  Sonya is deeply religious  something that she uses in order to survive  If she did not believe in God  she would never be able to live with herself  When asked what would happen when her step mother died  leaving her three siblings to Sonya s care  Sonya says that God won t let anything bad happen to them  She says this  but it is only a delusion  After all  if she looked closer she would have to see that God had let her become a prostitute  so what would make her little sister worthier of a better fate  I found it particularly interesting how Dostoyevsky uses religion as a tool  He does not particularly use it as redemptive just through belief  but he does see it as a means that people use to come together as a society  Therefore  when Raskolnikov opens the Bible at the end  he is not necessarily becoming a believer  but he is breaking out of his narcissistic isolation and becoming a member of society But still that beating the horse to death was fucked up  I get the allegory but still you had an attempted rape that was so tame it was almost unclear what was happening but that dream was horrific and traumatizing  DON T TRAUMATIZE ME DOSTOYEVKSY  this review is actually intended for the new translation by that celebrity translation couple  for some reason couldn t find it on goodreads  anyway  hadn t read it since high school  surprise surprise  it s still good  This book has left a lasting impression even years after I first read it  Dostoevsky is pure genius  his characters have unprecedented depth  and the setting of this psychological masterpiece draws you so close to the drama you feel as if you were there  His subtle but perfectly crafted exploration of morality  religion  society and redemption remains unmatched  An absolute must read that will engage and impress  despite slightly drawn out scenes which may bore an impatient reader  With so much under the surface  the reader experiences something new each time they reread the masterpiece  Subtle inclusions often have concealed meaning that only serve to enrich what is already a compelling narrative  One of the best novels of all time   This is Dostoevsky s best novel in my opinion  He did a wonderful job with his characterizations where you almost feel like you look into the soul is his characters  This is the first Dostoevsky novel I have read and I highly recommend it   I finished this several hours ago and  in respect of putting my thoughts down here  have picked up and put down the keyboard half a dozen times since  After an uncertain start I grew to love Crime and Punishment  my first attempt at any of the great classics of Russian literature  The range and depth of human emotions that Dostoevsky instils in every character is breath taking and the plot compelling through out  The main character  Raskolnikov  is fascinating  the book s great strength is how it deals with his internal struggles  how he initially justifies murder because he considers himself of the elite and then becomes tortured with self doubt  Much of his character beyond this is good  he wants the best for his sister  helps the bereaved wife of a man he barely knew and falls for the orphaned Sonya    although he is often difficult with his best friend  one of the few he has  It s this complicated soul which makes the book so captivating  despite him ostensibly being a risible character due to his callous crime I found myself rooting for him towards the end  Interestingly Dostoevsky turns none of Raskolnikov s family or friends against him when the truth outs  All the characters have great depth and the book is packed with tense  gripping moments  The scene with Dounetchka and Svidrigailoff towards the end  and the latters eventual  grim decision  particularly impressed me  It s not a light read and demands much from its reader but if you re prepared to give it your attention the rewards are rich  I m still struggling to put into words all I d like to but hopefully I ve conveyed the satisfaction this book gave me  My favorite book of all time  I read it once a year and love it more each time   The entirety of the plot is discernible within the first few chapters  but the story is not  Many other reviewers will praise this book as an excellent story of pride  sin  suffering  and redemption  By all means  Crime and Punishment will challenge the reader to consider himself in light of his own suffering  which  for Dostoevsky  is a redeeming agent  The particular crime is born of a vice  pride  and resulting is the testing of a hypothesis  if I am God  I should be able to create and execute my own laws  Guilt and suffering commence as a result of this action  but if this were a story that ended with sorrow  it would not be particularly interesting  A detailed narration of the main character s thoughts details the transformation of the main character   his redemption  and stands as a pungent answer to the problem of evil  we suffer it to be redeemed and transformed  However  with the above having been stated by numerous reviewers  it is also worth discussing the effectiveness of Dostoevsky s particular style  and by extension  Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky translations   Dostoevsky takes his time  preferring to explore the effects of the events of the plot on the main character  rather than those events themselves  Very little actually  happens  in this book  such that even the most mundane occurrence  story  or dream becomes a potentially major turning point in the story  Additionally  Dostoevsky s mastery of suspense in this particular work is on full display  While a more detailed discussion would ruin some of the plot  when Dostoevsky wants his readers to squirm in their seats under the crushing guilt and anxiety Rodion Raskolnikov experiences  they will squirm  The reader simply feels the same way Rodion does  I know it must happen  but I certainly don t want it too   Maybe the best book I ve read till now  Extraordinary  I love the psychology of the different characters  the thoughts  even the cruelness in the story  It s just an amazing book  I had goosebumps when I finished it Brilliant  Easily anyone s favorite novel  We all see injustice everywhere even though what looks unfair to you might be totally normal to others  Being in an unfair situation is the cruelest thing that can ever happen to anyone  It is difficult though to explain or justify when you re in such a situation  Dostoyevsky captures that pain clearly in this novel Summary Notes Part 1 Chapter 1 Walking around uncomfortably  avoiding the landlady in a hot summer day because he doesn t have any money  He is crushed by poverty  He doesn t care anymore about

doing whatever he wants to it  He wakes up from the dream in horror  He leaves the apartment and goes to the market  There he hears that Alyona Ivanovna s sister was going to be out at 7 in the evening and Alyona would be completely alone Chapter 6 Raskolnikov overhears another conversation between two people who also had a recent interaction with Alyona  They complained about her unfair interest prices and she abuses her sister to do whatever she asks her for  One of the men even suggests how killing Alyona and distributing the money she has to the poor would probably be a justifiable act to the society  Raskolnikov goes back and prepares for his act  He makes a secure pocket for the axe in his jacket  When he goes downstairs to the kitchen to get the axe he sees Nastasya and blames himself for thinking that the kitchen would be empty  He then leaves and gets the axe from the porter and heads to the place  He reaches the place without anyone noticing him  He goes inside and notices the painters painting in the flat but they don t see them  He continues going upstairs and rings the bell several times until she answered Chapter 7 Raskolnikov forces his way in the apartment  He reminds her of why he is here  for the cigarettes case   She goes into the bedroom and he gets his axe out and starts striking her with it  He looks for the keys and notices the necklace she s wearing  He tries to take it but it was stuck so he uses the axe to get it  He finds the keys and takes the leather purse  He finds the chest under the bed and opens it  It was full of clothes but then he discovers that a lot of watchers  silver and gold are hidden in those clothes  He then hears noise and goes out to discover that the sister never left the house  He goes back for the axe  The sister is defenseless  She doesn t even cover her face with her hands  He strikes her with the axe  He is frightened now  He begins cleaning himself to leave but then he hears the doorbell  Two people were waiting outside and were suspicious of the situation because the door was locked from the inside  They leave to get help and Raskolnikov takes the chance to leave  He almost comes across the painters as were going out but they don t see him  He hides in that empty apartment until everyone goes upstairs and then he leaves quickly Part 2Chapter 1 Raskolnikov is terrified  He goes into deep sleep  He wakes up frightened with a high fever  He hides the stuff he stole  Nastasya comes in with the porter  He needs to go the Police  He is horrified now and knows that the Police found out  He goes there and decides on the way that the best thing is to confess to get it over with  He arrives there and waits while being in a frightened state  They finally tell him that he is here because the landlady complained that he is not paying the rent  He is suddenly relieved and even gets upset at the police man  He signs the required papers and overhears the police talking about the murder  He gets terrified again and believes that the police will know it s him Chapter 2 Raskolnikov returns home  collects the jewelry and leaves again  He buries the jewelry under a large stone in a courtyard  He visits his friend Razumikhin and doesn t remember why he was there but then remembers that he said he will see him after  IT  happens  Razumikhin offers him a job doing translations he first accepts but then rejects the offer  He returns back him and goes back to sleep  He dreams that Ilya Petrovitch is beating the landlady  Nastasya wakes him up and he tells Nastasya what happened but she tells him it was a dream and he is very sick Chapter 3 Raskolnikov stays in that state for days  Razumihkin stays beside him to take care of him  He wakes up to find a person he didn t know  He turns out to be delivering money his mother was sending  He learns that he s been out for four days and he gets scared because he thinks he might ve said something about the murder  Razumihkin also tells him that he s been asking for his socks multiple times while he was unconscious  Raskolnikov checks on the socks and gets relieved that the socks were covered by dirt so no one would ve noticed the blood Chapter 4 Dr  Zossimov is a 27 year old tall fat man with spectacles  Razumihkin updates the doctor with the status of Raskolnikov and asks if it s possible for Raskolnikov to attend a gathering tonight  Zametov will be attending who is the chief clerk along with Petrovitch  the head of the investigation department  The doctor and Razumihkin were talking of the murder of Alyona along with her sister  The painters were accused of the murder  One of them had a jewelry box that he claimed to have found on the street  Razumikhin is insisting that the painters couldn t have committed the crime  Razumikhin gives a full theory of why the painters can t be the killers  He insists that the killer must ve been upstairs and once the painters left the apartment he went there and waited for everyone to go back upstairs and then ran out and dropped the earrings on the way  The doctor however thinks that the explanation is too melodramatic and couldn t have happened Chapter 5 Donia s fiance arrives asking for Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov doesn t care for him but also notices that he is very well dressed  Luzhin says that Raskolnikov s mother and sister maybe arrive at anytime now  He tells him where he is making them stay  Razumihkin says that the place is filthy and a dump  Luzhin defends the choice by saying that he didn t know ahead of time  Luzhin is staying though with Andrea Semyonovitch  Zossimov suggests that one of the clients of Alyona must have killed her  Zossimov thinks that he is a professional killer while Razumihkin thinks the killer is new and that is his first crime because he didn t take all the jewelry  Luzhin interrupts saying that the killer must ve been a rich client  Raskolnikov attacks Luzhin saying that he wants to marry his poor sister to have total control over her  Luzhin accuses Raskolnikov s mother of saying this  Raskolnikov threatens Luzhin of throwing him down the stairs if he talks about his mother again  He leaves right away Chapter 6 Alone in his room he calms down  He left the apartment  He walks aimlessly  He met Zametov  They started talking and Raskolnikov thanked him for giving him the sock when he was sick  Zametov thought he should still be in bed  He almost confesses to Zametov  He describes what he would ve done if he was the murderer  He described how he would hide the jewelry under a stone and come back 2 to 3 years after to collect it  Zametov at first started suspecting him but then changed his mind at the end thinking that Raskolnikov is just ill  Raskolnikov bumps into Razumihkin but says that he wants to be alone and rejects his friend s invitation to his party  He leaves and witnesses a suicide attempt over the bridge  He passes by Alyona s place and goes inside  He kept ringing the bell over and over again  He said he wants to rent the apartment  The workers was getting annoyed with him  Raskolnikov left and knew that he soon would to the police

by saying that he is opposed to the engagement  He declares that he doesn t want anyone in the room  Razumihkin takes the mother and sister away  He promised to bring Dr  Zossimov to take care of Raskolnikov  Razumihkin develops feelings for Donia  Razumihkin also tries to fix up the doctor with the landlady because he doesn t want the doctor and Donia to talk to each other Chapter 2 Razumihkin wakes up and goes to meet Pulcheria and Donia  They talk about Raskolnikov  how good he is although he doesn t show it  also of his past involvement with the landlady s daughter and how wrong that was  Pulcheria shows him the letter they received from Luzhin  He was supposed to meet them last night but didn t show up  He also apologized for not coming today  He also requested that Raskolnikov not be present when he meets them later today  He also told them about Roskolnikov giving me to the daughter prostitute of a drunk dying man the other day  She is nervous about the whole situation and even going to see Raskolnikov Chapter 3 Dr  Zossimov tells them that Raskolnikov is getting better and that he needs to go back to the university to keep himself busy  He is also doing this to impress the mother and Donia  Raskolnikov was thinking about how much he loved his mother and sister in their absence  His mother asks him if he knows what it means to be alone  Raskolnikov remembers the Katrina from yesterday and tells them how he should ve maybe not given the money away since he doesn t have any money  Donia also mentioned that Marfa died from the beating from her husband  They go back to the subject of Luzhin  Donia tries to convince him that she made the right choice  Raskolnikov is not convinced but at the end just declares that he doesn t care and she can marry whoever she wants  They show him the letter sent by Luzhin  They defends his position and says that he didn t give the money to the daughter but to the widow for the funeral Chapter 4 Sonya comes to Raskolnikov s place  She is dressed in cheap clothes  She came because Katrina told her to invite Raskolnikov to the service tomorrow  He invites her in but she felt that as if she is not worthy of sitting next to the ladies  The mother and the sister and leave  The mother is worried about the relationship between Raskolnikov and Donia  She thinks that Raskolnikov must think of a great deal of her  Raskolnikov tells Razumihkin that he needs to see Porfiry  the investigation officer  to see if he can find his father s watch that he had given to Aloyna  He also asks Sonya for her address so that he can visit her  He asked Sonya how she found his address and she told him that he gave it to her little sister but Raskolnikov didn t remember  They leave the apartment and Razumihkin jokes about about how he never looks his room  Sonya leaves too and suddenly she feels a strange feeling she never felt before  There was a guy following Sonya to her home  He was tall about 50  He turned out to be her neighbor   Svidrigailov Chapter 5 They both go to Porfiry  Raskolnikov is a bit nervous  Zametov is also there  Porfiry said that he needs to tell the lawyer and the lawyer will pursue the thing  Raskolnikov kept insisting that he doesn t have enough money and that the watch is very valuable and the only thing left from his father  Porfiry said that everyone came for their things except for him right after the murder  Raskolnikov become defensive and said that he was extremely hilarious  Porfiry kept asking him tricky questions  how he was generous with the family yesterday  his article about crime theory recently published  Raskolnikov said jokingly that he found a treasure somewhere  Raskolnikov figures out that he is getting irritated and that doesn t the case so he tried to calm down  Porfiry also asked if he saw painters two days before the murder  Raskolnikov knew the trick because the painters were only there on the day of the murder Chapter 6 Razumikhin doesn t understand why the police men were suspicious of Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov is certain they are  They walked to Raskolnikov s home  There was a man looking for Raskolnikov  The man calls him  Murderer   Raskolnikov walks beside him  He asks why he called them a murderer  He doesn t answer and the man leaves  Raskolnikov returns back to the room  feeling chilled and nervous  He is exhausted and in pain  He is convinced that he didn t kill a human being but a concept  He had a weird dream of killing the landlady again with the axe  He woke up to find a strange man in his room  The man declares that his name is Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigailovPart 4 Chapter 1 Svidrigailov goes to see Raskolnikov  He asks him to deliver a message to Dunya  Raskolnikov refuses immediately and asks him to leave  He defends himself saying that he had nothing to do with Marfa s death  Raskolnikov doesn t think so  He tells Raskolnikov about Marfa visiting him as a ghost and Raskolnikov thinks he is insane  He tells Raskolnikov that had heard of the engagement and he didn t think Luzhin is good enough for Donia and he wanted to break it and gives her 10 000 rubles without asking for anything in return  He also tells him that Marfa had left money for Donia in her will Chapter 2 Razumikhin and Raskolnikov walk together  Razumikhin had met Porfiry and Zametov  They meet Donia with Luzhin and the his mother at a restaurant  Luzhin gets upset  Luzhin tells them about Svidrigailov visiting and how he killed his wife  Donia thinks it s all gossip  Raskolnikov tells them about the money from Marfa s well  Luzhin threatens them if he leaves now he would ve ever come back  Donia tells him to never come back  Luzhin finally complains about how much they had cost him  The mother gets upset because Luzhin is cheap and barely spent money  Luzhin was so angry at Raskolnikov and thinks that he might still have a chance Chapter 3 Razumikhin is happy with the outcome  finally Luzhin is out of the picture  Raskolnikov tells Donia about the 10 000 rubles  Razumikhin says that the mother and Donia should indeed stay in St  Petersburg and not go back  that they should stay together as a family  Raskolnikov leaves without n     Just amazing  The flow of the actions  the thoughts of Raskolnikov  the absurdness of the situations and the ending  which contains some hope  The only creepy thing about it is  that Dostojevski can probably be more or less identified with Raskolnikov   A book that is a bit difficult to read  The author takes his time developing the characters and the plot lines  Particularly  the first few pages and the last few pages were a bit dull  The book takes a character  one who could be called a genius or crackpot with equal ease  and really brings him to life  The most brilliant aspect of the book as far as I am concerned is how the author makes you question about everything ranging from religion to law to society and even conscience  and then leaves you to decide for yourself how to feel about each  Certainly not a light read and I would suggest that you read it when you have the time and patience to move through atleast 50 60 pages a stretch   This book to me is probably the central work of the Christianity based wing of the literary existentialist movement  What I find to be so wonderful about it is that it has made fashionable so many of the central literary techniques employed in twentieth century literary existentialism  especially in the cases of Kafka  Nick Cave and  to a lesser extent  the surrealists as well   It has fantastic use of character development as a tool towards showing the evolution not only the human character undegoes but also of philosophical ideals  this  of course  is diaphanous as continental literature  and especially Russians like Chekov  Bulgakov and Tolstoy  employ this technique but it is  for me  the seminal example of said technique s proficiency  The question surrounding the Nietzschean  although this book is antecedent to FN  undertones of Raskolnikoff s outlook in relation to the sanctity of life and  prophetically  cultural relativism are so beautifully conveyed throughout not only through the use of his thoughts played out as narrative but also in the vernacular of the characters  giving another layer to the characterisation as a philosophical tool  To give an example of what I mean  Raskolnikoff appears early in the novel to be very blunt  a man of but few words and a very concise user of language  He often employs words such as  sultry    mere  and is derisory at all times in a stereotypically nihilistic manner  Towards the end  he makes a change to being extravagant and lyrical  reflecting a Renaissance style dialect that is indiciative of his gradual conversion back towards a Christian existentialist stance  which is emplary of the period of time that this style of speech symbolisises  My favourite example being his repeated use of the word  efficacious  towards his redemption  a word made popular by its use as an adjective of Christ s sacrifice in the KJ Bible  all the while his relationship with Sonia  herself symbolic of Christian values  and the religious images becoming more and more frequent  As well as this picturesque language and remarkable use of character development  this book also touches me on a philosophical level  too  We all love books that agree with our own prejudicial views although we hate to admit it and this is one that does this for me  It is a great depiction of how a nihilistic  yet utilitarian existential morality is  in terms of its application to this example  a philosophical reality  However  the idea of the human heart and sentience means that this inevitability is irrelevent in terms of the sanctity of life is a beautiful amalgamation of traditional morality and the existentialist emphasis on empirical experience  The difference between philosophical theory and philosophical practical  so to speak  A true classic   Well   I don t know where to begin    would it suffice to say that I really regret having not read it before   that won t be nearly enough  Amazing book  amazing characters  amazing conflicts     Somehow Dostoevsky just managed to capture every single feeling I would have felt were I in  Rodya s   place   every single small feeling in every single situation     Raskolnikov  and excuse my crappy spelling  wasn t a charming character  the man even had problems with seeing his mistake and insisted on that for a long time  he was utterly arrogant  utterly foolish   utterly human  you just had to end up dying to witness his  salvation  and his  redemption     and sorry for the cliche  happy ending  I especially loved his interactions with Sonia   their scenes were just    breathtaking SPOILER    Raskolnikov sat gazing  his thoughts passed into day dreams  into contemplation  he thought of nothing  but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him  Suddenly he found Sonia beside him  she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side  It was still quite early  the morning chill was still keen  She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl  her face still showed signs of illness  it was thinner and paler  She gave him a joyful smile of welcome  but held out her hand with her usual timidity  She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all  as though afraid he would repel it  He always took her hand as though with repugnance  always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit  Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved  But now their hands did not part  He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking  They were alone  no one had seen them  The guard had turned away for the time How it happened he did not know  But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet  He wept and threw his arms round her knees  For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale  She jumped up and looked at him trembling  But at the same moment she understood  and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes  She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come       They wanted to speak  but could not  tears stood in their eyes  They were both pale and thin  but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future  of a full resurrection into a new life  They were renewed by love  the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other They resolved to wait and be patient  They had another seven years to wait  and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them  But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being  while she  she only lived in his life  and another scene that I have to share but    well that s for another time      anyway    it s a must read so  yea  3 dstwyfsky hn bmthb  mHll nfsy  dktwr  w m shbh  yGwr fy   mq lnfs lbshry  lkhyWr  wlshryr     lmjrm hn yqtS ljrymth mn nfsh

livro    como se vc fosse ele  Muito bom  Amazing   Wonderful author  An unbelievably great book Supposedly this Pevear Volkhonsky edition is the best translation out there  I don t know about that but I can say that it certainly doesn t feel like you re reading a translation  Engrossing and poignant  the timeless struggles of the many colorful characters feel as relevant in modern time as they were 150 years ago when they were conceived I can t say enough great about this book  Definitely right up there with the best I ve ever read  Trying to review a book like Crime and Punishment is almost pointless  It s a classic for a reason  The story is amazing and the emotions described in the story are very real and relatable  Going in  I was a little afraid of the big Russian novel but now I can say for certain that I am no longer afraid  It was a great book to read  challenging at times but well worth it  as challenging things usually are  For those looking to challenge themselves or start reading classics  I recommend it  It s time consuming but you ll take a lot out of it   Providence has a pervading presence in Fyodor Dostoevsky s Crime and Punishment  It is a real presence in the story that has a real influence on the key characters  The word providence shows up all throughout the novel  It is evident that this was an important theme to Dostoevsky  Dostoevsky uses Raskolnikov to show how providence s presence can suffer and haunt a man s soul and mind  Providence appears as happenstance to Raskolnikov until it is personified in the life of his mother and sister  his lover Sonia  and mysteriously in Raskolnikov  Dostoevsky portrays a providence that works in unconventional ways to bring justice and win the heart of a murderer  Raskolnikov was not a repentant axe murderer  He was an enemy to God and humanity  Yet God  through the medium of providence  confronts Raskolnikov   It is accepted that providence could work in the life of remorseful murderer  Raskolnikov was no such man  for he did not regret his act of murder and constantly made attempts to rationalize his crime yet the work of providence unavoidable in his life  Providence is seen in three ways in Raskolnikov s life  in coincidence and being beyond suspicion  in using key characters temper his guilt  and in relinquishing his guilt by showing that there are holes in his rational   Providence is the evanescent earthly presence of God that is attributed to visible impressions that it leaves it behind in the form of coincidence  serendipity  or happenstance  Dostoevsky purposely made the providence ubiquitous in the life Raskolnikov to shows how far reaching is the love of God  The influence of providence was not limited to just Raskolnikov  It is seen his surrounding world of strangers and friends as well as the ethereal subconscious world of dreams    After struggling through the difficult lives the end was wonderful  Reading e book and listening to audio was helpful as was online resources to keep the names and identities straight  Dostoyevsky is incredible in his ability to portray characters the way that he does  Modern writers rely on more graphic detail to describe such characters   Raskolnikov  It s all about Raskolnikov  One of the most expertly crafted characters I recall reading  conficted from one hundred different angles  stricken with the most realistic and suspenseful paranoia  filled with hate and love simultaneously  and most of all  he acts like all of us might  It s not the easiest read in the world  but it s well worth it  I imagine reading it again will be with the greatest fondness and ease  Thanks Fyodor   One and a half century later the story still resonates  and human psychology has not changed a bit  This is the definition of a true classic   rwy   Zym  tj ln nnZr lljny  mn zwy   khr    l nSH lqD  bqr  hdhh lrwy   lnhm swf y nwn mm jmwd lnSwS lqnwny  b d qr  hdhh ltHf  lnsny      Klasiklerin klasigi  The last book I read that literally kept me up at night  flipping pages hungrily or worrying about what was happening to the characters when their narrative wasn t in my head  was One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest  Having begun Crime and Punishment only once before in my life  years ago in high school  and closing it because I wasn t connecting to the characters  I was happily surprised that C P became that new book on my second read through I feverishly read the book from cover to cover every moment I could  and it still wasn t enough  I wanted more  I wanted more of Raskolnikov s past  more of his inner thoughts and guilt    and more of how the pressures of his friends of and of society hung down on him Given the book s title  the entire plot revolves around Raskolnikov s murder  which could have easily been the pivotal point  the climax  but Dostoyevsky makes it happen right away so both we and Raskolnikov are left with the fall out  And what a journey that is  the madness  the guilt  the anger  the redemption  All is illustrated in Raskolnikov s actions and I couldn t get enough  Although there were parts of the novel that struck me as odd  especially in the way Dostoyevsky introduced new characters  they all came back around to a main point and adequately described Raskolnikov s inner turmoil I knew what was going to happen most of the book  spoiler alert    as a whole  it was a bit predictable  especially given Raskolnikov s frequent bouts of indecision about whether to come clean  I knew he would go to the police station eventually  whether on his own accord  dragged by someone else or maybe in death at someone else s hands  I didn t know how  but I knew he would be brought  to justice   But I did not see the reemergence of Svidrigailov coming at all  nor did I anticipate his confession to Sonia But despite surmising that the book would end in that general manner  I found myself wanting to dive deeper into Raskolnikov s head as his thoughts swirled around violently  I felt his illness and madness right after the murder  I felt his anguish and annoyance about his mother and sister  I felt his terror at being questioned or doubted  especially at Porfiry s hands   Dostoyevsky did a masterful job writing a character to whom it was easy to connect    despite the fact that he is a murderer  Raskolnikov as a character was perfect for describing the complexity of human nature when looking at criminals  especially  as his article in the law journal points out  That what was so fascinating to me reading along  hearing Raskolnikov describe his own thought process on his own and prompted by others  to come to a conclusion about what he needed to do C P was superb  highly recommended  I will need to let the book set a bit in my brain before I can go back and read it again and soak up everything I missed the first time  everything that ties it all back together   Raw gritty humanity mixed with questions about morality and redemption  What s not to like  Dostoyevsky hit it home with the characters in this one    makes me want to learn Russian  Ultimate masterpiece of the Russian literature  disregarding  War and Peace  by L  Tolstoy  because 4 800 page volumes are too much to handle     i dont know how many times i read this book  Que la vida es mas sencilla de lo que parece  A veces nos ahogamos o la pasamos mal por circunstancias de la vida  solo hay que tener fuerza para superar lo malo  Al final del tunel siempre habra una luz  The night I finished the book  I had a nightmare that I killed my own brother with a leatherman knife  He asked me why I was doing it  and I couldn t explain  didn t want him to ask  It was almost as if I couldn t control what I was doing  That s how creepy this book is  It s amazing though too  An absolute must read  Love this classic  Only Dostoyevsky can make you fall in love with a murderer  It took a while but I finally finished this book about a young man who commits a murder and the psychological torment he endures before finally confessing to the murder  It s a lot more than that with many subplots within the main plot  I liked this book but it was very long  So is it OK to commit a murder if you think you are making the world a better place  I say no  Such a well crafted story  so much more than I thought it would be  This is one of the few books of which I can truly say  it changed my life  Others can discuss the quality of the story  but for me its greatest power was that it held up a mirror and showed me what I was and what I could be  When it did that  I knew why I could not remain as I was   The first time I finished this book  I started over and read it again  I have since read it three more times  Can you tell I love it  I guess it s because the writing is so good  And the thought  And the characters  Beautiful narration  Excellent portraits of the characters  their lives and surroundings  As relevant as an insight into human mind as it was when written 150 years ago  I have said this a lot but it quite literally made me feel guilty and paranoid around the times I was reading it  I saw a police officer and my first thought was  oh shit  they know   Until a second later when I remembered that in fact I had committed zero murders   Brilliant   exposes the Russian soul  Las traducciones de Alianza suelen ser las mas ibericas de todas  De cualquier forma es mas legible que la de Catedra  Sigo prefiriendo las viejas traducciones de Bruguera  This was the first  Classic  I read beyond school  I loved it  though I agree with other reviewers the beginning was a little slow  I place C and P just below To Kill A Mockingbird  as my second favourite book of all time  Please read it  One of the  must reads  from highschool  But this one was remarkable enough to remember it for the rest of my life  This book is much better than all Agatha Christies books taken together  But it is just my own humble opinion    My favorite Dostoyevsky novel so far  I have read  Notes from the Underground  and  The Idiot   and I think this one has done the best job of depicting life in monarchist Russia  Although in no way historical  I love it for it s psychoanalysis of a desperate  self righteous university student who attempts to justify his crime  Similar to  Notes from the Underground  in terms of mental ambiguity  but a longer read  I suggest reading  Notes from the Underground  first to get a taste of this one   It is sort of ridiculous to give this book stars  This book is about  among other things  the uselessness  the stupidity  the insult to humanity that such things as star based rating systems reproduce  I only decided to re read this classic because my daughter is a big fan of the Manga series  Death Note  And she had read that Death Note is a re write of C P  Our whole family read Death Note last summer  and I found it to be more than a Japanese C P  in fact a lot more about the history of fascism in Japan than about the individual hubris of the main character  Light  But in re reading C P  I can see that Dostoevsky was precisely describing the qualities in humanity that lead to a kind of charismatic leadership necessary to fascism  What became interesting for me in that context  however  was the extreme isolation of Raskolnikov  He was never described as someone capable of leadership  He never was strong enough or confident enough to pull off the ultimate crime of eliminating a worthless human  And  in the end  when he recognizes his common humanity  it is presented as a kind of religious confirmation  the common humbleness of all humans before a greater power  which is never confirmed as God  but which is obviously represented as such through the personal devotion of Sonia  insofar as she seems to be like a nun   This aspect of C P struck me as less interesting than Death Note  In the manga  there is not a need to place the whole ethical conundrum in a religious context  The question is all about what human could possibly claim the right to judge the worth of other humans  to judge it so far as to claim the authority to kill them  That is still a deeply profound question  one we need to continue to ask ourselves as we watch the devastation rain down in Gaza  How does one write a review for this  How can one have the courage to put in words all the mayhem  the blood rattles  the slight glistening hope and a world in agitation  How can one go about doing that and feel he has done justice  This book is a psychological roller coaster  a journey into the gloomy halls of depression ever lengthening foreboding  delirium and anxiety  Layers upon layers of pure Russian genius  A profound study of human nature  from the pits of insanity to the heights of relief This has to be read O humans  P S  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  why u write so awesome   Simply the best novel I ve ever read It s brilliance lies in its timelessness  This pre Freudian psychological drama has all the tell tale requirements  Loss  madness  guilt  shame  tenderness and ultimately  a peculiar redemption  Though this book is said to be a redemption book  and it is in some respects  however redemption comes not from an epiphany  it comes from learning to see what is right in front of us  This novel took over a month to finish  Sometimes I had to take a break as the images burned into my psyche and  accordingly  I needed to allow the intense content to steep and to sink in  This is a book to be savored and treated with immense respect This is the first of my Russian  big books  that I ve read  I can truly understand their worth  I kept on saying to myself  how is it possible to write such an intense psychological novel in the mid 1800s Russia   For it reads like modern prose  if only we had authors commensurate to Dostoevsky to write the modern day equivalent  I suspect I ll end up re reading this  Though I did not have a clearer vision or understanding of Raskolnikov s motives by the end of the book  and though his actions were probably more dramatic than what most of us will do in any lifetime  I did see in his humanity  that lack of being able to predict consequences to actions  especialy negative ones  The selfish human nature that thinks  how unique I am  what do I need the rest of the world for  that common  nothing special world    In Rodion  in Sonya  even in Svidrigailov and Marmeladov  the lines of good and bad are blured  huge area of grayscale  How can one so generous be a murderer  How can such a sweet lady  daughter of a nice good for nothing drunk can become a street walker  How can a creep skirt chasser can do so much good for a bunch of unrelated orphans yet still not value his own life  Is it that people exist in parallel to others  yet don t realize how connected everyone is  how dependent we are to each other  Is it that we human beings  are so engrossed in our own little inner world that we forget to care  That we forget that we are nothing without others and that our very uniqueness is only what it it compared to other people s  Apparently  this novel is about redemtion  about salvation  about growth even  For me  it s a BIG jumble of questions on human nature  For a story this deep to touch me even deeper  I cannot thank Dostoyevsky enough    Or should I thank Raskolnikov  i read the book when it was  perhaps too soon and never could and wanted to get rid of its charming perspective of looking at those so called  criminals  raskolnicov is one of those guyes i will never call a fictional character the guy is my intimate friend i think he has done what i believe  beleived in for years but never dared to put into practice i relished in reading the book for three times and  surely i ii read it more than another three times   Completely agreed with Abby    C P is a masterpiece  an unforgettable tale of sin and redemption  it has everything in it for everyone  a psychological thriller  a classic tragedy  a crime detective novel  and to some extent a historical novel  The psychological insights Dostoevsky displayed here were beyond brilliant  Everything I read immediately after C P seems trivial and boring   Un retrato sicologico sorprendente Crime and Punishment is the epic tale of one man s misguided ideologies and his struggle to regain his humanity  When Raskolnikov  a bristly  edgy young intellectual  reasons his way into believing that the elimination of certain despicable individuals will make the lives of others infinitely better  he fails to calculate how his conscience will respond once a crime is carried out  Having resorted to a single murder  he is blindsided by the intense guilt and physical anguish the act inflicts on him  Burdened with grief and ailed with sickness  he begins his quest in search of forgiveness  absolution  and the sacrificial need to find redemption and grace  Dostoyevsky is masterful at probing what constitutes the human soul  What causes a person to snap while later causing him to regret  What forces compel an essentially good man towards committing an evil deed  Crime and Punishment stands at the pinnacle of literature in its attempt to understand how evil tempts us and how goodness regulates our morality  This novel is one that never diminishes in power and value for me  no matter how many times I read it  The emotional journey it captures and the wallop it delivers with its exploration of human frailty and dignity continues to overwhelm me with questions about what is the purpose of life  Why do we suffer  And what does it mean to have compassion  In Crime and Punishment  Dostoyevsky achieves the rarity of defining both the simultaneous horror and beauty that dwell within humanity   MP3 Narrated by George Guidall  English  As with all Dostoyevsky Novels  the characters remain with you long after you have completed reading the book  A dozen years after last reading it  I still vividly recollect the dramatis personae  the protagonist Raskolnikov  who is torn behind mind and heart  Sophia the prostitute with a heart of gold  Marmeladov  the former government servant who has destroyed himself with drink  the protagonist s friend Razumikhin  who serves as the voice of reason in Raskolnikov s life As with all novels of Dostoyevsky in his prime  Crime and Punishment is a multi layered novel  At one level its a thriller  a cat and mouse game between Raskolnikov and the wily police officer Porfiry Petrovitch  At another level  its a commentary on late 19th century Russian society  which was undergoing a tremendous socio economic transformation under the relatively liberal Tsar Alexdanr II after three decades of stagnation and iron fisted governance under Tsar Nikolai I  At another level  Crime and Punishment recounts the inner conflict of the protagonist Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov  A young student crushed by poverty  Raskolnikov plans to murder the greedy old pawn broker Alyona Ivanovna and use her ill gotten wealth to escape the desperate poverty in which he is living  His mind tell him that there s nothing wrong in killing a person who does no good to anyone  whose presence will make no difference to anyone  Yet somewhere deep down  his heart knows that logic apart  its a inherently wrong  immoral idea At yet another level  Crime and Punishment is also a tale of conflict between belief and atheism in a society where people were increasingly prone to rejection of God and religion to materialism and utilitarian thinking  Characteristically  Dostoyevsky presents both perspectives without taking sides  Its a testimony to the genius of Dostoyevsky  that a century and a half after it was first published in 1865  the central themes of Crime and Punishment still remain just as relevant  one of the best books i ve ever read in my life  What kind of person are you  What are the reactions to the complexities we create for ourselves and for others  It s like an encounter between the good and the evil that exists within us  within every man  And fear by knowing what you can do if ignore the social  brakes   Raskolnikov and his need to feel extraordinary versus his compassion  This book s title defines it s theme  though no words can begin to describe the brilliance and power of this work Dostoyevsky accomplishes much more than telling the tale of a murderer and his sentence  With a sympathetic voice he touches upon all sorts of destitution  of depravity  and of crime I think Dostoyevsky hits upon something that has escaped modern understanding  crime goes far beyond the physical action of murdering someone  or robbing them  or what have you  and the twins of punishment and retribution exist just as much in the murderer s mind as they do in prisons  His recounting of Marmelodov s selfish alcoholism  of Luzhin s narcissim  of Svidrigailov s depraved search of amusement  and finally of Raskolnikov s remorseless egotism is all at once enchanting and chilling  So completely enrapturing is his development of every character and his description of the fates that befall them  that one can t help but cry or gasp or stare at the page with mouth agape at some of the more provoking scenes My first attempt to read this book was unsuccessful  I dismissed it as boring  as trash  read the plot summary online just so I could spare myself the trouble of 522 pages of reading  And now  after reading the high strung drama  I can t help but scratch my head at how stupid or how blind I was at that time  to have missed the beauty of this novel This is among my favorite classic novels  and by far the best crime drama I ve ever read  or ever written  period    I feel my mind  my attitude  my very soul  has been enriched and uplifted through the reading of this novel As with every great novel I read  this one has left me in a state of wonder and ecstasy akin to intoxication   Mr  Dostoevsky asks the question of mercy  humanitarian treatment of criminals and human dcency in this powerful story about Russian society and its justice system  This is a must read classic  One of the best books ever  Read it for class I will be taking starting in January 2014  Much better than The Brothers K      the only other book by Dostoevsky that I have read  I really like 19th century Russian novels  I listened to the audible com edition read by George Guidall  When I first began reading this book  I did not like it  It was so    dark  This novel is really about a man who is from the Underground  He is lost within his own self  Reading it was frustrating and painful and depressing  But then it changed  And hope reared it s ugly head  And before I know what happened  I was on the edge of my seat  The book is amazing  When i finally laid it down  I got down on my knees  and literally wept over the darkness of my soul and the grace it took to deliver me  Hope barely rears her head    but what hope  Unquestionably one of the best books I ve read in a long time  I m honestly glad I didn t read it in school  but don t tell my freshman Lit teacher that  because I don t think I d have been ready at the time  I highly recommend this book to anyone with a passion for great literature  Just Fantastic  Though I haven t killed anyone  I am glad I didn t read this book until I was older  In fact  I am particularly glad that I waited to read it until moving to Kazakhstan where Dostoyevsky had served a prison term and met the love of his life  Of course  one might get a bit tired of Raskolnikov s endless fevers and moods  but the landscape of wonderfully various characters keeps him from becoming tiresome  To be fair  Rodion Romanovitch is dealing with a terrible situation  Funnily enough  I had an oddly short lived fever while reading this book  Though this novel has often been described as depressing  I found it very funny when the author makes fun of different schools of thought and human failings  If anything  the ending is unrealistically optimistic  I was thrilled to find a clue of how colonized societies can influence the literature of their colonizers in this novel  Allow me to explain  At the end of the novel  Raskolnikov is sitting on the bank of the Irtish River at his Siberian prison before getting to his morning s work  He hears singing and sees the tents of nomads across the river and is struck by the freedom they have  These nomads had to have been Kazakhs in Dostoyevsky s mind based on his experience  It is just after seeing this that his spirit is transformed  I don t think this juxtaposition is an accident  One of my absolute favorite novels of all time  although  considering its length   tome  seems a more fitting description   Crime and Punishment is the story of the young student Raskolnikov  and his descent into madness after the murder of a pawnbroker  to whom he s been forced to sell his beloved possessions  A story of guilt  anxiety and madness  this is NOT a  light  or  fun  read  Moreover  every character yes  literally EVERY character  not just the protagonist  has several names that they switch between throughout the story depending on the situation they find themselves in  In summary  Crime and Punishment is not an easy read  Not at all  But if you ever find enough time to truly give it a shot  I highly recommend this book  If I had to make a list of books that got under my skin  this would be number one  way above anything else  Do I want to write this  the idea of murder and that you may get carried away with that idea and actually do it is one that really got to me  The interrogation scenes often play out in different variations in my dreams  Unforgettable  I ve come to the conclusion that I just must love everything that s even been written by Russains  Crime and Punishment is thoroughly engrossing and I was held captive by every second of it  In retrospect  I wish I had bought a better translation  but still  this novel is good  This is a story that every person should read and be familiar with  Not all stories are written from the view of the  killer   the person most people come to think of as the antagonist  While the story is shown through the perspective of the killer  he is portrayed not as the antagonist but as the protagonist  The idea that the punishment received for a crime comes mostly from within oneself is an idea that I find interesting  and the writer develops the story through extensive use of setting and characterization  having particular characters act the way they do because of the environment that they live in  paralleling the idea that  we are what we live in     The novels of Dostoevsky are seething whirlpools  gyrating sandstorms  waterspouts which hiss and boil and suck us in  They are composed purely and wholly of the stuff of the soul  Against our wills we are drawn in  whirled round  blinded  suffocated  and at the same time filled with a giddy rapture  Out of Shakespeare there is no more excited reading     Virginia Woolf Dostoevsky seemed to be more honest than most of us in the struggle we all have between doing what we should and what we end up doing  After reading this  I was told Dostoevsky was a Christian and based the book on the 7th chapter of Romans  where this struggle is the central theme Very worthwhile book  Ho finito di leggere a giugno  Ho rimuginato tutta l estate su cosa dire  perche credo che questo sia uno di quei romanzi che ti lasciano senza parole  uno di quelli che puoi anche rileggerli per sempre e trovarci sempre qualcosa di nuovo  Io non ho nulla da dire su questo romanzo per il semplice fatto che il romanzo parla da solo a chi legge  Ci provo lo stesso Protagonista e Raskolnikov  giovane ex studente disagiato che per provare una sua personale teoria sugli uomini decide di uccidere una vecchia usuraia  presso cui egli stesso ha gia impegnato degli oggetti  Il testo presenta il giovane mentre si accinge al delitto e poi tutta il percorso di castigo  non tanto il castigo effettivo dei lavori forzati in Siberia  ma quello personale che pungola continuamente il protagonista  diventando una vera e propria malattia psicosomatica  In seguito al delitto  infatti  duplice  non per volonta del giovane   Raskolnikov inizia a non sentirsi fisicamente bene  ha piu volte la febbre e l idea di non farsi scoprire e non lasciare tracce lo ossessiona  In questo si vede tutta la grandezza di questo autore  perche se anche gli altri personaggi sono ben tratteggiati e caratterizzati e hanno tutti un ruolo ben preciso nell intera vicenda  e l animo del protagonista ad essere sondato in maniera incredibile  Persino nei sogni  e nei pensieri sconnessi  e nelle sensazioni fisiche che attraversano il giovane dall inizio alla fine  da prima del delitto  al durante  al dopo  quando e tutto un gioco di dissimulazioni e finzioni e contraddizioni con la polizia e in particolare Petrovic Se l analisi dello stato interiore del protagonista e di per se un gioiello e vale da sola la lettura  vedere quest analisi nel rapporto con gli altri personaggi e nella descrizione stessa delle altre persone che girano intorno a Raskolnikov rende il quadro completo e fa di tutto questo un capolavoro vero e proprio  Ognuno  come dicevo  ha un ruolo ben preciso  e la sua rappresentazione puo anche essere vista come una critica piu o meno nascosta alla societa russa del tempo  ognuno ha un tratto che lo caratterizza e che lo mette in contrapposizione agli altri  facendone risplendere le luci o risaltare le ombre e riuscendo in questo modo a far comprendere al lettore le caratteristiche degli uni e degli altri proprio attraverso la loro interazione Io credo che si potrebbe parlare di tutto questo per giorni e ancora non si sarebbe riusciti a dire tutto  Credo che questo sia uno di quei romanzi che parlarne non serve  devi leggerlo per capirlo  E  lungo  E  un po  lento  e a tratti non capisci il perche di quella scena ma poi torna tutto  alla fine  E finisce che lo hai divorato in molto meno tempo di quel che credevi necessario  con la voglia di rileggerlo perche sai che ti e sfuggito qualcosa  e troppo immenso per averlo compreso tutto e subito Provate  ne vale la pena sul serio  always worth rereading  detective story   psychological exploration of human nature  woven through with reality and stream of consciousness  well   as Jack Benny would say  what more could a reader ask for       Cautivador  una vez leida la primera pagina ya no lo podes soltar  Trama dinamica  llena de realismo y belleza  especialmente resaltable lo logrado de los personajes y la capacidad del autor para meterse en la psiquis de cada uno  y describir los escenarios y los ambientes en los que transcurre la historia  Relectura obligatoria  This book gave me nightmares  It AFFECTED me more than most all other books  It drags you down with it and gives you depressing thoughts  It s kind of like torture to get through  especially the 2 page long paragraphs haha   I liked all of this for some reason and so it gets a 5 My dad saw what this book did to me and read it after I did and had the same things happen to him  This book bonded us together in this weird way that I think is awesome haha  No one else in our family understands our weird love for this book    Fyodor Dostoyevsky was not only a story teller but also a philosopher and a psychologist    The mind in its own place and by itself can create a hell of heaven and a heaven of hell  JOHN MILTON  Crime and punishment is all about what John Milton depicted in his sayings I appreciate and always prone to read FYODOR DOSTOYEVSKY  I was feeling like such a hipster when I picked up Dostoyevski  but I had been aching for a quality read and I felt it was a good time to try russian literature  And boy did it deliver  Terribly gripping and from the moment you open the book it lays a claim on your thoughts and mood  I would not go as far as to say that reading it is a form of self torturing  but you do have to consider your dosage  About halfway through I almost put it away out of self preservation  Haven t been having the best of times myself lately and it felt like I wasn t doing the cause any good  Especially because while reading you get the ominous sensation that there s not going to be any light at the end of the tunnel  But the fact that it can do this to you through mere printed text alone makes it worth reading  But aside from that it is also beautifully written and not even as haughty as I expected it to be  Just very vivid and empathic Absolute must read  Ugh  so good This guy could have saved 7 years of his life  He was in the clear but his inner man couldn t deal  One of the most humane and emotion awakening books I have ever read  This edition is hailed as the best translation ever  and the two have done many other Dostoevsky works  There was also a very perspicuous introduction by Pevear which analyzed some of the more vague passages  and the whole was annotated  all of which helped my understanding immensely  Just one minor example  knowing that Raskolnikov is named after  raskolnik   meaning schismatic  sheds quite a bit of light of Dostoevsky s intention in laying out his character  I would have to say that the novel is one of the best I ve ever read  I began it many months ago  with long breaks between beginning and finishing it  which is probably not the best way to read such a complex book  but there it is  The novel has at least three plots and many levels of meaning  It doesn t just deal with a murder and a detective s psychological intimidation of Raskolnikov  Dostoevsky s characters offer opinions on the issues of the day  they embrace ideologies that were in vogue at the time  parodying them simply by the nature of their own personas  there are romances  other deaths  two methodical  selfish villains  symbolism through dream and vision  and so on  The author laughs at reason  nature and law  Reason fails Raskolnikov and doesn t help Porfiry  the detective  Everyone makes his own plan  carves out his own existence and scoffs at precedent  This existentialism is not certain  it helps Porfiry  but fails Raskolnikov  and drives Svidrigailov  the lecher who attempts to conquer Roskolnikov s sister  to suicide  A great  towering  multi layered book  one that I will have to read again in the future  dstywfsky   kl bTl wD  lGy  wHkm      br  dstywfsky fy Slh llqry  b slwb sls shl  l  lrGm mn  dd lSfHt lkbyr l   nh tstHwdh  l  msh rk w  qlk Ht

although there many ways to review Crime and Punishment  it s style  structure  characters   I will limit myself to brief commentary on the  deeper messages  in the novel  Even here  one could think about the novel forever  and make all sorts of connections with other thinkers  The fact that there is so much that could be said is what makes the book interesting  When a work is consistently read for over a century  there is a reflexive tendency to say that the work is  transcendent   that it captures something about the human condition that cuts across place  time  and culture  In reality  this reflex is probably only partly true  The artist s personality and socioeconomic status  as well as broader sociological factors  likely also play a role in determining what is remembered and what is forgotten  But  in Crime and Punishment  reflexive  transcendence  seems to ring truer than usual  I say this partly because of Dostoevsky s biographical history  Poverty  prison  near political execution  epilepsy  A man who faced considerable obstacles  although he seemed to be passionate and driven  Moreover  the work is  arguably  the conclusion of the novel notwithstanding  critical of Christianity and key characters are less than sympathetic  as is the case in much of Dostoevsky s work   Basically  it is hard to imagine that the book s message resonated with most 19th century Russians  Yet  the book lasted  There must be something  deeper   Certainly  Crime and Punishment addresses personal morality  What makes a person immoral  If someone is immoral  then what can they do to redeem themselves  These questions play out in the novel largely through Raskolnikov s introspections and unpredictable behaviors  An important idea presented at several points in the novel is the  superman  thesis  introduced through second hand description of an intellectual article written by Raskolnikov  By this argument  there are persons who  by virtue of their greatness  transcend good and evil  they stand aloft from conventional morality  It is partly aspirations of greatness that leads Raskolnikov to kill  I found myself wondering about the historical antecedents and consequents of this idea  I know Nietsche wrote of an  ubermensch   I will have to revisit Nietzsche  Also  in a case of  life imitates art   there is the Leopold and Loeb murder case in Chicago  in which two affluent youth premeditatively kill a young boy on philosophical grounds similar to Raskolnikov s  At least three films were made about this murder case  including a Hitchcock film   Loved this book so much I read it twice  once in college and once when I was living and working in Tokyo  The first time I read it it took me forever because I kept going back trying to find dates or names or facts I thought I had forgotten  Only when I got to the last pages did I see that Dostoevsky ties up all of the loose ends at the end of his book   Ako mozhekh bikh dala 6 ot 5  Neveroiatna e  Well  If I were one of those novelists who shaped the consciousness of humanity over the last two centuries  I would certainly have been him  Dostoyevsky I mean  If all literature revolves about the sublimacy of humanity  Fyodor s revolves about humanity as an incarnation of divinity  For Fyodor  no humanity is even possible without God  Constance Garnett is a wonderful translator indeed and he made an excellent job here with the Russian text transforming it into the multi colored rich English text that we read here Definitely  Crime and Punishment  is a sacred book  just like  Karamazov Brothers   La mas angustiante muestra de humanidad  encarnada en el personaje de Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov  Tremenda novela psicologica  La voluntad de poder  El animo de ser libre   y el desenlace de romper con las normas   I loved the overarching message of this book  that we can never really find peace until we come clean and accept responsibility for our mistakes and the consequences of our choices  It s easy to see why it s a classic  Brilliant  dark and incisive novel with an eccentric cast of characters  The supporting characters are every bit as crazy and colorful as the protagonist  His uniquely beautiful  headstrong sister  his loving mother  Razumukhin  the smart Poirotian detective Porfiry  the very gray Svidrigailov  Sonya  the tragic K Ivanovna  I can only confess to disliking Luzhin and even he was an admirable piece of work My first Dostoyevsky book  I half read Notes from the Underground in high school  which didn t appeal to me back then Looking forward to reading more of Dostoyevsky  Having substituted English surnames for the Russian ones  so I didn t have to keep re pronouncing them I found this book a joy to read  I don t know much about Russia or their history  only the big stuff but now I want to find out more I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book  it wasn t the chore I believed it was going to be  I just cast aside all pre judgements and went with it  I didn t try to work out what was happening or what might happen  I just let it happen and let Dostoyevsky do all the work and  oh  how he worked Superb  I am really liking this incredible Dostoievski story  The characters seem very real to me  At this moment I m on page 270 from my brazilian edition and Raskolnikov is having an stressful conversation with his sister about her wedding   I feel like I AM there watching the whole conversation  The way he writes really gets my attention  I   m also reading about how Nietzche was inspired by Dostoievsk s books and ideas when he wrote about the Superman on Zarathustra   I highly recommend readers who like philosophy to read about this too  I   m getting crazy   This is the best book I ve read so far  lst mlk l n qwl nh blf l rwyh ry  h tstHq

hard to read because it is so complex and psychological but it is also a brilliant understanding of human nature  I was totally amazed  The way Dostoyevsky shows you the emotional states of his characters is unbelievably beautiful and there is no one in the world who did it better than him  It was like as if I was with Raskolnikov  who left me speechless and breathless many times  watching him from somewhere very close  seeing the way he struggles  sharing the feeling of somebody having done something so bad that he can t talk to anybody  Everytime I think about that book I can t stop thinking about how I enjoyed being inside the dark depths of his mind  The character development in this novel is truly amazing  This book is a masterpiece  It was the reason I started reading all of Dostoyevsky s books and it was one of those rare books that ended up making such a big impression on me  I can see why it has been so celebrated as a great  timeless work  Read this book when I was 17  and I ve been in love with Russian lit ever since  I was afraid to reread it and perhaps be disappointed  after all  how could it live up to my memory of it  But  at 40  I must say that I find this story even more frightening  anguished and wonderful than I remembered it  So much emotion poured into the pages  so much raw humanity  so much fear and love and moral incertitude    I believe people will be reading Dostoyevsky many centuries from now  and that Crime and Punishment will haunt and taunt writers with its unparalelled terror and beauty   Ten years ago I listened to C P on audiotape  It was Christmas break  I was alone  and I was determined to  get through  this book  Instead  I was fascinated by it  so fascinated I did little else that week except sit on the floor  listening intently  This year I finally read the novel with the same measure of awe as when I listened to that first tape ten years back  Crime and Punishment is for me the most compelling psychological fiction I have ever read  The P V version is highly accessible and highly recommended   Just finished it  It s a classic text and the translation of this edition was perfect  All the characters were captivating  but the whole message this Russian bastard is trying to shove down the reader s throat is profoundly reactionary  It s basically a healthy attack on dangerous of rationalism and everything else the Enlightenment has bestowed upon human civilization  Among the greatest works of literature ever  regardless   Never studied it formally  whipped through it in a frenzy  Ate it up  Circularity  polemicism      rich symbolism and fascinating characterization  Need to wallow in it once more  if for no other reason than to watch the cat and mouse between Raskolnikov and Petrovich   See how I still remember their names  Doesn t that say something about my erudition  No  not remotely   Brilliant book that can be read in so many ways  crime novel  psychological drama  history and more   Simply one of the greatest novels ever written  If you ever want to begin reading something by Dostoevsky this is the place to start  The translation is good  it is easy to read and to follow unlike some of the others that are involved and have a lot of dialogue and difficult to follow sometimes like  The Idiot  and  The Possessed   Talk about a cat and mouse game and psychology this is the story that you must read  you must buy and add it to your collection this is simply one of the best novels ever written  The Russian film version holds true to the novel also  meraviglioso  Friggin amazing  the way he writes is so much extreme detail that half the time I almost forgot what he was describing  but once i finished the description it hit me like a ton of bricks and my mind was seriously blown  The twists and the way the characters acted was great  a little theatrical like a Shakespearian play but nonetheless great  I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy a fiction with great detail and interesting philosophical and psychological scenarios    There is no happiness in comfort  happiness is bought with suffering Man is not born for happiness  Man earns his happiness  and always by suffering  Fyodor Dostoevsky   the notebooks for Crime and Punishment I wish I could say  just read it  and magically plop this book into readers  hands  I guess everything that can be said has been said about it  except  at the end  if you read it closely  it s quite sinister  Szeretem Dosztojevszkijt  szeretem ezt a konyvet  megis meg csak harmadszor vettem a kezembe  eloszor  mert kotelezo volt  masodszor  mert felizgatta a fantaziam egy kabaretrefa  ahol kedvenc Colombo hadnagyommal kozoltek  hogy ot is csak loptak  meghozza a Bun es bunhodesbol  Muszaj volt

lehet atszaladni  ezt olvasni kell  elmerulni benne  megkonnyezni  szo szerint cseppenkent izlelgetni  Crime and Punishment is a misplaced title  It gives a false impression that Dostoyevsky divided the story into two halves for crime and punishment  The crime  that is the murder of an old pawn lady  was swiftly but unceremonially executed in Part 1  with the remaining parts devoted to spiritual self tormenting of Raskolnikov  the murderer and the protagonist of the story  Two subplots revolve around the murder  Before he finally decided to carry out the murder  he met Marmeladov  a drunkard who wasted himself away and ruined his family by his alcoholism  To support his drinking  he stole everything in the household  including Katerina Ivanovna  his wife  s last savings for their starving children  and passively encouraged his daughter  Sonya  to go for prostitution  Family tragedy ensued  The second subplot centres on Raskolnikov s family who recently arrived from countryside to St  Petersburg  Dunya  Raskolnikov s sister  was engaged to Luzhin  a moderately wealthy man whose dream  by the way  was to marry a destitute woman in order to control her and to have someone to idolize him  Simultaneously Svidrigailov  the wealthy gentry with an infamous reputation  also arrived to St  Petersburg with an evil design for the beautiful Dunya Raskolnikov fantasized himself as Napoleon   a superman who is above the ordinary mankind  His murder was the first step of his greatness because he can snatch the money for a yet greater cause  He could also prove himself as being an extraordinary human  He is destined to fall because a true Napoleon would not theorize so much  He would have simply committed the deed and gone on his way  Svidrigailov is a more interesting character  Like Luzhin  he pursued Dunya but with more thought and better skills  It was rumored that he killed his own wife but it was certain that he lured many a young girl and then deserted them  He almost succeeded when he entrapped Dunya but he gave up at the last second  Unlike Raskolnikov  Svidrigailov is a man of action  All the characters came under the sick influence of the Dickensian St  Petersburg  Neither the Winter Palace nor the grand avenues of the Nevsky Prospekt were mentioned  What Dostoyevsky described minutely instead was the dirty tenements or narrow pavements  The people were the drunkards  peasants and vagabonds  The grand and classical St  Petersburg became a morbid industrial place that exercised an evil influence on all the characters  Dostoyevsky brilliantly portrayed a vast array of characters  We have the deranged Raskolnikov  innocent Sonya  noble Dunya  devoted Pulcheria Alexandrovna  passionate Razumikhin  hypocritical Luzhin  evil Svidrigailov and dignified Katerina Ivanovna  They have their own features but did not fail to retain their human dimensions  Dostoyevsky  however  relied too much on chance and as a result  the story quickly became melodramatic  By chance Luzhin lived beside the Marmeladov family  so that he can play his trick  It was also a coincidence that Svidrigailov lived right beside Sonya and could therefore eavesdrop the conversations between her and Raskolnikov  Eavesdropping itself is a cheap device that is much seen in nowadays soap drama  I also found the didactic style of writing artistically flawed  Dostoyevsky has already shown his characters brilliantly  There is no more point in spending long passages in describing their psychology  The whole book could be cut down a third without them  Crime and Punishment is a huge book and I am glad I have read it  It was a painful exercise because reading a thick book is to develop a deep relationship with the characters  The intensity of the whole enterprise left me in exhaustion and I better read some non fictions to calm down   The book makes the reader deeply understand Dostoyevsky s greatness not because it is his best work  but because it isn t  It isn t his best work and yet its greatness goes beyond imagination  The deep understanding that the author has of the human mind and emotions overflows from the lines of  Crime and Punishment   Darker than other works by him  the rhythm and story line are highly intense and sometimes overwhelming  The human capability of self torture is described in such a precise manner that it sometimes is disturbing  In this regard  I often found myself comparing the bursting feelings to those I felt reading Kafka s  The Process   The description of fear and  mostly  of the human tendency to succumb to it is equally strong  The obsession is transferred from the character to the reader  it s almost painful  The only other work which I found describes the obsession created by fear as well as  Crime and Punishment  does is  Angst  by Zweig  even though the settings are completely different Dostoyevsky in this book presents a very interesting take on the matter of right and wrong  on the real meaning of them and the frivolousness of their definitions given by laws or habits  instead of being taken directly from the purity of loving and caring feelings   This is one of my summer re reads for this year  Every year in the summer I re read something  This summer it will be three books from Russian authors that I read years ago  So far Dostoevsky is as great a writer  still  as I remembered him RE READfinished this the second time  I agree with my first reading from back in college  It is quite an eye opener  and different scenes from it spring to mind at random moments  A very philosophical and deep book  The characters are more symbolical but yet believable  The book starts of a little slow but after getting used to Dostoyevsky s style and the suspension starts to rise it is a very enjoyable and at times even mind blowing read  This is and forever will be a classic  and it s easy to see why  The philosophies are profound  the writing is masterful  and the story itself is tense and so psychologically real that it frightened me sometimes  This is one of those classics that gets people hooked on classics Another good thing about this book is that it s fairly accessible  The Brothers Karamazov is much more ambitious than this book and a little harder to dig into  so this is a good place to start if you re looking into the Russian classics  Excellent book  The main character is constantly tied up in his own thoughts about what is right and wrong  and yet living life as though   no matter what his conclusion is upon any given action   thats life  Easier read than I anticipated  but would read again for sure  Let me say this first  if the main character had been anybody but Raskolnikov  the book would have fallen short  I am either a really horrible person or a very non judgmental one  because I found him to be one of the greatest characters I have ever encountered in all my years of reading  Not once did I feel repulsed by him   all of that repulsion was saved for characters such as Luzhin and Svidrigailov  But  I suppose  the fact that I felt such deep affection for Raskolnikov speaks volumes about this novel  It challenges you in that it makes you think about what really makes a man a murderer  It also forces you to question whether or not guilt induced suffering is punishment enough for a murder  If anything  you should pick up this book if only to read the scene where Raskolnikov asks   Mama  whatever happens  whatever you hear about me  whatever they tell you about me  will you still love me as you do now   That line alone made the book for me   it instantly helped me to get a firm hold on Raskolnikov s character and I was finally one hundred percent convinced that Raskolnikov isn t a murderer at all   he s just a man who happened to kill somebody  And  as this novel helps you to realize  those two things are not the same at all  I loved this book for it s look into the deep intentions of humans  What makes us good or what makes us bad  More importantly  it always made me wonder whether we really can change our inner selves    whether our actions are a product of our intentions or our intentions are a product of our actions  It took me a while to finish it  but it was worth it   I m not sure I understood it fully  but i enjoyed reading it   My copy of Crime and Punishment honestly looks like it s been through a war  I have read it so often  There are only a few books that I can claim completely changed the way I thought  and this is definitely one of those  This is the first Dostoyevsky novel I ever read  and it has stayed my favorite  sorry Brothers Karamazov    This is a masterpiece    Oh  Rasky         You idiot  Spoilers ahead    Damn  I felt Raskolnikov s anxiety  I resented his mother when he did and I loved her when he did  I felt sick at the thought of Luzhin or Svidrigailov getting their hooks in dear Dunya  shout out to Dunya   I wanted Porfiry to just accuse him  already  I guess I m saying that Dostoevsky managed to make a very real character that I believed enough to mentally and physically align myself with while reading  This is what ultimately kept me turning the pages    I find it a miracle that I liked Raskolnikov  His personality  at least that suggested in the character s essay On Crime  isn t one that I tend to sympathize with  The scholar who thinks he s a super human and therefore above or aside from others is someone who I want to punch in the nuts  normally  A complete lack of humility is not sexy  I liked him  anyway  I think we weren t seeing him at his finest  and the way that Dunya and his mother and that swell chap Razumikhin loved him suggested so    What was up with Sonya  Why was she so good  Why did she love him and follow him to Siberia  DANG  I ve always had a soft spot for the wounded and or pathetic men of the world  so I m familiar with this theme  but still  But still  STILL  goodreaders  How could Sonya be that good    Speaking of o_O  what was up with all the madness and dizziness and delirium in this book   I ve known people in pretty distressing situations and tragic despair   and they didn t immediately get a fever  Was there some sort of Russian virus that lay dormant until stress levels rose  There must ve been because it sent Raskol into delirium where he shouted out murder clues in his sleep  killed Katerina Ivanovna  though  to be fair  she was dying  anyway   caused Dunya to betray her brother to her mother while sleeping   She was raving    and then finally killed his poor mother after a few years of being batshit  O_o    I find Dostoevsky s personal story  weaved in with Raskolnikov s  to be very interesting  and I appreciated the translator s endnotes that helped me piece these together  I would like to read more about him before reading  Notes from Underground     My favorite moment was when he was serving hard time and realized he loved Sonya  Maybe this makes me a sap  but it was such a relief to know that he could feel  again  The other prisoners hated him less after that  which makes all the sense in the world  We were talking about getting into arguments with teachers over lunch the other day and it reminded me of Crime and Punishment  which I read in college  I loved the novel  but I hated the epilogue where he suddenly finds religion in a totally inplausible and out of character way  I made the thesis of my paper that the epilogue was tacked on to placate religious types and shouldn t be considered part of the original work  My very devout professor did not agree    I never thought that I am going to fall in love with this book and its writer  I first read it when I was younger and never really understood Dostoevsky s words at that time   I think I just shrugged my shoulders  put down the book and eventually returned it to the school library the next day  Years after  with so many books that came my way  I completely forgot everything about it  Until one day  the book found me again    at the bookstore  while checking out materials that I can read  My eyes accidentally caught a trade copy on bargain by a new translators  Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky  I tried to recall its plot but I guess my mind simply removed it from my mind literally after reading it years ago  I thought about it   and I thought about it more    I cant decide whether to purchase it or not  I roamed around the other shelves for a long time and decided that if I cant find any other book to buy  I was to buy it and so it happened  I bought the book and carried with me  thinking if I made a good purchase  The book remained in my shelf for days  I totally ignored it and was not excited to bury myself into Dostoevsky s words  One sleepless night  lost in my own thoughts  with nothing else to do or read  I remember the book and took it out of the shelf  The moment I decided to read it  I simply didnt put it down anymore  Dostoevsky left me spellbound  I totally lost myself into his words  His philosophies seemed to trigger something in my heart that were not there before  Somehow from his words  I understood something about life and our connection to the Divine  about destiny and the roles we were required to play  about eternal understanding and forgiveness to know and accept all  His thought provoking analysis  mind gripping scenes and characters that seemed to leap out of the pages blended so well together that I considered myself fortunate to have seen a glimpse of his genius  The book has altered my life  Its influence is so great that it instilled in me wisdom that is beyond this world  It changes the way I see LIFE  things  people around me  It even reunited me with God  I can thereby say that the book found me  just at the right time when I needed a change in my own life  Amazing storyThe classic tale of a young man s descent into debauchery  murder  and evil  His grandiose schemes and reasonings fail in the face of his grief and guilt  He is overcome by his own mind and   well  read the book  Sin lugar a dudad este es uno de los mejores libros que he leido  Bowled over by the genius of Dostoyevsky  Brilliant characterization  Hoping to write a longer review of  or atleast a compilation of my favorite lines from  this great novel Update   Here is my review   http   adarsh89 blogspot com 2014 07     this book is not about the thrill and suspense of a murder instead it s about what goes through the mind of a person when he commits a crime  the story is about roskolnikov who drops out of college because of financial instability  after that an idea grows into his mind regarding how some people are exceptional and the laws made by us are not applicable to them  they are a separate class of people and are allowed to commit a small crime because they are doing good on a much broader scale and giving something magnificent to the society and this idea leads to a cruel murder of a prawn broker and her daughter and what follows is an epic book on psychology of a criminal  Crime and Punishment is sweet  It is the first book I read where I see so much more symbolism than any review or person has described  It makes me feel as if Dostoevsky sent a message that nobody could understand  but me    This book showed to me the power of irony in the art of tear upppage  the book RIPS apart nihilism and  Ubermensch  to pieces  As Tolstoy said   Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal   Tolstoy had The Brother s Karamazov on his deathbed on his death  If you like any of the crazy Russians  hit up the other one too  different styles  both solid choicesIt makes me wanna go to Russia with a pocket full of rubles and cowpecks  and learn the language  The only quarrel i had was that I m not sure that the epilogue was umm  appropriate   this is still my favourite book to date  i was floored from beginning to end by dostoyevsky s writing  simply put  this is one of the most brilliant pieces of literature about one of the most gruesome subjects   murder  and its psychological impact on the mind  I first read the Constance Garnet translation with the Fritz Eichenberg illustrations  I understand the more recent translations have received praise for accuracy and fidelity to the original manuscript but I loved this version and the illustrations  wood block prints  are haunting and accomplished and remain with me to this day   great book that show a accurate picture of Russia in 19th century  Love  aristocracy  womens righs and money problams  all is shown in this book by the great Dostoyevky  This has been one of my favorite books for over a decade  I go back to certain parts of it over and over again  because I love the amount of detail that Dostoevsky covered when crafting Raskolnikov s neurosis  On the one hand the book is a very specific description of life in an unstable St Petersburg in the 1860s  post land reform and struggling with the new  isms of the day  socialism  capitalism  nihilism  On the other hand it s a story that anticipates the modern psychological thriller as the main character Raskolnikov suffers a mental breakdown that both causes and is caused by his murder of an old woman and her forgotten sister  The frenetic pace makes it mostly a compelling read  but not always  And the epilogue feels like a wasted addendum  awesome  had some relationships great psychological book  can t believe took me this long to read it  Become a sun  and then everyone will see you  Crime and Punishment is far too complex for me to be able to say a lot of smart things about it  I ve personally got a lot out of it however  and I can highly recommend it  It s by no means an easy read  but I knew that going in  and was not disappointed in the least Crime and Punishment is a gripping  intelligent  and masterful literary work  and I am very glad I pulled myself together  and gave it a chance  The psychological torment of a murderer20 September 2014 While the title can be a little misleading  the actual form that the punishment takes in this novel is the psychological effect of the guilty mind  The social punishment that the protagonist  Raskolnikov  undergoes appears only in the epilogue  where he is sentenced to eight years in a penal colony in Siberia  though we are given a glimpse of some of the hardships that he undergoes  However  the true punishment that the novel explores is the unmitigated guilt that dominates Raskolnikov s mind and the physical sickness that results  I am not sure if I can add anything further to my commentary that Jonathon has not covered in his review but since I have gone to the trouble of reading this  in a word  awesome example of literature  I feel that I should at least make an attempt  In fact  as I glance through some of the other reviews  such as Jason s  I even wonder if anybody can truly write more than a couple of lines  though I have noticed that wikipedia has a pretty decent write up that does a very good job of exploring the themes and motifs of this book   I read somewhere that the story begins with the perfect crime  however  for some reason  I can never picture an axe murder being a  perfect crime   Maybe it has something to do with the modern perception of axe murderers  something that does not necessarily seem to fit our protagonist  While on the outside it seems that the murder of the pawnbroker is  in a way  perfect  one thing Dostoyevsky seems to insinuate is that Raskolnikov could not escape the guilt that had come about because of his actions  Okay  he begins by attempting to justify his actions   sort of a Robin Hood scenario where he kills a rich miser with the intention of distributing her money to the poor  but as it comes out this never happens  In fact the money that he does find  and he doesn t get all that much money from her in the first place  spends the entire novel hidden under a rock  Even then  with the whole idea of a Robin Hood style crime  I sometimes wonder if we  as humans  are ever able to overcome our greed by willingly distributing our ill gotten gains  Much of the novel involves the investigation of the murder and the detective  Porfiry Petrovich  has a hunch in relation to who the murderer is  though he does not have any solid proof  It is not so much his investigation that is the focus of the novel but rather Raskolnikov s response to the investigation  He knows he is guilty  and this guilt is burning up inside of him  but another aspect is holding him back from confessing  the fear of the social punishment that he must face if he confesses  That is the catch  while he refuses to confess he undergoes a psychological punishment which in and of itself is much greater than any social punishment he can endure  It seems that this psychological aspect even prevents Raskolnikov from killing himself  It is clear that Dostoyevky s Christianity comes out in this book  especially with the reference to the story of Lazarus  In that story Lazarus dies and Jesus comes along and brings him back from the dead  While Lazarus died simply because he was mortal  Dostoyevsky seems to suggest that we all undergo some form of death  and while we are encased in that death we live in torment  It is only through the redemptive power of Christ that we are able to escape from that torment  as is reflective in the story when Jesus calls Lazarus back from the dead  Rostkolnikov clearly takes the role of Lazarus  and it appears that it is Sonya that is the Christ figure in the novel  Sonya is the first person to whom Roskolnikov confesses  and when he finally confesses to Petrovich and is sentenced to eight years in Siberia  Sonya travels with him as a reflection that Christ will also travel with us once he has released us from our bondage  Anyway  that is enough of the Christian allusions in the novel because I wanted to explore something else  the idea of the guilty mind  Here Dostoyevsky connects the guilty mind with the act of murder  and a pretty gruesome murder at that  but sometimes I wonder whether he actually understands the reality of the situation  The reason I say that is because there are murderers out there that do not seem to be effected by the guilty mind  and with that I point to individuals such as Charles Manson and Ted Bundy  They seemed to be able to kill people yet feel no guilt with regards to their actions  Yet  on the other hand  we have soldiers who are given an authority to kill by their respective governments yet suffer immense psychological trauma when they attempt to return to civilian life from war  This phenomena is explored not only in Greek literature  such as Heracles Furens but also in a modern literature  such as Achilles in Vietnam  though the second book does draw upon the Illiad   In speculating on this I do not want to go down the road of the street corner drug dealers  or those who commit property crimes such as frauds or burglaries  because those crimes do not seem to have the same effect on the psyche as a murder  though this is not necessarily always the case because I have known people who have been shoplifters and have been so overwhelmed with guilt that they have confessed to the owner of the shop   Some have suggested that a part of human nature is repulsed at the killing of another human being  which is what I suspect Dostoyevski is exploring here  because it is not so much the theft that is of concern  but the fact that Roskolnikov murdered the owner of the money with an ax  Anyway  that is probably enough of Dostoyevski for the time being  other than the bookclub on Sunday   though I still intend on reading some of his other works  such as The Gambler  The Brothers Karamazov  The Idiot  and of course Notes from the Underground   Cosa dire di questo libro che non sia stato ancora detto  Ovviamente Delitto e castigo e un capolavoro  ovviamente e uno dei libri da leggere assolutamente nella vita  ovviamente     ovviamente    Un po  meno ovviamente e un libro estremamente moderno  con la sua analisi profondamente psicanalitica delle ragioni e dei comportamenti di un assassino  delle sue interazioni con gli altri  le sue ragioni e i suoi sconvolgimenti  interiori ed esteriori Perche Rodia uccide per sentirsi diverso  per entrare a far parte dei superuomini  convinto che l atto quantitativo dell omicidio possa trasformarlo qualitativamente Ma Rodia e solo un bravo ragazzo  esaltato e confuso  sovraeecitato da una sorta di febbre nervosa  e tutti lo sanno  compreso il poliziotto  modernissimo  ci si potrebbe costruire una fiction televisiva come su Montalbano  che lo indurra a costituirsi Oltre a Rocia  ci sono infiniti altri personaggi in questo romanzo  uno piu interessante dell altro  con psicologie cosi complesse che ciascuno potrebbe essere protagonista di una propria storia  ma questa e una recensione  non un romanzo sul romanzo      AMAZING  I really enjoyed this book  It s a murder story told from a murderer s point of view  Fascinating investigation of forces that impel a man toward sin  suffering  and grace  Dostoevsky is a superb writer  top notch literature  long but consistent Wow  I totally understand why this is a classic  He had me from the first page  I was in the process of trying to read War and Peace  and still hope to  but I gave up and grabbed this one  They are both writteen by Russian  right  How different could they be  Anyhow   glad I did  Would love to talk about it with others who have read it   I know the Russian names are hard to keep straight but it s worth it for this classic  Who else but a great writer like Dostoevsky can make you feel empathize with someone and almost feel like you can justify them   for committing a brutal murder  ykhy z an khtb hyy khh Htm byd khwnd nykh shhkhr mdrn    khyly mdrn I love this book  It s genius  The nature of a criminal is studied and made into a complex story of extraordinary people who can kill without conscience  I fully recommend it  it captures the attention and truly is compelling   THis book is wonderful  So much detail about the minds of murderers and a glimpse into the desperate motives behind crimes committed by those forgotten members of society  the truly poor  Set in pre Marxist Russia   more later  br   khlS  ldystwyfysky fy twSyf khljt lshkhSyt w msh rh w mknwnth Ht  ltHsaW  nk m h t ysh lHZ  lmshhd m yZhr fqh dystwyfsky b lm lnfs w ynmuW  n br   w  bqry

16 more times Everything about this book is perfect I honestly don t know what else to say in the face of such perfection  This book is not what I expected it be  It is sad but very comical  In fact  some time it is so sad that it is comical  But it s realism is not marred by cartoonish antics  The writing is operatic but supremely smart and witty  There are monologues upon monologues  but these monologues are page turners  building to wonderful observations upon life  some I most certainly did not believe our present day have in common with Russian society in the 1860s  Most importantly  even though this book is completely popular and is said to be THE book  it is still quite unpredictable as far as plot lines go  And the writing is wonderfully digestible  And even more  what a wonderfully horrible slash smart slash kind slash petty slash stubborn slash generous main character  There is no denying that we all identify with Raskolnikov at one point in the book  One of the most interesting masterpieces of all time    Dostoyevsky takes you to a whole new world and gives a new meaning to  crime and punishment   focusing mostly on the psychological dimension of the main character  There s a small part describing a dream the main character has that will just blow your mind  A must read  Milontas gia ena biblio pou  prophanos  den khreiazetai sustaseis  to mono pou ekho na po einai pos xeperase kathe prosdokia mou  To phantazomoun polu kalo alla de tha mporousa me tipota na phantasto auto pou diabasa  Exairetiko  Aristourgema   This is an amazing look at the dark side of human nature  The writing is dense and exhausting to get through  but it is by no means meant to be a light read  Raskolnikov in the hands of any other author would have simply come across as crazy  Dostoevsky  however  successfully navigates us through the tormented thoughts of this tragic hero  and in doing so uses him as a window onto the fundamental brokenness of human nature  Oh  Fyodor  Termine de leer  Crimen y castigo  y casi tuve que sentarme en un rincon y ver a la nada en lo que asimilaba lo que acababa de leer  Desde la epifania de Svidrigailov en adelante fue un suplicio saber que ya se acercaba el final del libro  simplemente no queria acabar  pero queria ver el desenlace Los debates entre Raskolnikof y Porfirio Petrovich  o de Rodia con Svidrigailov  La vida de sacrificios de Sonia Simonova  el caracter de Rasumikhine  y una cantidad de cosas que hay para analizar y meditar  Dostoyevsky presents a provocative situation in which questions  big questions  about right and wrong  evil  love and redemption can be examined  His characters come at these questions from unusual and diverse directions that shake off pre conceptions  The action and dialogue take the reader on an examination of the human psyche that transcends time and place Sadly the types of tragedies that occur in this novel also transcend time and place  This gives the novel a timeless aspect  The central question raised in Crime and Punishment is relevant to 21st century America  A political party espouses an economic and social policy that is very similar to that appearing here  The idea that if a driven person or corporation  as our Supreme Court has seen fit to include them  goes after profit and achieves it then laws that encumber  regulate and limit them should be swept aside  The benefits of this taking by force will trickle down to the masses and our conceptions of right and wrong must deviate accordingly in the face of realized wealth  This ideal is revealed in all its frozen  pitiless  merciless lonely reality by Dostoyevsky and we can learn from this  It is through acceptance of our fellow human beings  flawed wretches though they may be  that we can find love and it is in love that we can find the strength to endure and shine a light in the darkness  Oddly  in a twist worthy of 1984 doublespeak  this same party claims kinship with the Christian faith whose very ideal is the exact opposite  saying instead that yes  we are our brother s keeper  The idea that if an action is profitable then it is de facto not a crime is a line of thinking I could see being argued by a lobbyist to a legislator who hears not so much the argument as the sound of money coming into the campaign fund  This tortuous logic can be trotted out  briefly  if needed then safely harbored behind mounds of cash and establishment frowns  leaving the masses to wonder   how s that again   Another aspect of C P that makes it feel contemporary is its kinship to a couple of television dramas that approach similar themes in an analogous way  Both the Sopranos and Breaking Bad create situations in which a protagonist decides he can break the law  The question is a compelling one  If someone takes horrible advantage of me and I have the power to retaliate violently  do I do it  If I am in an impossible financial position and I find a way to make money illegally  is that so wrong  This novel delves as far into the psyche of humans grappling with these ethical dilemmas than any movie  show or book I know of  The themes of whether actions that are commonly considered crimes are inherently crimes or not has interesting ramifications  If these perceived crimes are crimes whenever and wherever they are committed that implies the existence of God  Eternal truths about beauty  love  corruption and evil are up for debate and fascinating analysis  great book   It s one of those books that keeps popping up every now and then on some or the other list recommending you those  must read  classic works  Records state  it came out in 1866  However  even after 148 of publication  the content still reverberates as i put down the book  Inspite of the mammoth 853 pages  the momentum never seemed to ebb from the day i picked it up to the day i finally put it down  The beauty of the book lies in the precise manner in which Fyodor Dostoyevsky manages to touch upon a host of themes  weaving a beautiful story in the process   Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart  The really great men must  I think  have great sadness on earth   The emotions  the conflicts  the hallucinations  the guilt  the compunction   all bundled into one package   To go wrong in one s own way is better then to go right in someone else s   Definitely its worth a recommendation to any book lover  Its not just a good read  its a great read   Awww    What can a guy like me say about Crime and Punishment that hasn t already been said  It is a good thing Dostoevsky did not receive enough hugs when he was little  Hurray for abitrary murder  No hi ha prou estrelles per posar a aquesta historia  Em va impresionar molt el primer cop que el vaig llegir  quan era adolescent  En el meu  top ten  es el number one forever   This book is brilliant  the classic novel of all classics  the superlative of superlatives  the      It s quite good Never has psychological torment been rendered onto a page so effectively  Rich in character  philosophy  and texture  this novel is among my all time favourites Of course  you have to be in the right mindset to appreciate this novel  This ain t no fast paced John Grisham book of the week and it certainly ain t no happy go lucky pie in the sky Pollyanna tale  Raskolnikov s torment is palpable and I  for one  felt the agony he felt page after torturous page Torturous is not really a word that will make you want to read this novel  so just pretend the adjective I used is pleasurable  If you re a masochist you can pretend I used either word because  after all  it s all the same to you  right I don t think any novel has ever so thoroughly scourged the revolutionary mindset  the narcissistic belief that one has the moral authority and intellectual superiority to justly slay the unjust  Whether you agree or disagree with the concept of violent revolution  Dostoevksy s presentation provides some sober thoughts on the matter Sidenote  My favourite character is definitely Porfiry Petrovich  I enjoyed the way he feigned ignorance and played psychological games with Raskolnikov  In fact  Petrovich s character was the partial inspiration for my favourite television detective  Columbo  So  thank you Dostoevsky for inspiring the creation of the greatest television detective of all time To conclude  this is a novel that is well worth a slow careful read  at least twice   It s also worth a quick cursory read  but I recommend against that  rwy  ljrym  w l qb

does it but I want Raskolnikov to get away with it  but I don t at the same time  He does a great job of getting you into his mind  There were parts I wanted to put the book down and stop reading  but over all it was very well written  and worth the effort  all his books are classics and well worth the time to read F F  Excellent book  At times I was so engrossed in the book that in parallel to Raskolnikov s troubled conscience and nightmares  I too started having incoherent bad dreams  Facepalm     A MASTERPIECE  Dostoyevsky s way to show the suffering and inner torture of Raskolnikov as well as the intricated and entangled nature of human conscience is simply brilliant  The vividness of descriptions sinks the reader in the decadent and rotten atmosphere depicted in the novel  Why do we erect monuments to the great men of war  when they mostly are taking other men s lands  money or goods  Why isn t it okay for a starving man to take what he needs Dostoyevsky makes the questions worth asking in Crime and Punishment  Sometimes when I see the wealthy whacky housewives who have 4 nannies and plastic surgery every other day  I wished there was a Raskolnikov  sp   there to end their misery and maybe help thousands of people just have food and a chance of an education  Sounds brutal   and I hate violence  but love d s premise  That I started my next book too quickly after finishing this one  I needed time to think about this story  It left me too quickly to write about  It was haunting on many levels but in the end it is the soul that requires penance  More than any punishment society can devise for us all too often it is the punishment we devise for ourselves that lays it all out there laced in regret  I finished reading this book over the past week It is without doubt one of the best crafted  well written novels I have ever read  I don t pretend to know much of anything about Russian culture or history  but I never once felt overwhelmed by the unfamiliar setting of the book  I love the characterisation of Raskolnikov and his growing sense of paranoia and delusion  The translation that I read was superb  with the occasional quirks that suggested I wasn t reading the original script  You could say that the novel has a slow beginning  although I think the build up to the crime itself is no bad thing  and I was hurtling through the pages by the end  There are many scenes along the way that are powerful in isolation   the horse outside the pub stands out in my mind here Would recommend this book to anyone  and wouldn t want my first GR review to be on anything else  magestic  realism at its finest From the moment one reads Pride and Prejudice  the name of Elizabeth Bennett is forever impressed upon the memory  She learns and grows  and teaches the reader some important lessons along the way  She is no longer just a character  but a real person whom we love and care for  and sometimes see in ourselves and in others around us  Most of all  she charmed her way into our affections  and there she will forever remain I want to say the same thing about Rodion Romonovitch Raskolinkov  I want to  but I hesitate to  It is not Rodion s realism or indelible nature I take issue with  but rather the plain fact that in the general sense of the word  he is a villain It s strange that the more we glimpse of a man s soul  his feelings  his intentions  his personality  his strengths and weaknesses  his ideas  his growth over time  the more we see of all this  the more we grow to like him and in many cases respect him or even love him  I think the majority of people we do not care for or get along with are people we do not truly understand  Fyodor Dostoyevsky allows his readers to get enough of an understanding of Rodion Romonovitch that we really like him  Or at least  we d really like to  He is  after all  a murderer The beginning of this book is rather dark  but it doesn t stay that way throughout  We start out in the midst of Rodion s preparations for his crime  The crime itself is very unpleasant to read about  but Dostoyevsky doesn t just write a violent scene for the shock value  The rest of the book follows Rodion and his family  friends  and acquaintances  some of whom are very likable and amusing  and the action never really slows  You ll be hard pressed to put the book down  It also  of course  explores Rodion s anguish in dealing with his crime  As the book progresses  we are slowly allowed to understand more about why Rodion committed the crime in the first place  which  as we are in the hands of a master storyteller  comes only after we have grown  almost against our will  to like Rodion  Needless to say  his reasoning does not exonerate him in any way  But despite all  we do like him  and we want him to learn and grow and to end up truly happy somehow or another  How exactly that could be possible  though  is a bit mind boggling at first For a Christian  this book is very powerful  but I don t want to give the wrong impression  The religion in this book is not overstated  Taking a brief look at the plot points one could hardly say this is a religious book  But about three quarters of the way through the book  I began to see some significant symbolism  that I don t think I will entirely understand until I reread it  It is so deftly and intricately woven into the story that it s not entirely noticeable at first glance  When I reached the end of the book I was at first disappointed  but on allowing the story to sink in  I grew to like the ending more and more  Later that day I found myself close to tears as some of the truths related in the story began to hit home  The love that God has for each and every one of us is astounding  and something we could never  in this life  entirely comprehend  There are certain aspects of life that give us a glimpse  though  Parenthood comes the closest  as many quotes will tell us  The love a parent has for their child  even when that child misbehaves or disappoints  is so powerful that we would do anything for their good  Books such as Crime and Punishment can also give us a perspective on this love as regards people around us  As I look at Rodion as a symbol of a child of God  and I see the roles that human nature and the quiet influence of God  personified by a couple of characters as well as symbols of faith like the scriptures and a cross  play in his life  I gain a fresh understanding of God s love for us and His willingness to guide us  His willingness to bless us  His willingness to allow us to sometimes go through very difficult circumstances  and His willingness to give us the power of choice even if those choices hurt others or bring upon us horrible consequences  The power of choice can be a difficult subject to wade through  because God is  of course  over all  But if He is  how could He allow Rodion to murder Alyona Ivanovna  Alyona was the victim and of course did not deserve to be killed  but that question could apply just as much to Rodion himself  The punishment definitely fits the monstrosity of his crime  Why would God allow him to do something so horrible  And why does God allow horrible things to happen  especially to those undeserving of it  As Christians  we accept that this life is a school  in which we are constantly being given instruction and tested by circumstance  but in which we are also constantly growing  the extent to which we do so being of our choosing  God has control over all  but He allows us control over ourselves  not our circumstances  or the consequences of our choices  but of our choices alone  He allows all of this in order that we may learn and grow  to become better than we were  more wise  more virtuous  and more like Him  He allows all of this because He loves us and because there is more to life than this life alone It is through this point of view that we can love and care for Rodion and what he stands for  whether that be ourselves  people around us  or mankind in general  and hope for progression and happiness The more I ponder on this book  the more I like it  It is one of those books that will never leave you  one of those stories that add some small dimension to the shape of your understanding  This is why I love the classics  I cannot recommend Crime and Punishment enough  Yet another addition for my favorite book list  Amazing that this journey through emergent psychology  motivation  philosophy  and the schism between a person s rational and emotional minds was written in 1866  You re dragged along with the current of the Raskolnikov s battle with himself  By the way  this is an excellent translation  my daughter says much better than the one she read   One of my favorite books of all time   It s incredible how such a simple plot can pull you in and drown you in it s world  I ve never encountered such a novel that has put me  as the reader  at the same hysteric and neurotic mindset as the protagonist  Raskolnikov   and made me feel as if I was going through their thoughts  feelings  and processes myself as I experience their reality  When you see the physical book itself  it looks like quite a daunting task to take on  but as Dostoyevsky s flawless prose and hauntingly accurate layers of the human psyche unveil through the story  you cannot help but be sucked into it s world  the pages will begin to flip faster and faster and you won t be able to stop until you find out just where Raskolnikov s fate will lay  Is he at odds with the circumstances surrounding him  or just those within him  The motivations and wit used by both Svidrigailov and Porfiry are unendingly interesting  and you re never quite sure how their meetings with Raskolnikov will turn out  You can almost physically feel Porfiry breathing down your neck with a sly smile as you re reading the parts when he is speaking with Raskolnikov  and you will be battling within your own mind  wondering just what kind of game is Porfiry up to and when will he reveal his true colours  Upon finishing this book  I can honestly say it s earned a place as one of the top 3 books I ve ever read  I wasn t expecting it to be so absorbing and easy to read given the time period in which it was written  Most of this is due to Dostoyevsky s genius  but also hugely in part to the translator  The translation I read was done by Jessie Coulson  and I would very much recommend this version  although I haven t read any of the others   I have done quite a bit of research on translations of many of the Russian greats  and I ve learned that you should try to avoid many of the older translation such as Garnett s and McDuff s  as it may alter your experience of the book and lead to a lesser accurate portrayal of the authors intentions  P and V s translations are award winning and quite highly regarded  so definitely check out their versions of Crime and Punishment  The Brothers Karamozov  Notes from Underground  War and Peace  Anna Karenina  and quite a few others  However  if you come across Jessie Coulson s version of Crime and Punishment  I would say dive in head first and enjoy one of the greatest stories ever written  About the translation I started Crime and Punishment no less than 2 years ago  from the Peaver version  I gave it up after 100 some pages  Why  Here s the first lines from that edition At the beginning of July  during an extremely hot spell  towards evening  a young man left the closet he rented from tenants in S   y Lane  walked out to the street  and slowly  as if indecisively  headed for the K   n Bridge And here s Garnett s translation On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S  Place and walked slowly  as though in hesitation  towards K  bridge Taking another random example From Peaver Volokhonsky  Such is my trait  Do you know  do you know  sir  that I even drank up her stockings  Not her shoes sir  for that would somehow resemble the order of things  but her stockings  I drank up her stockings  sir        She has a weak chest and is inclined to consumption and I feel it  Do I not feel it  The more I drink the more I feel it  It is for this drink  that in drinking I may seek compassion and feeling  It is not joy I seek    but sorrow only  I drink  for I wish doubly to suffer  And Garnett says  Such is my fate  Do you know  sir  do you know  I have sold her very stockings for drink  Not her shoes   that would be more or less in the order of things  but her stockings  her stockings I have sold for drink        But her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it  Do you suppose I don t feel it  And the more I drink the more I feel it  That s why I drink too  I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink    I drink so that I may suffer twice as much  And another from P V  The dregs  the leavings  were being scraped out  Thus a man will suffer half an hour of mortal fear with a robber  but once the knife is finally at his throat  even fear vanishes Garnett The last moment had come  the last drops had to be drained  So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand  yet when the knife is at his throat  he feels no fear To me  it s pretty clear the P V lines read more elegant  but when you read this almost pretentious elegance 5 pages in a row  too bad I don t have the inclination to type out that much   you ll see there s less character and more letters in them  Garnett gives it a reality which is not Russian  not criminal or of suspense  but of a real man in a real world with a real fucked up mind  as it really is in life I ordered a very nice edition of P V  and something nudged me to give Garnett a try  I didn t want to waste a lot of money again  so I read Garnett off a stupid e book  unannotated and everything  googling miserably for the French and German  The P V is nicely annotated  with a nice introduction  afterword  et al  Yet     About the actual book Jesus  Mary and Joseph Period  This book is absolutely incredible in its ability to delve deeply into the mind of a criminal  The author  Dostoyevsky  brilliantly captures the inner workings of a man who has completely lost himself  Although it is a bit tedious at times  it s entirely worth the read just to experience the dangerous and terrifying mentality of the main character   Me encanto  perfecto  Solo me confunde un poco el uso de diferentes nombres para una persona   The themes of alienation  crime  punishment  suffering etc beautifully lectured through carefully spun characters of Raskolnikov  Dunya  Sonya  Razumikhin  As he puts in one of the chapter   Taking a new step  uttering a new word  is what people fear most  An engrossing and thought provoking read  2 sar garan unshsan nom maan  ingeed duuslaa  Ankh udaa iim udaan nom unshlaa khoorkhii  Udaan unshsan n  ch bolzh  Naadmaar ekhluulzh baisan ium baigaan    This book is unbelievably awesome and one of my favorites  I can t wait to read more Dostoevsky    definitely a commitment though F D  paints a dark picture with fine brushstrokes  Incredible characters  gripping pace  great dialogue  Wish I d read it in Russian  One of my all time favorites  To get into the mind of a murderer and understand  that is writing at its best  This book is so effective and it is one of my favorite books  I strongly recommend you to read it  It has lots of true points about life  You will see how bad is it to lose your way  your goals about life  Raskolnikov is regretting about lots of things but also he knows what he regrets saves his life  So  he is confused and has lots of complicated questions about life  He is against to the system  It is a deep story  deep book  deep language  Dostoyevsky did an amazing job again  This book is simply magic on paper  Don t let the rather slow beginning fool you   it initially did the people I ve recommended this to  and my advice to you remains the same  read on for the experience of a lifetime Very few books give the kind of insight Crime And Punishment does into the mind of the anti protagonist  Raskolnikov is an intellectual man  driven to murder by poverty  and attempts to reconcile this action to his moral compass by rationalising it  All of us have experienced this existential struggle  religious or not  at some point in our lives  Which is why you ll find this book leaves its indelible mark on you like no other Read it  mull on it  read it again and enjoy a better life  Absolutely amazingAbsolutely amazingkept me on the edge of my seat  once I picked this book up  I literally couldn t put it down    Too good of a book to honestly review  Too much to think about  I am probably going to re read it in another translation in a few months or at least thumb through my favorite parts to see the difference  I can not believe I took this long to read this novel  Everyone should read this classic if nothing else   I found the detective character  Petrovich  to be a prototype for Lt  Columbo  He appears to be far less intelligent and capable than he really is and the scenes between him and Raskolnikov are quietly amusing  in a wry sort of way  This is one of my all time favorite books because of its portrayal of a person grappling with philosophical matters in a  what if  scenario  I wasn t thrilled with the ending  but only because it seemed a bit too moralistic  for all the moral relativism that it portrayed earlier  Rodia e um ex

Splendida caratterizzazione psicologica dei personaggi  tutti ben delineati con la loro visione del mondo  Una storia scorrevole e coinvolgente che ispira riflessioni morali  religiose ed esistenziali  It s been years since I read this  but I remember being riveted by Dostoyevski s exploration of the psychology of a guilty many  The book hard little to no action  but yet it was a fascinating read  Crime and Punishment is a fascinating book about a man  Raskolnikov  who thinks he is above humanity and decided to kill his landlady  Alyona Ivanovna  and her sister Lizaveta  He then underwent a

was a thrilling one  for it explored the mind of an egotistic intellectual in such a vivid way that it really sticks to the readers  minds  I would definitely recommend it to people who like or love books that have a psychological approach  And it is not just a  sensational murder story   it actually has literal merit  A timeless classic  Maybe the best crime novel ever written  Vseki p t kogato

poor student  decides to kill a greedy  grasping old landlady in order to rob her  No spoiler alert is required in order to reveal that he carries out this deed  because this happens right at the beginning of the novel  The rest of the novel is all about the consequences of this murder in terms of Raskolnikov s psychology  The novel goes down  deep deep down into the darkness of Raskolnikov s growing insanity  It is at times scary stuff  But in the end the novel is about redemption and Raskolnikov  after going down into the depths of this darkness  see a way clear to come back up into the light  I know someone who said that after reading Crime and Punishment she felt that she could never judge anyone ever again  Part of Dostoyevsky s vision is that in the end we judge ourselves  and the totality of our judgement is so utterly merciless that only perfect honesty  the kind of honesty that is in service to the Truth  can save us  so awkwardly honest and incisive that it spooked me  i know there are volumes written about this compelling piece of literary history  but all i can say is i was shaken up by it  i did read it mostly by candlelight in italy  so maybe that had something to do with it   I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this fascinating classic  distressful but very good Shame on me for writing this review with a character list open in another tab  but memorizing Russian names will never be my strong point  besides they might have some slight letter variation in English  and I read it in Spanish  after so long    Who would have known this would be so brilliant to my eyes  Obviously it s an acclaimed classic  but I hated acclaimed classics before  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is a law student that s currently living far away from his mother and sister  They rely on his success to have a better life  As the book starts  we find that he has abandoned the university and falls in moral and material misery  but inside there s one more problem of spiritual decay that makes it possible for him to become a murderer  Out of greed and an egotism that he s reluctant to confess  he manages to kill Alyona Ivanovna  a famous usurer known for her lack of mercy towards her clients Her sister  Lizaveta  presennces the scene  This makes Raskolnikov lose control over an otherwise planned situation and ends her life too  Subsequently  a sickness described as fever  and paranoia invade the starring character s mind  and he s taken care of by Nastasya Petrovna  a servant  and Dmitri Prokofych Razumikhin  a friend and ex classmate  who has fallen in poverty  but is a hardworking character instead   Raskolnikov s constant paranoia makes him go around the city  think that everyone knows what he did  In a tavern  he meets Marmeladov  who tells him his story  He s an addict unable to quit the habit that will ruin his family  He s married to Katerina Ivanovna  The couple had widowed from previous marriages  and then united  Both had children from their previous lives  Three daughters and a son  The elder  Sonya  will take care of her sick step mother unitl the very end  when her father s death will make the family s situation even worse Without going much into essential plot details for those who plan to read how the story develops  I do think that Raskolnikov s efforts to do good  even when he s not confessing his crime  point out the qualities that in the end  will make him capable of repentance I find the parallel between this and Lazarus  biblical episode very called for  In accesses of insanity  it s how he finds the final peace of mind that makes him assume his crime before the world and pay the consequences  The characer study and development is very well done  The concern for the social changes in his time are clearly seen through the pages of the novel This is my first time reading Dostoyevsky  and it won t be the last  As inaccurate this might be from a literary standpoint  I cannot help but compare with some other Russian authors that I read  especially Tolstoy being the first that comes to mind  While lacking the long description  his work goes straight to the point and is equally capable of telling diverse stories that join together in the end  and that despite their tragic tone  leave some hope for the future    OH MEH GOSH IM DONE Wow  deep breath I was really really really reluctant to read this  It sounded kinda awful and I was just like oh GREAT  And I was so  like x1000  surprised  It s not like I thoroughly enjoyed it  but I really liked it  There came a point when I couldnt stop reading  it gripped me  There were all the under currents that came together and these amazing moments  And it had a good voice  it read like a modern novel  which shouldnt surprise since I read it for  modern  Lit class  and wasn t hard to understand  yet it is still an amazing work  You really end up loving Rasc  There s no hate for this man  a murderer  I ll probably add to this review in a minute   I need to read this again someday just to study it Just saying  I am so so so for Sonya Rascal    Second read  A book and author that has fascinated me since my first reading two years ago  The book is an amazing literary achievement that everyone should bring themselves to read  Especially for male university students    Intellectuals  for its direct challenge to there inner thoughts and ideas  Don t throw the fire of ideas as you might burn the forest  Also a fantastic novel in its own right beyond its ideas  The use of multiple character viewpoints  but mostly the main  in 2 5th perspective makes for a great journey with the characters story and thoughts  Essential reading for all  Excelente narrativa  increible que el autor te hace sentir complice del personaje principal porque temes que sea descubierto  ya que lo sientes completamente humano porque conoces sus miedos y pensamientos   Simplemente impresionante  The best book I have ever read  Dostoyevsky discusses  in detail  the numerous topics of morals vs  ethics  criminality vs  insanity  family  poverty  and of course the individual  all within a most exciting plot  Everything is so detailed  the emotions are rich  numerous  and thought out  and the epilogue is perfect  Keren mampus  mn  rw  m qr t fy Hyty Es girk e stipowm a ahagin mtatsel hants agortsowt yownneri masinShat havanets i ow mi k ani angam

 no tengo palabras para definir lo que he sentido al terminar esta novela  La cerre anoche y aun estoy pensando  No me extrana que sea uno de los libros mas importantes de la historia   I m feeling a little annoyed with myself right now   I had written two paragraphs of a review but then pressed something peculiar and lost it  Mind you  I wasn t anything much  Everything has undoubtedly been said before   what can you do when it s one of the Classics  Nevertheless  I will say a little  I found the chief protagonist thoroughly unlikeable  Not only is he arrogant and self centred  but he commits the most appalling crime  I was pleased he suffered so much  And yet I was compelled to continue reading  and although my start and end dates imply I took a long time over it  that was really because I read an e copy and so it s my public transport reading   This  I daresay  is the brilliance of Dostoyesky  Also  I felt immersed in the time and place  and that made the unpleasantness become almost immaterial I m glad I m reading the books I always should have  Truth be told  I put off reading this book because I was intimidated by reading something of Dostoyevsky s  I had wrongly assumed that his writing would be difficult to understand  and the book as a whole tedious to read  Instead  I quickly realized that  Crime and Punishment  is one of the easiest books I have ever read  in the sense that the writing style and plot lines alike are clear and understandable  Anybody who finds the idea of Dostoyevsky daunting  ignore that thought  it s wrong Although Raskolnikov represents certain moral struggles in the most extreme of ways  I believe that his internal struggle of right versus wrong is something that everybody in life must confront  Who sets down acceptable moral principles  Why is it right for some  but not all  to challenge those preconceived ethical boundaries  Although we may not all be  Napoleon  and dare defy society for glory  the issues of society and the self found at the center of  Crime and Punishment  should at least be contemplated by any person who considers themselves to be broad minded   I found myself getting lost in the mind of Rodya and being in awe and disgust at the same time  Dostoyevsky created wonderful characters that grew separately and together simultaneously  I dont know how to put the feeling I got from this book into words  but if you have the time and a cheat sheet of characters  names then you should definitely read this book  Dostoevskij e stato a lungo  lo  scrittore  per me pietra di paragone per tutte le letture  in buona compagnia di Franz Kafka  ad essere sinceri   Oggi c e troppo altro per sventolare alta la bandiera di un solo autore  ma i suoi romanzi  e questo in particolare  toccano cieli  o meglio abissi  tuttora ai limiti della coscienza e della morale  Se i Karamazov rappresentano il culmine di un percorso dell animo  Delitto e Castigo resta il diamante meglio lavorato  piu preciso e sicuro  A classic  of course  and one of my favorites  The character of Raskolnikov  and his move through the agony of guilt is one of the greatest examinations of character in modern literature  A classic book about the clash of ideas in mid 19th century Russia  The new translation provides a much more informed reading  with modern language and wonderful explanatory notes  The conceptions of European socialism and romanticism come into conflict with its hero s Russian religious conceptions of morality  Raskolnikov is a student who has fallen on hard times in mid nineteen century St Petersburg  This is a story about St Petersburg  its people and environment  The city has the huge disparity between the rich and the much more numerous poor  They live side by side  but come together in their vices  gambling  drinking  and prostitution  The problem is that the battle of idealism and traditionalism does not give comfort to the participants  Raskolnikov is conflicted by these ideas  He feels that his crime can be condoned  but his conscience gives him no comfort  He is a man who tries to do good deeds for his family and friends  but has done something horrible  He is driven to confession  contrition and atonement  This is not an easy book to read  but when finished  you feel that you have accomplished something worthwhile   Yesterday I started reading the book again but I won t be able to do it  The books  The Brothers Karamazov  and  The Demons  are far too easy to reread because they are not uniformly and through out tense and bleak  Crime and Punishment is a novel about the moment by moment reflection of an agitated mind  with its brilliance it grips you and tortures you and in such impossible detail  it can only fill you with awe  This was the first of Dostoyvsky s novels I read  and it was this one which propelled me towards reading almost all of his works  whatever I could find from whatever source  In the end  two other books I mentioned  The Brothers Karamazov and The Demons I liked more than this one  But this was the book  I cannot forget  I read at a time when I could easily associate with Raskolnikov   I was almost the same age and I had known about poverty  and I also think all these spiritual quests that ran inside Raskolnikov were inside me too  I specifically mean the sense of justice  The gradual way Raskolnikov s mind was built up for murder This has not been a review but a personal experience  It just goes to say that an unformed man  with an unformed spiritual consciousness  is more likely to be entirely swept away with Dostoyvsky s works  which happened with me  And I admit reading so much of him over a little time of about one year changed me  shaped me in many ways Recommended for everyone  for those too who don t read this kind of stuff   Just to be aware that this kind of books exist too  There is not much more I can say about this book that hasn t been said by hundreds of people throughout the years  On a personal note  I found this book to be outstanding and can easily see why it is considered one of the classics of literature  The way Dostoevsky gets into the mind of his character is as good writing as I have ever seen  The torment  guilt  hope  wonder  and range of dozens of emotions of the main character really hit home to the reader  I think everyone could connect in some way to the ideas in this story and although it is a slow read that takes some time  I think it is worth it for any avid reader   defalarca okumustum bu kitabi  nasi vurulduysam artik kitaba  beynin zarar gormiyim diye kitapla ilgili herseyi sildi heralde  hatirlamaya calisiyorum  sadece olaylar geliyor aklima  beni boyle derinden etkileyen neydi  aklima gelirse donerim tekrar    This is an amazing book and keen insight into the human mind  Dostoyevsky s portrayal of poverty and how we all look at poverty is enlightening and embarrassing  Dostoyevsky shows that  poverty is not a vice  and demonstrates that certain conditions can make even the best of men resort to unimaginable things  Now the saying  people who live in glass houses should not throw stones comes to life and do the ends justify the mean  Who is to judge what is a crime  Does a crime become justifiable as long as the  criminal  is successful  That s the question  I think the question got answered by the conscience  What is wrong is wrong and is felt by the core of our souls  The only downside to the novel is that it s hard to keep track of the characters because of the Russian names but that doesn t take away from the story but does slow down the reader  A must read  An amazing masterpiece  This book made me think deeply about some ethical dilemmas that humans face every single day and about life through the long moral punishment of Raskolinkov  Furthermore  I was fascinated by Dostoyevsky s control of flow of the events using ideas and thoughts  One of the best novels I have ever read  This was a book that I was required to read for a literature class over a year ago  I was not optimistic about it at first  and was really not even wanting to start readint it  However  once I did  I found that it was really interesting and exciting to see what Rodya would do next  The book is emotionally deep and contains many themes and images that reoccur in strange ways  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes crime related literature  or to anyone wanting to start reading some of the Classics that isn t sure where to start  It was a great introduction to Russian literature for me  and I hope to read more of Dostoevsky s work in the future   Honestly  I read it only because I was supposed to in school and never did  and I felt guilty about that I got two thirds of the way through it  and wasn t particularly impressed  Dostoyevsky wrote well  certainly  but I couldn t really tell where the book was going  or why I should care  But at the beginning of the last third the entire book kicked into gear  and the entire first two thirds made sense as a buildup to a fundamental understanding of the main character and his relationship to the crime  I would normally argue that it s poor writing to work that way  that one needs to hook the audience and keep them going  you don t ramp it up at the end  But your appreciation of the ENTIRE piece grows as the book nears the end  and it s well worth the wait Absolutely Excellent  crazy mange navn a holde styr pa  men fyf sa godt skrevet    A book only meant to be read when you re ready for it  It s down  dirty  psychological  The plot  however  is one of the most powerful and uplifting I ve ever come across  In essence   standing across from the executioner  when all hope is lost  only to be born again when the executioner forever stalls   And then everything from then on is a gift  Personally  I think this book contains the most powerful and passionate words ever written  considering the context of the story   They wanted to speak  but could not  tears stood in their eyes  They were both pale and thin  but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future  of a full resurrection into a new life  They were renewed by love  the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other   While being a kid  I was flipping through the pages of an art album listing paintings from Russian Art galleries   heavy  dark  detailed  desolate  despondent  gloomy  dramatic  heart breaking     that is how I keep them in my mind and why I got to associate them with Dostoyevsky s portrait for Raskolnikov sitting at the center of a similarly colored story in the St Petersburg s dirty  grey  poor decor   rar loc unde sufletul omului sa fie supus unor influente mai intunecate  mai brutale si stranii ca la Petersburg  It is story about a murder  by chance  a double murder   a paradox between a premeditated in planning but surprising in execution  looks a bit like a sleep walker action   and a punishment  a heavy and tormenting psychological and philosophical one followed  naturally  by the resurrection found by confessing  getting being jailed and serving time in Siberia  Telling enough is the split between the three   10    85    5  of the book The biggest fall is represented by the moment when Raskolnikov understand that he believed is above the normal people and there is no crime in murder if done for a greater goal but he discovers he isn t like that after all   that he is one the of the many    Cand imi puneam intrebari  de pilda  daca am dreptul la putere  stiam perfec ca nu am dreptul  prin simplul fapt ca imi puneam intrebarea  Initially I associated this idea with my favorite philosopher  Nietzsche   after more reading and thinking  I realized first that  Thus Spoke Zarathustra  was published 20 years later but also that this idea was pretty popular in that period of time  plus  a real trial might have been the inspiration source together with his life story  This is a re read as the first time I went through the pages maybe 15 years ago and even if I got much less of it  I for sure had glued to my mind two crazy cruel pieces  the death of the horse and Raskolnikov s mom s attitude towards his son   a ta pana la mormant   Ticalosul de om se obisnuieste cu toate  Sunt un om fiindca stiu sa mint  Oamenii  prin insasi legea firii se impart in doua categorii  in inferiori  materialul uman care serveste la procreare  si in oameni in adevaratul sens al cuvantului  cei care au darul si talentul de a spune in mediul lor un cuvant nou  Oamenii cu adevarat mari cred ca trebuie sa se simta foarte tristi pe pamant  Ne reprezentam intotdeauna vesnicia drept ceva ce nu poate fi inteles  ceva urias  imens  Dar de ce trebuie sa fie neaparat imensa  Si daca vesnicia nu este decat o maghernita oarecare   Delighted to have finished reading this book  mainly because I learned the author is among the favorites of another favorite of mine  Among other activities I do while on the subway  this book accompanied me as I focused my eyes on its pages for close to a month of reading while in transit  Well  read this for pleasure  and not for anything else  I know some law schools have this a required reading  so they must be taking the whole book seriously  By the way  I admire the translator s work that has been poured on this work The book s archaic in content and structure  its setting s over a hundred years ago which is very different from the Russia that we hear about nowadays though or see on TV   to say the least  but the story is very modern  Just how that happens  you ll have to find out for yourself  Keep your cool  and don t get intimidated by it  as it s got a very basic storyline  the guilt of an idle  proud young man who murders 2 women  as he expounds of his theory of him being above the law  writing about other  murderers  in society who got away with it  and in the end  rediscovers love in all its glory  I d venture again to read Dostoevsky s sometime  as soon as I figure out that I m not missing anything from translation  I just have a feeling it s getting to be too pretentious reading these so called classics or these books critics and readers are raving about  including Dostoevsky s  Brothers Karamazov    Besides  most critics get paid for voicing out their thoughts about these books  whereas I just do reviewing mainly for sharing to interested  curious readers  Also  I just go about reading this type of book  a  classic  now but could have considered odd those times  mainly to get a clear feeling of how these writers have thought and figured out to write these works  It s just like learning from the masters  without dealing with their idiosyncrasies that can be distracting to writers like myself   This novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky is said to be one of the greatest works of Russian literature  To be fair  I picked up in my quest of reading top 100 classics and I wasn t disappointed a bit The story deals with the mental struggles and inner conflicts faced by a former student  Raskolnikov overridden by poverty  who commits a double murder and tries to justify his act by a Napoleonic theory but his conscience forces him to confess to his crime  The act brings the protagonist into contact with two other persons Sonia  a religious girl who herself has endured great suffering and Porfiry  an officer who is a master in using psychological forces in crime investigations  Both these persons compel Raskolnikov in realizing his guilt The author expertly uses feelings and emotions to create a psychological effect in the book that goes beyond the crime committed  Sometimes as a reader  you feel to be suffering from the same illness as Raskolnikov s The book also explores the theme of redemption through suffering where the main character aided by Sonia s love  finds salvation by working through his suffering In short  it is an excellent work of fiction which is recommended to all those readers who like reading about man s psychology  Big book to tackle   but must read  I love the way Dostoyevsky delves into the mind of Raskolnikov  It is a true psychological case study of what happens to a man under stress and guilt I can t remember when I first read this book or for what class  but I love it and have taught it in my own World Lit classes  I like to pair it with Alfred Hitchcock s movie Rope  I highly recommend reading the book and then watching the movie  They are the perfect complement to each other because they both contain the idea of a superior man that should be able to do kill a man without consequence The story is very thick and it does take a while to get used to the various Russian names and all of their nick names  but the plot is very intense and once you get a handle on the names and the characters  it is very compelling Looking for something meaty and thought provoking   pick up this book     Um temor febril continuava a agita la  A luzinha que  ha algum tempo  ja comecara a se consumir no candeeiro iluminava vagamente naquele misero quarto um assassino e uma prostituta  estranhamente reunidos para ler o livro eterno   Sem mais   When I was a teenager  reading this book was a part of my high school curriculum    Yeah    Needless to say  I hated it back then  The main character was just a weird looser who was too weak to do anything about his sh tty situation 15 years later  after having read it over the course of five months  which is unheard of for me  since I am a very fast reader   I am seeing new depths and an amazing talent of Dostoyevsky to ask THE questions    I think when I read this book again  probably in another 15 years  I will go even deeper into the rabbit hole       Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostovesky focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov  an impoverished St  Petersburg ex student who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her money  The murder is also committed to test Raskolnikov s hypothesis that some people are naturally able to have the right to murder  The main hero justifes his actions by relating himself to Napoleon believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose  I have to remind myself that sometimes to be able to read a classic  one needs to do it in one day  more or less  I read this in bits and pieces  Sometimes only a chapter at a time  I found myself groaning at the long introspective musings of Rodion  Then I freaked like the closet philosopher lover that I am when dealing with the passages on  ordinary  and  extraordinary  humans This book is not for the meek  but oh how I loved it  I only wish I d read it sooner  This is the second to be discussed this Summer at the Great Books at Colby  Judgment  series  Most 19th century fiction has a certain gothic 19th century feel to it  Crime   Punishment could be a mid 20th centure psychological thriller  Age and experience teaches us that theories of life are best developed through examined living   rather than the youthfull mistake of developing theory in the abstract and then trying to put it into practice  Dostoyevsky has great fun with young intellectuals  The two approaches wonderfully described in the climactic enounter between Raskolikov and Porifry Petrovich in Raskolikov s room  Youth is truly wasted on the young  Anyone concerned with the progress of a young man struggling into adulthood should get this book   particularly to give to the young man in question  Crime and punishment is definitely one of the best books in universal literature  this novel has a rich context  all his characters have a complex psycological insight  also Dostoievsky makes great arguments about the human condition and his concience  this novel is a MUST READ in classical literature  manh liet  day dut va am anh  My favorite Dostoevsky   A book that seeks to answer questions that all of us have   when is crime justified  is causing the suffering of someone else for personal gain a sin  Will leave you pondering on these things long after you finish the book  I have yet to find someone who has finished reading the book and not identified himself herself with one of the characters 5 star without a doubt   Incredible book  the grandaddy of crime novels  but maybe too much for a generation teethed on computer graphics  Their loss   I really didn t think i would like this book when I started reading it but I was wrong  I loved this book  The writing is fantastic  I won t tell you about the book except this young man commits a double murder and starts to mad and paranoid from guilt  A must read   I know what it is like to isolate yourself completely for an extended period of time  to stay in a small room with not much to eat  But what caused Raskolnikov to separate himself from other ordinary people  that  I would never be able to relate to  as I m perfectly aware of that I m one of the ordinary  The motive of his murder was so astonishingly intelligent I was all in excitement and I know I won t encounter anything as shocking as that for a while  I honestly fell for his argument  It is absurd and shouldn t and wouldn t be put in to practice  and the realization of the theory might look exactly like the dream Raskolnikov had about the chaotic state of atrocity  But as he argued  there are only a handful of people who are extraordinarily superior and more often than not their act brings overall peace and prosperity  Raskolnikov should have plotted something of a larger scale  He wasn t just as superior as he thought  Nonetheless  he made himself clear to me about his theory  What I can t decide though is that whether I would agree upon the purging based on the Utilitarianism  My heart cheers for it but my cold and calm brain says no I cannot keep thinking about the possible connection between the murder of the old pawnbroker and the Dostoyevsky s own death penalty experience  He was sentenced to death because of his studying of Socialism which is a  theory   If that s the case  Dostoyevsky had a truly magnanimous compassion towards Raskolnikov and the regime  Dostoyevsky dreamed of their renewal in the end   I did love this book in the end  It was pretty hard to deal with all the protagonist s anxiety  paranoia  procrastination  denial and self punisment  But  the Raskolnikov s spiritual change  maturing and paradigm shift is all the more powerful for the fact that it is hard won  like finishing the book was hard won for me   His revulsion at love  his inability to enjoy life and his self importance fade and he notices all that is around him in a new way      now he could only feel  In place of dialectics life had arrived  and in his consciousness something of a wholly different nature must now work towards fruition   a  growing aquaintance with a new  hitherto completely unknown reality   Raskolnikov feels he can justify his crime intellectually  when explaining his actions to his sister he thinks he has just put it to her in the wrong  aesthetic form   His publication  written in his uniersity days  argued that all people  not only the great  but even those who deviate only marginally   who are marginally capable of saying something new  are bound  by their very nature  to be criminals   Petrovich  the tormentor teacher enemy voice of conscience explains the murderer  killed because of a theory  in the proud  enthusiastic frustration of youth  His pride  that pushes him to reach into the great  unknowable realm of death sees him lose his sanity  until he is brought back to reality by family  friends and the questions of enemies  admitting fault and accepting his punishment from society  I feel that there is also some truth in Raskolnikov s original idea  it is sometimes important to challenge the norms of society  but not kill anyone   There is no value in giving my opinion on Crime and Punishment  I lack the hubris to tell you what I think of it  I loved this book and am not sure why I had not read it before  The title really says it all   it s a psychological explanation of crime and punishment and what surprised me was that it was such a page turner  By the end I was hooked  My memory of other Dostoyevesky books was that he was  hard  to read  Not the case with this one  fascinating   A brilliant book  probably the best one I ve ever read  The plot as well as the characters make the book immensely intriguing to read  Outstanding dialogue between Porfiry Petrovich and Raskolnikov  Dementia  paranoia  arrogance  fury  murderous impulses  These are side effects that may be experienced while reading this book  Dostoyevsky has a way a uniquely powerful way of understanding and incorporation the human psyche into his story  You will feel what the characters feel  You will think what they think  You are not reding a story  you re reading life  This book is an absolute masterpiece  for once in my life I understand why a book is called  a classic   Dostoyevsky is ideal for both the casual reader and the ardent devotees of Russian classics  Really he is Dostoyevsky is well recognize as a literary genius  Some devote themselves to studying his works their entire life  In varying degrees of devotion  there are readers who enjoy him in periodic doses  I m that type of reader  I impose long intervals between digesting Dostoyevsky s novels so as to stretch his works across the length of my literary life  Then there is the casual reader of novels  The person who maybe reads ten books a year  Often these readers are afraid to pick up a Russian novel  But a reader should never doubt their ability to understand or enjoy a book simply based on the clout it carries  A book isn t a challenge  unless you make it one  A book can be enjoyable on the most basic level or a lengthy literary dissection  It is the reader s choice  That s why I feel Dostoyevsky s Crime and Punishment is a Russian classic for every type of reader I hesitated to write a review on this book because I feel there should be a solid reason for other Goodreads members to seek out ANOTHER book review for this novel  But maybe this review will appeal to the reader who fears diving into a Russian classic  Crime and Punishment has so many layers that it can enthrall any type of reader  Dostoyevsky wrote for everyone  It is my hope that this review will get one person to take the leap and try a little classic Russian  Read a chapter a night with some vodka  Feel your inner Russian grow strong no matter what type of reader you are Let s talk about the book now Raskolnikov is the main character and the plot revolves around his life  his decisions  his acquaintances and family  He is an intelligent man  a former student  who lives in a filthy tiny apartment in St  Petersburg  He is someone who has become extremely down on his luck so to speak  And because of his unfortunate circumstances  his judgment becomes poor and his actions become dangerous    key plot topic   avoid if necessary   Raskolnikov conceives a plot to murder a woman for minimal monetary gain  Though he conceives the plot as flawless  he ends up murdering not just the one woman he intended  but another  From this point forward in the novel his the poor judgment takes a firm hold of him and madness starts to settle in  He becomes physically sick from the stress and circumstance     end plot topic   Raskolnikov living with the secreted knowledge of his actions attempts to justify them  He lectures on humanity and at the same time he is giving reason to his recent behavior  He categorizes mankind by saying there is the first category  men who are conservative and law abiding  they love to be controlled  Then the second category  men who defy the law  they are destroyers  but they cause progress  He theorizes that both types of men are relative and varied  but what Raskolnikov truly contemplates is whether there are men who can and should live above the law  the men of the second category   Do these men have the right to kill others  He speaks of many famous men of the past who he believes were of the second category and that without them transgressing  the world would not have moved forward  In essence  Raskolinkov believes men of the first category are merely ordinary  Those of the second category are extraordinary  He is disillusioned and becomes grandiose while contemplating these two categories of man  Furthermore  Raskolnikov believes firmly that he is of the second category of man  And as his mind runs with these theories  he believes that pain and suffering are always inevitable for a man with a large intelligence and a deep heart   The really great men  must  I think  have great sadness   Raskolinkov is building himself up bigger and bigger while internally he is falling apart living with the secreted knowledge of his actions  He is like a child justifying his behavior when he well knows full well of his transgression  Through the entire novel he carries about this disillusionment of his person  It is infrequent that Raskolnikov totters on along the edges of sanity  After much time has passed  his tottering on the brink of potential sanity  he finally understands that he broke the law  And that even though he is in the second category of man that there are consequences for his actions  He pulls away from his prior grandiosity and states that   Of course  in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps   It is then he falls trepidly into the first category of man  Dostoevsky is a master who can intertwine layers of sociological  psychological and theological matters constantly page after page in every novel  I can understand how this could overwhelm a casual reader but it shouldn t because the reader has the choice to absorb whatever they choose in a Dostoevsky novel  It s like swimming in the ocean  You can choose to stay close to the shoreline or swim far out where the water is deep  It is the reader s choice what to draw and share with others from a novel  Prochitavshi lishe pershi storinok z 10 ia zrozumiv  shcho tse shedevr Iak dobre  mabut

book before  but in another language  As much as I loved the book and it fascinated me years back  I found the English translation was at times very stiff and lacking novel like fluidity and nothing like my first attempt  John Henry Newman looked on conscience as the most immediate and personal proof of the existence of God  Dostoevsky  in Crime   Punishment  shows it as the biggest obstacle to holding on to genuine atheism  Like any logical atheist  Raskolnikov thinks there is no higher power which determines good and evil  right and wrong  his own mind being the ultimate arbiter of all such matters  He kills an old pawnbroking woman  not so much for her money as to prove that he is a sort of superman to whom everything is permitted  that he stands above all conventional morality  has the right to do so  and that these convictions will suffice to put down any possible remorse  They don t His attempts at self justification slowly succumb to his conscience  In the end Raskolnikov is  saved  because he lets his conscience win in the battle with his own bad  alter ego   also mirrored in Svidrigailov  whose motto is   the best time is had by those who are best able to deceive themselves    The argument goes back and forth  His better self insists that there is such a thing as right and wrong  and that wrong is very present in man  man s trouble being that he  can get used to anything  the villain   And then his worse self pipes back   and what if I m mistaken  What if man   the whole human race in general   isn t really a villain at all  If that s true  it means that all the rest  religion  morality  etc   is just a load of superstition  just a lot of fears that have been put into people s head  and there are no limits  and that s how it s meant to be   It s a long argument and a long process  but in the end his better self wins out  The awareness of his crime almost drives him to despair but he overcomes that temptation too  He tells his sister  who now knows the whole story  that he had thought of suicide but could not bring himself to do it  She says   That means you still believe in life  God be praised  Dostoevsky can t refrain from a dig at the psychological experts of his  and our   age  When Raskolnikov confesses and is sent for trial  quite a few  intellectuals  see him as exemplifying  the latest fashionable theory of temporary insanity   And they are completely disconcerted when he  in his trial  gives a perfectly rational explanation of the greed and self centered pride motivating his crime  as for  what had prompted him to turn himself in  he replied bluntly that it had been genuine remorse  All this was almost indecent    Crime   Punishment ends not just with the  conversion  of Raskolnikov  but also with the clear comment by Dostoevsky that the new life his conversion opens up to him will have to be won  and that this will not be easy  Did he have in mind another story   a sequel that was never written  Or was he hinting that this is the story each one of us has to set about writing once we sincerely face our conscience  and keep at the job of throttling our bad alter ego  This book is truly the best book I have ever read  That being said  it is also the most challenging one to date  Fyodor Dostoyevsky s portrait of the human psyche is simply genius  The thought processes that go through Rodya s mind  you will soon find go through your mind many  many years after reading this book  It is understandable why this is considered one of the best books of all times  Please don t hold yourself back from this one  Your life will never be the same  I read this book at a very rocky time in my life  when I was 19  and while reading this book my life changed for the worst  but it was something I had to go through for sure  I was so drawn into Raskolnikov s story and his pathology that his dark thoughts started to permeate my own in real life  kind of like what the Ring did to Frodo  this book did to me  I remember walking down the street with so much hatred to mankind  it was a terrible thing  But partly for that reason Crime and Punishment became one of my favorite books  It was because I got so involved with it  it would be hard to part with it or describe it as anything but great  I doubt it would ever have the same effect  and I don t see reading it anytime soon  But one day I ll pick it up again  and what I ll get out of it will be immensely different I m certain  I always have a trepidation of approaching work considered as a  classic   Not that I would feel any compunction about saying er it s not very good but rather there seems to be too much history around it   particularly in literature  I found this weight appeared more than usual with Dostoevsky s stand out book as it is related to law in the broadest sense  the area of human  knowledge  in which I work  But sometimes all your worries are blown away and the term  classic  is completely appropriate as in this case  A brilliant novel One good sign is that the book surprises you in lots of ways  Even having spent the last couple of years reading the novellas novels of Dostoevsky I still have a picture in my mind of the setting being bleak  dark  wet  cold like Russian winter cold  But this novel is hot   really hot set at the height of summer  early July  in exceptional heat  as the first line of the novel puts it  The crime   a double axe murder which even now in these anaesthetised times is a shocking read   takes place in the smelly  cramped heating setting of a St  Petersburg tenement flat Like most of Dostoevsky s other works to this point it is also unarguably an urban novel   People and cultures are living on top of each other in the city   interacting in lots of chaotic ways  One of the characters is killed by being run over  Again touching on another common theme of Dost the tensions are clear between the strict feudal hierarchy of Tsarist dictatorship and the burgeoning urban life squalor of Russia s biggest city  Immigration is also a reality with many different nationalities mentioned in particular German landlords  One scene has the accent and lifestyles of Germans living in Russia mocked   a very modern development as nation states interact through people In the midst of this world a murder happens  It occurs early in the book and we know the perpetrator  Raskolnikov   a drop out law student living in the archetypal garret room not even a flat  By the end of the work he confesses to the police  And that s about it as far as plot goes  apart some family developments with his sister and his burgeoning relationship with a prostitute Sonya   This is not a who dunnit or even why  duunit this is an exploration of human psychology  interaction and ideas  This is not a sprawling family saga but a tight  rich exploration of humanity in a very contemporary  for 1866  setting  I cannot really understand the phenomenal success of crime fiction   puzzle solving maybe  but everything that could be strong about a crime novel was covered here by Dostoevsky  the thinking of a killer  the consequences of meaningless violence and the ending of human life  Every crime book or the sub genre  apparently  psychological thriller since then that touches on this pales in comparison in my view Dostoevsky even creates a bumbling intellectual detective Porfiry who solves the crime early on  His interactions with Raskolnikov are excellent mind games   Porfriry was apparently the model for legendary TV Detective Colombo  and the structure of each show was broadly based on this work too  which you can see  In fact every cliched detective maverick with a brain  which he s not afraid to use   has some roots in this little man   I m thinking Cracker with his centre piece interviews analysis with the criminals or more obscure Frank Pembleton in Homicide Life On the Streets   a forerunner of the Wire So plot is not really the thing but characters and ideas are  This probably explains why three has been quite a few dramatisations of it   not because of the story but the continuing power of Dostoevsky s creations Some of the ideas explored are pretty basic   why kill someone  What affect does it have on a killer  any  Although Raskolnikov seems to create a motive   the woman he murders is a  hag  and a money lender   he can use the money for a greater good   to re establish himself as a student  tuition fees were about then   and help his widowed mother and sister  Yet he ends up killing an  innocent    the hag s half sister and never spends the money which he steals  In a vague echo of Johnny Cash   is he killing her  just to watch her die  or to see what will be the impact on him  Well it s not good   Raskolnikov retreats into his shell  but life goes on and his attempt to exist with his actions as the banality of life goes on around him is spellbounding to read Along with these fundamental questions there is also a lot of nineteenth century ideological debate  Another powerful aspect of this novel is that the discussion of these concepts neither seemss dated nor contrived  Often in fiction when the author is linking the novel with an idea it seems shoe horned in  For Raskolnikov makes an attempt to intellectually justify the murder of  lesser  people   it is discovered that he has written an academic article  which Porfiry has read  obviously   He argues that exceptional people have the right to overcome their conscience as they have a higher and greater aim  Indeed the greatest people in history have introduced new laws and systems which traduce earlier ones thus they are by necessity turning things on their head  Napoleon is a recurring  and for the time current  example  His greatness and plans allowed him to take endless lives  It is still a symptom of psychiatric illness to believe you are the reincarnation of Napoleon or related to it  This is part of Dost s attack on the Nihilists and Early Utopian Socialists   essentially ascribing Raskolnikov with these views  The ends justify the means at one level but it is a bit more than that   the ends almost require these means  Some have seen this as an attack on Marxism but that is very unlikely as Marx s work was only in limited circles by then  But it is an attack on  modern  or  European  responses to the radically altering world in the nineteenth century  Particularly there are many side swipes at  What is to be Done    the Utopian Socialist Novel For the problem with Raskolnikov is that even though he may believe the great man can do what he wants philosophical action the double murder he has carried out is impossible for him to bear and maintain his grip on reality  The dichotomy of actions that end in people s deaths   it seems easier to do this when ordered from a distance   like Napoleon or even Tony Blair  Interestingly it is the detective Porfiry who outlines the argument from the article to Raskolonikov in another memorable scene Again that highlights the strength of the work it is not a dry academic analysis on the impact on human pschye of killing one or two people  although it is partially that  it is a fast paced work with memorable scene after memorable scene  In many ways like a great piece of cinema There are dark characters found in the grottiest bars in back streets of St Petersburg   one called the Crystal Palace accurately enough  Early in the book he stumbles into a bar room bore drinking his family s money away  He gives a brilliant monologue outlining the tedium  self indulgence and delusion of all drunks  This is so strong I almost hoped it wouldn t be referred to again   just existing as a stand alone piece  But there is a nod to the 19th Century novel plot and the fallen daughter which the drunk refers to becomes entangled in Raskolnikov s life   Sonya A true villain Svidrigailov also exists in the piece   although ironically we don t discover if he actually has killed anyone  though the murder of his wife and others is hinted at  where we do know that Raskolnikov did  He is attempting to seduce and pursue Raskolnikov s sister which he almost does in a chilling scene near the end  He also seems to be a peadophile   marrying a 15 year old in his fifties  grooming other children  Again a very modern  nasty dark truth written about by Dostoevsky  Svidirigailov also kills himself which Raskolnikov cannot bring himself to do  The nature of suicide is something which obsessed Dostoevsky  There is so much in this work  in fact it is a book you could get obsessed with in itself   A disturbing scene where Raskolnikov demands Sonya reads Biblical passages to him  The comical uselessness of Luzhkin   a clerk on the make who manages briefly to convince Raskolnikov s sister to become engaged to him  And of course the creation of Porfiry  All of the work is of its time   St Petersburg 1866   streets  events  people are referred to but also universal Dostoevsky really found his voice with this book   although he had written some strong pieces as I have outlined on this blog  Literally   this is a third person narrative although it follows Raskolnikov almost through every page  he apparently rejected the version where he was the narrator  There are two exceptions to this   near the end the narrative breaks from Raskolnikov to follow Svidrigailov   ending with his death  Also the Epilogue which has a strange distant tone   it follows Raskolnikov  or the criminal as it calls him  to his prison exile   a la Dost himself  and his redemption through Sonya s love and  of course for FD  religion  I am not sure about that ending but it follows Dostoevsky s spiritual belief   the truly dark figure kills himself  It is great when  classics  live up to expectations and I have not really done it justice  In contemporary writers the balance of the very new with the universal is often attempted but never that successfully  Old Dostoevsky shows how it is done  Amazing  Love this book  Nobody suffers like a Russian  Makes you question right and wrong and your own moral code  Raskolnikov is a fantastic riddle of a person  For example  I can understand why Raskolnikov murdered  Dostoyevsky does a good job here   but I don t understand why he turned himself in  But the drama of it all held me spellbound  I found myself thinking about Tom Ripley  another essentially unhappy  but definitely unrepentant  murderer who co opts us into caring about him  just as Raskolnikov does Otherwise  this is Dostoyevsky at his best  A page turner with interesting characters  Sonia  R s family  Razumikhin  Svidrigaylov  the odd and intuitive Porfiry Petrovich  etc   and excellent conversations  Sometimes it is surprisingly antic  e g   the Marmeladov sections  and especially the funeral meal  and Lebeznyatnikov s blabbing and his nonsensical ideas that are deflated by Luzhin of all people   All these characters motor through this book as strong and absorbing presences in themselves     such that the reader is jarred when he she remembers this whole creation rides on top of the basic fact of two murders  What fantastic craftsmanship and art  I suspect that D  put a lot of his own knowledge  based on experience  into this book  but the book is primarily art and not reportage and avoids any temptation to present a program  say  on punishment in contemporary Russia  What a genius P s  I found the Magershack translation quite nice  Very readable and  easy   Sin duda una de las mejores novelas que existen  Dostoievski tiene la vision psicologica aguda y conoce profundamente el corazon humano  Un libro lleno de filosofia y una vision cristana del mundo  Una novela existencial de situaciones extremas y valores notables Was barely at 4 stars by the near end  dreaded finishing   Where can this possibly go   I kept asking myself as R was going to give himself up  But the Epilogue  microbes and all  was unexpected  shocked me twice  and overall  was transcendent   A beautifully written story about a student and his decision to murder a loan shark  At times I could not believe the psychological twists and turns of human chess  I began to wonder if this was a feature of Russian nature or mid nineteenth century thought  Even after 531 pages I am not sure of Raskolnikov s motives  In such a long book  there were plenty of ways to turn the stone over and over and over  Would I torture myself and read The Brothers Karamazov also translated by Pevear  Absolutely  but only with a winter snowstorm raging outside  Dostoevsky s greatest work    one of Western Literature s finest and most disturbing novels  It s almost too much to bear  being inside this man s head and experiencing the wretchedness that surrounds him and finally turns him into a murder  There is a scene at the beginning of this book that concerns an old horse and his master with a whip that is horrific and yet beautiful  god knows why  but it is   And the progression of our main character down the road to nihilism and finally that blankness that allows evil to take root  That s what s at the core of this  So much of the book  of this man s thoughts are banal and silly and who gets to live in what apartment and who s upstairs  and where s the this and the food and who is watching me and on and on         but in the end  what is murder  Who are we as human beings  Just agents of inexorable forces we cannot truly fend off  How much of our natures are controllable  Why do we do what we do  And after  are we redeemable  Is there something special about being a human being  or are we all just ants nipping at each other  Read it  You tell me        Me encanta este libro por el retrato que hace de sus personajes  su psicologia y sus motivaciones    la redencion de Raskolnikov  su viaje personal y como el amor y la aceptacion de Sonia lo van cambiando es una de las historias de amor mas hermosas que he leido a pesar de estar enmarcada en un contexto tan oscuro   This was an assigned reading in high school  but I really enjoyed it  The story  in which a young man commits a horrible crime in an attempt to prove to himself and the world that he is the theoretical Ubermensch  The events leading up to the deed and his subsequent emotional and moral struggles are fantastically written  and the supporting characters do a wonderful job in leading the main character to the novels conclusion  It s not the easiest of reads  but you ll be happy that you undertook it   Didnt expect that a book in 19th century Russia will move so much someone like me that prefers the post modern japanese literature  so I recomend it to everyone nevermind your generel preferations   I didn t realize how much of the book would take place after the crime and before the character s arrest   rather makes me ask whether there is an emphasis on self indictment  or succumbing to social correction    good book  but i m left swinging about the ending  After having completed this book  I desperately needed a moment to capture my thoughts and ponder over all that was within my mind  but it wasn t possible for a long time due to ridiculous distractions such as a number of inspiring thoughts and ideas incessantly colliding with each other in my head in a rapid frenzy It is  however  with a sense of immense excitement and accomplishment that I find it within my heart to be able to put into action a futile attempt at describing the pleasure and rapture I had gained in reading this brilliant work of art The psychological insight into the psyche of 19th century inhabitants of Russia is just as captivating and thought provoking as is the magnified look into impoverished lifestyles and notions from that era I feel it is necessary for me to also list particular instances from the story that had really struck that sentimental chord within me  so please read no further if you haven t read this novel  spoilers ahead   What really touched my heart was the fact that the slightest hint of sanity from Raskolnikov was only witnessed when his friend Marmeladov had died  someone he hadn t even known for a long time  and another occasion when he was convinced that he had loved Sonya and could renew his life completely in seven years  These specific moments brought out a different sense of approach to life within him   Katerina Ivanovna s desire to let the World know that she s from an Aristocratic background was really  really heart wrenching  What makes her poverty worse is that she had already been familiar with a better lifestyle  and yet she finds it in her heart to continue struggling for her children in dire straights   Raskolnikov s realization of having failed in followoing his theory due to a  lack of courage in his convictions   The palpable strong bond between Raskolnikov and his mother and sister  sh chhrm khtb rw khyly sry  khwndh bwdm khh ykhbrh chnd mh khwndnsh rw khnr gdhshtm  khyly Hs  jyby

people would drink their tea  lol More exciting than Anna Karenina and it has more wits but it tends to be more fictitious in anna karenina people think before they talk restraining their anger as much as possible unlike here where people actually get angry yelling curising and restrained from violence by a third party  Although I have some reservations about one or two things  this is one of the best books I have ever read  it is no doubt a masterpiece  Almost gave up on Dostoyevsky until a friend recommended a much better translation  Made all the difference in appreciating how Dostoyevsky weaves description into the narrative thread  arguably more than any other 19th century writer   loved loved loved it   for a treat  after reading this read Strangers On A Train by Patricia Highsmith   An Incredible book and undoubtedly one of my all time favourite classics  The depth of psychology evoked through Dostoyevsky s characters is startling  at once intimate and wholly realistic  This is a clinical depiction of the human psyche which in my opinion has never been so acute in literature  Everybody already knows this a five star book  so I won t iterate some flowerly discussion of the plot or the symbolism or the mind boggling historical affect of Dostoyevsky s works  Instead  here are just a few things I really liked about it 1  I love Sonya  the prostitute with a heart of gold  Forced into a life she does not wish to live so that she can provide for herself and her family  What makes her an extra great character is that she doesn t exist solely as a symbol for the poverty of the time or of the suppression of women  The character herself is extremely nuanced and very real  and though really a secondary character in the novel she seems stand out on her own  I couldn t help but love and feel for her the entire time  2  I like that Dostoyevsky uses his character s dialogue to tell you what the non speaking conversant is doing  I really enjoy the more seamless movement of the dialogue rather than constantly having the omniscent narrator step in to tell you what is happening to the person off sceen 3  The way Dostoyevsky makes you hate and then feel sorry for Raskolnikov within the span of two pages is incredibly impressive  The depth of main character is truly unrivaled  I am a big fan of Victor Hugo but his characters always seem to embody the Platonic Ideal of SOMETHING  Raskolnikov is a man  a flesh and blood human who has a lot going on  I like the  many layers to the onion  approach  because it really makes the character seem so real 4

perfect  I think that either this review or my tears  my rapid beating heart  my admiration or any word of praise I can think off just isn t ENOUGH to even come close to the greatness of this book  I found comfort in it and I found fear  I cried over it and was left speechless  My dear Dostoyevsky  I salute you with awe from the bottom of my heart that recognized this genius piece of art as the greatest book it came across  Existence alone had never been enough for him  he had always wanted more  Perhaps it was only from the force of his desires that he had regarded himself as a man to whom more was permitted than to others   I spent the entire miserable hot summer of 1986 reading and re reading the first 100 pages or so of Crime and Punishment  which essentially details how hot and miserable it is in St  Petersburg in the summer   a psychological journey  written so brilliantly by Dostoyevsky that the reader actually feels the tension and paranoia that the main character experiences  A creepy book  but definitely one that the reader can extract a certain sense of having learned or understood something never before experienced  It s fortuitous that I was reading this book at the same time that we were learning about philosophies in AP European history  This is an amazing books that explores the boundaries between logic and emotions  reason and conscience  Dostoevsky artfully incorporates many ideas of 19th century Russia and Europe into the different characters in the book  Covering a span of only 2 weeks before the Epilogue  the book captivated me at nearly every moment  It put me on the edge of my comfort zone as I felt sorry for a murderer and tried to explore my own true feelings about the serious issues the characters faced Oh look  English class and the teacher s love of this book has poisoned me  But really  this deserves to be a classic     I wouldn t have called the book  Crime   Punishment   I would have instead called it  Love   Compassion  as this book is absolutely full of such things  I ve never been so moved by any work of literature  in my entire life  although to be fair  I haven t read a great deal but I digress  It often felt as though I was the characters themselves   That I was in their shoes and feeling not my own emotions but theirs  And what a rollercoaster of emotions it has been   I ve teared up as well as weeped  the epilogue    I ve smiled as well as laughed and everything inbetween  Perhaps that s in part because I related to many of the blessings and plights within on a personal level but that aside   I feel that it s a masterpiece and that seems to be what masterpieces do  no matter how relateable they may or may not be I feel almost    regretful  As though I have lost something dear to me  merely for having finished the book  although  at least I ll be able to read it again in the future and I most assuredly will   And don t think that I feel unfulfilled in any way because of that feeling  quite the opposite in fact  Not only was it emotionally moving but it was also extremely thought provoking  To say how relatively short it is  at least  the edition I read  the character and plot development was brilliant  in my eyes  I fell in love with many of the characters  even the ones I disliked or hated  I m still trying to process it all  to be honest and I probably will be for some time to come  And now  I simply have to read the rest of Dostoyevsky s works and I d implore you to do the same  I loved this book from the first page  I read it on spanish and English  And i will read it again some day  probably    Raskolnikov it is a fantastic character   I love how Dostoyevsky guides us into this man s mind and soul  we suffer with him    And the dialogues    I even imagined the voices twice i read it  Also enjoyed to read it on a loud voice  so deserves that    I have not much to add  just read and enjoy a unique trip    One thing that recurred throughout my mind time and time again throughout the time that I was reading the novel was how well  how vividly Doestovsky captures the human mind  He doesn t just simply delve into it  If anything  he delivers it to you  He portrays it in its flesh and blood  And shows you  what it really means to be human  It s simply mindblowing how well Doestovsky knows human nature  And to think that this man  wasn t even a psychologist   I especially marveled at how he captured Sonia s despair  and how her only form of hope was conceived from that of religion  which is  in actuality   true of many despairing souls out there   This is a novel highly recommended for anyone willing to ponder the meaning of humanity  conscience  or even crime  Or better yet  anyone really who wants to be left speechless by the craft of Doestovsky s genius  Amazing book  I read it for my literature class in highschool  I was dissappointed to learn that most of my peers did not enjoy the book as much as I did  This was my first introduction into Russian literature  and it was by far a brilliant book  I ll probably be reading more from Dostoevsky  or I ll try Tolstoy   Honestly  I completely loved this book  If it had not be a required book  and I wasn t pressed for time  I would have enjoyed it much more  The plot line was fascinating and I was actually surprised at times  which rarely happens when I read  All in all  I will definitely re read this when I can do so at my own pace and get the most out of it  There are a few books that keep you awake n the middle of the night  and this is definitely one of those It took it some time to intrigue me  it has kind of a slow start  but in the end I couldn t stop reading  I really enjoyed this book  as it was not as difficult to get through as I had expected Great characters  settings  and even plot  though  for me  plot may be the novel s only shortcoming   But the where it really shines are with Dostoyevsky s social theories excellently enterposed with the story A great read  Of course I found it brilliant but alas I have to confess that I am not a fan of heavy Russian novels  I loved them when I was a teenager but it s taken me a month to read this book  Brilliant  My only complaint is that it could have been about a hundred pages shorter and the first third of the book is difficult to get through  the lengthy archaic dialogue filled with an endless array of  seemingly  useless digressions and details  the list of  seemingly  insignificant characters  the tedious nature of scattered internal ramblings   But before the halfway point everything starts falling into place and nothing is nearly as superfluous as it seemed  A Truly meaningful study of human nature and the social construct  Crime and Punishment  like 1984  makes you examine questions that can only have unsavory answers  I will definitely come back to Dostoyevsky   A great book on the soul of man or perhaps it s absence I really liked everything about the book but could not make peace with the favor given to theism Yes I am an atheist maybe not that liberal   Through this book Dostoevsky seems to become more than an atheist or theist he becomes an immortal Genius   This book is a marvel  It takes a very simple incident and weaves a long and complex tale about its implications upon the lives of a those involved  The characters are well drawn and well rounded  Dialogue is honest  if lengthy  Reading this book was long overdue for me  and I was rewarded with a most pleasurable journey  Not my favorite of Dostoyevsky s works    that honor belongs to The Brothers Karamazov    but still a fascinating  chilling read that asks questions we all must try to ponder  If the Brothers Karamazov is  among many other things  to be sure  about a man who did not commit a crime but is tried for it because everyone thinks he did it  Crime and Punishment is coming to grips of the man who did do it but just about everyone thinks he did not  Truly  the crime is a minuscule aspect of the plot  just as the punishment isn t very shown until the very end  The real punishment is psychological  the internal torture of dealing with the reality of one has just done  It s a masterpiece for that reason  the psychological expression of an individual s anguished inner monologue  and the artful way of expressing those thoughts  Here we begin to see one of Dostoyevsky s most distinguishing themes  namely  that what is ultimately good or evil rests not on the external law or popular opinion  but rather on our conscience  that  the conscience is the sternest judge   Our punishment for an evil deed is doled out much more in personal suffering than any prison term can one be sentenced to Aside from the pervasive themes of good evil  conscience  God s will vs  Man s  Dostoyevsky offers some very interesting theory on the nature of crime and power  Rodya believes that a certain extraordinary sect should be above the law  those people intelligent enough to know that the crimes they commit are for the greater good of society  Of course  Porfiry calls him out on this to wonder what makes someone qualified to hold such a position  and how they themselves can be kept in check  Indeed   who will guard the guards   It s a very interesting discussion they have  and one of the most intriguing ideas I ve read  An Idea  a Theory  an attempt to change life is what brought this gloomy young man to committee crimes  the story is about his redemption    I loved it Would surely recommend to anyone  sy sl qbl ynkhh frwyd ty wry hy khwdsh rw dr

pskhgwy yn swlth  The beauty of Russian lit  is that it so often defends what so normally hold to be bad  He gentally reveals the mind of criminal  exposing the thin line we all walk  And the deeper good still triumphs over evil  Really interesting book  lots of great ideas crammed into it  I m never really sure where Dostoevsky stands on the ideas presented in the book  but his characters and sub plots are all fascinating   The perspective of the novel is one in which I truly enjoyed  It was third person omniscient  there were multiple subplots  yet there was a clear connection to the protagonist  Raskolnikov  who committed a crime and had to personally pay the price  Ultimately guilt was his punishment  and this is evident because the majority of the novel was about his internal struggle  His public punishment only comprised the epilogue of the novel  Dostoyevsky clearly connects to his message to his readers and his country  during the time he wrote this novel people were becoming idealistic and philosophical and extremist  that crime cannot be justified and has worse consequences than beneficial gains  Something I have always appreciated and loved very much about Dostoyevsky s novels is the dramatic and radical developments most of his characters have   The Brothers Karamazov  was the first novel I ever read by Dostoyevsky  and I thought  Crime and Punishment  would be a good second novel to advance with  I was right Crime and Punishment is a distressing novel  And it s not a surprise  is it  It s Fyodor Dostoyevsky we re speaking about  The novel has certain moments of joy  of humour  but the rest of the novel is filled with moments of pure greed  Katerina Ivanovna  anyone    indigence  arrogance and  sometimes  moments that indirectly disclose the terrifying darkness that inhabits man s heart  The plot is basically the following  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is a meagre drop out college student who lives in a tiny garret on an apartment located in St  Petersburg  He is different from most underprivileged people you d know  though  He dresses with filthy and ragged clothing  but Raskolnivok is a handsome  tall  smart and good looking young man whom is also arrogant and feels he possesses a large sense of entitlement  Raskolnikov despises people  he despises society as it is  he s asocial  antisocial and he attempts to avoid people at all costs  This particular attitude of his reminded me very much of Ivan Karamazov  from  The Brothers Karamazov   Ivan was intelligent  cold and distant  much like Raskolnivok  Unlike Ivan  however  Raskolnikov loathes society and people not because of the barbarity and cruelness that abides in the world as Ivan did  Raskolnikov s motives are solely because of his own arrogance  conceitedness and his self indulged thought of being superior to everyone else  He s arrogant and prepotent  but since he doesn t involve himself with society  he couldn t possibly harm anyone  could he  Wrong  This is where our  indirect  second protagonist comes  This person isn t a protagonist in the sense that we see much of them  that we see them constantly interact or that we re able to know what they think or feel  No  this person is a main protagonist in the sense that because of this person  most of the plot and the novel is a constant roller coaster of drama  affliction and darkness  This person is an elderly woman named Alyona Ivanovna  Alyona Ivanovna is a pawnbroker who tends to make the miserable more miserable than they already are and to snatch them from the little money they have  She has a thirty five year old sister named Lizaveta whom she  Alyona  has enslaved to clean  cook and do house chores  Alyona is a woman with a repulsive nature  constantly beating up her sister and constantly degrading people and  much like Raskolnikov  has a high sense of self worth  Raskolnikov utterly loathes her because of her ways  until he has enough  This is where it gets good  When we hate someone  we usually think awful things about them and probably speak behind their backs  But that s about it  Raskolnikov takes the notion of loathing to a whole new level  He doesn t only think awful things about her  and he doesn t speak behind her back  he plots on murdering her  And he does On a different note  something that I liked very much was the introduction of Marmeladov and his family  I thought that he would be a minor character  but I was wrong  You know how Dostoyevsky is  everything has to be filled with misery and ache  In Chapter II we re introduced to Marmeladov  Katerina Ivanovna  his wife whom married him out of misery because of her being a widow  Katerina s three children and Marmeladov s daughter  Sonya  Throughout the development of the novel  we re able to learn more about this dysfunctional and miserable family   view spoiler   We learn the progress about the sad ending of the ruined Marmeladovs  a family that includes their drunk husband  Marmeladov  trampled to death in the streets  whom is also noble enough to recognise he s the root of his family s problems  but too egoistical to do something about it  a proud  greedy and consumptive mother  Katerina Ivanovna  reduced to constantly beating her three children and begging to the rich  and an older daughter  Marmeladov s daughter  Sonya  whom is forced into prostitution to support her family  Sonya is probably the most loving character of the story besides Dunya  Raskolnikov s sister  Sonya s suffering and devotion to her family stands out remarkably against this backdrop of utter despair  She has long understood and accepted her identity and role  despite the cruel and crushing reality of her life   hide spoiler  Ultimately  Raskolnikov and Marmeladov s daughter Sonya  bond and he  since she is damaged and so is he  attempts to compare himself to Sonya  but the difference between them is that Sonya turned to prostitution to help her family  and she truly laments her sin  while Raskolnikov hasn t repented his crime  confessed his crime or lamented his sin  He can t realise that what she s doing is selfless while what he did was solely self serving  The cause of his murders was unclear for most of the novel  but almost in the end we re able to find out why he did it  To understand we review his Crime article  He explained some men were above and superior to the rest of mankind  therefore they had the right to break moral codes  one of them being the notion of being able to commit murder  Nearly the end of the novel we realise that he murdered Alyona Ivanovna because his self absorption fuelled his actions  He wished to prove he was somehow extraordinary and so superior he could break moral codes that bind ordinary people  Yet  his development after the murder only proves he is completely pathetic and a sad excuse for a human being  He murderer Alyona Ivanovna because of self absorption and he murderer Lizaveta because of the mere egoistical purpose of not wanting to get caught  Here we realise how truly selfish and self serving Raskolnikov really is  He constantly tried to justify his main murder  saying Alyona s life was worthless while his wasn t  so it wasn t worth confessing  He involved himself with society after the murders so he could find faults in society and attempt to justify his main murder  In the beginning  he had a side of him that felt repulsed by the idea or murdering Alyona  yet the other side of him begged for it until he finally did it  All I was able to conclude about Raskolnikov was that he was a major coward  In general  the novel is filled with distress and much pain  but in the end  Raskolnikov falls in so much love with Sonya that he confesses his murders to her  and she supports him and urges him to confess to the law  When he confesses the murders  he s imprisoned in Siberia to eight years of hard labour  He confesses everything to the judges  yet  after so much Raskolnikov has gone through  and everything in his life has changed  there is one thing that hasn t changed  His pride  Raskolnikov continues to justify his murder to himself  he continues insisting that what he did wasn t a crime nor a sin  it was a simple mistake  Raskolnikov never repented the crime  He always justified his action  and I believe this sends a strong social message because so many people are like this today  Being able to kill remorselessly  only feeling guilt because of what will happen to them  and yet  never being able to understand that what they did was indeed wrong  I loved the novel because it had a strong sense of anguish and malaise  Dostoyevsky basically wrote in a novel the social issues they had back then in the 1880s and the social issues we continue to have to this day  The constant battle of right and wrong  good and bad  the constant battle of justice and the battle of doing the right thing  Which is why I have to say it was an amazing novel  and that it is definitely worthy of being called by critics Fyodor Dostoyevsky s first masterpiece  A detailed anatomy of human soul rwy   kthr mn ry     twDH kyf  n t nyb lDmyr mn  shd  nw  l qb  wn lnsn

lighting up in the poverty stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book  The rich psychological portraiture of the novel  and even its characters and the several subplots running through the book  present an elaborate dissection of a certain type of criminal mind  as that of the protagonist Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov  There is his moral reservation  hesitation and terror reflecting in the heroine  the voice of reason in the devoted friends  the exaggerated perfection of his radical premises in the two villains  the species

bring to bear on the his type of criminal mind  And what is this  a pathetic fumbling delusional murderer  brooding and sarcastic but with kindness and nobility in his heart  It is a first art to make this premise plausible  and then  after  to make it agreeable and sympathetic    Prest plenie i nakazanie  zaplashvashe da ostane nedochetena  osobeno sled dvata neuspeshni opita predi niakolko godini

time getting interested in the novel  Part 1 really dragged as the Raskolnikoff planned a murder  However  after the murder is committed  it really got intriguing  Other characters begin to emerge and the interplay between them got complicated and weird  It might be helpful to know a little bit about the predominant philosophies in the intellectual community of Russia during the 1800 s  There are long discussions about these philosophies throughout the book that can be confusing and mysterious if you don t have some basic knowledge of them  mgh myshh khmtr z pnj strh bh yn khtb dd    mgh myshh

and as the book progressed  I felt myself sympathizing with Raskolnikov and even agreeing with the psychology of his actions  My perceptions of crime were twisted and stretched into another dimension of thinking  The conversations  in particular  with Raskolnikov and Porfiry contained some of the most interesting thoughts  and at certain times  I even came to fear Porfiry  The characters were also all very lifelike  in part because of the universal connections of suffering  The style of Crime and Punishment was also written unlike few other books that I ve ever read  containing a terse  clear tone that English teachers always try to encourage students to use while writing essays  Because of this  I was able to visualize the dark world Dostoevsky was weaving and see many of the events in the book clearly and was even surprised by some of the plot twists  I cringed when Raskolnikov brought the axe down on Lizaveta and I shivered when Svidrigailov trapped Dounia in the tiny room  The delirium and fear of Raskolnikov s own mind further highlighted the darkness of the book  Overall  the book was excellent in plot and style  and the ideas it posed were unlike any others I had ever heard  causing me to be thinking and evaluating throughout all 600 pages   I didn t quite like what he did to some of the characters as the narrative approached its end  however  it is a brilliant psychological narrative and you are compelled by the flow of thoughts and events to hang on to just another page  I can t believe it took me almost 30 years to read this book  or at least that I never read it in college  It was a really intense reading experience  and I m shocked that a book written so long ago in such a different culture than my own has the power to keep me flipping pages and move me like this one does  I read the Constance Garnett translation  and I hear the others are better  but this one was free  so there you have it  It was shockingly modern seeming  and funny  and relevant  and it is just really hard to believe that it was written at such a remove from the present  Also I ve just joined a Russian book club  book club  4   and am so excited about catching up on the Russian classics  On the other hand  at tonight s meeting  there was a young man who seemed to really identify with Raskolnikov and he was a little scary  As in  I made sure he left the library way before I did  He was totally into the idea that the rules only applied to some people and that other  ubermensch can do what serves them best  That is not the takeaway message you are supposed to get from this book  Right  RIGHT  Part of my great pleasure in re reading C P  for the first time since college  was in escaping from my environment  a 4 day power outage following the Blizzard of February 2013 to Raskolnikov s  St  Petersburg  Russia  during the hottest summer of the 19th century    One of the best books I ve read  I expected a dull and way too long book on some boring topic  but it was a real page turner and I found myself staying up in the middle of the night  although I had the flu  reading it  There are several different stories in the book but they are all very nicely mapped out and connected to each other and the overall themes in the book  The characters are some of the best I have ever read of  and I was surprised of the happiness that permeates them and the story  even if their lives  the events and the setting are so utterly depressing  as I imagine it is in most 19th century stories   rwy  ry     z jny fyh blfSwl l khyr   n lmtrjm qm bHdhf kthyr mn lnqsht lflsfy  w llh   lm lmdh  Remarkable novel  A notch below his  Brothers Karamazov  and Tolstoy s  War   Peace   but still an absolutely superb work of realistic  philosophical fiction  The depth  wit  insight  honesty  and vulnerability in the characters made them both pitiable and admirable at once  And that ending    wow  What an author  They just don t make  em like this anymore    Again  I read this in my teens  so it has been as while  However  something I love about the nineteenth century is the constant introspection at work within its writers  This seems true of most writers regardlesss of geograhical location  Through this introspection a hundreded questions arise and it is fabulous   So much better than Tolstoy  Not as drab and Russian It s basically Hamlet meets pre Communist Russia meets Neitszche s theory of the Uber mensch  I had a couple other things when I read it way back in highschool  but overall that sums it up  Kinda However  not a good book to read in a very short period of time more or less in one sitting while taking notes and facing an all day rehearsal of  Oklahoma   Ouch  I enjoyed this book from the beginning  I expected it to be long a a bit dry  While there were aspects that grated a bit on the nerves  I fully enjoyed this book and hesitate to reread in  only because I fear that on re reading it might lose some of the magic it still holds in my mind from my first reading  An excelent performance especially by Eduard Cupak  as narrator   Josef Vinklar as Svidrigajlov and Josef Somr as Marmeladov and Rudolf Hrusinsky st  as Porfirij I was a little bit disappointed by Vaclav Postranecky as Raskolnikov  I loved the Constance Garnett translations of all of the Dostoyevsky I read  I was just reading that Sidney Monas has the most accurate translation of Crime and Punishment  however  so I might have to check that out  I m not a huge fan of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky  despite all of their awards  I ll probably give them another chance at some point  Some favorite quotes from the book   You think i am attacking them for talking nonsense  Not a bit  I like them to talk nonsense  That s man s one privilege over all creations  Through err you come to the truth  I am a man because i err     Razumihin Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery    Svidrigailov  One can always forgive lying  lying is a delighful thing  for it leads to truth     Razumihinand finally  Look at them running to and fro about the streets  everyone of them a scoundrel and criminal by heart and   worse still  an idiot But try to get me off and they d be wild with righteous indignation Oh  how i hate them all    Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov  Raskolnikov  a god in his own eyes  tries to bend reality into his mold but doesn t understand why it won t fit  His journey through the book seems to be a picture of a man devoid of God I believe I am not objective enough in my reading  as it was a struggle to truly draw from this book some great and noble thread of truth  a lesson to be passed on for the ages  It isn t that they weren t there  Life was depicted clearly  and as such the lessons of life abound within the book  but it was disheartening reading the book  so much that it was a difficulty to overcome the depression that seeped from its pages  Even when punishment is dealt  still there is only the empty feeling of self righteousness  depression abounding still rather than delight at evil being found out  as more evils take its place I rated it five stars  because how real it seemed  how clearly it seemed to show man without God  I loved this book  I really appreciate Dostoevsky s interesting female characters  even when they re a little flat  like Sonia   and I like that this is a psychologically driven  rather than plot driven  novel  The other driving force behind this novel is the Orthodox idea that happiness is only achieved through suffering  Raskolnikov  the main character  suffers greatly    his own pride almost destroys him  The portrayal of human pride is really believable  as we see Raskolnikov cracking under the horror of what he has done  while at the same time holding onto a sort of infantile rage that his plans were thwarted  and that he s not the hero he thought he was  Sonia brings him hope  and although the epilogue is totally unconvincing  I still like happy endings  I wish I knew Russian just so I could read this in its original language   a true masterpiece  The style of the writing is in certain ways a bit old fashioned  of course  Characters often speak uninterrupted for paragraphs at a time  The way that chapters frequently end with cliffhangers is probably now considered overly manipulative  And the epilogue seems to tie the story up more neatly than modern readers have come to expect and prefer  But generally  there s not much issue for a person reading this book today vs  one reading it around the time it was first published  In fact  one of the things I prefer about Dostoyevsky s style is the amount of detail he provides in each scene  He gives just enough to paint a clear picture in the reader s mind without slipping into that zone of information overload that so many contemporary novels are unable to avoid  Beyond my stylistic observations  what Crime and Punishment represents is one of the most thorough explorations of human psychology I have ever encountered  That this psychology exists within such an entertaining story is the novel s great accomplishment  and I hope to discover similar achievements in the next of the author s work that I intend to read  The Brothers Karamazov  At a point in your life you began to realize the obligation you have towards classics  you just owe it to yourself to read Dostoyevsky  i picked this one for i have set a goal to read whatever classics i can put my hands on  and i couldn t feel better i m even proud of myself there s a hint of pleasure and accomplishment running through my veins while writing this because honestly Fyodor is MIND BLOWING  Spoiler Alert  this is a short review only contained leading characters  in my opinion   view spoiler  Story takes place in ST Petersburg Russia  Raskolnikov a former student is the leading character in the story  he s smug  arrogant delusional and a divided character  troubled young man who his pride and intelligence leads him into thinking he s superior to the rest of mankind  he believes the world falls into two categories  Superior  special people who can do whatever they want with no law of moral boundaries and second class who had everyone else  He believes he can break the rules in this case commit murderer for higher purposes  such as doing good and helping humanity with what he steals  so Raskolnikov murders the pawn keeper Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta her step sister  however guilt torments him and he believes he s not a Napoleon material  the idea of confessing torments him through the whole book  while reading i came to the conclusion he is crazy  even tho he thinks about confessing but not for the sake of being guilty for murdering the pawn keeper  he remains convinced that his crime was justified  Raskolnikov s relationships with the other characters in the novel do help in understanding of his conflicted personality  Although he cares about Razumikhin  Pulcheria Alexandrovna  and Dunya  Raskolnikov is so caught up in his own head to the point he never notices their attempts to help him  He finds Sonya  his connection to Sonya was due to him thinking she s a sinner like him but what he fails to understand that Sonya s sin is selfless she sacrifices herself to help her parents and her three siblings but he essentially commits his crime for his sake alone to prove his theory  Sonya is a quite poor devoted girl who sacrifices herself prostituting for the sake of her family  Sonya  in her infinite capacity for understanding  begins to care deeply for him  She is not horrified by his crimes  but rather  concerned for his soul and mental well being  urges him to confess Dunya is Raskolnikov s sister also one of the main characters in the novel  She is intelligent  proud  beautiful  and strong willed  she is the strongest female character in the novel  neither as crushed by poverty nor as timid as Sonya Svidrigailov is as conflicted as Raskolnikov  first he s represented as a villain  he murders his wife  attempted to rape Dunya  tries to marry a 16 years old girl but still we witness Svidrigailov perform goods deeds  such as giving money to the family of his fiancee  to Katerina Ivanovna and her children  and to Dunya  Although he is a violent and sneaky and dishonest snake he s some how capable of doing good  when Dunya rejects him  Although the painful realization that she will neverlove him forces him into committing suicide    hide spoiler    Consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis  of a new view of life and of his future resurrection  This story isn t about who killed the pawn keeper  that we know form the beginning it s about poverty  redemption  pride love understanding and forgiveness i cried at the end not because it was sad but because it couldn t have ended in a better way   I couldn t possible be more impressed with this book  As far as I m concerned  this novel is a masterpiece  and Dostoyevsky is a genius  I can rarely recall being so consumed and involved by such a remarkable and powerful text   I ve read this book twice  once in Romanian and once in English   The first time I picked the wrong version on goodreads  for some reason only the audiobook version pops up when you search this book   I recently read Dostoevsky s novel Crime and punishment and greatly enjoyed it  This is not a review  Just some notes   Crime and Punishment is  in a way  an exploration of what happens when you stretch a theory to the extremes   But I do not know philosophy that well to decide if the theory itself is extreme or if it is being stretched  so you decide         The novel explores the life of Raskolnikov  a very intelligent but poor student who is consumed by the ideas of his times like utilitarianism and nihilism that propel him down the slippery slope path of murder  convincing himself that a murder is noble when it is good for the society at large  When Alexander the Great kills thousands presumably for the good of the society at large  why can t he too murder  That is the motive behind the murder committed by the protaganist    How bizarre  extravagantly fantastic and out of the world this idea is  I feel like a baby when I consider my own thoughts and ideas in comparison with something as big and lunatic as that  Even when we have all the philosophy behind a crime like murder  as Dostoevsky captures in his lucid and eloquent prose  it is hard to escape the consequences    What fun to read this novel and to go inside the mind of a murderer  the endless  inescapable cycle of various emotions   the guilt that depresses  the reason that struggles to explain  the shame to face your own mother and sister  and the fear of getting caught   is captured so well that it is no surprise when you hear that Dostoevsky is a master of psycho analyses  Even the unreal  almost fantasmogorical idea of murder gets real and believable when buttressed with such compendious analyses   Character development is remarkable  Surprisingly  in this big book  there are not too many characters  The story revolves around only a handful of them  Doctor that helps to theorize and explain the workings of mind  the family members and the lover who bind Raskolnikov to society   in a way  force him away from his nihilism  and finally throw him a lifeline of love  his friend Razumikhin  his sister s fiance  his sister s ex employer are all excellently developed  believable characters  Above all  the investigator Porfiry Petrovich s character is very well sketched and developed   his understanding of crime  criminals and his experience that shows in his patience and supremely clever attempts to find out the truth during his investigations of Raskolnikov   The plot is divided into two parts  first  crime  second  punishment  There are plenty of twists  and scenes full of suspense and intrigue just as any crime novel would have  I have not been a big fan of crime detective novels  but this novel just shatters any fixed   unbaked  idea about this genre  Crime novels can be written in such compelling  engaging manner   it is as much about life  love  ideals as about money  murder  police and death  Just like any good art  Crime and punishment transcends any artificial boundaries of genres   If not anything  at least the investigation scenes involving Porfiry Petrovich and Raskolnikov alone needs a special mention  It is some of the best  very intelligently written scenes I have ever read  When we know who the killer is  the investigator knows who the killer is  the killer knows that the investigator knows  it all comes down to the technicality of proof  You must read to see how Dostoevsky handles these situations  What a fine read  Greatly recommend
