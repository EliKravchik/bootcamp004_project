rating and attempting to review this timeless masterpiece of classic literature  I guess artists are doomed to be eternally judged by those to whom their work is exposed  even centuries after their time  You think Goethe even imagined that after two and a half centuries a Greek nobody would  not talk  about his Faust in a  non place  called internet  I know I may be getting a bit weird here but hey  I just read Faust  What did you expect Anyway  I think it s one of the best literary works ever created  The way Goethe used alternating styles in his writing was genius  The scene on Walpurgis Night is one of the most trippy  psychedelic  out there things I ve ever read  But the most impressive is the concept itself  With the catharsis only foreshadowed but never played before your eyes  you feel in every rhyme that Faust is nothing but a puppet in the hands of  himself   higher powers  Trapped by his own will to live  to fly high and his tendency to stay stuck on the ground  he becomes a vulnerable victim for our friend Mephistopheles  And a strange journey begins   Ok  I surpassed myself here  Just one more thing  I d like to say that reading Faust after midnight by the fireplace with the only source of light being the fire and the lights on the Christmas tree  is one hell of experience Cheers  dr aGz khlmh bwd     nh  rwH bwd     nh    dr aGz  ml bwd     pyn nql z

humanity gained confidence in their ability to define the world objectively  In turn  the old  established picture of a world as the centre of the cosmos was knocked off its pedestal  the divine core of humanity became mechanistic  the human heart was no longer the seat of love and intellect  but a machine like organ circulating the life force of a larger machine  The whole perspective of the medieval mind was disintegrating  The soul had lost ground  becoming impenetrably mysterious as a consequence of the externalizing forces of the new science which shrank the domain of metaphysics down to the size of a small  aporia ridden pinhead  And what resulted from this was a terrifying picture of infinite space  the unbounded reaches of a godless expanse  The human mind was cast out into that wilderness and  in most cases  disheartened by its new freedom  retreated back to the comforts of old beliefs  to the perfectly crafted bubble of geometric simplicity that gave human life a soul and salvation  But for those who dared to know  those like Faust  the threshold had been lifted seemingly into a profound  endless space of longing  Even the greatest  most stalwart minds would be crushed by such a force of uncertainty  For even the once potent idea of free will languished there  tethering itself to the darkness of infinite space  and failing to seize the boughs of an intersecting ontological plane  latched back onto the machinery of a perfectly deterministic cosmos  reducing the most formative human compact  that between subject and object  inner and outer space  to a tormenting machine of externalizing simulacra  The human mind  fallen into this morass  confronted a new point of departure  the old ways of redemption were no longer viable  the individual  on his own  was left to invent new means for making life meaningful  Not an easy task  It is essentially humanity taking over the job once reserved for God  and it is this fact  humanity s temptation to replace its old idols and seize its autonomy  that gives Faust its literary force  Goethe s play obviously deserves 5 stars and then some  It is eloquent  inventive  mythic  and extremely weird  and at times even absurd  But this translation by Stuart Atkins felt pedestrian  the poetry of the work is predominantly prose like  and yet it cycles in and out of meter and slant rhymes  so you constantly feel at war with your aesthetic judgement of the translation  For first time readers of this play  I would recommend Walter Kaufmann s translation  which cuts out most of part II  which to be perfectly honest does drag on quite a bit  becoming needlessly exotic and meandering  and has much more of a continuous poetic flavour  I can only assume that means it is closer to Goethe s original  since I don t know any German  save for the interesting philosophical terms I ve imbibed whilst reading Kant  Schopenhauer and Hegel  oh and the primitive lager beckoning sentences I ve learned during visits to the country  But to return to the theme  Faust  who has grown weary of science and theology  turns to magic  and finding that unsatisfactory  considers suicide but at the last minute has a change of heart   Already we have much of the existentialist oeuvre in the first few pages   In steps Mephistopheles who  with his impulsive appetite for pleasure and chaos  is like a giant id projection  in the opening pages he makes a wager with God that he can pull good old studious Faust over to the dark side  and once he appears  first as a poodle  he temps Faust into a bargain  If M can get F to become contented with life by pursuing pleasure  F will give himself over to the devil  And so the drama ensues  Faust falls in love  loses his love  and then embarks on a strange odyssey during Part II  which Goethe wrote over a period of decades  hoodwinking an emperor  and then finally  after much uncertainty and disappointment  finds a form of contentment  the cold  staring into the abyss sort   having returned to nature and now choosing to use his authority  resources  and intellect to clear a new area for habitation  from this he achieves at long last a sliver of fulfilment  In a sense  Faust finds redemption  not by turning away from that terrifying image of infinite space  that image haunts his existence but also  given enough time  shows him that he must achieve something with his own powers  and that that can only be done in a community  by investing his own intellect and inventive powers in reconstituting the fabric of society  so that there is a harmony between the individual and the society  all very Hegelian  I know   so that the wound which has sent the modern mind reeling into a pointless defile of space returns drenched in the knowledge of the ineffable  aware  awake  but directed towards purposeful  integrating work At least that s how I read the play  It s a magnificent allegory myth of the modern condition  and even though Thomas Mann has offered his own  more updated version of the Faust myth  Goethe s still retains its poignancy  especially today when we all seem to be bargaining on a daily basis with various forms of entertainment and social media which  like Mephistopheles  hold out the promise of a redeeming contentment which  big surprise  never come through  We all are faced with Faust s problem  and to find redemption we too must look inward and not flinch from the horror of an endless expanse of nothingness  and simply let it be a reminder of what happens when we turn away from challenges and withdraw into a ferociously isolated egotistical interior that disconnects us from a larger whole  of integrity between subject object  where the meaning of our work and talents might be reflected back to us  and yes  even grant us salvation  possibly   khms  njwm blTb  lyst tqyym lfwst    wmn kwn Sl Hty qym fwst w n lm y jbny  ml ljwth fl yb lys fy l ml nm fy lmtlqy   nm hy ltrjm  lry    llktb w lm l trjm

twny nmybynm This contains both Faust part 1 and part 2 and its a play that was something special to read mostly because Goethe s prose was so poetic  great use of languge  words  That and its a very smart classic in its use of ancient Greek Roman myts literature  It was never hard  challenging to read because the alliusions  references didnt feel forced  too abstract except early in Faust part 2  The first two acts of the second part was little harder to read and too much going on at once  That was the only reason i thought about rating this book 4 stars and not 5 because the rest was brilliant writing The satire that attacked religion  other power sources and most of Goethe s enemies was a big highlight and much more interesting than the surface story of Faust and his dealings with the devil  It was hard to care about Faust because he was typical romantic literature period arrogant hero without the human sides weaknesses of say Werther  Mephistopheles kept the story interesting with his wit and magical powers  The burlesque games  humor was an interesting contrast against the clever construction of the play with all the symbolism  literary games   Anyone can read Faust but who can really say that he understand it  I know I don t  For those who seek a little bit enlightenment on this subject  I can recommend the book by Rudolf Steiner  Goethe s Secret Revelation and The Riddle of Faust  and  of course  his other books about Goethe  I really adore this book  I have nothing to say  Amazing    Faust  Goethe nin siirsel olarak kaleme almis oldugu tiyatro metnidir  Faust 1 ve 2 olmak uzere iki bolumden ve bu bolumlerin alt perde ve sahnelerinden meydana gelir  Gerek metnin uzunlugu gerekse mekansal ve dil unsurlari olarak tiyatro metninin ustunde bir yapisi oldugunu soylemek gerekir  Ani olarak degisen mekanlar  karakter coklugu bu dusunceyi destekledigi gibi kitabi okumayi zorlastiran faktorlerden bir tanesidir  Bundan yola cikarak Goethe nin bu kitabi bir tiyatro metninden ziyade kendi hayatini aksettirmek istedigi ana bir metin olarak gormek mumkun   Bunu kanitlar nitelikte kitabin yazim asamasinin Goethe nin butun hayatini icerdigi ve ancak 83 yaslarinda olmesine ramak kala tamamlayabildigini goz onune almaliyiz   Siirsellikle birlikte doruk noktasina ulasan Goethe nin imgeleme  benzetme dunyasini aralayan ve zaman zaman orada kaybolmamiza yol acacak kadar kapsamli ve teferruatli bir kitap  Dogu bati yayinlarindan cikan baskisindaki dipnotlar metin icindeki atiflarin neyi icerdigini anlamak konusunda yardimci oluyor  Cogu yerde eksik kalsa da okuyucuyu yonlendirmek acisindan onemli aksi takdirde kitabin anlasilma olasiliginin dusecegini belirtmek gerekir  Bu benzetme ve imgelemeler cok genis bir sahayi kapsadigini soylemek mumkun  Eski yunan mitolojisinden  dogu kaynaklarina  cagdasi bati dusuncesinden  butun Avrupa kultlerine kadar her sey kitabin icerisinde kullanilmis  Bu sekilde bakilinca Goethe nin kiymet dairesi ve hazinesi daha da berraklasiyor  Goethe nin herhangi bir eseri okumadan once akla gelebilecek abartildigi dusunceleri kitapla birlikte hayranliga ve diger kitaplarini da okumaya tesvik edici bir unsura donusuyor  Kitabin icerigine deginmeden once Goethe nin dogu bati divani da basta olmak uzere diger eserlerinde bulunan islami esintiler  cogu defa abartilarak yazari Musluman yapmaya kadar goturulse de  dogu dunyasina olan yakinligini gostermesi acisindan onemlidir  Bu genelde bizden bir haber olan batili yazarlara karsin Goethe nin kapsamaya calistigi toplulugun genisligini gosterir  Bircok dilde Kuran tercumesi okumasi  peygamber hayatini derinliklerine kadar incelemesi  bazi yerlerde Kurani yaklasimi benimseyip hakkini teslim etmesi ama gene sonucunda kendi gorusu cercevesindeInsan  Isa nin eseginiGoturseydi Mekke yeOlmazdi daha terbiyeliBilakis esek kalirdi yine  Mealindeki sozleri soylemesi modern dunya da dilimize pelesenk ettigimiz evrenselligin en onemli orneklerinden bir tanesidir  Tekrar kitabin sinirlari icerisine donecek olursak  kitap ile ilgili bir cok kapsamli elestiri ve yorum cihetindeki kitaplarinin varligindan haberdar ama iceriklerinden yoksun olarak   benim kavradigim kadariyla Dr Faust uzerinden Goethe bilimin sinirlarini zorlayan  akli ile elde ettigi bilgilerle yol alamadigini anlayinca farkli arayislara giren  bu ugurda yalnizlasan ve turlu denemeler sonunda buyuculukte karar kilan bir insanin trajedisidir  Bu sekilde cagdasi dusunurlerin ve genelde bati toplumunun icerisine dustugu bunalimlari betimlemekte ve ozelestirisini yapmaktadir Ah  iste felsefe  hukuk  tip    Ve maalesef  ilahiyati da fazlasiyla okudum Hem de atesli bir cabayla Ama ben iste yine ayniyim Neden eskisinden daha akilli degilim  Bilim ile elde ettiklerini begenmeyen  onlari hor goren Faust hakikati kavrayamamaktan muzdarip bir haldeyken  tanri dan izin alan seytan onu yolundan dondermek icin harekete gecer ki faustun bu durumundan tanri memnundur  seytanla kani ile imzaladigi bir anlasma yapar  Bu antlasmaya gore seytan onun hizmetkari olur ki bu durum kitaptaKan oldukca onemli bir ozsudur Ver elini o halde  Eger bir gun ben sana soyle dersem  Dur  bekle bir anlik  ne kadar guzelsin Beni istersen zincire vurabilirsin O an yerin dibine girmeye raziyim O benim son gunum olacak Senin de gorevin son bulacak Belirtildigi uzere o zamana dek surecektir  Seytanin yapmak istedigi dunyevi hazlar ile Faustu yoldan cikarmak ve bu sekilde tanriyla girdigi iddiayi kazanmaktir Burada kitabin iki mihenk tasinin Faust 1 ve 2 de ayri ayri islenen Gretchen ve Helena oldugunu ve Faustun onlarla olan ask iliskisi anlatildigini soyleyelim  Bu olay orgusu cevrcevesinde ahlaki olan sorgulanmakta  insan ile seytanin varolustan itibaren devam eden cekismesi derinlemesine anlatilmakta ve bu durum bazen mantiki olarak bazen vicdani olarak yapilan muhasebelerle pekistirilmektedir  seytan gorevini icra ederken insan ona bazen ayak uydurmakta bazen pisman olmakta bazen ise umursamamaktadir  bu durumlarin herbirine yakinen sahit olmamazi saglayan Faustun hayati insanlik tarihinin bir ozeti seklinde de algilanilabilir   l ykhf   l

Faust  The inclusion of footnotes and interpretive notes provide information on allusion to other text and conversation Geothe held with other writer that many reader may not recognize without the inclusion of these notes  As a musicology major I found these notes especially helpful in developing a deeper understanding of Geothe s influences and writing style  Splendid  excellent  and fun  as if Dr Seuss grew up  lost his religion and his certainty  and decided to debate himself for 250 pages as to whether happiness  satisfaction  and successful striving is even possible without immense frustration and despair ruining it all  Is there a balance  A modern dilemma  told with lots of humor and irreverence  which I didn t expect Kaufmann s version seems near perfect  and it s got the German side by side with English  which is great because you only have to read half the book    It reads like disillusionment  with Faust  after half a lifetime of academic and scientific pursuits  sort of gives up and says WTF  to what end   I tried to cure the plague and couldn t  am miserably dissatisfied  but I can t change myself or my outlook or my lofty dreams  Mephisto bets the Lord that Faust will never be satisfied despite all the pleasures and magic that he can bestow  but the Lord has faith in Faust that he will appreciate life  We find out who wins the bet in Part II Before that Faust manages to get it on with Margaret slash Gretchen  Delight  hand wringing  and near tragedy ensues  Will love satisfy him  Is there such a thing Plenty of knocks on reason  the church  the masses  and I suppose striving for God like omnipotence and omniscience as well  Interestingly  and perhaps what gives the book further modern significance   Toward the end there is quite a bit of praise for Freedom A quote to finish  a good example of rhyme and theme Should he go  or should he come All decision has grown numb In the midst of well paved placesHe reels  groping  in half paces As he sinks and is more thwarted Everything grows more distorted Burdening himself and others Breathing deeply  he yet smothers Not quite smothered  not quite dead Not resigned  but full of dread Ceaselessly he alternates  Yields  resenting  must  but hates Liberated  then enmeshed Barely sleeping  unrefreshed He is pinned down in his cellAnd prepared to go to hell  fy lbdy  yjb  n ykwn hnk jz

very much but it kind of came about long way round as I got sidetracked by the opera in several forms before I settled in and finished the book  It remains one of my favorites though for that very reason and I love listening to my various opera CDs based on the story  A TOP SHELF review  originally published in the October 9  2015 edition of The MonitorSometimes called the  Gothic Shakespeare   Johann Wolfgang Goethe looms large over German and world literature  Born in 1749  Goethe lived a breathtakingly ambitious and stellar life  learning multiple languages  practicing law  serving as a statesman  receiving a noble title  carrying out scientific research and writing some of the most enduring literary pieces in nearly every major genre Arguably his most influential work was  Faust  Part One   a closet tragedy  i e   one not meant to be actually performed on stage  published in 1808 after three decades of intermittent writing  an early draft of the play  known as the  Urfaust   was discovered in the late 19th century   Based on the story of the itinerant alchemist known in English as John Faustus  who reputedly made a deal with Satan to wield dark magic   Faust  Part One  centers on the scholar Heinrich Faust  a learned man whose studies have left him hollow and searching for something transcendent beyond the pages of his books The first impulse of Faust is to seek the answer in something spiritual  something magical  But Mephistopheles has made a wager with God along the lines of what s found in the book of Job  he ll bend this wise man to his will  earning his soul  Now  Faust has realized that an afterlife means nothing if he cannot feel anything in this life  As a result  when the Devil appears to tempt him  the scholar makes a deal  If the sovereign of the damned will do everything Faust commands on earth  he will serve him for all eternity in hell  The only concession made is that if something Mephistopheles gives him pleases the scholar enough  he will be killed in that instant to preserve its memory forever Then begins a descent into depravity that rivals any ever portrayed Eventually the whims of Faust lead him to desire a maiden named Gretchen  However  her demonic seduction drives her to poison her mother to be with the man she s obsessed with and then drown their illegitimate child  Imprisoned for murder  she comes to her senses and refuses to escape with the aid of Faust and Mephistopheles  Accepting her punishment  she is declared redeemed by heaven Written in timeless verse  well translated by both Kauffman and Luke    Faust  Part One  is definitely an example of Sturm und Drung    Storm and Drive    a Romantic literary movement in which individual subjectivity and emotion were highly valued to balance the extreme rationalism of the Enlightenment  Scientific learning  Goethe demonstrates  must be weighed in the context of the human heart  used for good or ill  Dispassionate and logical reason does not truly exist    for women and men  it always  d evolves into  meta physical concerns  Anyone can read Faust  but who can really say that he understand it  I know  I don t Sa amenalakonik ow im kartsik ov

Posthuma  Perpetuareeks   en ik ben volkomen blij en gelukkig  Wat een boek  Wat een schrijver  Wat een vertaling  Deels is het verhaal wel bekend  de in het leven teleurgestelde dr  Faustus  snakkend naar wereldomvattende kennis en diepe  intense ervaring  verkoopt zijn ziel aan de duivel  met allerlei verwikkelingen tot gevolg  Maar ja  wat ik echt niet wist is hoe pregnant Goethe het verlangen naar oneindigheid wist te beschrijven  en hoe swingend en zinderend hij Fausts onvrede en rusteloze streven op papier wist te krijgen  En hoe Goethe schrijft over de pracht en verschrikking van de aardse wereld en de bovenaardse wereld     geweldig  Maar het meest verrassend vond ik hoe Goethe  die ik altijd had versleten voor een vormvaste classisistische en dus wat stoffige klassieker  echt HELEMAAL los gaat in deel II van Faust  Daarin komt de lezer een werkelijk totaal bizarre stoet tegemoet van engelen  duivels  geesten  Griekse filosofen  keizers en tegenkeizers en bekende Griekse mythologische figuren in een volkomen nieuwe rol  Zo beleeft Faust een even illusoire als hallucinerende als intense als ontroerende liefde voor Helena  na de val van Troje  In die liefde speelt een homunculus een rol  op fascinerende wijze voortgebracht door alchemie en toverij  alsook een Icarus achtige Byron figuur die uit puur verlangen naar oneindigheid vliegt naar de zon en wordt verzengd door de hitte  Wat ook weer een metafoor is voor het even zelfdestructieve als inspirerende verlangen naar oneindigheid van Faust zelf  De duivel Mefistofeles is in deel II even scherpzinnig als geestig als filosofisch als  tsja  duivels  Carnavaleske passages worden afgewisseld met prachtige passages over religieuze vervoering  die weer worden afgewisseld met griezelige stukken over amorfe geesten uit de onderwereld  die weer worden afgewisseld met pure jubel  die weer worden afgewisseld met ontzetting over het onvermogen Het Al te omvatten  De stijl is steeds prachtig en dichterlijk  maar verandert voortdurend  soms zit je strakke versvormen te lezen  dan ineens zit je in het ritme en de cadans van het platte dronkemanslied  En op het eind besef je dat het Faust verhaal totaal anders eindigde dan je had gedacht  bepaald niet met een conventionele vervloeking door de duivel  maar ook niet met het geijkte Christelijke verhaal van berouw over begane zonden en verlossing  De Faust figuur is een geweldige metafoor voor het brandende verlangen te tasten naar de oneindigheid  voorbij alle grenzen  tegen alle natuurwetten in  Een gevaarlijk en zelfdestructief verlangen  maar zoals Goethe het beschreef bewonderde ik vooral de positieve kanten ervan  als brave burgerlul bewandel ik natuurlijk braaf en verstandig de gebaande wegen  maar stiekem bewonder ik figuren als Faust die daarmee totaal breken ook als dat hun ondergang betekent  Maar wat mij vooral verraste en verrukte was dat Faust over zoveel meer gaat dan alleen de Faust figuur  en dat met name deel II echt een enorm en exuberant feest is van ongeremde creativiteit  Nooit had ik vermoed dat die ouwe Duitser zo n fontein van pure inventio was  nooit had ik gedacht dat deze klassieker zo n ongeremde erupte zou zijn van dichterlijke verbeeldingskracht  Het zal jullie duidelijk zijn  jubelend las ik het uit  en in mijn hoofd jubel ik vast nog dagen lang door  Kniga neveroiatnaia   Nastol ko glubokaia v svoiom

tbHl khwndh bwdm    Every page is worth to quote  In theology and Christian mysticism is an important concept  sacrifice Christ sacrificed himself to his followers  the extensive mercy and forgiveness  and eternal benefit  Kierkegaard  in his numerous works on the concept of  sacrifice  has noted  According to Kierkegaard at three levels  the aesthetic  moral  faith  The sacrifice related to stage faith  We agree or disagree with the opinion of Kierkegaard  a deep psychological analysis of man he offers Find aesthetic  associated with weariness Moral conflicts and other problems with it But in the faith  surrender and pure satisfaction Faust life  tedious  and boring  Frustrated  discouraged and disappointed  To earn pleasure  his soul with the devil transaction Transaction of the spirit  sign of the aesthetic is proud to life  This life  aesthetic  even if all pleasures bring with them  eventually the human despair  Secondly  more aesthetic drown in life  should break ethical standards  Faust story  the story of human sacrifice  We re always sacrifice themselves  more speed  more consumption  watching TV  spending time on Facebook and so on Erich Fromm and Gabriel Marcel  both in the case of  being  and  having  spoken  In fact  we  being  sacrificed himself  having  our own  And all like Faust  only when want  being  self discovery  and self knowledge to find  and the perfection of our own  that time has come to death  Faust life  our life  no creo haber entendido mas de la mitad  pero me diverti leyendola  These words set up the central motivation of the play  Alas  I have studied philosophy    the law as well as medicine    and to my sorrow  theology    studied them well with ardent zeal    yet here I am  a wretched fool    no wiser than I was before    And I see all our search for knowledge is vain    And this burns my heart with bitter pain    I ve more sense  to be sure  than the learned fools    The masters and pastors  the scribes from the schools    No scruples to plague me  no irksome doubt    No hellfire or devil to worry about     Yet I take no pleasure in anything now    For I know I know nothing  I wonder how   I can still keep up the pretence of teaching  Or bettering mankind with my empty preaching  Faust desires to transcend human knowledge in an attempt to mitigate his own existential meaninglessness However  on life  How great a spectacle  But that  I fear    Is all it is  The tragedy is inevitable   A five  Out of five  For me it was a remarkable book  How many of us carry a burden in our hearts as to what we are and are not happy with who we are  I was not happy with myself in my teens  But I was able to find peace with myself when I read Goethe s  Faust   Dr  Faust was well known and loved by the people in his town for all the wrong reasons  He father was a doctor and who helped his town during the plaque  Faust knew that his father was all but experimenting with his patients while under the false colors of a healer  Faust knew he did not deserved the praise of his patients and it bothered him  In this story we have a  listener  to Dr Faust s story  In the end he tells the troubled Faust   Where you father failed may you succeed  Where your father succeeded may you excel   This alone has brought me a lot of peace of mind   Recitit Faust a treia oara  de data aceasta complet si intr o alta

mai cuminte traducere  M am bucurat de ea de la primul pana la ultimul vers Cealalta traducere la care am acces  a lui Mihail Nemes  se apropie de original  Sau cel putin asa mi au zis cativa connoisseurs  Dar mie mi s a parut ca  pentru a atinge perfectiunea  a iesit sterila  contorsionata  pentru a putea respecta metrul original  chiar intimidanta  As vrea sa dau vina pe traducerea lui

aceasta e parerea mea subiectiva  de diletant intr ale filologiei  De exemplu    gica contra  Arghezi are o parere diferita de a mea si a certat editura care a permis publicarea pentru prima data a traducerii lui Blaga  Intrebarea cititorului este cum s a putut admite de catre o editura asortata cu un mare contingent de specialisti  un text atat de scazut in nivel ca sa si justifice marile

German language career  ich habe dieses Buch auf Deutsch gelesen  Complex  allegorical  and tragic with insights into good and evil  vice and morality  De todos os trabalhos que fiz na faculdade de direito  aquele com que mais me diverti foi um trabalho de teoria dos contratos  e que tinhamos de analisar a questao dos contratos de adesao e clausulas abusivas a luz do Fausto de Goethe Bem  a coisa comecou mais ou menos assim  a professora passou uma lista de livros para a turma se dividir em grupos e trabalhar um daqueles  Inicialmente  iria haver sorteio dos livros  mas ninguem   absolutamente ninguem   queria pegar Goethe  que era o unico livro de literatura da lista    Minto  Havia duas pessoas na sala que adorariam pegar Goethe  mesmo porque  ambas ja tinham lido o livro  E as duas pessoas estavam no mesmo grupo  Entre eu e Davi  Guilherme e Carol nao tiveram muita escolha E todos ficaram felizes da vida que Fausto nao estaria no sorteio Fizemos a divisao do trabalho de forma que  a cada tema que comecassemos  tambem se apresentasse um trecho da obra  De alguma forma que nao sei explicar muito bem  misturamos Goethe com Confuncio  Shakespeare e Al Pacino em O Advogado do Diabo  Fizemos o contrato assinado e selado com  sangue   e  ao final da apresentacao  demos o pergaminho de presente para a professora  Modestia a parte  foi o melhor trabalho dos apresentados no ciclo de seminarios  Ate porque  em nenhuma outra das apresentacoes  estavam presentes Deus e o Diabo Quando dividimos a questao da pesquisa  eu fiquei com a introducao  para falar justamente da parte literaria do trabalho  E  qual nao foi minha surpresa ao descobrir que Fausto nao era exatamente um personagem exclusivo de Goethe   Por volta de 1540  morreu na Alemanha um magico errante largamente conhecido a epoca chamado Jorge Faust  ou  simplesmente  Doutor Faust Fausto foi contemporaneo de outros magos conhecidos   tal como Paracelso e Agrippa  numa epoca em que o estudo da magia interessava aos academicos  que se viam habitantes de um mundo governado por forcas invisiveis  Sorte dele  pois  tivesse vivido um pouco mais  teria certamente sido alvo da perseguicao empreendida pelos partidarios de Lutero e pela propria Inquisicao Foi Lutero  alias  juntamente com seus seguidores  que acabou por demonizar a figura do mago  ligando o a Sata e culpando o mestre infernal por sua morte  A ideia do contrato com data marcada  entretanto  so se tornaria conhecida em 1587  com a publicacao do Faustbuch  em Frankfurt Essa primeira obra apresenta Mefistofeles  do grego Mefotofiles ou Me to fos files    a luz nao e amiga   em clara contraposicao a  Lucifer    um espirito demoniaco  que se compromete a servir a Fausto  obedecendo o e conseguindo para ele tudo que este desejasse  respondendo todas as suas perguntas sem nunca faltar lhe a verdade  Em troca  Fausto assinaria um documento dizendo que  apos 24 anos de servico  se todos os seus desejos tivessem sido satisfeitos  o diabo  podera fazer de mim o que quiser  a sua maneira e conforme a sua vontade  apossar se do meu corpo  alma  carne  sangue e bens  O Faustbuch constitui se  entretanto  mais em uma comedia farsesca  explorando as situacoes pelas quais passa Fausto  envolvido pelas artes de Mefistofeles Foi depois de ter caido nas maos do teatrologo Cristopher Marlowe  contemporaneo de Shakespeare   que a obra ganhou  em 1592  a dimensao tragica que conhecemos hoje  Marlowe conseguiu desenvolver em sua peca os tres pilares do mito  a excitacao pelo conhecimento  o entusiasmo pela beleza terrena e a danacao espiritual  Dois seculos depois  Goethe daria a historia um significado ainda mais amplo A primeira cena de Marlowe  vamos encontrar Fausto debatendo se sozinho em seu gabinete de estudo  avaliando todos os ramos do conhecimento com desalento  Comecando pela logica  ele logo se decide que tal ciencia tem como finalidade apenas permitir  que se discorra bem  e ele nao tem necessidade mais de estuda la  pois ja aprendeu a usa la e  de qualquer maneira  ele cre que seu  genio    requer algo maior  Avalia entao a medicina e  como medico  ve que ja alcancou a fama  Apesar disso   es apenas um homem  Fausto   De que lhe adianta a medicina  se nao pode ressuscitar mortos ou ter a vida eterna  E entao que ele se volta para a magia e  a partir dai  liga se a Mefistofeles O Fausto de Goethe e diferente nesse aspecto  Vamos encontra lo primeiro passeando por entre as pessoas do povoado onde mora   estamos no meio de um festival e ele se compraz em ver as pessoas se divertindo  mas ele mesmo nao se diverte  E um personagem respeitado e admirado por todos  mas permanece isolado em seu proprio mundo   e individualista ao extremo Quando Mefistofeles aparece para lhe propor o acordo  acordo esse que comecou com uma aposta entre Deus e o Diabo  numa cena que muito lembra o livro de Jo  no Antigo Testamento   nao e propriamente ao conhecimento que ele tenta em Fausto  mas a necessidade que este sente em se ver como um homem comum entre os outros     Mefistofeles    Nao te e marcado nenhum limite  nenhuma finalidade  Se te agradar experimentar um pouco de tudo  apanhar em voo o que vier  faz como entenderes  Vamos  liga te a mim  nao tenhas medo    Fausto    Sabes bem que nao se trata de divertimentos  Eu consagro me ao tumulto  aos prazeres mais dolorosos  ao amor que sabe a odio  a paz que sabe a desespero  O meu coracao  curado do ardor da ciencia  nao ficara daqui em diante  fechado a qualquer dor  E o que e quinhao de toda a humanidade quero o concentrar no mais fundo do meu ser  quero  pelo meu espirito  alcancar o que ela tem de mais elevado e mais secreto  quero acumular no meu coracao todo o bem e todo o mal que ela contem  e inclinando me como ela  quebrar me da mesma forma O Fausto de Goethe vive em estado de morbida insatisfacao  no tedio de nunca encontrar o que quer que mitigue sua existencia  na desesperanca de sua vida como academico  Nada jamais correspondeu as suas expectativas  suas esperancas em compreender o mundo se desvaneceram e tampouco chegou ele a conhecer alguma das alegrias normais da existencia Destarte  diante da oferta de Mefistofeles  Fausto nada ve a perder  A aposta  entao  esta lancada     Fausto    Nao haja do  nao haja mora  E  se um dia eu disser ao momento que passa   para  es tao formoso    entao me faz morrer ao teu contento  pois decerto morrerei bem venturoso  Que toques entao o sino derradeiro  que tua obrigacao comigo tenha fim  que a hora pare  que caia o ponteiro e que o Tempo termine para mim Ou seja    No dia em que alcancasse afinal algum gozo  sua alma estava entregue ao demonio  Goethe transformou o contrato com data certa de expiracao  que aparecia em Faustbuch e A tragica historia da Vida e da Morte do Doutor Fausto num prazo aparentemente infinito  Tanto e que  se nessas primeiras obras  Fausto nao sobrevivia aos 24 anos acertados  e que  a epoca  era a idade canonica da maioridade  e nao os nossos atuais 21 anos   enquanto o de Goethe chega ate quase os cem Fausto assim  dispoe de sua vida mortal e de sua alma   que pagaria pela eternidade pelo contrato feito  E  com sangue  assina o contrato Outra obra que trabalha com essa tematica e O Mercador de Veneza  de Shakespeare  um dos meus textos favoritos do bardo   Nessa peca  Antonio  mercador  amigo de Bassanio  um jovem nobre que muito ja despendeu suas herancas  faz um contrato com Shylock  judeu e usurario  Para que Bassanio possa cortejar uma rica e formosa senhora  Antonio empresta dinheiro com Shylock  afirmando que  nao pagando a divida ate a data aprazada  dara  uma libra de carne  ao seu credor Bassanio ainda reflete por algum instante se aquilo seria certo  mas Antonio garante que  muito antes do prazo se vencer  os navios mercantes que a ele pertenciam teriam voltado  e ele teria sua fortuna de volta  O que seriam  entao  tres mil ducados Por ironias do destino  enquanto Bassanio consegue conquistar a bela Porcia  Antonio descobre que seus navios socobraram em alto mar  Resta a ele entao pedir clemencia a Shylock  o mesmo que era chamado de cao e vilipendiado pelos amigos e pelo proprio Antonio por sua condicao de judeu e usurario Shylock e irascivel em sua vinganca   sim  porque o contrato que firmara com Antonio nada mais era que uma forma velada de vingar se  E  embora todos os amigos de Antonio  incluindo ai o proprio duque da cidade  tentem demover Shylock de cumprir o contrato  nenhum deles  por nem um unico momento  pensa ser possivel ir contra um compromisso tao formal quanto um contrato  E  com pesar  teriam entregado Antonio nas maos de Shylock  nao fosse a intervencao de Porcia Alias  toda essa ideia foi revisitada or Ariano Suassuna em O Auto da Compadecida Eis portanto a grande questao que nos coloca todas estas historias  e qual a logica de trabalhar tal tema numa cadeira de teoria dos contratos   seria justo permitir a execucao de um contrato a tal ponto imoral A verdade e que nao estamos tao longe da libra de carne prometida por Antonio a Shylock como garantia  ou da cessao de toda a sua pessoa e alma que Fausto faz a Mefistofeles  Tal ficcao tem perfeita validade em nossa Historia  enquanto predominaram os principios classicos do contrato  um acordo para trabalhar em uma fabrica textil na Inglaterra do seculo XIX era como pactuar com o diabo Clara fica a malicia de Mefistofeles em Marlowe  quando da morte de Fausto     Fausto    Oh  demonio feiticeiro  a tua tentacao foi o que me privou da felicidade eterna    Mefistofeles    De bom grado eu o confesso  Fausto  e me congratulo  Quando tu estavas no caminho do Ceu  fui eu quem te barrou a passagem  quando lias as escrituras  fui eu quem virou as paginas do livro e te desviou o olhar  O que  Choras  E tarde  Desespera  Adeus  Tolo que ri na Terra ha de chorar no Inferno O Mefistofeles de Goethe  entretanto  e quase humano  Muitas vezes  ao longo do texto  esquecemos de com quem estamos lidando  nao a toa  visto ser ele  de acordo com Fausto   o espirito que nega  Talvez seja por isso que  de todas as grandes obras que trataram do mito do pacto faustiano  apenas na de Goethe o fim termina em redencao para o triste doutor  Isso nao acontece no Faustbuch  onde os membros de Fausto sao encontrados no dia seguinte a sua noite derradeira  em Marlowe  onde os estudantes discipulos dele  escutam as horas de agonia do mestre  ou ainda  em Thomas Mann  que fez um Fausto musico  representando o pacto numa mulher de bordel  que avisa ao seu hospede que tem uma doenca venerea e  mesmo assim  ele deseja possui la e  em virtude do contagio  vem a morrer A verdade e que a redencao de Fausto nao vem apenas do fato de ser Mefistofeles quase humano  mas de outras situacoes nas quais as duas partes do pacto se veem envolvidas  em especial na parte primeira da peca  quando conhecemos Margarida Embora tenha comecado com um desejo despertado pela luxuria  Fausto realmente se apaixona por Margarida  E e Margarida que ha de salvar Fausto na cena final  Salvar nos e permitido a quem sozinho lutou   respondem os anjos  que acompanham a moca  quando Mefistofeles tenta impor seu direito a alma de Fausto mostrando o contrato  E aqui se poe a verdade da posicao de final do doutor   a aposta que Mefistofeles fez com Deus e que ele deveria levar Fausto ao seu caminho e  apesar do pacto  o demonio nao consegue subverter a alma de seu devedor  Nebiju gaidijusi  ka sis dzeja titais raksta gabals

Blessed Host comes from AboveAnd welcomes him to Heaven  You can feel the striving for a story that would travel trough time and even hundreds of years later would make people think  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has created such a piece  there can be a lack of understanding for someone not from the era he was  but definitely there can be felt the passion which he gave the piece  Some parts could be interpreted only if one knew Goethes life  his enemies and his friends  that could be the only small thing that keeps me from reading it again and again  It is one of the books  that everyone should read   I ve read Kaufmann  Luke  and Atkins  translations  and find Kaufmann s the most satisfying While preserving the verse form  Kaufmann s translation is surprisingly accurate  It s often close to literal  and he often manages to gracefully preserve the basic structure from line to line  unlike many verse translations that rearrange lines to pull it off  But Kaufmann s is also the most satisfying poetically  There are particular lines and phrases that I think Luke captures better  but that s the exception  On the whole  it s just a more beautiful  compelling version Atkins is accurate enough  but utterly lacking any poetic sensibility  You might as well read an essay about Faust instead  Luke is wonderfully clear  I must admit there are nuances in the meaning of the text that I completely missed in other translations that are plain as day in Luke s translation  It s also accurate enough  though  on occasion  departures from the original seem inexplicable  they don t hold to the spirit of the text any more than the letter  and they don t seem to be necessitated by a difficult meter or rhyme  But I think Kaufmann s uncanny combination of artistry and accuracy has to win in the end  Part I is a engaging  rollicking  mostly satirical version of various sources  the Faust legend and Job come immediately to mind   At least in the beginning  when Faust is mostly divided between haughtiness and wonder and Mephistopheles is always good for a laugh  Then Gretchen  and Gretchen s sins  show up  and the play gets quite serious and hits some very high notes  Goethe is far too human to be a terribly rigorous Christian  and it makes the ending of the play that much better Part II is a different beast  Greek allusions  in content and structure  form much of the second part  And while I enjoy feeling smug when I get the references  and don t mind occasionally looking things up  the focus on Helen and the Emperor means the play meanders a lot more than the first part  and not to its benefit  However  as in Part I  the ending is sublime  with Goethe once again failing to be a Christian and doing much better for it  Mephistopheles  last scene was wonderful  and  though I haven t read Paradise yet  I suspect I will enjoy Goethe s version much more than Dante s  So pleased I purchased this edition of Faust I had never read the entire work before  only the first act  the Gertrude part  back in college IIRC   Then I tried to re read it several months ago  but struggled  This is not an easy book under any circumstances  and the translation I tried previously seemed stilted and difficult to follow  Got a little way into Walpurgis Night and my eyes started to cross     Then I found this edition  and what a pleasure  The translation  Walter Arndt  is much more accessible  I also really appreciated the interpretive notes by Cyrus Hamlin    they re extensive  around 150 pages  and helpful in so many ways    everything from providing context to insight on the text s symbolism  I honestly felt like I was in a college lit class  being  taught  the book by someone who knows it inside and out  But no having to worry about writing a paper at the end  DI also enjoyed the critical essays that make up the final 3rd of the book  except for the ones at the very end by the contemporary scholars  Good grief  can we get any more abstract  fellas I m actually noodling the idea of writing my own version of Faust  that was part of my motivation for picking this up in the first place  But those plans are backburnered for now    the scale of Goethe s version is so epic I m pretty much overawed  Maybe once I ve digested it for a while    Highly recommend to anyone who loves the classics and or wants a nice mental stretch   I m giving it five stars with reservations  those being that I do not totally understand it yet  I am working on it though  It is a great morality play and a bit of a cautionary tail  and I like that a lot  But there is also a ton of symbolism in it  which I also like  but which I do not fully understand  With the aid of critical analyses  I am learning  though  and will probably reread the story when I get most of that into my head  The story of Faust is one of a tired and disillusioned old man who  in his deepest darkest thoughts  feels like his life has been such a failure that  when he gets the chance  he sells his soul to the devil in exchange for youth  success  fortune and romance  There is always a dear price tag attached  however  as Faust learns to his horrific consternation Sad that we English speakers have to read a translation  but even with that  it is obviously expertly written  I guess foreign speakers feel the same way about Shakespeare  and I hope for their sakes that they have quality translations  Being unable to be anything but ignorant on the subject  I feel that this translation is superior  The beauty of the poetry is breathtaking  and can t help but be favorably compared to Shakespeare  The subject matter is earthy and less than beautiful  yet so relevant  mainly because it is human beings that read this story  and we human types are less than perfect  and often less than beautiful  Our base desires are often selfish  try as we might to rationalize them with  good  motives  All in all  this is a story I am not finished with yet  and it will probably never be finished with me  At least  not on this earth  First time reading Faust by Goethe  There be world class literature  me hardies  I STRONGLY recommend this book to all my friends       and enemies Wow  What did I just finish reading  Part I was exceptionally well written and not overly difficult to understand  Part II  however  was out there  I mean REALLY out there  I am still scratching me noggin with that one  me brain pan is hurting Perhaps the only time in my life where someone  a post graduate doctoral candidate in literature no less  actually stopped me and said they noticed I was reading this book and wanted to know my thoughts about this particular book  This person actually commended me for taking the time to read what she catagorized was  a difficult book to understand       what with all the philosophical rendering and all   Her words  not mine  I aren t that smart Nonetheless  it is my understanding that the message of redemption is the same in Part I and Part II with the first section devoted to redemption on  a microcosmic scale  whereas Part II is redemption on  a macrocosmic scale   wholesale redemption  Does this then mean that regardless of our many faults  the  GOD S  forgive us our humanity  I say that in the singular and or plural because Part II does concern itself with the ancient ideal of polytheism vs  monotheism  this  despite the fact that it is the Lord of all Heavenlies who makes the Job like bet with Mephistopheles Satan  Does  good  always triumph over  evil   Is the deck stacked against the Devil  If so  then I would think after a few millenia that the Devil would see he is beat and give up the fight  Either that or the Devil truly is a glutton for punishment Deep questions raised by the writing  perhaps far too deep and beyond this reader s limited brain pan  No doubt about it  Goethe was one heck of a writer  scholar and  most assuredly  judge of good whiskey  If n you like a challenge  read this one  If n you like your message a little less ham fisted  then read  The Sorrows of Young Werther  also by Goethe Post Script  My daughter and I just saw the encore performance by the New York Metropolitan of the opera  Faust  on Wednesday  January 11th  which was nationally televised through Fathom Events  If you EVER get the chance to see this  do it  It will be among the best four  4  hours and 20 minutes of your life  The modern production of this classic was breathtaking and simply astounding  Charles Pape s caddish and calculating version of Mephistopheles  stole  the show Rock on  me hardies  It s a great life       as long as you put down the remote and open a book  Goethe s Faust is one of those rare classics that you feel good about reading and that you actually enjoy reading  well  I did anyway  to the point where my husband was laughing at my eagerness to  go snuggle up with some Faust  as he put it  An accurate observation  But that doesn t mean this is an easy read  I had the good fortune to get my hands on an outstanding edition translated by Walter Kaufmann  who through a mix of rigorous work and sheer genius managed to impart the rhyme  rhythm  and meaning of the original into English version  The edition is laid out with the German text on the left page  and the English on the facing right  so that that I could read the German and let my eyes flick over to the English side during the denser  more poetic sections to make sure I hadn t missed anything important  I think most of us have encountered some version of the old  sold my soul to the devil  trope  but how many of us know the original story  ok  there were many versions of Faust Faustus before Goethe put his spin on it  but still   This isn t as dull or tragic a  tragedy  as most of us have somehow been led to believe  The story and language are earthy and funny  especially the devil incarnate Mephistopheles who can draw wine from a table  The titular Faust himself is naive and silly and dangerously ambitious  but his love for Gretchen is touchingly real  if misguided  and you just want it to work out  knowing there s no way it can    But I think what surprised me most about Faust is the moral ambiguity in this story about making deals with devils  which on the surface sounds  morally  pretty cut and dry  I hear Marlowe s version adheres to more Church approved messages   Goethe himself was not a religious man  and it s clear from the choices he makes as a writer that  in his view  good and evil are messily intertwined I can t recommend this book and this edition highly enough    I should mention that this translator included all of Part One  and judiciously chose to summarize most of the more rambling and esoteric Part Two  only Acts 1 and 5 appear in full  and from the introductory explanations  I think it was a wise choice    A brilliant retelling of the old Faustian legend  In this version Faust is able to avoid damnation after making a deal with the devil  He is saved by the fact that at least he continues to strive for greatness  which it turns out is all God wants from Mankind  As a self acclaimed Pagan  Goethe abandons traditional Christian morality and creates a new value system in which striving for improvement and greatness is put first  Faust s impact on literature has been HUGE and can be seen on German philosophy and the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche all the way to 20th century Russian literature in The Master and Margarita  Not only is it revolutionary in its themes and rejection of traditional morality  but the story  writing  and characters are all superb  This is amongst the greatest and most influential plays ever written  In the mind of many literary critics  myself included   only Shakespeare s Hamlet and King Lear can really challenge Faust for the position of greatest play of all time  GOETHE S FAUST    THE IMMORTAL CLASSIC OF HUMAN ASPIRATION     FROM THE WORLD LITERATURE FORUM RECOMMENDED CLASSICS AND MASTERPIECES SERIES VIA GOODREADS   ROBERT SHEPPARD  EDITOR IN CHIEFJohann Wolfgang von Goethe is universally revered as one of the great immortal geniuses of World Literature  and his great classic  Faust   the epic drama of the scholar s pact with the devil that has come to embody the spirit of the West and its fated love affair with limitless knowledge and technology  is often held to be his greatest masterpiece   Faust   which he finished with Part II in 1831  shortly before his death  can indeed be seen as the crowning achievement of his long and polymath career  but was by no means his only major contribution to World Literature  He wrote the most popular world novel of the 18th Century   The Sorrows of Young Werther   a masterpiece of European Romanticism which catapulted him to European fame at the age of twenty six  followed by one of the most influential novels of the 19th Century  the Bildungsroman  Wilhelm Meister s Apprenticeship   then topped off those acheivements with a profoundly modern novel of sexuality and adultery   Elective Affinities   which has been widely influential in the 20th Century  GOETHE AND WORLD LITERATUREIn addition  Goethe is credited with the creation of the concept and institution of World Literature  or  Weltliteratur   as he termed it in his  Conversations with Eckermann   and thus continues as a living and seminal presence in Western and World Culture and Civilization two centuries after his death  He was a pioneer of Comparative Literature and vigorously advocated the study and appreciation of works from outside the Western tradition  reading Chinese novels and Persian poets such as Hafiz  and publishing his  East West Divan  as a bridge between Western and non Western cultures and literary traditions  Speaking of World Literature to his young disciple Eckermann in January 1827  the seventy seven year old Goethe first used his newly minted term  Weltliteratur   which upon publication of the Conversations passed into common international currency   I am more and more convinced   Goethe remarked  that poetry is the universal possession of mankind  revealing itself everywhere and at all times in hundreds and hundreds of men       I therefore like to look about me in foreign nations  and advise everyone to do the same  National literature is now a rather unmeaning term  the epoch of World Literature is at hand  and everyone must strive to hasten its approach   In his internationalist view of literature and culture Goethe was joined by other of the great founding fathers of World Literature such as Matthew Arnold of the English speaking world  who in his  The Function of Criticism at the Present Time  urged national literatures and literary criticism to internationally incorporate  the best that has been known and thought in the world    One may say  indeed  of current English literature  that they may at all events endeavour  in dealing with this  to try it  so far as they can  by the standard of the best that is known and thought in the world  one may say  that to get anywhere near this standard  every critic should try and possess one great literature  at least  besides his own  and the more unlike his own  the better  But  after all  the criticism I am really concerned with   the criticism which alone can much help us for the future  the criticism which  throughout Europe  is at the present day meant  when so much stress is laid on the importance of criticism and the critical spirit   is a criticism which regards Europe as being  for intellectual and spiritual purposes  one great confederation  That modern nation will in the intellectual and spiritual sphere make most progress  which most thoroughly carries out this programme  And what is that but saying that we too  all of us  as individuals  the more thoroughly we carry it out  shall make the more progress   Such figures as Marx and Engels also saw the globalization  internationalization and social transformation of literature and culture to be a necessary consequence of the globalization and transformation of the world economy and of the relationships between social classes in the modern age  In addition to his literary creations and leadership  Goethe as a true  Renaissance Man  or  Universal Mind  made lasting contributions to many fields  including one of the most important works on theoretical optics  chemistry and meteorology  as well as studies in geology  comparative anatomy and botany that anticipated and laid a foundation for Darwin s theory of evolution  He was also a government official responsible for establishing and developing museums  libraries and universities  As the example of  Faust  reminds us  he was also deeply involved in the theater as a playwright  actor  director and manager of theatrical companies and institutions  He was a close friend of the great poet and dramatist Friedrich Schiller and the center of a global network of writers  artists  scholars and statesmen  Though enobled as amember of the aristocracy and often regarded as of  Olympian  stature  he married a woman from a lower class background and insisted on the principle of equality  while living through the great transmormation of Europe through the French Revolution and its aftermath in which the  ancien regime  of feudal heirarchy was eventually swept away in the birth of the bourgeious age of mass democracy  GOETHE S FAUST  PARTS I   IIThe Faust legend was not invented by Goethe  but was a folk saga based on the life of a historical person  Georg Faust  1480 1540  who was a wandering charlatan  magician and showman  and whose life was subsequently embellished by gossip  folk tales  puppet shows and subsequent literary adaptations  most notably through the legend of his pact with the devil to gain occult knowledge and power in exchange for his soul  until it bacame the source material for Goethe s several works from the 1770 s until his death in 1832  In England  Christopher Marlowe had used the folk legend as a basis of his play   Dr  Faustus  in 1590  though Goethe probably did not know of it until around 1818  or ten years after he had published Part I of Faust  He probably first was exposed to the Faust material in local puppet plays at fairs and similar venues  including his early participation in the Romantic movement to record  folk songs  and  folklore  of the common people  led by such intellectuals as Herder and the Grimm Brothers  Later authors such as Gounod in opera and Thomas Mann in  Doktor Faustus  would rework the legend in ways additional to Goethe s treatment  Goethe s Faust consists of two parts  Part I   Part II  the first of which was  after an extended period of reworking  finally published in 1808  though not performed until 1829  Part II was the major work of Goethe s final years  and he put the final touches to it only shortly before his death in 1832  Thus the composition of the whole of the Faust epic occupied Goethe off and on for over fifty years  Goethe s Faust constitutes a complete reworking and reshaping of the Faust material under the influence of the Enlightenment and the Romantic Age s love affair with infinite striving of the free individual and communion with Nature  Thus Marlowe s play and the popular folk versions of Faust cast the legend as an admonitory morality play in which Faust s hubris and impiety seduce him into a sinful quest for occult knowledge and magic powers by sale of his soul to the devil  with his eternal damnation as a result of his errors  Goethe  Faust is completely different  Goethe as a  Renaissance Man  and  Romantic  is fully in sympathy with Faust s endless striving after infinite knowledge  and the secrets of nature and the spirit as the proper cultivation of the  Spark of the Divine Soul  which dwells in man and seeks to join with and commune in the powers of God as one s human birthright  Seeing Man as umbilically linked in spirit with God and Nature  Faust s thirst for ever greater knowledge and experience is seen not as a sinful presumption and defiance of God s order as in Marlowe  but rather as evidence of the living spiritual bond between God and Man that draws him ever closer to union with God and Heaven  Accordingly  Goethe s Faust never  sells his soul  to the devil  or Mephistopholes  but rather makes a friendly wager with him  echoing a wager God himself has made  betting his soul that no mere gratification or power the devil could confer on him would quench his thirst for even greater and infinite life and experience  a yearning for the infinite which is in itself a yearning for the embrace of the infinite goodness of God  Romanticism  in essence  is the apotheosis of the Individual  And the Romantic Movement in all its ramifications  with all its cornucopia of creation  with its vast range of artistic expression  constitutes identifiable movement precisely because it rests on and returns to a single unifying theme  The Individual Mind  the freedom and supremacy of that Mind  in particular its powers of Imagination and Creation  and the conflicts between the passions and aspirations of that Mind and the reality in which it must live  Romanticism as a way of being in the world  and as an ethos for communiion with nature and creative art  changed the balance of thought  and the focus of perception of its culture  It ultimately completed a cultural revolution  from a world centred on society and the divine  to a world centred on humanity and the individual  Where the Classical world of Greek and Roman antiquity saw human beings in society  where the Medieval world conceived of them in their respective positions on the ladder of God  and as parts of the Divine plan  Romanticism  fuelled by the Enlightenment  starts from the Individual  who shares in the creative powers of both Nature and God  and goes on from there to question the meaning of being  It s premise is therefore Existentialist  and its outcome is Modernity  That is not to say  however  that Goethe in Faust and elsewhere is merely the stock figure of  a Romantic   While he was one of the earliest embodiments of  Romanticism   his Werther predating Wordsworth  Shelley  Keats and Byron  we could say that for Goethe  his Romanticism was one stage on an evolutionary path of further development  which  while preserving the essence of Romanticism  sought to bring it into a greater maturity harmony and synthesis with Classicism  the Enlightenment  Rationalism  and a reformulated spirituality  This is often described as his  Classicism  or a grand humanist harmonzation of those complementary and at times contradictory cultural movements Part I was completed between 1797 and 1806 and published in Goethe s late fifties  in 1808  Part II was created in his seventies and published after Goethe s death in 1832  Part I can thus be understood as a mature man s revision of his youthful Romantic ideas  Part II is an older man s development of and resolution of that work and its contradictions  Goethe put into Faust not only his early Romantic emotion  in all its depth  but also his later more mature understanding of that state  and his attempt to resolve the problems for the Individual that it represented  through creative activity  intense subjective emotion informed and restrained by reason  and the acceptance of some fundamental limitations in the human condition  Faust  the dramatic character  was ready made for Goethe as a vehicle through which to express the new situation of the Individual attempting to penetrate single handedly master the hidden fabric of the Universe  Part I presents the essential personal tragedy of Faust  in Microcosm as he wields the enhanced powers of his own genius aided by Mephistopholes  arts  Like the archetypal Romantic hero he is restless and dissatisfied with the limits of his own life and human life  Despite his genius he feels the emptiness of common goals in life   pleasure  wealth  women  wine  power  social status  even academic knowledge  He contemplates suicide as he is approached by Mephistopholes  who is following up on a wager in Heaven with God that he can corrupt God s darling Faust into sin and damnation  Faust first regains lost youth from a potion from the Witch s Kitchen  After that the plot focuses on his love for Gretchen  a common innocent girl who sees him in his new youth and falls in love with him  Faust himself  seized with more lust than love  asks Mephistopholes aid in getting Gretchen for him  which he does through various arts such as bribing her and her mother with jewels and wealth  providing a sleeping potion to help the girl evade her mother to make a tryst with Faust and decoying her chaperone  But this overwhelming passion follows a tragic trajectory as the sleeping potion inadventantly kills the mother  and the sexual affair causes Gretchen s brother to challenge Faust to a duel of honor in which the brother is killed  Faust is cast in a conflicted character  His heart is well meaning  and even God in the Prologue has admired his idealism and aspirational ardour  but his selfishness and lack of foresight and wisdom leads to unintended evil consequences  This reflects his impulsive Romantic character  perhaps the consequence of an immaturity arising from his regained youth  Moreover  Gretchen  though pure and innocent of heart  becomes pregnant  She asks Faust if he is religious and they should be married  but he  in the romantic spirit is hostile to the church and marriage and prefers  free love  which Gretchen out of love acceeds to  Meanwhile Mephistopholes takes Faust on additiobal adventures including a visit to the Earth Spirit and a visit to the  Walpurgisnacht  or witches  fair  When they return Faust learns that Gretchen has unintentionally distracted by her despair caused the death of her baby and is being prosecuted for murder  Faust chastizes himself for having caused such harm and vows to save her through Mephisto s magic  But when they attempt to break her out of jail she refuses to leave  in the purity of her heart prefering judgment and repentence to flight  As Part I ends  Mephistopholes claims Gretchen for damnation for her sin  but merciful Heaven takes her upwards to God as the purity of her heart and her repentence saves her In Part II  which is much longer and more complex than Part I  we switch from the Microcosm of Faust and Gretchen s small fate to the Macrocosm through which Faust s enhanced powers lead him  That is to say his forays with Mephisto lead him to adventures within several wider dimensiobs of human experience  the world of power represented by the Imperial Court  the realm of art and beauty represented by his pursuit of Helen of Troy  the epitome of beauty  and the ideal worlds of  The Mothers  and of the  Classical Walpurgisnacht   back to the Emperor in time of war  and finally to new land where he attempts to create a Utopia by reclaiming land from the sea and leading society  GOETHE S FAUST   SPIRITUS MUNDI  NOVEL BY ROBERT SHEPPARDGoethe s Faust heavily influenced the composition of my own contemporary and futurist epic novel  Spiritus Mundi  First of all  Goethe himself plays a significant role appearing as a key character in Spiritus Mundi in Book II as the mentor and guide for Sartorius  the protagonist  on the Quest to save humanity from World War III  visiting Middle Earth  the Great Central Sea at the center of the globe and transiting the Cosmic Wormhole to plead with the Council of the Immortals at the Black Hole at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy  In this regard Goethe takes on the role of Dante s Vergil as the guide of the Divine Comedy  Goethe is the mentoring sage of Modernity  as Vergil was the sage bridging the Classical and Christian worlds in Dante s epic  Goethe appears mysteriously in the underground caves of Qom  Iran where Sartorius and the questers are escaping from the captiviity as  human shields  of the Supreme Leader  accompanied by both the  Homunculus  the half born  spiritual Frankenstein created by Wagner in Faust  who is on a parallel quest to seek completion in a natural and spiritual rebirth in Part II  and by the  Trickster  figue of the Monkey King  Sun Wu Kong from the Chinese Journey to the West  Similarly  in Spiritus Mundi  there is a double quest  not only to save humanity from extinction in WWIII but also to acheive spiritual rebirth of the modern world  In terms of structure  Spiritus Mundi is also divided into two parts  as is Goethe s Faust  with the first part focused on the Microcosm  or the level of realistic individual life  and the second part  Spiritus Mundi Book II  The Romance  dialating its action to the Macrocosm  the symbolic  mythic and spiritual realm  Both Goethe s Part II and Spiritus Mundi s Book II thus offer symbolic  archetypal and mythic journeys and explorations  Part II of Faust involves a trip to  The Mothers  which is a sort of idealized witches cauldron of protean Platonic forms arising and falling into and out of existence  Sartorius in Spiritus Mundi  like Faust  also pays a visit to  The Mothers  on the Island of Omphalos at the center of the Central Sea at the hollow center of the globe  where he is to transit a cosmic wormhole to visit the Council of the Immortals at the Black Hole at the Center of the Milky Way Galaxy  In Spiritus Mundi  The Mothers  are conflated with the Three Fates  the ugly hags of Necessity  Just as Faust visits the Court of the Emperor in Part II  in Book II of Spiritus Mundi Sartorius and the band of social idealists on their Campaign to create a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly visit the  court  of the Supreme Leader of Iran  Additional archetypes from Faust are echoed in Spiritus Mundi  such as the role of Eva Strong  who is Sartorius s anima and soulmate  who inspires him and leads him onwards in development as an embodiment of the  Ewige Weibliche or the  Eternal Feminine  anima spirit which guides man to greater spirituality  Just as Faust s line of development is from egocentric and isolated genius in Part I to relationship and belonging in both his love of Gretchen and of Helen of Troy  as well as his joining and leading a Utopian project reclaiming land from the sea  so similarly Sartorius goes from a divorced and loveless existence contemplating suicide only mitigated by his social and intellectual idealism  to a marriage with Eva  an organic and spiritual union  in which he fathers a child  as does Faust with Helen  which Sartorius also names Euphorion  and their both working organically related within society    a creative individual within a free and creative people     to bring about their Utopian project  the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly In conclusion  I invite you to read both the immortal Clasic of human aspirationm  Faust  and Spiritus Mundi  which derives spiritual inspiration from it  For a fuller discussion of the concept of World Literature you are invited to look into the extended discussion in the new book Spiritus Mundi  by Robert

initially refused to finish the end of Faust because I hated Part II so much  Eventually  of course  I did finish  I took a more relaxed approach to Part II and even enjoyed the looser feel of it  The conclusion to Faust is redemptive  oh in so many ways    stunning  probably some of the most beautiful  translated  words I ve ever read  Advice  Don t fight Part II  just go with it  The depth and scope of the entire text is almost overwhelming but you ll never be bored and never run out of something new to intrigue your mind This edition is beautifully translated and considered one of the more poetic translations of Faust  The Interpretive notes at the end can sometimes be helpful but they re kind of a mess   READ IT IN ITS NATURAL LANGUAGE  TOO MUCH GETS LOST IN TRANSLATION  I am a huge German nerd and always loved Goethe  in my final year of high school German class my teacher had me read this in its mother tongue  which keeps its original beauty and wonder  I blazed through this like nothing  my teacher was pleased  I was the highest level German student he ever had while teaching high school foreign language  Faust is magnificent  brings back high school memories and I FULLY

it could surpass my affection for Marlowe s Faustus  but it did  I read a lively translation  the Robert David McDonald one  it beautifully constructs the character s personalities in a way that doesn t feel stunted  but raw  I can t comment on how good a translation it is  but it just feels right  The silky  dark charm of Mephistopheles has engraved itself upon my subconscious  as if we ve met somewhere before on a lonely cross road  I think it s the age of stories like this that bestow them with something unusual  it s almost as if they tap into the past  It is hard to express  and I don t think anything I say here will do justice to these words  they are like a painting or a piece of music  They kind of fill you up  leave traces that never quite fade   Goethe s views on heaven and hell  combined with his Screwtape esque commentary  made this one thought compelling and underline worthy  yes  I just used three hyphens in the same sentence  for me  One of my favorite lines from the

reading Faust  the question that I feel is pinnacle is How do we make desire work for us and not destroy us  I believe in order to not fall pretty to its power  we must be responsible with our desires as well as to not let it afflict anyone else to the moment it becomes destructive  We have to use knowledge and a semblance of control to not get absorbed in the dark side of too much pleasure  In having a superior talent  does that justify in ignoring other to gain a means to an end for it  No  that itself is a point where one must take a step back  Considering others and their feelings is what makes our humility  for if we didn t have that we would either be sociopaths or Mephistopheles himself on a path of      destruction  evil  I  represent  that  being  my proper element   Giote

they live for freedom  they keep striving everyday and everyday they they begin again  it is a beautiful scene  i d like to say  stay for a momment you are so perfect   I ve been always wondering  why are there so many quotes from Faust in so many books  and now I have the answer  because this is a book of life  to say very simply and with few words  so I d advise to everyone  I d be really glad if I knew German to read it in original  but Georgian translation is very good I think   Faust is the first modern man  As developed in Goethe s drama  Faust in his striving is the model for those who follow into the nineteenth century and beyond   he is truly the first modern man  It is also a marvellous romantic tragedy  One aspect that makes the play extremely fascinating is an interlude that is a devilish pageant with witches and wizards  and a direct allusion to Shakespeare s A Midsummer Night s Dream shifted from an entertaining fairy dream to a wicked and perverse diabolic Sabbath night  This first part of Faust has been the model for many adaptations  including operas by Gounod  Boito  Busoni and others  I am currently  2009  rereading this fundamental dramatic text for the fifth time  It never grows old nor fails to impress with its wisdom  Obra abrumadora  en los dos sentidos de la palabra  por un lado  puede producir hastio al leerla  por su profundidad y complejidad  por otro  produce admiracion y asombro   En ella se dan cita tanto la mitologia clasica como las leyendas medievales  en una serie de personajes memorables  Las referencias a nuestro acervo cultural son innumerables  la Biblia  como es de esperar  siendo uno de los personajes principales el demonio   las teorias del origen del mundo  Vulcanismo  Neptunismo   la literatura  especialmente la corriente romantica contemporanea a Goethe   la politica  ya que Fausto se acerca al poder  inducido por Mefistofeles     Por eso es una obra que a veces se hace dificil de leer  y yo aconsejaria conseguir una edicion con buenas notas  A beautifully written poem about a man who sells his soul to the devil  This classic has survived the test of time for a reason  Faust is a man devoted to science  that strives so desparately to discover the true meaning behind the laws of nature  the universe  and to know the mind of God  Frustration sets in  Faust renounces his studies as fruitless  and in steps the Devil with an offer too good to resist  The undoing of Faust that follows and his interactions with Gretchen are tragic but captivating  I regret I am unable to read the poem in its original language  and so I can only say that the translation rendered by Kaufman was briliantly poetic and I have heard it is the best and most faithful translation  Overall this classic is a must read   This has the same effect on me as Marmion  Why don t people write like this anymore  I know  I know we re too busy trying to do something new and the general populous doesn t have the attention span for great writing  Still  I could read this again and again all day  Considerably  one of the best pieces of literature  Outstanding work  monumental idea and a solid fundament for any upcoming writings we can experience  But the depth of this book is still unattainable   I was very impressed by the translation  It was done extremely well A very beautiful read  I found myself falling asleep  dreaming

not like its final  Faust is one of my best books    Reserved for people who can read beyond the words and see beyond the scenes depicted in the book  I really enjoyed the first book more than the second  Many believe that the second part is more didactic  A great work  druge prochitannia  lukash   naikrashchii perekladach  persha chastina   ideal na  za viniatkom val purzhinoyi nochi  druga   vzagali ni pro shcho  Ich liebe es und kann Fausts Anfangsmonolog mitsprechen  da ich ihn vor lauter Faszination ziemlich oft gelesen habe  I read Faust I in its entirety and parts of Faust II for a German class in college  Because the prose is rather difficult to read  even for native German speakers   I decided to also buy a copy in English to make sure I didn t miss anything  All I can say is that the two are incomparable  the German is so incredibly beautiful and well written and the English translation just doesn t capture Goethe s words at all  I recommend that if you can read the German  read it in German  It is a challenge but is extraordinarily rewarding  The story itself is fantastic and the characters are interesting  Still a favorite of mine  This edition is the one I read at university  attracted both by the wonderfully readable text as well as Harry Clarke s illustrations   the first I d seen  Clarke remains a major influence on me  illustration wise  today  I re read this book the other night  thoroughly enjoying it  Goethe makes me laugh out loud  his observations and tongue in cheek comments about people  about erudition  about religion and morality  are spot on  delightful and relevant until today  Man talks of progress and the cat apes in the witch s house titter with glee  Humanity hasn t progressed an inch  I still know half of this book by heart

Regardless of whether I am as skilled with reading poetic structures or not  it was a great read  It was one of few romantic pieces I was okay with since I personally perfer more pieces that are realist  The idea of gaining knowledge first hand being better than reading or observing it was great enough to make me even ponder if such a philosophy was something I would look for in someone s

work  Loaded with gems  And the Oxford translation is stupendous compared to the  2 Kindle version I got from Amazon A must read   You can compel the mass by mass alone  each one in the end will seek

could read German so I could fully appreciate the poetry   As a piece of theater it is a bit harder to critique  The sprawling nature of the narrative is more typical of epic poetry or literature and staging the plays leads to quite a number of difficulties  not even mentioning the difficulty in keeping the narrative focused during the second Part  But the journey is a deep and fulfilling one  I believe the idea of doing something no matter what happens and then dealing with the consequences that come as some sort of punishment  because the plans or the goal was quite ambitious is very clear

best translation I have read  Just a warm up for the wonder of Part 2  Breeze through this and get on to part 2  I especially love that the devil comes to Faust in the form of a poodle    also The Master and Margarita is based on this tale  But I read that first so I need to re read that as now i understand it in hind sight as a russian response to Faust  to lost faith in one s art  and to Russian soviet repression  The poetry While I thoroughly enjoyed Faust I  Faust II is many times the difficulty  Even translated  Arndt does a wonderful job retaining many portions of the greatness I believe since it is still awe inspiring in English  It is still enjoyable for its beauty  but I look forward to coming back to it with a stronger classics background in the future to appreciate what I know to be one of the greatest works of literature  Uno de mis libros favoritos porque siento que capta las cosas cotidianas  los detalles que se suelen pasar por alto para irse  directo al grano   sin embargo el autor puede hacer uso de la fantasia y al mismo tiempo dejar entrever las cosas que el percibia en su sociedad  asi como las aspiraciones de las personas que la componen Mi personaje favorito  y el de muchos   Mefistofeles  Wie kann man wagen ein solches Meisterwerk zu bewerten  Der Erste Teil ist leichter zu verstehen und zu schatzen  Mit der Griechischen Mythologie gut vertraut sein hilft beim zweiten Teil  Gegen Ende fand ich Ahnlichkeiten mit dem Inferno von Dante  sowie von Miltons  Paradise lost   Man muss auf jeden Fall viel flexibles Denken und eine breite Aufnahmekapazitat mitbringen   lyl  w lbrwG  I have two translations of this  Walter Arndt translation is pretty slick and more readable  although there are a number of moments when as a reader you have to think  surely not   I am partial to  critical editions  of books in general  especially for something like Faust  Have now read this 4 different times  and continue to grow with it  Ucinilo mi se da je moc zatreperila samo pred covekom  Pred necim  pre svega  ljudskim   ljubavlju  Kao da suzu osetim samo u oku nekog ko se suoci sa njom iliti uplasi je  I usamljen je osobeni davo u gardi

where is god what do god think about faust Ilginc bir kitap seytan insan Tanri uclemesi  tanrinin ne oldugu nerede oldugu ve ne dusundugunu anlatan felsefik bir kitap  Aslinda daha cok bence sosyolojik  Goethe packs a lot of original truth into this very sensual work  In particular  his observations about society  learning  and  of course  religion  are thought provoking  The style and plot are also unique and impressive  especially in the interaction between Faust and Mepistopheles and Margaret  Probably my favorite  classic   I couldn t put this book down and stayed up all night reading it when I was in college  probably because I wasn t reading it for a class but had  borrowed  it from my roommate  I love this translation by Kaufmann but maybe that s because it was my  first  Faust  Excelente relato  en sus dos partes  Disfrute mucho su lectura   en gran parte gracias a la edicion de letras criticas  que tenia unos muy buenos pie de pagina que me ayudaron sobre todo en la segunda parte del Fausto   siempre recordare a Mefistofeles  un grande en todo el sentido de la palabra  I personally liked this book very much  Amazing intertwining of christian era and traditions of 19th century with antic goddesses  mythological creatures and tales  Mind blowing piece  although very hard to read and I am sure I haven t understood more than half correlations in the book    The merits of the German original and my deep admiration of the literary work aside  I was particularly impressed by Kaufmann s lyrical translation  Walter Kaufmann s translations of Nietzsche s work are most impressive as well  I highly recommend this translation to English readers  Po vpechatleniiam  poluchennym ot knigi  ia by postavila tverduiu chetverku  no iz glubokogo uvazheniia k avtoru

through part two  but I especially enjoyed the talking soap bubble who speaks in tones of bagpipes  It is important to remember that Satan first appears bathetically in the guise of a poodle  Why does Faust hallucinate Venus when he looks into a mirror  I love Norton Critical Editions of older books because they include so much material that helps you to place the world where the book was written  It s a must read  IMHO  for anyone who plans to see the Gounod opera Faust  which was taken from the first part of the book  Es uno de los mejores libros que jamas he leido Te atrapa desde el inicio y no te deja ir hasta que terminas de leerlo   El trabajo de Goethe es de mis favoritos en general  pero a esta obra en especial la considero sublime y digna de ser leia y re leida  Masterpiece of german literature Goethe s classic is in the public domain  with a free electronic copy here  What a journey  And how dense    Definitely read the interpretive notes after every chapter  otherwise you re going to get lost  especially in part two  Totally worth it  though  The surrounding history and context is so rich with meaning  Imam dve stari izdaniia na  Faust  u doma  po staroto e v prevod na

mas bellamente escritas de todos los tiempos  Goethe era sin duda un gran artista  Estoy leyendo esta maravilla de obra teatral y me tiene atrapada  Espero terminarla pronto y completar esta resena  This one took more than 60 years to write for Goethe  So this is a book filled with lifetime advices of an important figure in history  Goethe  I didn t get some of what have been told but due to my young age i believe  Faust represents man s striving after truth and happiness     are they possible to be attained     Faust turns in despair to magic after many years of searching for truth     many years of study and reading      Faust is always an enjoyable read but this edition is particularly fun  The cover is full of color and modern and the text is very easy to read  I couldn t put it down and read it straight through in one afternoon  Dies war das schwerste und zugleich faszinierendste Buch  dass ich je gelesen habe  So poetisch  ein wahres Meisterwerk  Um alles zu verstehen  muss ich es noch ein zweites oder auch drittes Mal lesen  This book is one that I will keep with me for a very long time  It changed my thinking about some stuff  It made me think deeper than I have in a very long time  I think I may have to learn German now   The book was a little hard to digest but the language and imagary was beautiful  I loved the classical illusions  this is a book I definitely want to return to someday to get a deeper reading  Nada como un hombre recto  juicioso y buen cristiano para torcer con los pactos diabolicos  Libro recomendado para aquellos que creen que todo hombre puede ser torcido de los renglones de Dios  Good and evilThe story is well known  but there is a pacing and attention to detail in the original that leads to a dramatic  unforgettable finish Very much enjoyed  Brilliant translation although I couldn t read the original German so I guess I wouldn t really know  Great source material and a lot of highlights  Definitely following up my notes  The first volume Chapter of this is really great  It s worth the hype  You get to fully understand how Mephistopholes and Faust enters into the Western mythical lexicon  ExcellentIt was a magnificent poetic read like none I have ever read before  Faust s tale has enthralled me  It s definitely worth a couple of rereads here it is the most powerful  the best story and the real readable book which can one find just catching a glimps over it make you never forget such a masterpiece    This shit is poetry  That s pretty much all it is  It s fantastic though  Makes me want to learn German just so I could read it in its original tongue  I knew it was gonna be a tragedy    but this was immensely doleful I will write my review another day    I need all of this to sink in   A classic  important for understanding almost anything German coming after it  This edition s translation and notes are excellent and helpful  The only translation of Goethe s play I would recommend  Accurate to Goethe s text in meter  meaning and tone  and simple stunning to read  I was lucky enough to read it in German and see the performance of the drama  Really the best ever  You can test your world view on this
