OH BOY  OH BOY  PEOPLE I HAVE A NEW FAVOURITE This edition came with two stories   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and  The Bottle Imp   and they were both awesome let s talk about them  I m so excited I can t contain myself Jekyll   So  Well  Crafted  From beginning to end the story was engaging and the themes where quite straightforward  but I really love that in writing  see  George Orwell is my favourite author   I like it when authors aren t bogging their messages down in unneeded subtleties   Some of these sentences  I swear to god  One of my favourite ones   I slept after the prostration of the day  with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break   The context doesn t even matter  It s solid gold   My only distress with this story comes not from anything Stevenson did  but from the fact that it s so famous   spoiler alert    I wish I didn t know Jekyll and Hyde are the same person  Gosh darn it  The story is solid enough that it doesn t matter if you know or not   which is important  if one spoiler can ruin your story you don t have a very good story   but it would have been so wickedly fun not to know  Stevenson did such a good job of hiding it   The ideas of evil vs good in humans were great  And the idea that Jekyll didn t hate Hyde   GOSH DARNIT THIS WAS GREAT   That ending though  That ending  THAT ENDING  JESUS Bottle   I had no idea what the heck this was  which made it so much fun  What a story  Stevenson has an awesome imagination  To avoid spoilers I ll keep this brief   This story was so stressful  Oh man I felt legitimate anxiety  My heart  it was not happy  WHICH IS GREAT  It s amazing when a piece of writing can make you feel real dread   Why was it set in Hawaii  When talking to a friend  who is Scottish  and so is Stevenson  so I trust her on this subject  she explained to me that Stevenson was known for being a world traveller  so maybe he just wanted to explore something new  It was interesting  I d like to look more into the significance of the Hawaii setting   definitely something to do with being an island   I wanted this to end more sadly  Gosh it was so set up for a sad ending  and I was dreading dreading dreading that it would end badly but sometimes these things can t end well  I think  ultimately  the ending didn t feel too bad  It could have been done worse  I think the  saviour  situation that happened had legitimate merit  but still  I think this would have been better if it had ended horribly Go read this  seriously people   It came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller  slighter  and younger than Henry Jekyll  Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one  evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other  Evil besides  which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man  had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay  And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass  I was conscious of no repugnance rather of a leap of welcome  This too  was myself   Richard Mansfield was mostly known for his dual role depicted in this double exposure  The stage adaptation opened in London in 1887  a year after the publication of the novella   Picture 1895  Dr  Henry Jekyll is a brilliant man who in the course of trying to understand the human psyche has turned himself  with tragic results  into a guinea pig for his experiments  He has unleashed a power from within that is turning out to be too formidable to be properly contained  This book was released in 1886 and at first none of the bookshop wanted to carry the book because of the subject matter  but a positive review had people flocking to the stores to read this sinister tale of hubris overcoming reason   The American first edition is the true first edition because it preceded the London edition by three daysThe timing was perfect for releasing such a tale  The Victorian society was struggling with the morality that had been imposed upon them by the previous generation  They were embracing vice  Many men of means living in London now found themselves hearing the siren song of pleasures available on the East End  They could be as naughty as they wanted and safely leave their depravity on that side of town before they return to the respectable bosom of their family and careers  They were struggling with the dual natures of their existences  The thunder of the church and the faces of their sweet families made them feel guilty for their need to drink gin in decrepit pubs  smoke opiates in dens of inequity  consort with underage whores  and run the very real risk of being robbed by cutthroats  This walk on the wild side also allowed them the privilege of feeling completely superior to all those beings providing their means of entertainment  Jekyll as it turns out is no different  He relishes the adventures of his other persona even as he feels the mounting horror of losing control of this other self he calls Mr  Edward Hyde  Furthermore  his creation has no loyalty   My two natures had memory in common  but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them  Jekyll  who was composite  now with the most sensitive apprehensions  now with a greedy gusto  projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde  but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll  or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit   Spencer Tracy plays Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde in 1941 Unfortunately indifference becomes more personal  more brutal in nature  as Hyde becomes more and more a caged animal who does not want to have to embrace the pretenses of Jekyll s respectable position   The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order  His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide  and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person  he loathed the necessity  he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll had fallen  and he resented the dislike which he was himself regarded  The tincture that has so far allowed Jekyll to contain Hyde is needing to be doubled and tripled to give Jekyll some modicum of control over his deviant nature  Jekyll contacts every apothecary he knows trying to find more of the solution he needs only to discover that the original batch that he used to make his  grand discovery  with must have been tainted with a foreign substance unknown to any of the suppliers  This foreign substance  unfortunately  is the ingredient that made the emergence and the restraint of Hyde possible  Dire circumstances indeed  Men who normally did not read novels were buying this book  I believe they were looking for some insight into their own nature maybe even some sympathy for their own urges  They made a book that quite possibly could have been thought of as an entertaining gothic novel into an international best seller  New generations of readers are still finding this book essential reading  Even those that have never read this book know the plot and certainly know the names of Jekyll and Hyde  It has inspired numerous movies  mini series  comic books  and plays  It could be argued that it is one of the most influential novels on the creative arts  It was but a dream  Robert Louis Stevenson was stymied for a new idea  He was racking his brain hoping for inspiration   He had his names for the agents of his dreams  his whimsical alter ego and writing self  Stevenson referred to these agents  it pains me to admit  as  the little people  and the  the Brownies   His hope was that they would supply him with marketable tales   RLSIt came to him in a nightmare that had him screaming loudly enough to wake the whole household  It was a gift from the depths of his mind  maybe an acknowledgement of his own dark thoughts  his own darkest desires He wrote the nightmare down on paper feverishly over ten days  When he read the final draft to his wife  Fanny  her reaction was not what he expected  She was cold to the tale  completely against publishing such a sensationalized piece of writing  They argued  thin skinned to any criticism as most writers are especially when it is a complete repudiation of a piece of writing he was particularly proud of  Stevenson  in a moment of rage  tossed the whole manuscript in the fireplace  Be still my heart  There is no arguing with success of this magnitude  but I can t help but wonder what was in that first draft  If there is a criticism of this novel it would be for the restrained nature in which it is presented  Did Stevenson just let it all go  Did he give us more elaborate details of Hyde s excursions  Was Jekyll s glee in Hyde s adventures more fully explored  I understand Stevenson was a fiery Scot given to flights of temper that could only be doused with something as dramatic as throwing 60 000 words into the fire  but how about flinging the pages about the room  and storming away followed by the proper slamming of a door to punctuate displeasure  In my mind s eye I can see his stepson  Lloyd Osborne  carefully gathering the pages  scaring himself reading them in the middle of the night  and keeping them for all posterity between the leaves of a writing journal  In 1920 John Barrymore played Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde Stevenson was obsessed with the concept of good and evil  We all have a side to our personality that we prefer to keep hidden  We all wear masks  For now our inner thoughts are still our own  but don t be surprised if the NSA has figured out how to tap in and tape those as well  Sometimes wearing the mask becomes arduous  Another entity fights to be allowed to roam free  We want to be impulsive  self gratifying  slutty  sometimes brutal  but most importantly unfettered by our reputations  I wouldn t necessarily call that evil  but there are people who do have true viciousness barely contained and we have to hope they continue to restrain it  The Victorians identified with Jekyll Hyde and maybe to know that others are also struggling with doing right without doing wrong certainly made them feel less like an aberration when they next felt the itch for the East End  I m sure this book was the source of many fine conversations as they drank their gin and smelled the musky hair of the doxie on their laps

Stevenson s wife Fanny Stevenson  and Joseph Dwight Strong  Isobel s husband The word that most of his friends and acquaintances used to describe Stevenson  RLS as I often think of him  was captivating  He was sorely missed when he made the decision to move to Samoa taking himself a long way from supportive friends and his fans  He was searching for a healthy environment that would restore his always ailing health  Unfortunately the new climate was found too late  he died at the age of 44 from a brain aneurysm leaving his last novel  the Weir of Hermiston  unfinished  Many believe that he was on the verge of writing his greatest novel  Oddly enough  F  Scott Fitzgerald a very different writer from RLS  but also a favorite of mine died at 44 as well  Critics also believe that The Last Tycoon would have been his best novel if he d had time to finish it  It does make me wonder about the wonderful stories that were left forever trapped in the now long silent pens of RLS and FSF  but they both left lasting monuments to literature  Even those that don t appreciate their writing the way I do still have to admit that their impact was undeniable  If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews  visit http   www jeffreykeeten comI also have a Facebook blogger page at https   www facebook com JeffreyKeeten Robert Louis Stevenson was a man who knew how to play his audience  Utterson  the primary point of view character for this novel  is a classic Victorian gentleman  he is honest  noble and trustworthy  he is the last reputable acquaintance of down going men like Henry Jekyll  So  by having a character who evokes the classic feelings of Victorian realism narrate the abnormal encounterings  it gives it credibility  it gives it believability  thus  the story is scarier because if a man such as Utterson is seeing this strange case  then it must be real  Indeed  this gothic novella was considered very scary at the time  I think this was emphasised because Stevenson pushed the boundaries of the gothic genre  One of the tenants of the style rests upon the inclusion of a doppelganger  Instead of using this classic idea Stevenson transgressed it with having his doppelgangers relationship reside in the same character  Jekyll Hyde is the same person  and at the same time one and another s counterpart  I think this is a masterful technique because the relationship between the two is more psychologically complex and fear inducing  than  for example  the relationship between Frankenstein and his Monster  It breaks the boundaries of the normal role and establishes a doppelganger relationship that is stronger than any others  This all happened because one day a Victoria chemist decided to see if he could separate the two states of human nature  The result was a successful disaster  Utterson has to try and piece together the scraps of the strange situation  He is perplexed at the idea of the paranormal because logic dictates that this shouldn t be happening  therefore  it isn t real  but only it is so  again  it becomes more scary  The incident at the window is demonstrative of this  Utterson witnesses Jekyll s transgressive shift into Hyde and a shift between the doppelgangers  The blood of the Victorian gentleman is frozen by what he beholds   I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man  I saw that  of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness  even if I could rightly be said to be either  it was only because I was radically both  I love the gothic genre and I love this novella  I think so much can be taken from it because the number of interpretations that have been made of it are huge  It is told in my favourite style of narration  epistolary  There are a number of narrators  including Jekyll himself  Consequently  the interpretive value is increased significantly  I ve spoken a lot about Utterson  but there is also the strong possibility of Jekyll being an unreliable narrator as he has deluded himself almost completely  One could also compare the work to Stevenson s own life and his self imposed exile as he wrote this gothic master piece  In addition to this  Hyde can be seen as the personification of having the so called exact physical characteristics of a criminal in the Victorian age  and the homosexual undertones are also very implicit in the text  There is just so much going on in here  The literary value of this is  of course  incredibly high  But  it is also incredibly entertaining to read  I ve written essays about this novella for university  thus  I could praise this book all day and night  This is  certainly  the best novella I ve read to date  I had to buy a Folio Society edition of it  I just had to   After the overblown Frankenstein and the undercooked Dracula  it s pleasant to find that the language and pacing of the third great pillar of horror is so forceful and deliberate  especially since I was disappointed by Stevenson s other big work  Treasure Island   But then  this is a short story  and it s somewhat easier to carry off the shock  horror  and mystery over fewer pages instead of drawing it out like Shelley and Stoker into a grander moralizing tale But Stevenson still manages to get in quite a bit of complexity  even in the short space  As I was reading it  I found myself wishing I didn t already know the story  that it hadn t been automatically transmitted to me by society  because I wondered how much better it would be to go in not knowing the answer to the grand  central mystery  but instead being able to watch it unfold before me  Much has been said about the  dual nature of man   the good versus the evil sides  but what fascinated me about the book was that despite being drawn in such lines  it did not strike me as a tale of one side of man versus another  Indeed  it is the virtuous side who seeks out a way to become destructive  showing that his virtuosity is a mere sham Likewise  neither Jekyll nor Hyde seem to have any real motivation to be either  good  or  evil   it is more that they are victims of some disorder which compels them to be as they are  that causal Victorian psychology which  in the end  robs anyone involved of premeditation for what they do  Dracula kills to survive  Frankenstein does so because he is the product of the ultimate broken home and Hyde does it as a self destructive compulsion despite the fact that he loves life above all else  yet is unable to protect himself well enough to retain it This is not the evil of Milton s Satan  or of Moriarty  who know precisely what they do and do it because of the way they see the world before them  but that of the phrenologist  who measures a man s head with calipers and declares him evil based upon the values so garnered  independent of any understanding  motivation  or reason And yet this is not an unbelievable evil  indeed  Stevenson uses it as an analysis of addiction and other self destructive behaviors  where the pure chemical rush of the thing becomes its own cause  despite the fact that the addict will tell you he wishes nothing more than to be rid of it  to be normal again  never to have tasted the stuff in the first place  It is a place a man might fall into through ignorance and carelessness  never realizing how hard it could be  in the end  to escape And that s something we can all relate to  far more than the sociopathy of Moriarty  which requires that you have complete understanding but just a completely different set of emotional reactions to the world around you  It is much easier for most people to say that there is some part inside them that they do not like  that makes them uncomfortable  some thoughts and desires which rise unbidden from their brain  and which they must fight off  And it is the fact that they are strong enough to need to be fought off that unsettles us and gives us pause  for we do not like to think that such incomprehensible forces might always be there  working  just beneath the surface  and which might come out not due to some dark desire or motivation  but due to simple  thoughtless error   I have become a monster  I must find a place where I can hide  That s it  I shall call myself     DUN DUN DUUUUN     Mr  Where I can  The above is paraphrased from a  Morecambe   Wise  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde sketch  they don t often make me laugh  but this one is gold Not so much  The Strange Case  as the  Overly Familiar Case   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is one of those stories that practically everybody knows so few people bother to read the original text  The original  Frankenstein and  Dracula are also often neglected by readers for the same reason  This is a shame because these are great books and well worth reading    Frankenstein is particularly beautifully written  Clearly the inspiration for  Dr  Banner and Mr  Hulk   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is  first and foremost  a damn fine horror story  If you ignore the fact that you already know all the plot points and just immerse yourself into Robert Louis Stevenson s wonderfully atmospheric setting and prose  Imagine walking around a foggy London street in Victorian times  whistling some spooky tune  and suddenly    DUN DUN DUUUUN       Mr  Hyde comes out of nowhere and whacks you on the head The theme of the duality of human nature is not exactly vague since it takes on a such a physical manifestation  However  Stevenson leaves you to draw your own conclusion of whether Jekyll s theory is valid  The story is also an allegory and a cautionary tale for inebriation  or getting wasted   and yielding to temptation in general   Just one more pint  and you may find yourself whacking people in foggy London Interestingly Dr  Jekyll is not as good a guy as many people may assume  The text clearly indicates that he is always up for a wild time  painting the town red  visiting houses of ill repute  and doing some serious S M   Besides  no decent gentleman is going to deliberately    and repeatedly    take drugs that turn him into a psychopath Anyway  do give The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde a read  it may be old hat  but it never goes out of fashion  Try it on for size Art by  MB CG  _________________  Not to be confused with M S which is Marks   Spencer  where you

chose the one read by David Barnes  as he sounds suitably English  The narration is a little bit of a monotone  but nice and clearly read  and it s free so I can t complain  Thank you Mr  Barnes  I m so glad that I decided to re read this book  because I enjoyed it so much more than the first time  And I have no idea why I didn t like it this much first time around  I guess I rushed through it to get to the end  And I just remember that I found some parts really boring to read  Well this time  not a single page was boring  I also really like how creepy the story was  and how well everything was explained in the end  This is that kind of a book that will make you think after you finish it  and those kind are my favorites Definitely changing this to 5 stars  and planning to re read it again some time in the future  hopefully soon   This book was the start of my on going love story with gothic fiction  Definitely one of my favorite classics in one of my favorite genres  I highly

wmthyr Gryb wmmt  This book has officially made its way to my favorite classics of all time list  I thoroughly enjoyed it  Let s discuss The characters  Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde were so well crafted  Jekyll represents the  good  side of the mind and Hyde is the  evil  one  They are complete opposites  appearance  behavior  social class   so you d think they would absolutely loath each other but then Stevenson throws this idea that Jekyll doesn t hate Hyde    Aghh that was GREAT  My issues  The twist of this story is actually pretty famous so I knew that  view spoiler  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were actually the same person   hide spoiler   but how I wish I didn t  If you can go into this story not knowing anything about it  that would make it ten times better  I feel like reflecting the ugliness inside Hyde by his physical appearance was kind of a cliche but it didn t bother me that much because it was relevent to the story  The Bottle Imp  This is a short story that was included at the end of my copy and I had absolutely no idea of what it was about before I started it  I loved it  From beginning to end the story was so engaging  you can t possibly put it down  If you haven t read this short story yet  I highly recommend it   Thanks to Jeffrey s recent DJ MH review series  which includes  Mary Reilly  and  Hyde  in addition to the original   I realized that I had not  in fact  ever become acquainted with  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  as  Robert Louis Stevenson  wrote them  Actually  the closest I d come was seeing  Dr  Jekyll   Mrs  Hyde   a mid 90s movie adaptation that I cannot  in good conscience  recommend   at a friend s house in middle school    and  frankly  no case of two being one involving Sean Young could ever possibly top  Finkle and Einhorn   so that film was doomed from the start   I m glad I bothered  and not just because I m pretty sure I had been pulling a mental Frankenstein style name mix up  wherein I assumed the doctor was the more sinister half of the duo   The tale itself is more complex than a  man becomes monster   or binary morality tale  though I can see how excerpts could have been used for the likes of Reefer Madness   The philosophical substance of the story reminded me of one of my favorite passages from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn s The Gulag Archipelago     If only there were evil people somewhere  insidiously committing evil deeds  and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them  But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being  And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart       It s short  and RLS  and a classic  So  really  you have no excuse for not giving the original a read ___________________________________________  If you were absent from class during the early 90s  and haven t seen   Ace Ventura  Pet Detective    you need to remedy that situation immediately   Relectura octubre 2015   Sin dudas  uno de mis libros favoritos  Me encanta la forma en que se trata el tema de la doble   o multiple   naturaleza del ser humano y de las cosas que pueden llegar a hacerse para mantener a flote el lado por el cual uno es aceptado en la sociedad  pero sin renunciar al que mas verguenza da      Pequena extension de la resena         no hay que excluir que el hombre  en ultimo analisis  pueda revelarse una mera asociacion de sujetos distintos  incongruentes e independientes   Si dos sujetos dan miedo  como en el libro  imaginen a varios    Relei por tercera vez esta historia y tuve ganas de escribir mas sobre ella  porque son de esas cosas maravillosas que uno quiere comentar  al menos un poco  con medio mundo   El extrano caso del Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde  tiene una trama muy conocida gracias al tiempo y a diferentes adaptaciones  pero que no decae en el texto mismo  Un medico prestigioso y honrado  de las puertas de la casa para afuera  de repente se ve relacionado con un hombre  o algo que se le asemeja  que pisotea a una nina en plena calle  Eso es  a grandes rasgos  lo que le da comienzo a la historia Que Ya Sabemos  Utterson  notario y conocido de Jekyll  es quien va a llevar gran parte de la trama y empieza a atar cabos sobre el asunto  Y luego el asunto lo atara a el  porque se ve envuelto en una serie de acontecimientos horrorosos que pondrian en peligro el nombre de Jekyll y necesita tomar decisiones  Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde  esta narrado de forma amena  sin complicaciones y con mucho dialogo de por medio  Hay varios sub textos que constituyen el libro  como las cartas  que permiten cambiar el punto de vista  Ademas  eso hace que el caso este contado directamente por sus protagonistas  lo cual significa que el momento de las transformaciones estan detalladas desde el interior  por ejemplo   que a veces suenan afectados  pero nunca acartonados  No es ningun descubrimiento senalar que Jekyll y Hyde acaparan toda la atencion del lector  porque tal vez Utterson sea el que mas responde a su clase y se define solo  Pero Jekyll y Hyde  en sus esporadicas apariciones  generan mas de una intriga  Engancha y se lee en una tarde  si no hay interrupciones  A pesar de que la accion refleja las concepciones de la moral victoriana   Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde  no pierde vigencia  sobre todo porque el tema del bien y del mal en la humanidad jamas caduco  y no lo hara   Lo recomiendo con todos los sujetos incongruentes de mi ser  Y si  necesitaba hacer el chiste malo del dia   This classic tale is nothing but awesome  If you haven t done already  go read it  Now To be honest  I thought of this as a little bit too slow paced during the first pages  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were introduced in the very beginning through the main viewpoint character  Mr  Utterson  a friend of Jekyll s  from whose eyes the story is told for its major part  As soon as more and more details surrounding the true background of Mr  Hyde s existence emerge from the narrative  the story itself becomes more and more exciting  until the climax looms with an inexorable pace  cutting the story to an abrupt ending  Despite its comparatively short length  Stevenson managed to write a fascinating character study about one of the most recognized and famous characters of British literature Stevenson s verbal skills are unrivaled  drawing a convincing portrait of a conflict between good and evil  two opposed souls sharing one man s memory and fighting each other in the most obscure way    The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order         A nd indeed  had it not been for his fear of death  he  Hyde  would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me  Jekyll  in the ruin  But his love of life is wonderful  I go further  I  and freeze at the mere thought of him  when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment  and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide  I find it in my heart to pity him    I wish I hadn t already been introduced to this story before finally reading it  if only because it would have become the most astonishing story I ve ever read by the mere intensity of that intense plot twist  Even though the plot was not unknown to me and the story itself was pretty short  Stevenson captured his reader with this tale of one soul ripped in half   and his perfect usage of different perspectives resulting in a piece by piece revelation of the true circumstances to the reader More than enough of the praise  This classic can be read not only for free on the Internet  but also in the course of a short time  so I cannot recommend reading it enough  And off it wanders on my list of all time favorite novels  Uma agradavel surpresa  pena a minha traducao pavorosa Opiniao em https   thefondreader wordpress com 2    It is a beautiful thing  in one s life  to come across a work of literature which is commonly regarded as a classic  and find it wholly deserving of every ounce of praise ever bestowed upon it This is the situation I have encountered while reading  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   Stevenson s Victorian styled narrative is so beautifully contrived  that his words flow through your mind like the music of Mozart  The language alone is worth the praise My only wish is that I could have read this legendary piece of literature with no prior knowledge of the story  However deserving this work is of all its praise  and popular retelling  I fear it has done a disservice to the original work  From Broadway musicals  to episodes of Scooby Doo  this story has been told time and again  The credit this shows to the power of the original story is due  however it sours the reader to never being able to experience it  how Stevenson originally intended There is no female love interest  to attracted the pop culture female audience  And there was no prophetic Jekyll  railing against the lack of foresight of his contemporaries in the scientific community The piece that I found most fascinating was in Stevenson s exploration of the duality of the spirit of man  It s well known that this is the main focus of this story  however  I feel it s a common misconception that Jekyll   good  and Hyde   evil  Indeed  Hyde DOES   evil  However  Jekyll is something far more complicated  Jekyll is the embodiment of both good AND evil  Jekyll is the original spirit  with good and evil wrestling within it  Through science  Jekyll is able to wrest from his soul its purely evil nature  which then becomes Hyde  When he returns to his Jekyll form  however  the evil is still present  The evil that was always there  Always lurking  Jekyll has no potion to free the purely good and holy side of the human spirit  It seems this is the very failing that spirals Jekyll uncontrollably into damnation  Never being truly free of his evil  and never being solely holy  eventually evil s strength grows and grows  until it is no longer able to be restrained Do I recommend this work  Most assuredly  And I recommend it to everyone  Everyone should read this masterpiece of literature  It s not called a classic without good reason  It s an almost perfectly plotted short novel  all the parts complementing each other  all serving to build tension and anticipation  The good doctor is suitably tragic  Hyde is suitably degenerate and  despite having seen the multitude of adaptations over the years  it still feels remarkably fresh and modern  All of Stevenson s stylistic flourishes are on show  as well as his rarely bettered storytelling ability  I d give it six stars if I could  Cinque stelle Una scrittura splendida e ricca  resa in modo veramente magistrale in questa edizione  scelta appositamente  dai mitici Fruttero e Lucentini La prima parte  quella preponderante  crea un

almeno una volta nella vita Stevenson regala alla letteratura l iconico personaggio del dottor Jekyll  inserendolo in una storia dai tratti molto cupi  anticipando i tempi su molte tematiche di psicologia Leggibile tra le righe una sottile critica alla Londra vittoriana falsamente perbenista  mentre ho trovato piu rilevante la duplicita psicologica del protagonista L acuta analisi di Stevenson mette in luce un protagonista coerente nelle sue contraddizioni in perpetua difficolta con l accettare un lato oscuro che e irrimediabilmente intrinseco alla nostra personalita Particolarmente intelligente l idea di sfumare il confine tra Jekyll e Hyde  rendendoli al contempo colpevoli e innocenti in ugual modo  il primo e ben conscio dell avida  e pericolosa  voglia di sapere  il secondo non e esente da momenti di lucidita dove prova vergogna per il male perpetrato Jekyll ed Hyde rappresentano la stessa persona  quello che cambia e l accettazione di limiti sociali ed educazionali che la cultura e la societa dovrebbero impartirci Capolavoro da leggere e rileggere  soprattutto contestualizzato all anno di uscita  Just finished re reading this book for part of my October spooky reading   in preparation of reading Hyde and Lighthousekeeping  Still love this novella    it s a perfectly crafted story  Just wish I could have been a part of the original reading public when this first came out so that I would have been completely surprised by the events of the story   October 2015                              I read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson today   The edition I linked is one from this year   is a lovely  crisp little edition of the story   I had never read it   I must say that I  absolutely  loved it  I m a big fan of books that explore the duality of man s good evil nature   it has immediately joined my list of  favorite  books  It s a perfect short story  The story is somewhat different than what I expected  based on the lore of  Jekyll Hyde  that I knew going in    I  so  wish I had no prior knowledge of the idea of Jekyll Hyde  what a treat it must have been for the original readers of this story to be fully surprised at the revelations as they happened  Even so  it was still fabulous   wonderfully told  I enjoyed every sentence of this tense  tight tale  The writing   vocabulary are just spot on  imo  This is a great read   a classic that everyone should experience   Original review written in 2011   Actually I could have just given this book five stars when it was still in the  Currently Reading  tray  as of course it s not the first time I ve read Jekyll and Hyde  What still continues to amaze me though is how gripping and compulsive this tale remains  even though the one thing everybody knows about it is  in fact  the twist On re reading this book I m struck by how much it seems to say about Victorian hypocrisy  The characters within are mainly good and decent professional people  bound by the rules of politeness and correctness  Yet there is a barely repressed sexual anxiety right the way through  Utterson  the lawyer who is the reader s eyes throughout the book   wonders at the level of intimacy which exists between Hyde and Jekyll  he frets at what sin might lie in the good doctor s past for this monster to have a hold over him  he worries at what kind of disease may affect a man s mind and keep him locked away from the world all day  Nothing is overtly stated  as that wouldn t be the done thing   but the fear of moral transgression is there throughout the book  and the fact it can t be talked about just makes it more shadowy and sinister  For most of the story the dread is not that Dr Jekyll has gone against the laws of nature  but that he has gone against the rules of society And yet it is clear how liberated Mr Hyde is by his evil doings  by his breaking of these repressive strictures  Indeed he seems to draw his power  which eventually subsumes Dr Jekyll  from his capacity to act outside of society s norms  Of course the trampling of the girl and the murder of the MP are truly reprehensible  but there are other   seemingly more enjoyable   sins that Hyde indulges in  These  crimes  are ones that give Jekyll pleasure when remembering them in his own self  and the fact that they can t be named suggests these are matters of the flesh This book could not have been written to the same effect at any other point in history  Stevenson has created a tale which fears the social disgrace and moral degradation of seedy London  while simultaneously desiring to revel in it  CapolavoroRomanzo tanto famoso  quanto erroneamente interpretato  soprattutto a motivo di un approccio superficiale o addirittura inesistente alla sua lettura  La semplicistica contrapposizione tra un Dr  Jekyll bigotto e bacchettone e un Mr  Hyde gaudente e trasgressivo  con una chiara oscillazione delle simpatie verso quest ultimo  non ha senso  infatti Hyde non e  altro  da Jakyll  ne la sua versione disinibita  e Jekyll stesso  cosi come si trasforma in seguito all assunzione di una pozione  guarda caso   impura   e il male che e in Jeckyll  distillato nella sua essenza piu spaventosa e atroce  perche separato dal bene  in una scissione contro natura di quelle componenti positive e negative che albergano in ogni essere umano  Per questo e di bassa statura e di costituzione piu esile rispetto a Jekyll  per il fatto che ne e soltanto una parte  una componente  Per questo ispira sgomento e orrore in chi lo avvicina  non perche sia brutto o deforme  come di norma viene raffigurato nelle trasposizioni cinematografiche   ma per il fatto che da lui irradia un aura indefinita di mostruosita  di  inumanita   in quanto non puo considerarsi umano un essere ricolmo unicamente di pulsioni maligne e delittuose  Indefinito  nel senso di non enumerato ne descritto  e anche il genere di colpe di cui Hyde si rende responsabile  con l esito di ampliare fino all enorme  al raccapricciante  all impensabile il potere emozionale del non detto  Le scelte stilistiche dell autore sono sapientemente intese in questo senso  ovvero a concentrare sul mistero  su cio che e taciuto  la potenza suggestiva del racconto  in un climax di intensita e tensione che culmina con le straordinarie pagine della confessione di Jekyll  Vero miracolo di perfezione compositiva  questo romanzo ad ogni rilettura suggerisce nuove riflessioni e dischiude nuovi tesori  cio accade soltanto per i capolavori   Stevensons bekannteste Erzahlung kann man in der Ubertragung von Friedhelm Rathjen  die in der schon aufgemachten Ausgabe in seiner selbst verlegten ReJoyce Reihe wieder zuganglich gemacht ist  neu entdecken  Unterschiedliche wechselnde Tonfalle und individuelle Redeweisen der Personen lassen den Text fast modern wirken  Wie auch in seiner Moby Dick Ubersetzung erhalt Rathjen dem deutschen Leser die sprachlichen Eigenheiten des Originals und beschert ein grossartiges Texterlebnis  das die  klassischen  Ubersetzungen vor enthielten  Yes everyone knows the story but it s great to read the original  I did this with Frankenstein  Or  The Modern Prometheus and was actually a bit disappointed as the film s  had distorted it but this one has remained untouched and I really enjoyed it  Such a great classic Found this 1980 s leather bound edition while antiquing last weekend which made the reading all the more enjoyable  Love my IPad  but will always prefer holding the real thing  Clasico ejemplo de la tematica del doble  del bien y el mal  del titanismo propugnado por los Romanticos en esta pequena  pero gran  novela salida de la pluma genial de Stevenson  Un clasico que demuestra que no necesita tener 1000 paginas para ser inolvidable    Classic  No doubt about it  The plot idea is unbelievably imaginative and dark  The language can be challenging at times  but it s definitely worth the extra work and time to understand and make sense of it  One of my favourite pieces of literature  Top notch  Najzad sam seo i procitao ovu knjizicu  klasik knjizevnosti i moram da priznam zasluzila je sve pohvale kojom je obasipaju  U sustini u knjizi se malo toga dogadja vec vecim delom citamo pisma ili imamo obicne razgovore ali opet ubaciti tolko jeze i horora bez upotrebe nekih klasicnih klisea prosto maestralno Jedino sto moram da priznam knjiga mi je bila teska za citanje posto nisam navikao na taja cvetni  gospodski govor engleza 18 19 veka pa me je to dosta usporavalo posto sam morao mnogo vise da se koncentrisem nego inace U svakom slucaju svaka preporuka   The idea of this one is fascinating   Delightful The secret to a top notch reading experience is to forget everything you know about Jekyll and Hyde  Stevenson sets it all up as a mystery  there s a dastardly man named Hyde running around  trampling young girls  murdering members of parliament  et cetera  The reader sees the story through the eyes of the affable but rather dull lawyer Mr  Utterson  friend of Dr  Jekyll  who finds himself irresistibly drawn to the mystery of Hyde Anyway  Stevenson sets it up perfectly and he lands it perfectly  And he does it in a small number of pages  which is something to be admired    Ma se sono diventato    quello che sono diventato    lo devo alla mia smodata ambizione di essere un punto di riferimento morale  non certo agli errori commessi  Ed e per quella smodata ambizione che  giovanissimo  tracciai dentro di me un solco profondo fra due fratelli gemelli  il bene e il male  che dividono e uniscono  a un tempo  la duplice natura dell uomo  Ma per quanto fossi cosi  doppio   non ero affatto un ipocrita  Ero sincero sia nel bene che nel male  che coesistevano dentro di me  Quando abbandonavo ogni ritegno per tuffarmi nell infamia  ero me stesso ne piu ne meno di quando mi adoperavo per alleviare le sofferenze della povera gente Avvenne cosi che i miei studi scientifici gettassero una viva luce sulla consapevolezza di una perenne conflittualita tra bene e male  Non solo  ma capii che l uomo non e uno  ma due  come le facce di una medaglia  Fu in campo morale e sulla mia persona che imparai a riconoscere il dualismo profondo e primordiale dell uomo Mi resi conto che  delle due nature che si dilaniavano nella mia coscienza  io non avevo preferenze  perche appartenevo completamente a entrambe  E fu allora che cominciai a sognare ad occhi aperti la possibilita di separare il bene dal male   Se questa ipotesi fosse possibile   pensavo   avremmo uomini interamente buoni e uomini interamente cattivi  Il gemello ingiusto potrebbe compiere le sue nefandezze senza farsi distrarre dalla coscienza che gli chiede di perseguire il bene  perche la sua felicita sarebbe fare il male  Il gemello giusto  a sua volta  compirebbe il bene tranquillo e sicuro  senza neppure accorgersi delle tentazioni del male  perche la sua felicita sarebbe fare il bene  Era la maledizione del genere umano che questi gemelli antitetici  cosi legati tra loro  si dilaniassero perennemente nel grembo tormentoso della coscienza  Come fare  allora  a dissociarli    It s a puzzle  a mystery  a combination of accounts that the reader must piece together to discover the true natures of these men  Everyone knows the basic premise  but the book itself is a masterwork of narratives that slowly constructs a riddle of human nature  Perhaps a strange beginning  but short enough to read again and again  pondering all the while  This will affect how you view humanity  regardless of religion or worldview   Supongo que esto se debe a que todos los seres humanos  tal como los conocemos  son una mezcla de bien y de mal  en tanto que Edward Hyde  sin antecedentes en la historia de la humanidad  era ejemplo exclusivo del mal Este libro es perfecto  Comentar Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde sin dar explicaciones resulta dificil  pero creo que todo el mundo deberia leerlo  Es una novela con altas dosis de intriga  misterio  sorpresa  suspenso y muchas emociones  La narracion es excelente y a cada pagina vas queriendo saber mas sobre este doctor respetado llamado Harry Jekyll y su amigo tan extrano  de forma fisica y en actitud  llamado Edward Hyde  La novela es tipo detectivesca  pero tambien busca exaltar las formas del yo  y mostrarnos las perversidades del ser humano  En mi edicion tambien se encuentran tres historias   Historia del hombre de las tartas de crema   incluido en El club del suicidio  Tambien se encuentran  El diablo de la botella  y  Olalla   Las historias igualmente tienen un aire de misterio y algo de fantastico  ademas del tono detectivesco  Hay muertes y cuestionamientos de la vida  Las historias terminan siendo adictivas Altamente recomendado y una de las experiencias de lectura mas placenteras  Edebiyat ve sinema dallarindaki coklu kisilik bozukluguna sahip olan  Hulk  Gollum  Two face gibi  karakterlere yon veren  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   Dr  Jekyll ile Bay Hyde   insan psikolojisini ve dogasini mercek altina yatiran  iyi ile kotunun savasini metaforik bir sekilde okuyucuya sunan gercek bir basyapit niteliginde  Robert

e intrigante  encontramos accion y suspenso en todas las paginas  Me ha fascinado    Mislim da nema osobe koja nije citala ili cula za pricu doktora Dzekila i gospodina Hajda  Davno sam je citala

A chilling tale which details the interplay between the forces of good and evil  A physician scientist endeavors to segregate his personality through alchemy into a  dual self  by isolating the good into one being and of evil into another  The consequences are tragic  At once  the narrative becomes an allegory for humankind  depicting the devilish results which occur when a human soul  through choice  gives innocent  or at least thoughtless license to darkness  Stevenson sequentially and artfully weaves this intriguing account into a masterpiece  It has been some years since I read Robert Louis Stevenson s book  Treasure Island  and I had forgotten what a gifted writer he is  He is a consummate wordsmith and has what seems to me to be a total command of the English language  His selection of words and their careful placement one after the other is breath taking and  for me  took precedence over the story line itself  Though England Scotland has produced many great authors  all with their separate abilities to deliver a great story  none I think surpass the shere brilliance of Stevenson s literary style  This book is a must read   Halfway through the first chapter of Robert Louis Stevenson s 1886 novella  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  a character named Richard Enfield says   I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal  and that a man does not  in real life  walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man s check for close upon a hundred pounds   He conveys this to his lawyer cousin  Mr  Gabriel Utterson  as he recounts the odd story he has of the  gentleman   a certain Mr  Edward Hyde  who one night deliberately trampled a little girl after she accidentally bumped into him  Several bystanders  including Mr  Enfield and the girl s family  witnessed the incident and were quick to seize the offender  However  Mr  Hyde was just as quick to think up a way to appease them  he entered a nearby door and quickly produced a check for a substantial amount signed by one Dr  Henry Jekyll  a distinguished gentleman who  as it turns out  is one of Mr  Utterson s clients  I cite the above line of dialogue as I think that  as innocuous as it sounds  it is a near perfect prefigurement of the essential characteristics of the excellent short novel where it is from  For one thing  it is spoken by a character in a burst of submission to gossip  thus itself qualifying as something of doubtful veracity  which in turn can also be said of the rest of the book  There s the mention of a man apparently posing as another  claiming no less than the other s signature as his own  However  it s not the book s subject  a man with a split personality  that lends an air of intriguing dubiousness to the narrative so much as the structure of the narrative itself  Stevenson s authorial technique is one which allows for a spellbinding sense of mystery to hang relentlessly over his story  For the most part  the story is told by a narrator who only knows as much as the characters about what exactly is going on  But near the end Stevenson abandons the third person narrative and transforms his novella into an epistolary tale  focusing on two revelatory letters  one written by Dr  Jekyll and the other by a colleague  addressed to Mr  Utterson  who I ought to point out is the real central character of the story  the fulcrum about which the two title characters move  But how much of the revelations contained in these letters  including Dr  Jekyll s reflection on the duality of man   Man is not truly one  but truly two     are true  when the circumstances under which they were created are already beyond Mr  Utterson s  or indeed  anyone s  belief  What is not open to question  though  is Stevenson s grace of style  as exemplified by the phrase  cellar door  arguably the most phonetically beautiful word combination in the English language  in Mr  Enfield s quintessential line  Stevenson s wife famously said that the story of Jekyll and Hyde came to her husband in a dream  It s no wonder then that it reads like one  terrifying like a nightmare and at the same time exhilarating like a trance  His talent is particularly evident in his numerous  mostly gothic  dreamlike descriptions of unpleasant meteorological conditions the characters are forced to deal with  Following the murder of an old gentleman in the hands of Mr  Hyde  Stevenson writes   It was by this time about nine in the morning  and the first fog of the season  A great chocolate coloured pall lowered over heaven  but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours     Then  when Mr  Utterson sets out to finally confront his client  the narrator observes    It was a wild  cold  seasonable night of March  with a pale moon  lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her  and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture  The wind made talking difficult  and flecked the blood into the face   Like Alice in Wonderland  Gulliver s Travels  and Moby Dick  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is one of those classic books whose stories most of us already know from somewhere  often from countless adaptations across various media and quick plot summaries stumbled upon while surfing Wikipedia  but haven t actually read  We know it s about a man who leads a double life  a man who oscillates between being the two title characters  one of whom is mostly good and the other downright evil  but how many of us  knowing full well that the entire text is available in the public domain  have actually gone out of our ways to experience the real deal I for one lament that my introduction to Stevenson s landmark story was by way of Dr  Jekyll and Ms  Hyde  a movie I remember watching on VHS with my family when I was in fourth grade  It starred Tim Daly as a descendant of Dr  Jekyll who  in a supposedly clever twist to the original story  transforms into a voluptuous woman played by Sean Young after an experiment gone awry  I was only ten then  naive and easily pleased  and seeing a man metamorphose into a woman with long hair and ample breasts amused me to no end  It was not until fifteen years later  as I breezed through a Jon Gray designed Headline Review  The Best Adventure Stories Ever  edition of the book which I found while rummaging through a bargain table in a secondhand book shop  that I realized what a travesty it was  even for a loose comedy film adaptation of this truly amazing short novel    Cross posted on Fully Booked  Me  One of the four Victorian novels that I have to read as part of my Victorian Literature module in my Foundation Degree  along with North   South which I ve read  and The Woman in White   Great Expectations  which I haven t   this was a quick  classic read that s free on the Kindle Fire in the UK at least   I ve always loved this book and like a favorite film  I find myself revisiting it every few years just because  It doesn t hurt that at 97 pages it is the perfect length for my morning walk on the treadmill Reading it again today  it occurred to me that most of us read this book already knowing Dr  Jekyll s secret  while the original audience was doubly blessed with an element of suspense as the mystery slowly unfolded Overall a good  quick read packed with meaning  A truly timeless classic  it has been studied and analyzed out the wazoo  It s an unavoidable part of pop culture and has provided the foundation and inspiration for many characters written since and  I suspect  those still unwritten    khyr nhyt ry    rwbrt lwys styfnswn   dktwr jykl wmstr hyd rwy  mn lmfrwD nh khyly  wlknh mn wjh  nZry Hqyq  tmm wtTrH sw l trykhy  mn nHn  nHn lshkhS

puede contener spoilers  aunque estos son conocidos por casi todos   Hace mucho tiempo que tenia ganas de leer este libro  pero por alguna u otra razon no lo hacia  Ahora queria leer algo corto  y cuando me puse a ver que seria lo siguiente que leyera me decidi por este finalmente El extrano caso de dr  Jekyll y mr  Hyde puede encajar dentro de varios generos  novela de terror  de terror psicologico  fantastico  o bien un ensayo de la psicologia humana  Para empezar a hablar sobre lo que me parecio el libro tendria que mencionar tres puntos claves que hicieron que el relato me gustara tanto  En primer lugar  los personajes  y principalmente sus pensamientos y o sentimientos estan increiblemente bien desarrollados  La descripcion del miedo y la repulsion que Utterson sentia por Hyde no podria haber sido mejor  El autor usa un vocabulario muy amplio que permite mostrar a la perfeccion lo que sienten sus personajes y estos lo transmiten plenamente al lector  o por lo menos es lo que me parecio a mi  En segundo lugar  todo el texto en el que se describe la situacion de Jekyll Hyde es espectacular  Todo lo que se narra permite entender cual es su situacion  como sucedio y como fue cambiando su pensamiento respecto de ella  Mientras leia  esta parte me hacia acordar a Frankenstein  de Mary Shelley  mientras en la novela de Stevenson  al principio  Jekyll deseaba con todas sus fuerzas convertirse en Hyde para saciar sus mas ocuros deseos  Viktor solamente podia pensar en finalizar su creacion  Al mismo tiempo  cuando Jekyll se da cuenta de lo que representa su otra personalidad  la aborrece completamente  al doctor Frankenstein le sucede lo mismo cuando ve a la criatura que el creo y se da cuenta de que habia roto una de las reglas morales mas presentes de su epoca  Por ultimo  la diferencia entre los personajes de Jekyll y Hyde son muy notorias  Eso me parecio esencial para que la trama tenga sentido  y el autor supo elaborar un personaje del que se desprende otro mas igual de importante que el original  Probablemente  me habria dado mas intriga no saber como se desarrolla la historia y su final  pero  igualmente  conocerlo no me impidio hacer un analisis sobre otros aspectos del libro igual de interesantes  Do 5 stelline perche la prima volta che ho letto questo libro avevo 15 16 anni ed ero rimasta estasiata  Purtroppo avevo dovuto leggere la versione corta e in inglese per la scuola  quindi non era esattamente come leggere il libro vero  Ricordo di aver amato questa storia e ora che mi sono trovata a rileggerla ho scoperto di aver perso un po  di quell amore  forse perche sapevo quello che sarebbe successo  Spesso quando rileggi piu volte un libro hai la sensazione che sia sempre la prima volta perche scopri particolari in piu  vedi cose che prima non avevi visto  Altre volte  invece  sai che un certo libro potrai rileggerlo infinite volte ma non proverai piu quello che hai provato la prima volta che lo hai letto  E purtroppo per me Lo strano caso del dr Jekyll e di Mr Hyde rientra nel secondo caso  Ho dato le 5 stelline piu per la prima volta che l ho letto che non per questa  Ma se le merita tutte perche e una storia che ti prende e ti porta in un mondo in cui devi capire che il bene e il male esistono in una sola persona e che se si prova a dividerli  le conseguenze sono assolutamente pessime  Avrei tanto voluto che il libro fosse piu lungo  o per lo meno che Jekyll avesse piu spazio   Most people are familiar with the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  it is such a big part of our literary history that one need only mention those names and the reference is immediately understood  Imagine my surprise then upon finally reading the novella to find that there were nuances to the story that I had never fully appreciated  I had thought that this was a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong  that Jekyll had used himself as the guinea pig  that he found the evil acts of Hyde totally reprehensible but learned to his horror that he could not control Hyde  Ah   no  I learned that it was the release of the evil side of Jekyll s personality that he sought through transcendental experimentation because he was tired of hiding his naughty  fun loving side under the persona of the good  law abiding doctor  He was delighted to be Hyde at first because he could let Hyde do whatever he pleased  enjoy those walks on the dark side and not be bothered by a guilty conscience afterwards  Then he began to have second thoughts about the wiseness of his extracurricular activites and decided to give that all up cold turkey  which lasted all of two months when  like an addict  he backslid and decided to enjoy Hyde for one more evening  Upon being released by the dose again  Hyde burst forth with even greater  pent up rage  which with nothing to stop him  resulted in his murdering a prominent citizen and worse yet  being observed in the act and identified  Now it was even more important to keep Hyde under wraps but to Jekyll s horror  Hyde began to reappear at will  he was becoming much stronger and Jekyll weaker  Jekyll was even afraid to sleep  And then the greatest horror was learning that one of the chemicals that reversed the transformation was no longer working properly  had been perhaps tainted to begin with  The end to the dilemma became a choice between the gallows or suicide  Great horror story  I love that the idea came to Stevenson in a dream   Reading Robert Louis Stevenson s classic The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I was reminded of Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  Both novels involve the idea of tampering with science in a controversial way and expecting positive results  Much like Victor Frankenstein learns that you can t  play God   Dr  Jekyll comes to realize the dark side of experimentation gone wrong  Neither character has the resolve to own up and take responsibility of their actions until things are well out of hand  As much as the novel illustrates how the results of science can turn awry  the story also questions duality within oneself  In the novel  the rational side  Jekyll  of a man is tempted into various forms of sin and sinister behavior  Hyde   One side soon becomes the more dominant of the two  and there is a struggle to escape from this dark side  When Jekyll becomes Hyde  he erupts into various forms of grotesqueness  Hyde is physically repulsive  but also repulsive in character  Hyde in many ways is an outlet for Jekyll to experience unrelenting freedom and  do as he pleases   despite the costs or consequences  It s ironic that this newfound  freedom  for Jekyll s other self actually turns into a form of a prison  where he has to physically isolate and hide himself from society to protect others  The many morals it delves into and investigates make this an amazing reading experience  There are also many thinking points about human psychology and human nature  In many ways  this novel is groundbreaking and innovative  ahead of its time  It s easy to see why this novel has spawned countless film adaptations and productions  remaining quite popular and part of our pop culture  Not only that  but this novel is just a great book  well written and with so many different elements  It has exceptional moments of suspense  mystery  philosophy  science  and a darkly Gothic atmosphere to lure you in  Stevenson s novel is one to read  and then come back to and read again    I Want to Be Evil  by Eartha Kitt would be an excellent theme song for this story  And  it could easily have been a Twightlight Zone episode of 1961 Here is a book that I have never seen a movie  cartoon or play  I ve heard over a thousand times the expression  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  to describe people  but never knew the  whole  story  I know   Where have YOU been     I can t answer that  All I know is that I WENT IN FRESH  Thank goodness  It is spellbinding  You feel the suspense right from the first few pages The main theme of this novella is the conflict of good vs  evil  A London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson investigates strange occurrences between his old friend  Dr  Henry Jekyll  and sinister Edward Hyde  The investigation keeps you wondering  what secret is Dr  Jekyll hiding  I fell in love with Robert Louis Stevenson s writing  He sets the mood so perfectly on the streets of London  My favorite description he wrote is   for here it would be dark like the back end of evening  and there would be a glow of a rich  lurid brown  like the light of some strange conflagration  and here  for a moment  the fog would be quite broken up  and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths   Aaaagghh  that is so beautiful  The last chapter is phenomenal  This is where everything is explained explicitly  This chapter works your brain  Very deep  It makes you think about yourself and how much good and evil is lurking inside you  I definitely want to read more of Stevenson s books and poems  I recommend this book to the SANE  Stiv ns n  podobno na Melvil  e poznat poradi vsichki greshni prichini  Nishcho obshcho s ekranizatsiite  ostavili izkriven obraz v pametta mi   Lee la resena completa en Hojas de Otono                            Hay algo plenamente retorcido en este libro que me ha encantado a sobremanera  Considero fascinante el modo en que Stevenson plasma ese temor humano a cometer errores  Yo supongo que la razon por la cual he adorado tanto este libro  ademas de la escritura del autor que me parecio impecable   es principalmente por mi carrera  Este libro cuenta con un gran contenido psicologico que para aquel que sepa apreciarlo  sin duda enganchara hasta la ultima pagina  No deja mas que dar la aceptacion del ser humano como un todo  no como la aglomeracion de individualidades   I got the impression it was about drug addiction or Stevenson s own abuse with some kind of substance  as much as it was about our own unwanted dark desires  Like all great horror books  it has these layers that go past just suspense and dread  Este cruel retrato de la lucha entre la razon y el instinto se disfruta mas si no conoces nada de nada de los personajes   Uno de mis clasicos favoritos http   muydenovelas blogspot com es 2    A heck of a lot more philosophical than the Bugs Bunny rendition with which I was familiar  I actuall  like this book a lot   The eternal battle of Good v Evil   A man and a child accidentally bump into each other at a street corner   a normal everyday incident  But when the child falls down  the man deliberately tramples over her  ignoring her screams of pain  When he is stopped by passers by  he shows no remorse  This is the reader s first introduction to Mr Hyde  a man who has no obvious deformity but gives off an air so repellent that strangers passing him in the street shudder without knowing why  But this man has some kind of hold over the eminently respectable and well known scientist  Dr Jekyll  who not only pays compensation for Hyde s actions  but also gives him the run of his own house  and has made out his will in Hyde s favour  leaving him everything should Jekyll die    or disappear  Jekyll s friend and lawyer is at a loss to understand  but feels it his duty to discover more about the mysterious Mr Hyde   Because the story has become so phenomenally well known  the reader is way ahead of Mr Utterson  the lawyer  In the novella  it s not till near the end that it s revealed that Mr Hyde is the result of a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong  But it s so well written that knowing the story doesn t hamper enjoyment in any way  Stevenson builds up the tension and horror beautifully  with one of the best uses of London fog I ve come across  both as providing a cloak for wickedness and vice  and as a metaphor for the darkness within each human soul  Darkness features throughout  with fog rolling into houses  and Mr Utterson having to face the terrifying climax with only the feeble flicker of a candle to light his way Dr Jekyll refuses to tell Mr Utterson anything about his strange friend  but assures him that he could get rid of Hyde any time he chose  Mr Utterson has to accept that and let the matter rest  But one day  months later  a woman looking out of a window sees a horrifically brutal murder take place  The description she gives of the murderer could only be of Hyde  Mr Utterson races to Hyde s address in sleazy Soho  but too late  He has vanished  Dr Jekyll seems nervy and upset  but after a while begins to get back into his old routines  Then some weeks later  Mr Utterson receives a visit from Dr Jekyll s servant   it appears that Mr Hyde is back   There is more than an element of morality tale about the story  Dr Jekyll has always liked to indulge his vices   mostly left  incidentally  to the reader s imagination  which works so much better than lengthy graphic descriptions would have done  But now that he has become a well known figure  he has to think about his reputation  So he decides the solution is to split his personality between good and evil  But the experiment doesn t work the way he hopes   the Hyde side is indeed purely evil  but the Jekyll side doesn t change   he still retains all his vices and weaknesses even when in that guise  and gradually the Hyde side begins to take control  The suggestion is that  if one gives in to one s evil side  it will always become dominant  so we must guard against it at all times  It s not nearly as preachy as I ve probably just made it sound  though  First and foremost  it s a thrilling  chilling tale of horror  Great stuff  I hereby forgive Stevenson for boring me in Kidnapped   www fictionfanblog wordpress com Robert Louis Stevenson in essiz ve

deaktive olsaydi  neler yapardik  I ll admit it   I ve deliberately avoided reading this book for years  I suppose it s entered folk lore and spreads through thoughts and cultures still  It s revered by many and I was a little concerned that I d be disappointed by the book  What a fool I ve been When I was in the library a couple of weeks ago  it was there face out and calling to me  It seemed so slight and vulnerable among the weighty tomes that I just had to do it  Boy  am I glad I did Unfortunately  I forgot to write down my memorable quotes before returning it  but there s so much for you to find out about this one that my lack of input is hardly going to matter I was somewhat taken aback by the brilliance of this story First of all  there s the way the story is revealed in snapshots  The disquiet and the sinister aspects of the story bite straight away  but I was always hungry to unpeel another layer to get to the bottom of things  even with my prior knowledge of what I would eventually find  imagine reading a book like this with no sense of what it was about   how amazing that would have been  The language is exquisite  A vocabulary that s at least a couple of pegs above my own is used to keep things tight and minimal  With very few words  Stevenson manages to offer a complete picture of a scene or an idea The characters are superb  from the upper strata of the social set to the butlers and servants of the world  Extraneous story elements just don t exist  In one scene  the lawyer Utterson visits a doctor to find out information  The scene is set and time and place are perfectly fixed  In terms of the conversation  there s no fluff  All the preamble is missing and all that s offered is the meat that is necessary to feed the tale I d love it if some of the craft and skill on show here were to seep into my words and wonder how much better I might be as a writer if I d come to this a long time ago The book s brilliant  The horror and darkness are cold and clammy  The plight of Jekyll is terrible yet understandable  who wouldn t enjoy that liberation from the cerebral ways of the human for a while   and absolutely tragic The only question I am left with related to the pronunciation of the author s name  A friend of mine tells me the middle name should be pronounce  Lewis  and he generally knows  Maybe drop a comment if you concur All in all  it s a must read   don t hesitate and pop down to the library or load that kindle right away   either way  it s free   Me cuesta trabajo creer que Stevenson escribia bajo la influencia de la cocaina  Estos cuentos son sobrios  solemnes y bien pulidos  Sus narraciones tienen una directriz oscura  pero no vacia  te guia por la anecdota como quien te lleva de la mano apuradamente para mostrarte una sorpresa y entonces no sabes que te mostrara  pero sabes por la andanza que sera algo bueno En cuanto al  cuento estelar  de estos relatos  entiendo por que Jekyll y Hyde se convirtieron en un fenomeno cultural  No se trata de una persona que brinca del bien al mal como tristemente se ha hecho creer  sino de materializar toda la maldad que cada individuo conlleva en si  Jekyll es un compuesto del bien y el mal  el lleva a Hyde en si mismo  mientras que Hyde es puramente el  se desentiende de la moral y la etica del doctor  no asi con Jekyll que observa  reprueba y considera lo que Hyde es y construye  No es pues el angel y el diablo en un cuerpo  es un cuerpo que puede exponer la parte malvada que lo conforma  A esto  agregar que Hyde no es un monstruo gigantesco  tosco y  hulkiano  como lo pintan muchas pantallas  sino un ser enano  encorvado  complexion justificada por el propio Jekyll que se recrimina el mal reprimido que guardaba durante tantos anos y que finalmente vino a convertirse en el andante Hyde  no fuera de Jekyll  sino usurpando el espacio que por naturaleza tambien es el suyo Con esta seleccion que hace Valdemar de los cuentos de Stevenson  me quedo con una sensacion de fantasmas en la mente  cobran presencia  debaten sobre la virtud y la monstruosidad  alzan la mano en protesta de su lugar reducido a un  tu no existas   El extrano caso del doctor Jekyll y Mr  Hyde evidencia la catastrofe personal que seria el tener demonios permisibles  tangibles que no porque se supriman quiere decir que no estan alli   Beginnings We start the tale by a long description of Mr Utterson  later on we learn that he is a friend of Dr Jekyll who employs his services as lawyer  We learn that this lawyer is able to love things but abstain from being without them for long periods  such as his love for the theatre which he has not seen for 20 years  it appears he is a patient man  This ability of abstention can be seen in his relationships  with his friends such as Dr Jekyll where over the years contact has dwindled  Mr Utterson is used as the opening for the book  he introduces the tone of the novel from his statements of  I let my brother go to the devil   However the description of him goes on to illustrate that his few friends were from a long  deep cultivated relationship  as ivy grows  The scene is set on the streets of London with Mr Utterson and his cousin Mr Enfield walking together rapt in discussion about an incident that Mr Enfield witnessed and was involved in  The eerie tale is recited to Mr Utterson who although he digresses does not get involved with such strange occurrences  finds himself engrossed in finding out the mystery of Mr Hyde and his relationship with his dear friend Dr Jekyll EndingsThroughout the book we discover the mystery of Mr Hyde and see the true relationship between him and Dr Jekyll  In the end we see the hopeless actions of Mr Utterson who now strives to save his brother from the devil  but is to late to stop Dr Jekyll s on his course of destruction  Dr Jekyll recounts his tale and his last moments in letter at the end of the novel  In this letter we see Dr Jekyll consumed by his desires  consumed by the evil nature of the heart  We see how he lost himself to the addiction of a life of certain freedom  of no constraints  of not being him  being another person  It is human nature illustrated so poignantly not wanting to be yourself  We are shown how Dr Jekyll walked into the sea  to drown himself in that perception of freedom  On the whole the novel is about an identity crisis  and is heavily imbued with sacrilegious themes  of science meddling in creation  in the soul and how ultimately the human desire in science will lead to untimely destruction of human kind  Introducing CharacterStevenson true to the thriller genre establishes the entrance of Mr Hyde classically  shrouded in mystery  The entire novel is the slow bone chilling introduction of Mr Hyde  an evil being  whose very existence is heretical  The malevolent spirit is emitted from the very first mention of this unknown disfigured gentleman stalking the streets on London  Throughout the novel we are teased with savage imagery and the immoral streaks of this Mr Hyde who is presented as Dr Jekyll tormentor  However Mr Hyde did not ask to be created  it was Dr Jekyll s continued addicted relationship with the release  to create such a creature and then confine it  to deny it freedom would not drive anyone insane  So in the end were we introduced to a savage monster  or a misunderstood victim not knowing how to survive  Who was the tormentor Mr Hyde or Dr Jekyll  a scientist obsessed with the destruction of the human spirit  In the pinnacle moments did Mr Hyde take hold of the only thing in his possession  the only thing in his control his life  along with his captor  his tormentor  Narrative ViewpointThe main plot is witnessed in the account of three characters Mr Utterson  Dr Jekyll and Doctor Lanyon  The three are close friends who over the years have drifted apart yet are still closely bonded by their experiences together  We are shown the disintegration of these three brothers who are all in someway consumed by the devil  Dr Jekyll and Doctor Lanyon is perspective both acquired through letters  which hold the voices of the dead  containing their secrets  their anguish and the causes of their demise  The perception of situation is also seen from Pooel a servant in the Dr Jekyll household  and Mr Enfield  both in conversation with Mr Utterson  The perspective seen from these two characters are mainly fillers for the blank periods of time  The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is the recordings of Mr Utterson s investigation of Mr Hyde  Extrinsic Attitudes There are a number of influences and links that can be seen reflecting the society in the late 19th century  The stand off between the religious attitude in society and the meddling scientists was extremely strong  The scientific community in the late 19th century had a post Darwinian perspective  they were also beginning to examine various biological influences on human morality  including drug and alcohol addiction  homosexuality  multiple personality disorder  and regressive animality  The novella portrays human nature and how the ultimate desires leads it destruction  It submits a message that we should not play with things that we don t understand however the doctor pushes boundaries  he puts himself in a position of God  Although to learn  to experiment is what advances  what progresses humankind although this desire may end up consuming us  Scientists  doctors are seen in some sense as noble  yet Dr Jekyll though deluded felt he was doing something right in the beginning to understand the human psyche  However to meddle with the mind  will have no good outcome  it shows that there are places where we should still not venture  The evil in the novel is reflected in deformities shown in the appearance of Mr Hyde  it also demonstrates the society s reaction to those different  However could not the true representation of evil be seen in Dr Jekyll someone who could create such a sacrilegious existence  The fable of Mr Hyde could have been influenced through tales such as bogeyman like Mr Hyde the bogeyman s appearance depends on the beholder  however both are seen as an embodiment of terror  In the end to this society it was message that they should not reach for the stars  they are not Gods    It was a wild  cold  seasonable night of March  with a pale moon  lying on her back  as though the wind had tilted her  and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture  The wind made talking difficult  and flecked the blood into the face  It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers  besides  for Mr  Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted  He could have wished it otherwise  never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow creatures  for  struggle as he might  there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity   Honestly  I hadn t read anything from Stevenson before  I read this book on a whim really because I received it in the mail from Easton Press  It was short  about 120 pages  and I had heard so much of this story before  how many movies had I seen of this  Yet what I read really blew me away  I honestly loved it  Stevenson nailed the last chapter so powerfully to describe the duality of motives within us  On one hand  we want to do good  yet on the other hand  evil is right there with us  That which we feed becomes stronger in a sense  though in truth it is only possibly through the power of the Holy Spirit to ever do good  Yet it was brilliant  it was only somewhat archaic because I knew the plot  But imagine reading this book for the first time  never ever imagining the outcome to be the way it was  There is little stretch to understand the popularity of Stevenson when he came over to the states after it s publication  I doubt even Hunger Games sold as much  Please read and enjoy  It will be well worth your time  This is why I love the classics  This short little book is so very powerful and gives such a raw glimpse into the struggle that everyone has faced more then once in our lives I found myself relating to the characters in this story quite a bit  The overall theme in this book is something that I believe everyone can relate to  How often do we  as humans fall into something simply through our own carelessness only to find ourselves addicted and attempting to escape the darkness that we have caused ourselves to fall into The evil in this short story is quite believable  Robert Louis Stevenson is a genius  Instead of a sociopath  we simply have the error and evil of human self  Really  Stevenson summed up the emotions  error  and thinking of the human mind so perfectly  We THINK that we are simply testing something out and we won t become addicted or ensnared by it  but in the end it only destroys us  In the beginning we think we are strong enough to resist the evils that we have seen others fall into  but as time goes on and we become more and more wrapped up in whatever force has us ensnared we find that we are destroying ourselves and we must escape the darkness that we have fallen into  I didn t find this book depressing  I found it raw and real  I re read various pages several times because I could relate so much to what Stevenson was attempting to show the reader  He did it quite well in fact  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is an amazing piece of literature         Love  Love  Love  Full review to come  I recently read Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and I would recommend that everyone read this short  insightful book at some point  The story has had a large impact on my own thinking  because I read it over a week ago and I still cannot get it off of my mind  If you have not read this story  I am sure that you are at least familiar with the work  Christians would benefit greatly from this book because it reveals man s sinfulness  his need for the gospel  and the importance of community Many people view Dr  Jekyll as the  good  personality and Mr  Hyde as the  evil  personality  We easily look to Hyde as the evil one for committing crimes  and Jekyll as the good one for living a respectable life   even doing good now and then  However  this book is not a story about good fighting against evil  Dr  Jekyll desires to do evil  yet he will not act upon his desires so that he will not tarnish his reputation  So his evil heart found a way to work out these desires by disguising himself as Mr  Hyde  Although Hyde commits the atrocities  he is only acting upon what Jekyll already wants to do  In fact  Jekyll is  more evil  than Hyde  because Jekyll is the one who creates Hyde as a means of committing evil without consequences  The Bible tells us that no righteous person exits  Even when man does something good on his own it is equivalent to dirty  filthy rags  Dr  Jekyll evidences this truth  as he would often do good deeds   even correcting the evil done by himself in the form of Mr  Hyde  This story clearly presents the sinfulness of man Stevenson s presentation of man s sin makes us acutely aware of our need for the gospel  Literature allows the reader not only to have a mental knowledge of man s sin  but also to be emotionally moved against sin  When we read of the horrific crimes committed by Hyde  we feel anger towards both him and Dr  Jekyll  So what is the solution  What do we need to combat this sinful nature that pervades men s hearts  We need the Gospel  God does not convict of sin without giving us the solution  In his book  How The Gospel Brings Us All The Way Home  Derek Thomas wrote  when God reveals sin He is calling us to repentance   When God makes us aware of the evil in our hearts  He wants us to call upon the promise offered to us in 1 John that  if we confess our sin  He is faithful and just to forgive our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  This story allows us to see our need for the gospel  Finally  this book helps us understand our need for community  As Mary Shelley explores what it means to be human in the popular story of Frankenstein  she points out that humans desire relationships  No matter what provisions a person has  or how wealthy a person is  human companionship is essential  The more recent Harry Potter stories make the same observation early on in the series by portraying Harry  although wealthy beyond his imagination  as sad and lonely on his first Christmas at Hogwarts because his friends have their families to celebrate with them  and he does not  Humans  at a basic level  desire community and companionship  More importantly  Christians understand that becoming a child of God also brings them into the family of God  God uses other believers to aid in the pursuit of holiness of other family members  Sinclair Ferguson reminds us that  our fellowship with other Christians is one of the chief instruments God has given us to overcome sin   We are not made to live on our own  separated from other believers  During Dr  Jekyll s worst moments he cut himself off from every relationship  minimizing any accountability in his life  Hebrews 10 24 exhorts believers to consider those around them   to take interest in the lives of our fellow believers  God uses other people to help us in our pursuits of holiness  Stevenson shows that man at a basic level desires companionship  and that believers ought to pursue Christian community  Stevenson teaches us about man s sinfulness  our need for the gospel  and the necessity of community in this short book  Although there is much to be learned from this story  these are the main points that stood out to me  I would highly recommend this book and hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did   Another classic that I have never read  I was surprised at how short this book is  Not really a  novel   more like a long short story  The beauty of this story is that we get the events from the perspective of a lawyer  Mr  Utterson   even though it s in third person  Then  at the end  we get the whole story from the perspective of Dr  Jekyll  himself  Oddly  all of the representations that I have ever seen of this story  even the Bugs Bunny parody  really don t quite do it justice  Hyde wasn t necessarily an ugly monster  as most people have depicted him  He was  rather  the embodiment of the evil that lives within each of us  I think  in some ways  this is a moral tale  Good vs  evil  and how  if we give it a foot in the door  evil will take over  Incidentally  I did not like the afteward by Jerome Charyn in the Bantam Classic edition  I find it very pretentious when people presume to tell me what the author really meant  Reminds me of school lit classes  which I also hated  Someday  I would like to write a novel that becomes famous and sit in on a lit class  so I can tell the teacher how wrong he she is about what I was writing about  Pft  The analogy of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde has probably been used by people since the story was published but I wonder how many people have actually read the book  I had never read it before and found it to be an interesting study of human nature  Jekyll tries to release the evil nature in himself without any guilt  His personal struggles are no different than the struggle against sin inside of everyone as St Paul describes on Romans  Jekyll s loss of control over his evil self brings him down  St Paul concludes   What a wretched man I am   For the Christian there is victory over sin in Christ  Thanks be to God who gives us the victory in Christ Jesus our Lord  As with so many of the older classics  we think we know the plots and characters from word of mouth or  God forbid  the film versions of the stories In the past few months  I ve read FRANKENSTEIN  DRACULA and now  THE STRANGE CASE OF DR  JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE Each one was had so much more depth and value and was more beautifully enhanced by brilliant writing than I would have imagined Robert Louis Stevenson s youth was bound by poor health that required frequent periods of isolation and bed rest  Perhaps the very fact that his life was so confined freed his imagination to give birth to the characters in his stories JEKYLL AND HYDE is a study of good versus evil   a common plot in all literature   but the insight he gives you into the minds of these dual beings is the beauty of the book that no other source of telling can portray with any justice or satisfaction  Amazing  Very strange  and very different  If I hadn t known the story beforehand  it would have been quite a good mystery for me   Although  I must admit  I m not all that engaged when it comes to deciphering mysteries  I found it a little silly how everyone was so incredibly repulsed by Mr Hyde  it just seemed a little irrational  But I m nearing the end  though  and it s all coming clear now  It s a great read  I love it  Recommended to all those who enjoy dry fiction and fantasic wordplay  Post script  The MARVEL character known as the Incredible Hulk was supposedly inspired by this novel as well as Frankenstein by Mary Shelley  Considering my knowledge on these topics  I can certainly see why   knt hdhh hy ltjrb  l wl  ly m  styfnswn   lrwy  knt mn trjm  l bqry  Hmd khld twfyq    jmy

hacia muy monotono  como muy plano pero el ultimom capitulo es sencillamente una obra maestra y con el cobra sentido todo el libro   Es increible todo lo que cuenta y lo que transmite en tan poquitas paginas  es el tipico libro que se lee en un dia Sin duda yo creo que este libro tiene una gran dosis de verdad aunque muchos de nosotros nos empenenemos en negarlo y supongo que habra sorprendido mucho en aquella epoca  Sin duda un clasico que hay que leer si o si  yo tuve la suerte de que no sabia nada de la historia pero aunque la conozcas merece mucho la pena   I VE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS Stevenson is an author that has always captivated me  and so he has done with this magnificent short novel  There you go  Rob  you are the real MVP        Como todo el mundo lo estaba leyendo tambien quise hacer lo mismo  y fue una buena eleccion   Me gusto muchisimo  Nunca dejan de sorprenderme los clasicos  Uno tiene las ideas tan preconcebidas que no se da cuenta de lo que se esta perdiendo entre las explicaciones y las historias basadas en el original  Por eso los clasicos son de obligada lectura para conocer la realidad del concepto y no el producto del marketing  Jekyll y Hide la dualidad entre el bien y el mal entre el poder de crear y destruir a voluntad  la necesidad de autoafirmarse escondiendose de la realidad sin esperar las consecuencias de los propios actos o actos ajenos vividos en propia carne  Encontrar ese pasadizo secreto que te permite ocultarte y disfruta de una nueva realidad para saciar tus sentidos y ser no lo que esperan de ti sino lo que realmente alberga tu verdadera personalidad esa que ni en privado eres capaz de vislumbrar porque el ser humano no es un bien o un mal sino un conjunto de sensaciones eticas o prohibidas que nos obligan a controlar Una historia que te sorprendera y te hara pensar en lo que tu escondes en tu interior  con el peligro de ser devorado por la propia bestia que tu has mimado y alimentado  siempre subyacente  Los clasicos nunca defraudan  After seeing so many classic film adaptations of this book  I figured it was about time I read it  Since I already knew what it was about  I can t say I was surprised at the end  However  it is a great read  Certainly an original for its time and I think it should be a celebrated piece of horror fiction still  My favorite part would have to be Dr  Jekyll s take on everything that had happen  It was a good character study  looking into what he was feeling and what he was struggling with internally  I think I may reread this around Halloween time along with Sleepy Hallow because it is such a classic that it has to be retold  In a way  the concept is still relevant even in realistic terms  Everyday people live their lives a certain way  Then people get tired of a certain lifestyle and opt for a new one because its so different from what you are use to  This is why I enjoyed this story so much  It explores deep rooted moral  emotional  and I guess physical conflict in a person that go along with that idea  I  m rambling but hopefully you get what I mean Overall  it is a good story  Though I wasn t surprised by the twist  which we all know what it is   the idea is still captivating  Again  very original for its time too   More like 4 5 stars but I m feeling charitable so I ll round up This is another book where I was familiar with the basics but parts of the story surprised me  The story is not told by Jekyll or Hyde but by Dr  Jekyll s friend Mr  Utterson  Utterson is alarmed by some changes in his friend s habits but basically just goes about life as normal  as I probably would when a friend is going through a crisis that I don t know anything about  Utterson notices that Dr  Jekyll has become friends with a loathsome man named Hyde  that Hyde has complete access to Jekyll s home and possessions  and that Hyde has inexplicably been named the beneficiary in Jekyll s will if anything were to happen to Jekyll   or if Jekyll were to mysteriously disappear We don t get to find out what s actually going on until the end of the book  If I knew nothing about the story I probably would have been mystified and deliciously frightened  But because the story is so famous and I knew exactly what was happening  I could concentrate on the masterful language and storytelling Perfect Halloween read  I ll admit I skipped the essay at the end which was meant to explain the book for me  Honestly  do these people think we re idiots  What s with the introductions and  afterwords  for famous novels   You hear all the time he she has a Dr  Jekyll Mr  Hyde personality  It s funny after having read the story  I have a totally new respect for Jekyll Hyde  Was Dr  Jekyll insane  Let s see  he was a scientist who liked to experiment  which is what any scientist worth his salt would do  He also believed that every human was more than just one  self  but several personalities in one  Jekyll believed there was a way to bring out all sides to the human being  while still keeping the original host  the essence of one s soul  Actually  that s not insanity but sheer brilliance because he s right  Every person has several sides  The problem was once Jekyll discovered the correct potion to test his theory  he didn t factor in that something could go horribly wrong  For every cause there is an effect  and that was Jekyll s error  Once Mr  Hyde began to shape of his former self  Hyde represented all that was evil and sinister within Jekyll  He took all that bad and lived the bad boy life  And what was even more thrilling than that  while Jekyll lay dormant while Hyde took over  Jekyll enjoyed what Hyde did  He liked living dangerously and murderously because it gave him power When the potion began to take on a whole personality of its own  Jekyll soon discovered he would change whenever his body felt like it without his knowledge  See  that s another thing the good doctor didn t factor in  He thought his personality would only change  but the potion caused the personality to mold into a completely different looking person  which is amazing because that part of the experiment actually rang true  If you have different sides  certainly all those sides will not look the same  He d go to bed as Jekyll only to wake up as Hyde  And Hyde was horrifyingly disfigured and a small shell of a man  unlike the bigger than life Dr  Jekyll who was a very tall and lean man  Unfortunately  Dr  Jekyll failed to realize his experiment didn t quite go deep enough  The only sides Jekyll had was his good side  being the doctor  and his evil side being Mr  Hyde  He had nothing else and this brought about a deep struggle within himself and threw him into a deep depression I found this story so captivating and gave me much more insight into the mind of what most called a mad man  but after having read and deeply reviewed  I m not so sure he was as everyone suggested  What he ultimately learned of himself drove him to insanity when he realized he couldn t forego being Mr  Hyde no more than he could being Dr  Jekyll  He actually created monsters  He had a great idea  but unfortunately  didn t think it all the way through  If he could have controlled Mr  Hyde  I suppose this story would have had a different ending  Outstanding read  I absolutely loved this book  Honestly  this was amazing  I don t understand how you could dislike this book  However  after completing it  I felt somewhat saddened that I couldn t have read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde with a clean slate and having absolutely no idea about anything in the story  Unfortunately  that was not the case at all  I knew the general idea that Jekyll and Hyde were one  However  I did not know anything about the plot  So that was a bonus The plot was not incredibly complex  however it was pretty intricate  I absolutely loved it  I enjoyed the entire cast in the story  particularly Utterson  He was so simple and trustworthy  very contrary to Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde The ending actually surprised me  My jaw actually dropped and I had to read it twice so I could get the full understanding of it  After my second time through  I felt deep rooted sympathy for Dr  Jekyll and that his scientific discoveries lead to such suffering  But  what needed to be done was done  Overall  amazing book  Loved it   mfz    km hy mfz   fkr  lqS

this long to read  I Personally love that Stevenson addressed both the good and evil that reside in our species  I speak often of the dark side that lives within us and how we so often pretend it is not there or cover it up  it s taboo to speak of the hell that lives in all of us  Everyday we awake  and as a decent human we try to do what is right and proper but in our minds our thoughts go opposite of our actions  Example  driving on the blvd today saw a pig  person  throw a plastic bottle out of the window onto the street while approaching a red light  I immediately thought about how satisfying it would be to get out  pick up the bottle  shatter his window and make him Choke on the bottle while asking him if the earth is his trashcan  That was my Hyde that lives in me but I kept my Jekyll and did nothing like a good little controlled Citizen  I would have went to jail for helping the planet fight its parasites  Ok so anyway I Absolutely love the novella and its writing style  I totally get the duality of man thing  we all live it  everyday  When I think of book I d like to hand to an alien species to understand humanity I d like to give them this here masterpiece  If your wondering   should I read this   The answer is an overwhelming YES  In this classic tale  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Stevenson has recreated London back to the past where there is a doctor named Harry Jekyll and a very strange man named Mr  Hyde  The main character Mr  Utterson who is Dr  Jekyll s lawyer trying to find out who is this  Mr  Edward Hyde  character in Dr  Jekyll s will  He also has heard the name  Mr  Hyde  moving around London because Hyde has trampled a little girl walking in the street on night  Being one of Dr  Jekyll s closest friends he demands to find answers to who Mr  Hyde is and why Dr  Jekyll is giving him everything he owns when he dies  The thing that I liked about this book was that it was a classic which are my personal favorite genre next to superhero comics  Classics to me are the best because it allows the reader to see what life was sort of like back then where most of the action took place in London due to the fact that most of the authors wrote in British  Stevenson he made London sound like a dark mysterious place to be in throughout the story due to it mostly setting at night time  In the story through Mr  Utterson s point of view  he seems like he is desperate to know what Dr  Jekyll is hiding from him in his will  He goes to all the possible people who might know why Mr  Hyde is in Dr  Jekyll s will  But having the story be from Mr  Utterson s perspective was a bad idea  in my opinion  because he is so desperate that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants  Also Jekyll gave Utterson his will a long time ago and decides to investigate now which is still odd to me after reading it I enjoyed this book because it had a lot of mystery involved in it and it really keeps you wondering  how is Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde related   I would recommend this book to anyone who really enjoys classic novels  Robert Louis Stevenson is one of my favorite authors  He can be a little hard to understand at times  I had heard of this story before  I did not decide to read it until some time ago  In the beginning of the story Mr  Enfield and Mr  Utterson are taking a walk  Mr  Enfield takes notice of a door that reminds him of a horrible event committed by Mr  Hyde  Later Mr  Utterson finds out that Dr Jekyll would turn his estate over to the one and only Mr  Hyde if something happened to him  Mr  Utterson becomes intrigued and wants discover the truth of the strange happening  Dr  Jekyll refuses to relay any important information at that given point in time Mr  Utterson is a lawyer who is investigating to find out the truth  He appears to have a sense of loyalty to his friend s wishes  Dr  Jekyll is a friend of Mr  Utterson  He is a rather respected doctor and seems to have a lot of money  Mr  Poole is Dr  Jekyll s butler  He is loyal and has worked for the doctor for twenty years  He very is concerned for the welfare of Dr  Jekyll  Dr  Lanyon is a friend of Dr  Jekyll  Something happens later that causes him to wish never to hear of his now former friend  Dr  Jekyll again  Mr  Enfield is a friend and a distant cousin to Mr  Utterson  The two of them often take long walks together  Mr  Hyde is spoken of as being deformed and giving those around him a sense of a presence of evil  Not only does he appear evil but he is evil The setting takes place in the the late nineteenth century in London  England  This may fit because people at that time believed in strange ideas The main theme of this story is the good and evil in oneself  I find an example of this in Dr  Jekyll  His experiments show both sides of him  the good and the evil I would recommend this story to teens and adults who love mysteries  The story can be very hard to understand   knt wl qS  qrh mn slsl  ldb l lmy llnshy yn lty

questo piccolo capolavoro e stato davvero un piacere  Bella la struttura narrativa  la suspence  le atmosfere opache  per non parlare poi della descrizione dello sdoppiamento del dottor Jekyll in mr Hyde     nascondere  che fa parte dell immaginario di ogni lettore occidentale   A well written creeper  Also a brilliant critique of the human condition and the scientific quest to perfect it  Henry

narrated and well recommended as one of the essential classics  Possibly the best  most polished of the great horror classics  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a wonderful and profound book that I re read every decade or so  I would love to write something this iconic  How can such a short book  66 pages in the edition I loaned from the library  get you so spell bound  Simply marvellous  The way Stevenson writes is just   there are no words  Wow  A very good novel  describing the dual nature of a man s existence  of  outward respectability and inward lust as they say  A classic and a must read  Surprisingly quick read   haven t read this in awhile   and a nice tight  brisk cautionary tale  Of course  a classic for a reason     ry    mn rwy   styfnswn bl mn rwy   ldb lnfs hyd lwjh lsy  ldktwr jykl wlmstr tHt jldhlSr  byn lkhyr wlshr khms njwm bl mnz  I recently read Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and I would recommend that everyone read this short  insightful book at some point  The story has had a large impact on my own thinking  because I read it over a week ago and I still cannot get it off of my mind  If you have not read this story  I am sure that you are at least familiar with the work  Christians would benefit greatly from this book because it reveals man s sinfulness  his need for the gospel  and the importance of community Many people view Dr  Jekyll as the  good  personality and Mr  Hyde as the  evil  personality  We easily look to Hyde as the evil one for committing crimes  and Jekyll as the good one for living a respectable life   even doing good now and then  However  this book is not a story about good fighting against evil  Dr  Jekyll desires to do evil  yet he will not act upon his desires so that he will not tarnish his reputation  So his evil heart found a way to work out these desires by disguising himself as Mr  Hyde  Although Hyde commits the atrocities  he is only acting upon what Jekyll already wants to do  In fact  Jekyll is  more evil  than Hyde  because Jekyll is the one who creates Hyde as a means of committing evil without consequences  The Bible tells us that no righteous person exits  Even when man does something good on his own it is equivalent to dirty  filthy rags  Dr  Jekyll evidences this truth  as he would often do good deeds   even correcting the evil done by himself in the form of Mr  Hyde  This story clearly presents the sinfulness of man Stevenson s presentation of man s sin makes us acutely aware of our need for the gospel  Literature allows the reader not only to have a mental knowledge of man s sin  but also to be emotionally moved against sin  When we read of the horrific crimes committed by Hyde  we feel anger towards both him and Dr  Jekyll  So what is the solution  What do we need to combat this sinful nature that pervades men s hearts  We need the Gospel  God does not convict of sin without giving us the solution  In his book  How The Gospel Brings Us All The Way Home  Derek Thomas wrote  when God reveals sin He is calling us to repentance   When God makes us aware of the evil in our hearts  He wants us to call upon the promise offered to us in 1 John that  if we confess our sin  He is faithful and just to forgive our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  This story allows us to see our need for the gospel  Finally  this book helps us understand our need for community  As Mary Shelley explores what it means to be human in the popular story of Frankenstein  she points out that humans desire relationships  No matter what provisions a person has  or how wealthy a person is  human companionship is essential  The more recent Harry Potter stories make the same observation early on in the series by portraying Harry  although wealthy beyond his imagination  as sad and lonely on his first Christmas at Hogwarts because his friends have their families to celebrate with them  and he does not  Humans  at a basic level  desire community and companionship  More importantly  Christians understand that becoming a child of God also brings them into the family of God  God uses other believers to aid in the pursuit of holiness of other family members  Sinclair Ferguson reminds us that  our fellowship with other Christians is one of the chief instruments God has given us to overcome sin   We are not made to live on our own  separated from other believers  During Dr  Jekyll s worst moments he cut himself off from every relationship  minimizing any accountability in his life  Hebrews 10 24 exhorts believers to consider those around them   to take interest in the lives of our fellow believers  God uses other people to help us in our pursuits of holiness  Stevenson shows that man at a basic level desires companionship  and that believers ought to pursue Christian community  Stevenson teaches us about man s sinfulness  our need for the gospel  and the necessity of community in this short book  Although there is much to be learned from this story  these are the main points that stood out to me  I would highly recommend this book and hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did   Another classic that I have never read  I was surprised at how short this book is  Not really a  novel   more like a long short story  The beauty of this story is that we get the events from the perspective of a lawyer  Mr  Utterson   even though it s in third person  Then  at the end  we get the whole story from the perspective of Dr  Jekyll  himself  Oddly  all of the representations that I have ever seen of this story  even the Bugs Bunny parody  really don t quite do it justice  Hyde wasn t necessarily an ugly monster  as most people have depicted him  He was  rather  the embodiment of the evil that lives within each of us  I think  in some ways  this is a moral tale  Good vs  evil  and how  if we give it a foot in the door  evil will take over  Incidentally  I did not like the afteward by Jerome Charyn in the Bantam Classic edition  I find it very pretentious when people presume to tell me what the author really meant  Reminds me of school lit classes  which I also hated  Someday  I would like to write a novel that becomes famous and sit in on a lit class  so I can tell the teacher how wrong he she is about what I was writing about  Pft  The analogy of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde has probably been used by people since the story was published but I wonder how many people have actually read the book  I had never read it before and found it to be an interesting study of human nature  Jekyll tries to release the evil nature in himself without any guilt  His personal struggles are no different than the struggle against sin inside of everyone as St Paul describes on Romans  Jekyll s loss of control over his evil self brings him down  St Paul concludes   What a wretched man I am   For the Christian there is victory over sin in Christ  Thanks be to God who gives us the victory in Christ Jesus our Lord  As with so many of the older classics  we think we know the plots and characters from word of mouth or  God forbid  the film versions of the stories In the past few months  I ve read FRANKENSTEIN  DRACULA and now  THE STRANGE CASE OF DR  JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE Each one was had so much more depth and value and was more beautifully enhanced by brilliant writing than I would have imagined Robert Louis Stevenson s youth was bound by poor health that required frequent periods of isolation and bed rest  Perhaps the very fact that his life was so confined freed his imagination to give birth to the characters in his stories JEKYLL AND HYDE is a study of good versus evil   a common plot in all literature   but the insight he gives you into the minds of these dual beings is the beauty of the book that no other source of telling can portray with any justice or satisfaction  Amazing  Very strange  and very different  If I hadn t known the story beforehand  it would have been quite a good mystery for me   Although  I must admit  I m not all that engaged when it comes to deciphering mysteries  I found it a little silly how everyone was so incredibly repulsed by Mr Hyde  it just seemed a little irrational  But I m nearing the end  though  and it s all coming clear now  It s a great read  I love it  Recommended to all those who enjoy dry fiction and fantasic wordplay  Post script  The MARVEL character known as the Incredible Hulk was supposedly inspired by this novel as well as Frankenstein by Mary Shelley  Considering my knowledge on these topics  I can certainly

el cobra sentido todo el libro   Es increible todo lo que cuenta y lo que transmite en tan poquitas paginas  es el tipico libro que se lee en un dia Sin duda yo creo que este libro tiene una gran dosis de verdad aunque muchos de nosotros nos empenenemos en negarlo y supongo que habra sorprendido mucho en aquella epoca  Sin duda un clasico que hay que leer si o si  yo tuve la suerte de que no sabia nada de la historia pero aunque la conozcas merece mucho la pena   I VE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS Stevenson is an author that has always captivated me  and so he has done with this magnificent short novel  There you go  Rob  you are the real MVP        Como todo el mundo lo estaba leyendo tambien quise hacer lo mismo  y fue una buena eleccion   Me gusto muchisimo  Nunca dejan de sorprenderme los clasicos  Uno tiene las ideas tan preconcebidas que no se da cuenta de lo que se esta perdiendo entre las explicaciones y las historias basadas en el original  Por eso los clasicos son de obligada lectura para conocer la realidad del concepto y no el producto del marketing  Jekyll y Hide la dualidad entre el bien y el mal entre el poder de crear y destruir a voluntad  la necesidad de autoafirmarse escondiendose de la realidad sin esperar las consecuencias de los propios actos o actos ajenos vividos en propia carne  Encontrar ese pasadizo secreto que te permite ocultarte y disfruta de una nueva realidad para saciar tus sentidos y ser no lo que esperan de ti sino lo que realmente alberga tu verdadera personalidad esa que ni en privado eres capaz de vislumbrar porque el ser humano no es un bien o un mal sino un conjunto de sensaciones eticas o prohibidas que nos obligan a controlar Una historia que te sorprendera y te hara pensar en lo que tu escondes en tu interior  con el peligro de ser devorado por la propia bestia que tu has mimado y alimentado  siempre subyacente  Los clasicos nunca defraudan  After seeing so many classic film adaptations of this book  I figured it was about time I read it  Since I already knew what it was about  I can t say I was surprised at the end  However  it is a great read  Certainly an original for its time and I think it should be a celebrated piece of horror fiction still  My favorite part would have to be Dr  Jekyll s take on everything that had happen  It was a good character study  looking into what he was feeling and what he was struggling with internally  I think I may reread this around Halloween time along with Sleepy Hallow because it is such a classic that it has to be retold  In a way  the concept is still relevant even in realistic terms  Everyday people live their lives a certain way  Then people get tired of a certain lifestyle and opt for a new one because its so different from what you are use to  This is why I enjoyed this story so much  It explores deep rooted moral  emotional  and I guess physical conflict in a person that go along with that idea  I  m rambling but hopefully you get what I mean Overall  it is a good story  Though I wasn t surprised by the twist  which we all know what it is   the idea is still captivating  Again  very original for its time too   More like 4 5 stars but I m feeling charitable so I ll round up This is another book where I was familiar with the basics but parts of the story surprised me  The story is not told by Jekyll or Hyde but by Dr  Jekyll s friend Mr  Utterson  Utterson is alarmed by some changes in his friend s habits but basically just goes about life as normal  as I probably would when a friend is going through a crisis that I don t know anything about  Utterson notices that Dr  Jekyll has become friends with a loathsome man named Hyde  that Hyde has complete access to Jekyll s home and possessions  and that Hyde has inexplicably been named the beneficiary in Jekyll s will if anything were to happen to Jekyll   or if Jekyll were to mysteriously disappear We don t get to find out what s actually going on until the end of the book  If I knew nothing about the story I probably would have been mystified and deliciously frightened  But because the story is so famous and I knew exactly what was happening  I could concentrate on the masterful language and storytelling Perfect Halloween read  I ll admit I skipped the essay at the end which was meant to explain the book for me  Honestly  do these people think we re idiots  What s with the introductions and  afterwords  for famous novels   You hear all the time he she has a Dr  Jekyll Mr  Hyde personality  It s funny after having read the story  I have a totally new respect for

story Mr  Enfield and Mr  Utterson are taking a walk  Mr  Enfield takes notice of a door that reminds him of a horrible event committed by Mr  Hyde  Later Mr  Utterson finds out that Dr Jekyll would turn his estate over to the one and only Mr  Hyde if something happened to him  Mr  Utterson becomes intrigued and wants discover the truth of the strange happening  Dr  Jekyll refuses to relay any important information at that given point in time Mr  Utterson is a lawyer who is investigating to find out the truth  He appears to have a sense of loyalty to his friend s wishes  Dr  Jekyll is a friend of Mr  Utterson  He is a rather respected doctor and seems to have a lot of money  Mr  Poole is Dr  Jekyll s butler  He is loyal and has worked for the doctor for twenty years  He very is concerned for the welfare of Dr  Jekyll  Dr  Lanyon is a friend of Dr  Jekyll  Something happens later that causes him to wish never to hear of his now former friend  Dr  Jekyll again  Mr  Enfield is a friend and a distant cousin to Mr  Utterson  The two of them often take long walks together  Mr  Hyde is spoken of as being deformed and giving those around him a sense of a presence of evil  Not only does he appear evil but he is evil The setting takes place in the the late nineteenth century in London  England  This may fit because people at that time believed in strange ideas The main theme of this story is the good and evil in oneself  I find an example of this in Dr  Jekyll  His experiments show both sides of him  the good and the evil I would recommend this story to teens and adults who love mysteries  The story can be very hard to understand   knt wl qS  qrh mn slsl  ldb l lmy llnshy yn lty Sdrth mktb  lsr     tkdt fy Hynh wn qrw h ny  shq lkhyl l lmy lqdr kbyr qS  jmyl  jdbs

written creeper  Also a brilliant critique of the human condition and the scientific quest to perfect it  Henry Jekyll is tempted to lead a double life  He concocts a potion and the hideous Hyde comes

Not so  I d always thought Dr Jekyll was the evil one           The version I read was audible  Brilliantly narrated and well recommended as one of the essential classics  Possibly the best  most polished of the great horror classics  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a wonderful and profound book that I re read every decade or so  I would love to write something this iconic  How can such a short book  66 pages in the edition I loaned from the library  get you so spell bound  Simply marvellous  The way Stevenson writes is just   there are no words  Wow  A very good novel  describing the dual nature of a man s existence  of  outward respectability and inward lust as they say  A classic and a must read  Surprisingly quick read   haven t read this in awhile   and a nice tight  brisk cautionary tale  Of course  a classic for a reason     ry    mn rwy   styfnswn bl mn rwy   ldb lnfs hyd lwjh lsy  ldktwr jykl wlmstr tHt jldhlSr  byn lkhyr wlshr khms njwm bl mnz  I came

a far parte del patrimonio della conoscenza comune  per sua fortuna e condanna  Quando ad un superbo thriller dal sapore gotico viene strappato il suo terribile segreto  il danno e pesante e il conseguente approccio del lettore non puo essere dei piu entusiasti  Eppure  la grandezza del capolavoro di Stevenson puo riassumersi in questo  nella sua incurante ed intrinseca capacita di rapire  I dettagli della storia  la maestria dello stile ed il ritmo incessante e travolgente  squarciano fin dalle primissime pagine qualsivoglia pregiudizio  anche quelli ingenerati da banalizzazioni e distorsioni operate da una certa filmografia   La sola nota d insoddisfazione attiene alla brevita dell opera  originalita della trama e superba narrativa dell autore avrebbero preteso una mole ben piu consistente  Ad ogni modo  libro consigliatissimo  Stevenson en este libro y sus historias  Olalla y El extrano caso de Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde    Mi favorito fue Olalla  Es una historia realmente genial  el concepto y como se mueven los personajes me encanto  de verdad  La historia se envuelve en misterios y preguntas  tambien hay amor en esta historia  amor y hermosura  Y es de esas historias que no tienen un final feliz  es triste pero es verdaderamente justificado  Una historia corta que vale la pena  Una de mis frases favoritas     Que importaba todo si aquel imperioso sentimiento sobrevivia  si sus ojos todavia me llamaban y ataban  si  ahora como antes  cada fibra de mi cuerpo entorpecido la anoraba y la buscaba    El extrano caso de Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde fue el siguiente  Una historia genial tambien  que no te debes perder  es un clasico  El como avanza cada vez esta historia te dejara enganchado y el final    es realmente magnifico  Leerlo es un regalo   I ll pick up and consume any Gothic horror novel  but this is not to say that Jekyll and Hyde isn t fantastic in it s own regard  The story isn t all that frightening by today s standards  although I did have an evening full of nightmares after finishing  but the attention to detail  which is a definite characteristic of the genre makes all the difference  I m not sure that Stevenson was paid by the word like many of the Victorian authors were  has anyone read a Penny Dreadful that wasn t the length of a telephone book   but if he was  he wasn t in it for the money  He does have long  detailed  and very Victorian sentences  yet his story is only a fraction of your typical Gothic horror novel  However  the writing style is beautiful and fits within the genre by creating an atmosphere that is unparalleled to any current day horror authors  in my opinion  This version of the story also has a few short stories by Stevenson  with the Bodysnatcher being one of the best   Excerpt from my full review at seattlebooks tumblr com I loved this book  Wow  I loved this book As with many classics  Robert Louis Stevenson s novella is available on Amazon for free on Kindle  It s 40 something pages when stripped of the other horror stories that usually make up a compilation  but no less striking as a standalone piece The story begins with a brief description of an English lawyer  Gabriel John Utterson  and his strange acquaintances and experiences with one Dr  Henry Jekyll  Right off the bat  Stevenson hooks us  A dark figure runs over a child on a street corner in the middle of the night  drawing the unwanted attention of some passersby  Although they don t have the words for it  each detects something evil in the man s appearance  From here  the mystery only grows Stevenson works his plot slowly  handing the reader pieces to this sinister puzzle but withholding the final one until the last two chapters  Today  of course  the plot twist of this case has been deeply embedded into American culture  preventing most readers from experiencing the full shock of Jekyll s unbecoming duality  I was pleasantly surprised to find the novella still packed a punch  however  still had the power to chill and frighten even without the use of its big reveal In fact  the most intriguing aspects of this story are buried in Jekyll s confession   The analysis of Jekyll s dual personalities is extensive and oft written  so I won t strive to add anything new to the conversation   Jekyll finds within himself a war of morals  On one hand  he is drawn towards a righteous  moral life  He does philanthropic work  is well respected by the community at large  and generally makes good and generous use of his time and resources  The undercurrent that runs through his upstanding character is a desire to live wild and free    to possess  as Jekyll puts it   an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul  I love the imagery here    the idea that there are two sides to everything  even freedom  Jekyll believes he can live free as two people  opposite in everything but memory  but it eventually devours everything in his path  his safety  his identity  and ultimately  his very life Jekyll s most stirring transformation occurs on a kind spring day  He has grown comfortable    too comfortable    with his arrangement between himself and Mr  Hyde I sat in the sun on a bench  the animal within me licking the chops of memory  the spiritual side a little drowsed  promising subsequent penitence  but not yet moved to begin It is then  when Jekyll feels strongest  that Hyde attacks  But  Stevenson asks of us  can we feel sympathetic towards a man who has placed his very soul in jeopardy  who has chosen to straddle the line between heaven and hell  Can we anticipate anything but the most thorough destruction  Zavladiavashchata istoriia na dr  Dzhekil   m zh  chiiato misiia e da pomaga na khorata i na mist r Khaid   preg rbeniiat diavol  koito porazhda otvrashchenie v v

reading them  This book was exacting that for me  I would recommend it to EVERYONE  No matter what genre of books you like to read this book is absolutely brilliant and I m sure that no one would be able to read it and hate it  The only thing I hated about this book is that it had to end  Basically  this book is about a doctor named Henry Jekyll who wants to rid himself of his evil thoughts so that he can be the respected man that everyone thinks he is without having this burden  So to do this  Jekyll creates a potion type thing to make him turn into this other person who he can then use to exercise these evil habits that he possesses  Jekyll can then get rid of the burden of these evil tendencies without actually having to do anything that would hurt his reputation  So when he drinks this potion type thing he becomes Mr Hyde who is essentially his evil side but in the form of a person  Let s just say this doesn t do to Jekyll s plan and a lot of things go wrong I don t really know what any of these  habits  are but I know there is a lot of speculation of what they could be or what experts who have analysed this book think they are  but nothing is definite  If I ever gave this book another read  which I probably will at some point  I will try and read it more thoroughly and analyze the text as well as just read it  So if I do that I will write another review on what I think those  habits  could possibly be  The only downside to this book is that it was crazy short and that really disappointed me about because I just didn t want it to be over  However  I did absolutely love how Stevenson ended the book with Jekyll s letter confession so we got to find out everything that happened from him rather than in the words of Utterson who might have been a bit biased as a friend of Jekyll and the story would have had to be written in his character which may have meant the truth would have had to be twisted  I love how Jekyll seemed to be that character that you knew you should have no sympathy for as it was all of his own doing but I started to have so much pity for him when reading that last chapter  This story is such a famous one and I recommend that before you watch any adaptations of it you read the book first to compare because this book was utterly brilliant  E  sempre difficile recensire un classico  Forse tonnellate di parole sono state sprecate per recensirlo  soprattutto da baroni della letteratura molto piu competenti di una semplice lettrice  Forse anche perche un classico deve essere a tutti i costi perfetto e bellissimo per antonomasia  ed ogni critica che si allontana da questo luogo comune viene vista con sospetto e  a volte  pure disgusto  portando il povero lettore ad essere additato come mediocre lettore di romanzetti di serie Z e troppo stupido per comprendere la vera letteratura  O forse anche perche la complessita di certi capisaldi letterari sono troppo grandi per poter essere recensiti in parole povere  Avrei dovuto leggere questo libro prima  ma ho sempre rifuggito i classici come la peste  ritenendoli troppo noiosi e verbosi  Mi sono invece accorta che certi capolavori della letteratura hanno bisogno di menti mature per essere apprezzati nella loro vera natura  mentre una mente giovane li vede solo come noiosi testi da leggere per forza  Chi non conosce la storia di Jekyll e Hyde  Sembra quasi banale descrivere il contenuto di questo piccolo gioiello  il cui titolo e entrato nel linguaggio collettivo come simbolo di  doppia personalita  e  alter ego   Eppure Jekyll e Hyde e molto piu di questa idea riduttiva  Jekyll e Hyde esplora il profondo dell animo umano  le passioni e i desideri repressi al fine di mostrare a tutti i costi un immagine consona a quello che la societa vorrebbe da noi  Jekyll e tanto represso e conformista quanto Hyde e libero e ribelle  La sua  cattiveria  potrebbe essere vista piu come una ribellione ad una societa chiusa e perbenista che una vera e propria forma di malvagita  Il disgusto che la gente prova nel guardalo in faccia esprime proprio questo concetto  E alla fine  come succede alle passioni a lungo represse  Jekyll non riesce piu a controllare il suo doppio  portandolo ad un inevitabile epilogo Leggere  Lo strano caso del Dottor Jekyll e di Mr Hyde   Assolutamente si  Ma solo se si e pronti ad analizzare nel profondo l animo umano  I have read it 3 times in my life and I enjoy it even more each time I read it  The last time I did it was for English literature and I had to write an essay about it  which I think made me enjoy it even more    Just in case someone wants to exercise a little bit more the intellect while after reading it  here s what we had to do Choose one of the following topics and write a critical essay 1  Why does The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde by R L  Stevenson deal only with men and not women   Consider this point  Are women also divided into good and evil sides  2  Can we read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde by R L  Stevenson as a story of drug addiction   Consider this question  Or could the drug be replaced by something else in this story  3  Does R L  Stevenson condemn Jekyll or sympathise with him   Consider this question  What is Stevenson attacking in his story   I read this book in my native language and i liked it  However it was very shortened so i read it again in the original text and it was awesome thing to re live the horror again within the story  I just love Stevenson s choose of the names  how Dr Jekyll wants to kill the part of himself that he hides  It s about good versus evil and also the limits of science  I loved it  so I m giving it five stars  Campo Elias Delgado  un ex combatiente de Vietnam  asesino hace casi treinta anos unas veintiocho personas en Bogota  incluida su propia madre   la mayoria en el Restaurante Pozzeto Este es el germen de la novela Satanas  de Mario Mendoza  Sobre el asunto se tejen muchas leyendas urbanas  alguna vez escuche de alguien cercano que Delgado y Mendoza fueron companeros de estudios de literatura en la Universidad Javeriana  y que el primero estaba obsesionado con la historia de Jekyll y Hyde  Incluso hay quienes dicen que despues de morir en el intercambio de disparos con la policia  a Campo Elias le encontraron una pequena edicion del libro de Robert L  Stevenson en el bolsillo de su gaban  Sea como fuere  este es uno de mis libros favoritos  Esta escrito de una manera precisa  dando unas pequenas pistas sobre la Londres victoriana  pero sobre todo  es una gran descripcion de la dualidad de la naturaleza humana  de los extremos que conviven dentro de nosotros y que se mantienen contenidos y tal vez  balanceados  gracias a lo que Freud denomino el Super Yo  la instancia moral que evita las consecuencias de actuar inclinado totalmente a uno u otro lado  El Doctor Henry Jekyll se indaga a si mismo sobre lo que alberga su ser  y a traves de una serie de experimentos quimicos logra extraer su lado oscuro  por medio de un ser de baja estatura  troglodita  velludo y horrendo que aparece luego de beber el liquido purpureo  el Senor Edward Hyde  claramente una alusion a escondido  u oculto   la representacion del Jekyll mas vil que no puede revelarse debido a su origen noble y su gran reputacion Estructurado como una especie de diario  un metodo comun de la epoca  Frankenstein  Dracula   en el que los personajes cuentan su vision sobre la historia  el libro termina con el monologo de Henry Jekyll  explicando el desarrollo del experimento y la manera como el actuar de Hyde lo seduce hasta hacerlo perder el control  asi mismo  narra como el liquido transformador de marras deja de surtir efecto y lo obliga a ceder por completo a la naturaleza de Hyde  tal como le sucedio a Campo Elias  O como nos podria suceder a cualquiera de nosotros   A Case of Murder and Mystery The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hide is a very intriguing story that is centered on the murders and ensuing case of a serial killer  The book quickly jumps into the story by describing the first murder and subsequent events  The search for the serial killer is the majority of the book s content  This book is very complex  yet is easy to follow and read while keeping you thinking and trying to guess what will happen next  This story is very suspenseful  It grips the reader and glues them to the pages as they read for hours on end  The story is a classic and for a good reason  I would say that thrillers such as this one are the most popular genre of fiction due to their interesting plots and twists during the story  The characters all have different personalities in this story and it makes them easy to be identified  The plot is exciting and easily followed  yet complex at the same time  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde both have traits that make them relatable to other people  Overall  this book is very good and I enjoyed it profusely  It grabs the reader s attention and doesn t stop until the very end  The plot can keep the reader focused for hours at a time  The tone of the story is another attribute that makes the story very good  Murder mysteries are one of my favorite genres and made me enjoy the book that much more  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in classic literature or murder mysteries  You will be glued to the pages from the first to the last   Keep Guessing When reading a mystery  you think you solved all the mysteries or questions during the story  Well when reading Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  you should second guess yourself  This stories tone is very mysterious and serious  while the narrator is in third person  Most of the stories point of view follows Mr  Utterson  Mr  Utterson is lawyer who is well a respect individual in the town  He is always curious in the story  which helps him discover the relationship between Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Mr  Utterson one day realizes that he hasn t seen his close friend recently  So he decides to look for Dr  Jekyll  While in his search he sees a small man who he describes as very ugly and evil  which is Mr  Hyde  During the night  Mr  Utterson keeps having nightmares about Mr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   He is not easy to describe  There is something wrong with his appearance  something displeasing  something downright detestable   this is how Enfield describes Mr  Hyde when he sees him  He believes that Mr  Hyde is affecting Dr  Jekyll s attitude  After a week  Mr  Utterson finds Dr  Jekyll in his lab  and sees that he is not in good shape  He worries about him and asks about Mr  Hyde  and the doctor says to never mention his name again  This becomes the rising action  Throughout the whole story  Mr  Utterson with his good friend Dr  Lanyon tries to discover the truth about Jekyll and Hyde s relationship  The story keeps going with Mr  Utterson s journey  many awkward and strange events occur with Dr  Hyde and Dr  Jekyll  During a night  Mr  Utterson s friend saw Hyde stab someone repeatedly  But on the body there was a note from Utterson to the victim who died  Was Hyde trying to blackmail him  find out the mystery behind Hyde  After this occurred  Hyde hid or left the town  nobody really knows  After he fled  Dr  Jekyll started to get healthier and was himself  What is going on with these two characters  Can Mr  Hyde live two lives  when he keeps blackmailing people  Then by the end of the book  Mr  Jekyll starts to get weak  A major theme in the story is silence  While he weak physically  he tells his butler to not let guests or visitors come into his house  This concerns Utterson  and finally Utterson finds the mystery  Which you will have to read  to find out  This story becomes very slow in the first chapter but speeds up into a dark and mysterious story  A lot of deaths occur  and the story keeps getting more confuse until you hit the last chapter  So in order to find the real truth about this relationship  you need to read this unbelievable story  Just remember every person has a dark side in them  This will second guess yourself  you will think about Mr  Hyde  If you think he is one person or two people  You will get confused while reading because Robert Louis Stevenson created such a great mystery book  I approve this book to anyone who is twelve or older and I think this is such a fantastic book to read   I believe this is the first book about the  split personality  that has ever been written  I loved every page of the book and the narrative form  I must admit I felt a strange liking for Edward Hyde and I felt sad that he and Dr  Henry Jekyll died at the end of the story  However  this is more than a novel  it s a good way to think about the dichotomy between good and evil  A short yet powerful book  Perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of this tale is the continual biblical references made by Jekyll  Indeed  this book almost seems like an embodiment of Romans 7 15 20  For what I am doing  I do not understand  For what I will to do  that I do not practice  but what I hate  that I do  If  then  I do what I will not to do  I agree with the law that it is good  But now  it is no longer I who do it  but sin that dwells in me  For I know that in me  that is  in my flesh  nothing good dwells  for to will is present with me  but how to perform what is good I do not find  For the good that I will to do  I do not do  but the evil I will not to do  that I practice  20 Now if I do what I will not to do  it is no longer I who do it  but sin that dwells in me Hyde is a literal manifestation of this  and the metaphor reaches full import when Jekyll describes changing into Hyde involuntarily and against his will  There also seems to be an inordinate amount of similarities between this book and Oscar Wilde s  The Picture of Dorian Gray   written a few years afterwards  Both deal with the same theme of sin embodied  Estupenda novela Con respecto a las peliculas basadas en ella quisiera decir que la version donde actuan Jhon Malkovich y Julia Roberts es muy buena  sin embargo me gusto mas el papel de Dr  Jekyll de Spencer en la version de Flemming  El efecto especial de la transformacion en la cara sin duda para la epoca debio ser sorprendente  Me gusto mucho  La historia esta narrada en tercera persona  centrandose en lo que va descubriendo el senor Utterson  que es el abogado del Dr  Jekyll  El libro esta muy bien estructurado  primero te explica desde el senor Utterson  lo que va pasando  despues se van descubriendo las cosas  hasta que ya conocemos todo  La forma de escribir del autor es fantastica  sabe que escribir en cada momento  y que poner en cada parte  La verdad es que es un libro bastante corto  que se lee en nada  en apenas una tarde y a parte de que te absorbe mucho  y no paras de leer  Esto viene bien  porque si no te quieres poner a leer un libro gordo  este libro no te quita mucho tiempo  El libro esta ambientado en el siglo XIX  sin decir fechas concretas  Las descripciones no son muy abundantes la verdad  pero por las ilustraciones que vienen  te puedes hacer una idea sobre las cosas que se nombran en la obra  Por dentro no son todo letras y palabras  porque vienen algunas ilustraciones muy bien hechas  de estilo clasico  y viene una en cada capitulo  En muchas de las paginas  te vienen definiciones y algunas aclaraciones de palabras complicadas  o poco utilizadas  y eso viene bastante bien  porque no tienes que andar buscando en el diccionario el significado  que eso quieras o no  te quita algo de tiempo de leer  Al final del libro  cuando lo terminas  te viene un cuaderno documental  con abundantes datos sobre el autor y datos sobre la obra  donde  vienen muchas curiosidades interesantes  En conclusion  El extrano caso del Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde es un gran clasico que sin duda merece la pena leer  que encierra un misterios e intrigas  que te dejan impacientes por resolver  RESENA COMPLETA AQUI  http   laestanteriadeirene blogspot c    A classic for good reason  more of a short story than a novel  with pointed structure and shocking scenes that plant it squarely and endlessly in the middle of the classic horror genre  Beautiful turns of phrase and a clinical approach that makes this a dark  gloomy  misty read  even on the sunniest day  Masterful  and always rewarding to come back to  This book is one of my favorite books I ve ever read  I was so fascinated by the idea of having an alter ego  especially being split into good and evil  I would always picture Mr  Hyde as so sneaky and trying to do stray away from good  Dr  Jekyll attempted to merge the two together so that he could have both at once but it ended up not working  Although I m sure this sounds weird  I always feel like I have good and evil battling in my head so I thought it was so fascinating that he tried to control it with science  His lust for bad ultimately ended up getting the best of him  This is a book I definitely need to read again soon  I m not sure if I would incorporate this into my own classroom considering it s gothic literature and I consider that as being something intended for an older audience so that they can understand it better   It truly shows the hidden human nature   mbhwrhUnder the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself  ay  even beyond what I had thought possible to man  I became  in my own person  a creature eaten up and emptied by fever  languidly weak both in body and mind  and solely occupied by one thought  the horror of my other self  dktwr jykl     tqdy lqwy  n lnsn lys wHand w nm thnn shkhSn fy  nsn wHd w n  l  yqyn mn  n  lm khryn swf ywSlwn lbHth bl yktshfwn  nn fy wq  l mr  kthr mn

contains spoilers  at the bottom of this page  just incase anyone else isn t   and I was shocked to find that Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were the same person  What a great story of juxtaposition  Absolutely one of my favorites  Blown away       Right from the very beginning its the feeling of eerie and dread that trudges along with you making your senses more alive till you read the last page of this novella and overwhelmed by the numbness of your mind  you acknowledge this remarkable work and the joy you feel in that moment is out worldly  the duplicity of the man  The anguish and turmoil in which the man bestows its reserved and constrained self upon the world while leashing his more feral and socially unacceptable prospect deep within him  The duplicity is a more common affair in the society to the point of being ubiquitous  I found the novella relatable to even the most worldly beings of our society The novella is provides more details in mere 88 pages than one could hope for  intricate work  Buy it   store it    worship it     amen Una obra maestra de su epoca que nos involucra intimamente en la dualidad del ser humano y sus pensamientos mas oscuros Cumple lo que promete  un verdadero clasico de horror  misterios y ciencia ficcion envueltos en una fina capa que nos alienta a sacar nuestro lado detectivesco  Un deleite de principio a fin  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a classic story and I highly recommend it  The story is of Dr  Jekyll  a very respected and sophisticated gentlemen in society getting ill and leaving everything to a mysterious Mr  Hyde  Mr  Utterson is the person you follow through this book  He is a lawyer and a friend of Dr  Jekyll and is worried about him leaving everything to Mr  Hyde because of the rumors he has heard about this mysterious man  Hyde had gained the reputation of being a repulsive juggernaut who is very violent  there was also a incident where he killed a can with a cane  But throughout the story Dr  Jekyll continued to say it ll be fine and the Hyde is not a problem  Eventually by the end Dr  Jekyll changes his will so everything goes to Mr  Utterson because he becomes fearful of Mr  Hyde  It s not until the end of the book where you find out the Dr  Jekyll is Mr  Hyde and that it is two personalities matched with the physical traits to match them  Dr  Jekyll was a very intellectual man and created a potion which would transform him in Mr  Hyde but with time Mr  Hyde dominated Jekyll and no longer needed a potion to transform thus leading Jekyll to liv in fear of Hyde  Dr  Jekyll is then suffering for the rest of his life because of Hyde  so he resorts to writing a letter explaining everything  The ending to this book caught me off guard and I did not see it coming This book overall was very well written and I enjoyed that the author got to the point and did not have any useless dialogue or descriptions  I enjoyed this book because the message the story sends one which everybody should be able to relate to  Everybody has a good and bad side them and depending which side you embrace will ultimately decide the person you become  Though this book was written in the late nineteenth century it I still easy to comprehend and understand and is very good and creating mystery  suspense  and a story that readers enjoy  I would highly recommend this book and I would definitely read it again   First published in 1886 as a  shilling shocker   Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde takes the basic struggle between good and evil and adds to the mix bourgeois respectability  urban violence  and class conflict  The result is a tale that has taken on the force of myth in the popular imagination  This Broadview edition provides a fascinating selection of contextual material  including contemporary reviews of the novel  Stevenson s essay  A Chapter on Dreams   and excerpts from the 1887 stage version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  Also included are historical documents on criminality and degeneracy  the  Jack the Ripper  murders  and London in the 1880s  New to this second edition are an updated critical introduction and  in the appendices  writings on Victorian psychology by Thomas Carlyle  Richard Krafft Ebing  and Henry Maudsley  among others  Este libro posee unas analogias tan unicas que de verdad me sorprende  He quedado encantado con absolutamente todo y  aunque siento que el autor pudo explotar un poco mas la historia  quedo satisfecho  Debo admitir que en ocasiones no estuve de acuerdo con algunas de la teorias que en el libro se presentan  una de ellas es que se afirma que nuestro lado malo es un personaje totalmente ajeno a nosotros cuando en realidad  en mi opinion  es otro yo  Es ritmo es bastante rapido y me atreveria a decir que la lectura es bastante sencilla y es una lastima en serio que todo acabe tan rapido pero  como ya dije  quedo satisfecho  Un libro cargado de teorias y analogias sobre lo que somos en realidad  desmenuzandonos como personas y asi mismo mostrando nuestras peores perspectivas  Increible  I had given Stevenson s book four stars until I re read the story  I think I m finally old enough to understand Dr  Jekyll  When I was younger  I couldn t appreciate the vigor he regained as Mr  Hyde  Besides  the line  a soul boiling with causeless hatreds  surely deserves another star  How have I not read this before  This book was amazing  This is definitely Stevenson at his best  The mystery and thrill of this classic captured me and I never wanted to stop reading  If your not big on classics yet you want to read more of them this is the one for you  Insanin icindeki kotuyle basta mucadele edip sonrasinda kendini ona kaptirisinin ve hatta kotulugun gercek benlige donusumunun harika bi betimlemesi  Dili  eserin kendisine saygi duymama vesile oldu  Cunku asla basit bi kitap degil  Konuysa muhtesem  Tekrar tekrar okunmali  still fantastic  I loved the damn thing  especially the last part when the relation between Jekyll and Hyde is finally revealed  For me it was a breath taking read  How psychologically profound and analytically plausible  And how entertaining  Genius

los 2 lados de cada persona el bueno y amable y el oscuro y brutal q cada uno oculta pero que en este caso sale a la luz y donde para dominar a uno de ellos el otro debe morir  Genial  Um livro que deveria ser de leitura obrigatoria  A dualidade do espirito humano  a fuga libertaria da condicao social estabelecida e aceite pelos pares  a seducao pelo comportamento animal sem o peso de uma consciencia moral  I really loved this tiny mystery novel  It is less than 100 pages  yet the plot envelops you in the opening pages  Jekyll s narrative at the end brings this book to a satisfying and memorable finish  I would definitely read this again in the future   Nada mas que  wao   un libro que capta bajo un extrano experimento lo bien conocido por todos  la naturaleza del bien y del mal Dr  Jekyll honorable y respetable  de una sociabilidad exquisita de la que pocos gozaban en la epoca de Londres bajo la cual fue ambientada esta historia  por su parte Mr  Hyde  emana un aura tan horripilante que solo verlo a la cara te provocaba el mas espeluznante escalofrio    seguido de asco  aberracion  terror  y eso indescriptible que para ya los conocidos de el o  de mirada  entendian bien Un libro que se centra en aquello a lo que la naturaleza humana refiere   Somos buenos o malos al nacer  o  Nos hacemos buenos o malos segun vamos viviendo  Libro o relato corto pero significativo  Completamente recomendado  I reread this today in preparation for reading  Mary Reilly  by Valerie Martin  which is a  sort of  sequel retelling   was reminded again just what a brilliant piece of dark Gothic fiction the original is  There seems to be more there every time I read it  I have seen many movies based in this book but till now I didn t had the opportunity to read it  Is really something great  an interesting study about the nature of good and evil inside us  I liked the fact that the big difference from the movies is that Dr  Jekyll is not that innocent  Seems that in the start he welcomed evil in his life  he thought that it was something controllable but in the end the things got out of control with tragic results  This is telling us more on a second level  many people drift towards their evil passions of drugs  gambling or anything similar  they think they have the control but in the end the passion destroys them  So in the end we have a fantastic story but with a deeper meaning about human nature  Look  this book is a classic for a reason  We all know the story  Uptight Victorian era doctor invents a potion that would allow him to engage in whatever questionable pursuits he likes  becomes addicted to it until his Mr  Hyde persona consumes him  Even The Hulk is loosely based on this short novel  After finally reading this story for myself  I m impressed with how profound it is  The story  which is surprisingly short  actually reads as a mystery told through the eyes of Dr  Jekyll  s friend and lawyer  The final chapter  which is a confession by Dr  Jekyll is extremely interesting  The story can be read as a critique for many things from uptight Victorian era life to an allegory on drug use alcoholism  Nice quick read if you haven t read it before  which one am I  and when am I which  I loved Jekyll and Hyde the first time I read it  and it improves upon rereading and teaching  It is so tightly written and does so much to keep the reader on edge as the events unfold and full of uncertainty about how to react to them   Frightening the extent to which I related to this book    It is a great danger to think that we can isolate our  evil  deeds from who we are    though I often try  It made me appreciate  again  the beauty of the struggle within    In short  The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde now lies  immovably  in my Top 5 book list  The writing style can be best described to be poetic  but yet  no confusing  Sophisticated  but incredibly readable  If you are one to be put off by works of this period  then I highly suggest that you give it a try and see if it doesn t change your mind  R L Stevenson does an excellent job of characterising the internal struggle of Dr Jekyll throughout the story and his attention to detail is perfect  it is just right  in my opinion  There is no endless waffle like you may see in some earlier works  but everything he describes adds something   even if it is just a little   to either the story or the atmosphere  Amazing  quick read   Fiquei curioso para ler este livro depois que li A danca macabra de Stephen King  o mestre do terror King aponta este livro  junto com Dracula e Frankestein como os tres maiores expoentes do horror gotico da historia da literatura  Ja li Dracula e estou lendo Frankestein e concordo inteiramente com a opiniao de King  Este livrinho de pouco mais de 100 paginas e de tirar o folego  considere que ele foi escrito em um dia de 1885 pelo autor Robert Lous Stevenson o que por si so ja e impressionante  Agora  o enredo e simplesmente alucinante  A historia do Dr  Jekill e do senhor Hyde nos desperta varias emocoes  ansiedade  ternura  raiva  suspense  horror e tristeza  E sem divida um classico eterno da literatura universal  Oh dear  I am still freaked out  This was great  Fast paced  scary and full of suspese althoug I already knew what was going to happen    I ll need time to think about this more in depth  it is psycologically just SO well done   I don t generally go for the  mad scientist creates a monster  kind of fiction  I hated Frankenstein  However  this was absolutely fantastic  Short  interesting and really creepy  Definitely worth your time    and then some  This was a HUGE surprise how much I loved this book  It s one of those English teacher books that I have always felt that I  should  have read  I figured that I would enjoy it since it s a classic  but I seriously cannot wait to read this book again  The commentary that Stevenson has on the duality of man is absolutely brilliant and there are so many theological undertones in this book that gave me food for thought  As I m desperately trying to read my 50 book goal  I find myself reading things that are short or are in my wheelhouse  and that was part of why I chose this particular book on CD    it was short  But what a lovely surprise to find a favorite book in the midst of the frenzy of reading     Yazildigi donemi de asip gunumuzde dahi saglam bir gerilim kitabi Dr  Jekyll ile Bay Hyde  Tabii sadece gerilim kitabi olarak ele almak da yanlis olur  hakkinda bircok makale yazilmis karaktere karakterlere sahip   Stephen King said in his book  Danse Macabre  that the best horror stories don t use gore to frighten  they use the terror and horror of evil and the unknown  I m inclined to agree  partly because as King himself admits hyper gory stories tend to give the reader opportunities to be relish blood and guts and identify with evil characters instead of heroes  Robert Louis Stevenson does an excellent job of avoiding gore in  Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde   a story that gives you nightmares without a trace of blood shown  and has a lesson but doesn t feel preachy and force it down your throat  It s a story every beginning horror writer should read and study  one of the few horror stories that anyone can read safely  A common theme of 19th century writers is that of the soul  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a perfect example  What happens when the good doctor tries to cure himself of his inherent  natural evil   What a fantastic read  I can t believe I waited so long to jump in  The imagery and language in the story is wonderful  There is a passage about the fog that I read over and over just because it was so beautiful and well done  Our books of today truly lack the eloquence of this man s stories The struggle we all face on a daily basis is personified in this story  Are we going to keep our evil twin under wraps or do we give in to temptation and live as Mr  Hyde did thriving on doing evil deeds  My daughter had to read this for her 7th grade English class and it s been reading it out loud with her and talking about the deeper meaning  It s a great discussion book and one I recommend reading  Indossata la maschera del crimine perfetto  irriconoscibile e senza traccia  l uomo e libero di far quel che gli riesce meglio  esser cattivo  D altronde  lo e per natura   The convoluted construction this tale is impressive   and a great reason for reading this    even if we all know the plot in advance   Also a very short read  which is always nice in the classics section    Chete se na edin d kh  tova kato p rvo Vtoro  izkliuchitelno mrachna kniga  nasitena s tiagostno i ochakvatelno chuvstvo za predstoiashch uzhas  Kartinata na mrachniia London

Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  however  Robert Louis Stevenson s story is told from a third parties perspective  It made for a fascinating  and very quick  read  lsw l lbdy yhm ytGlb  ly lnsn Tb  lkhyr m Tb  lshrfkrh mbtkrh n nfSl bynhm wly ysh kl mnhm km ysh lkn styfnswn fDl n lshr Glb wzH lkhyr fy nfs lnsn wdhlk mn r yy nZrh mtshy mh God  this is such a good story  The only problem I have with this is that I already knew the twist  It s so famous that almost everyone knows the twist in it  and that really is a shame because the author hides it so well that  if you already know the ending  you began to doubt yourself  At least I did  I wouldn t say that it s a scary book  but it is very creepy and it has a very eerie vibe  It doesn t scare you  but it creates an overall scary environment that you quickly immerse yourself into while you read   Does that make sense   Anyways  this is a very good book  and it s very quick to read  Definitely recommend it if you re looking for horror with a side dish of morality   Hard to imagine that such concepts even existed in the century in which this book was written  But the way they have depicted a psychological issue in a scientific manner is amazing  Having just read this a second time  I find that the book remains one of my favorite Victorian novels and possible the best piece of  classic horror  long fiction I ve read  This was a four star novel  novella  until the last chapter  In Jekyll s explanatory letter   all of Stevenson s themes jump up off the page  This is why I love to read  I ve wanted to read the original Jekyll   Hyde story for quite some time now and I decided to sit down and start it yesterday  I expected to pick it up and give up due to its lack of musical numbers and love triangles  However  I couldn t believe how engrossed I became immediately  Especially  in a story where I already knew the end  It s a brilliantly paced thriller told through the introspective eyes of Utterson  lawyer and friend of Jekyll  I was amazed at how engaged I became in this novella written about 150 years ago  I highly recommend it to anyone who even has interest in Jekyll and Hyde or anyone who has a few hours to spend  It s well worth it   All human beings  as we meet them  are commingled out of good and evil  and Edward Hyde  alone  in the ranks of mankind  was pure evil    I love this story  and it was fun to re visit it this Halloween season  Doesn t it make you wonder what YOUR Mr  Hyde is like  Even just a little  It s kind of a book that scares you but not a book like Mrs Peregrine or Bad girls Don t Die  This book is just not like a classic  It s clear you understand everything really well There are not not much foreign words  I really liked every word and really like the whole book  I started reading with Robert Louis Stevenson when I was 5  and for that  Stevenson is very special to me  I want to read every book he s written  I think everybody will like this book even a comedy reader  And if you re interested and you want to know what it s like you gotta watch the tv show  I really liked the first episode  I hope you ll like it to     NOTE  This is a review for the story  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  by Robert Louis Stevenson only  This is not the edition I read    The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson Stars  5Rating  PGGenre  Classic mysteryThings you might want to know about before you read  violenceShelves This Book Made Books I Read for School  books that I read for literature class in schoolGood Lit Books  my favorite classicsDiscussion This book is a very well known story  When someone says  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  you immediately think  Oh  that s that story about the guy who makes a potion that separates his good half from his bad half   Even though I already knew pretty much what happened in this story  I was still curious to read it The first thing I want to point out is that this story is really short  Its basically a long short story  less than seventy pages in length  Despite its length it still tells its story well  The writing in this is a little old and difficult to understand in places  basically  a normal classic  but it still grabs you and makes you want to keep reading This is not my first experience with Robert Louis Stevenson  Several years ago I sang the version of the Skye Boat Song that used the lyrics of one of his poems  Sing me a Song of a Lad that is Gone   Every time I read something of his it always stirs up memories of that song I don t know what reading this story would have been like if I didn t know the basic plot line but I found knowing what was going on made for an interesting read  I could tell that in some places what Mr  Utterson thought Dr  Jekyll was saying was completely different then what Jekyll was actually saying  example  at one point Jekyll tells Utterson   The moment I choose  I can be rid of Mr  Hyde  I give you my hand upon that   Utterson assumes Jekyll means he can throw Hyde out whenever he wants  but Jekyll actually means he can stop taking the potion and literally be rid of Hyde  When I finished the story I started to think   Is Jekyll as guilty of Hyde s crimes are Hyde is   In the story  Jekyll basically creates a potion that causes him to obtain the world s worst case of Split Personality Disorder  Technically  Jekyll and Hyde are two different people but also technically they re not  Jekyll believes that only Hyde is guilty of atrocities but is he right  After all  it was Jekyll s desire to indulge in the wicked things of life that caused the whole situation   view spoiler   chances are  if he hadn t started to take the potion regularly Hyde would never have taken over   hide spoiler   Its a very confusing moral question  one that makes me happy I m not the one that has to make those kind of decisions Anyway  I really liked this story  I think my favorite chapter was  Henry Jekyll s Full Statement of the Case  followed by  The Last Night  and  Doctor Lanyon s Narrative   I give it five stars out of five  JennyP S  The next classical book I will be reviewing is A Wrinkle in Time  I could not put this book down  It is such a great story  It wasn t what I was expecting when I first decided to read it  it was much better  I was never 100  clear on the whole story  It s a horror about a man who makes a potion to release his evil side  I found it fascinating  as every one of us has an evil side as well as a good side  no one needs a potion to release it  It s a scary  fantasy version of every human  I have always enjoyed stories that are more true to life  even if they are overdone a bit  I have met a lot of people who think this story is nothing like real life and they can t understand the connection   I decided to read this book because I enjoyed the television show Jekyll the stage musical but realized that I had never actually read the original  It was a really short and gratifying book  I would even venture to say a must read  We all know the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  The way the story is told here is very different from how one might expect given pop culture  but it is still such a delight to read  It s essentially a mystery  with a very spoiled ending   The drama  suspense  intense imagery  symbolism  and pace are so well done  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde really does live up to its hype  I have lost count on how many times I ve read this book  Its so good  I rarely reread anything but this book is the exception   A well written masterpiece  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  is a classic story of a good man releasing his inner  dark nature due to a concocted serum in his laboratory  A story which all seems to know  but one should really read for it lay one of the foundations into horror classics  This Victorian horror story by Robert Louis Stevenson is a fine example of foreboding and foreshadowing  gripping anxiety  and ambiguous feeling of what is to come  as I say the creeping shadows in which lingers near  Who  what  or dare say is that  This book I can imagine being a tale to read aloud to bedtime listeners   rwww    jbny ltfSyl Hbyt mstr hyd lSrH  dym bHb lshkhSyt lshryr     qryt lnskh  l rby  Tb     I picked this up just because I could download it for free from Kindle  and I was trying to find an  easy  early nineteenth century text to tempt the teenagers in the house  I found the writing to be easy to understand  much more so than Jane Eyre which is one of my favourites  and the story  although short  flowed well and intrigued me  The language is flowery and sometimes convoluted and yet it didn t get in the way of the developing storyline and many of the descriptions of early London were thoroughly delightful   the eerie qualities especially  I d never read the book before  and now can t imagine why I hadn t  I originally read this book like ten years ago  and in a Spanish translation  I loved it back then  and I was a bit afraid of picking it up again and  as often happens with books read during youth  find that it wasn t as good as I remembered it  While I didn t get the same feeling of fascination and amazement that I did when I encountered the story for the first time  I was able to notice and take delight in many more things than I did back then  I can better now appreciate Stevenson s talent and craftsmanship  and reading it in the original language now brought me a whole new level of enjoyment  Still a powerful metaphor for the most desperate struggle that takes place within the hearts of each of us   Beautifully Written    when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality  I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair  or continue  with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening  to pace up and down this room  my last earthly refuge  and give ear to every sound of menace                                    Once   he said   Once I heard it weeping    Weeping  how that   said the lawyer  conscious of a sudden chill of horror   Weeping like a woman or a lost soul   said the butler   I came away with that upon my heart  that I could have wept too   A great novel  This is what I think of gothic horror  One of the best uses of setting expressed in novels due to it being so closely linked to the themes  The themes i e  de evolution of man  the city as a faced on human image  Image as the most important attribute also are so entwined with the times that this is really the novel that epitomises Victorian London  It s structure is wonderfully confusing which really pulls the reader forward through the mystery  The impact of the characters have resounded through the evolution of the novel ever since  And lets not forget one of the greatest endings of all time  A true classic   Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a very interesting and mysterious novel The story takes place in the 18th century in the heart of London  The reader is first introduced by a well respected man named Mr  Gabriel John Utterson  This man likes to take casual strolls every night with his kingsman  Mr  Enfield  However one sunday night  they encouter a strange man  This human described as   the devil himself   had knocked over a young innocent girl on the sidewalk without caring  Bystanders and family members of the little girl quickly ran out to confront the man  They later discover that the man s name was Mr  Edward Hyde  The crowed later asked him for money  Es genial  me ha encantado  Hay que ver los cambios que hace el cine para su conveniencia       Ojala ser colega de Henry Jekyll y poder decirle   pasame de esa mierda  tronco    I haven t read this in decades and had forgotten how short it is  It s easy to lose the specifics of the book with so many movies overwriting the story The majority of the book is written in 3rd person by the friend  and lawyer  of Dr  Jeckyll  Something I didn t remember was how much care his friends and even the staff within his home  took to preserve Dr  Jeckyll s reputation in the backdrop of Victorian England  Even how willing his friend was to overlook unpleasantness as a normal course of behavior   I incline to Cain s heresy   he used to say quaintly   I let my brother go to the devil in his own way              No sir  I had a delicacy   was the reply   I feel very strongly about putting questions  it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment  You start a question  and it s like starting a stone  You sit quietly on the top of a hill  and away the stone goes  starting others  and presently some bland old bird  the last you would have thought of  is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name  No  sir  I make it a rule of mine  the more it looks like Queer Street  the less I ask     view spoiler  It is at the last of the book that readers are shown the letters of confession from Dr  Jeckyll himself  detailing his quest for understanding the duality of man and his decline into his abhorrent side  If each  I told myself  could but be housed in separate identities  life would be relieved of all that was unbearable  the unjust delivered from the aspirations might hos his way  and remorse of his more upright twin  and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path  doing the good things in which he found his pleasure  and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this is extraneous evil           Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes  while their own person and reputation sat under shelter  I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures  I was the first that could thus plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability  and in a moment  like a schoolboy  strip off these lendings and spring headlong in the sea of liberty  But for me  in my impenetrable mantle  the safety was complete  I had also forgotten that it wasn t just out of fear for his own safety that Hyde allowed Jeckyll to take control again  even when Hyde was able to assert himself into existence  Hyde was distressed at being disliked  at being unable to enjoy the belonging that came with being the acceptable Dr  Jeckyll  There is so much to this very short book  and while much is portrayed of Hyde s crimes in the movies   the story of Hyde and Jeckyll negotiating as separate  but dependent  beings in Victorian England is what interested me most   hide spoiler   Bukan karena endingnya atau plot twist yang di tulis oleh robert yang membuat saya memberikan 5 bintang untuk sastrawan skotlandia ini tapi man     kata per katanya     oh gosh     Keren bangettt dan     pokoknya kalimat tiap babnya cara dia menggambarkan dua pribadi yang begitu berbeda sangat mengundang orang untuk membaca dan membacanya lagi  Mungkin untuk tahun 1880 an cerita ini membawa sesuatu yang fresh  tidak di sangka sangka orang  namun di jaman sekarang yah    salahkan saya yang terlalu banyak baca buku sehingga udah bisa menebak misteri siapa sebenarnya Mr Hyde  ikinci kez  ve sonra ucuncu kez  okumak buyuk bir keyifti  buyuk bir roman  cok buyuk  Oh how I wish that I could have read this art without knowing its content  Starting to read this story of course I knew the content but I wasn t aware of its beauty  Its beauty in language  in story development  in moral  and in philosophy  I can scarcely imagine how fantastic this story must have seemed when it was first released  How incredible shocking the reader must have been after the revalation of the true character of Mr Hyde  nye  Dr Jekyll It is an extraordinary work about the war between good and evil in its purest form the struggle within one man  5 stars without hesitation    This is awesome  Loved the writing  the story  the themes    Everything  An extremely well written book that shows us the capability for evil and good within all of us  Hyde is a much misunderstood character who is more than just the embodiment of evil  He is more an archetype of crazed apathy than he is of evil  Jekyll on the other hand could be argued to be the true evil character  as he creates and desires the freedom that Hyde exhibits  One is desire the other reason but each exhibits characteristics of the other  If nothing else at least this book teaches us that we all have the capacity for both good and evil  but there is no real absolute of either in human life  Hyde is one of the finest novels I ve had the pleasure to read in quite some time  A beautifully written  riveting tale of horror  a descent into madness  and the mystery of identity  is it a matter of multiple personalities or a matter of possession  Is Dr  Jekyll possessed by Mr  Hyde or is it the other way around  Is Jekyll the monster and Hyde the puppet manipulated to express Jekyll s descent into evil  I ve slowed down my usual reading pace  both to savor the writing  and to prolong my enjoyment of this novel  I couldn t recommend it more highly  ttjwz  bqry  styfnswn fy hdhh lrwy lqSyr  mjrd ltshwyq ljrmy w lkhyl l lmy w lGwS fy   mq ltHlyl lnfsy    styfnswn hn yqT  HdWan khTyran

explanation of the dual nature of humanityI read this story for the first time the age of 12 as a piece of fiction  Now at age 62  I see it s truth  I also can appreciate the use of the precise language as my reading experiences as well as life experiences have improved my appreciation of classic literature  Let the reader beware lest he too glances into his own reflection and faces his own dark side  For me personally  it is my belief in my own Higher Power s infinite love that allows me to see the beautiful side of the reflection  So I finally come to know the story behind the oft referenced duo of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   or are they a duo  Nope  as it turns out  one  Mr  Hyde  is rather the evil projection of the other  Dr  Jekyll   Now I know  This was a quick but thoroughly enjoyable read  one that remains very realistic throughout for what appears to be  at first glance  a rather fantastical tale  The writing style is both to the point and satisfyingly descriptive  and though not much is explicitly described of the main characters  you feel as if you know them by the middle of the book  I don t think I can relate to the  good vs  evil within  notion that Dr  Jekyll embodies  but I still found it a pleasant morning s diversion  Un clasico se puede distinguir desde sus primeras paginas  por la riqueza de la forma de narrar  del vocabulario  como la trama se mezcla y se desenvuelve  Este libro  a pesar de saber el desenlace  por ser una historia bastante famosa  al leerlo te mantiene con los nervios de punta  hace muy muy interesante la narracion y uno se muere por saber COMO sigue lo que ya se sabe que sigue  como se desenvuelven los hechos  Ademas el analisis de la lucha entre el bien y el mal que todo hombre lleva es exquisito  Deja  por lo tanto  bastante espacio para la reflexion  Muy recomendado  Brilliant quick read  Stevenson s best  Love the cover  Fue uno de los libros que me dieron a leer en la escuela hace unos cuantos anos y que no lo habia valorado como realmente merecia  esta segunda vez ha sido una lectura super placentera  rapida de leer  que me entretuvo a pesar de que ya sabia el misterio que giraba alrededor de Mr Hyde  me parecio interesante la historia y lo que el Dr Jekyll queria demostrar con su experimento  que todas las personas estamos conformadas por el bien y el mal Realmente El extrano caso del Dr Jekyll y Mr Hyde es una maravillosa obra que todas las personas tienen que leer una vez en la vida  For some reason  I always think of Robert Louis Stevenson s  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  as being much longer than it actually is  The book is only 96 pages long  easily read in a couple of hours   Yet  Stevenson s focus on events is such that those 96 pages are filled with richness  You can read it as a straight physical description of things  or you can read it as a metaphor for good and evil in men  and both are wonderfully described  Stevenson s use of language  descriptions  plotting  pacing and characterizations are all excellent  Thus  I rate the book at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5  I surprised myself at how much I enjoyed it  This is one of those books that stays with you well after you ve finished the last page and have closed the book  If ever there was a book written about addiction and what it does to a person  this is it  A person starts out with a curiosity and the addiction seems manageable until it grows and completely takes over the person  their lives  their relationships  until it utterly destroys  I doubt Robert Louis Stevenson had addiction in mind when he wrote this  but with addictions so prevalent today  wow  This story nails it  The first novel that I ever read in English    Read it when I was 10  It felt scarily amazing  So its 2015 and im probably the last person to have read this book  Culture and media around us has made sure that no one hides from the fact that Dr Jekyll is indeed Mr Hyde and going into this book I thought that knowing that fact might hinder me from enjoying this gothic suspense book as it were  But no  Even though i knew what the twist was the whole book had me at the edge of my seat  Stevenson s writing and the way he kept changing the point of view of the narrator was mesmerising   Must read for everyone  though i seriously doubt anyone is left  I absolutely loved and devoured this novella  The writing was great  the plot was epic  seriously though  imagine that the plot wasn t so famous and well known  if we didn t know that it was the same person  that would ve been an epic plot twist    and the ending was chilling to the bone  It kind of reminded of a Sherlock Holmes story  the writing style and sense of mystery were very similar  but much more exciting and gripping  Would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to read an amazing  short  easy to read classic   Never having read this before  I tried to approach this  rather short  book as someone who didn t know anything about it  This is difficult given the many retellings of the Jekyll and Hyde story  What struck me is that the book was written in a way that if you didn t know better  it could be seen as Hyde is  for most of the book  a completely separate person from Jekyll  It is only revealed at the end the two are the same person  As a form of perhaps criticizing Victorian era morality  Hyde s misdeeds are never really revealed aside from one big one and a couple smaller ones other than the fact they are shameful for any gentleman to engage in   the book really works  I m glad I read it   La curiosidad mato al gato A pesar de haber hecho un poco de trama  leido mitad en original y mitad traducido  recojo este libro como uno de los mejores Si condensara todo lo que he visto en los terminos mas breves  lo esencial de esta historia  una palabra lo condensa  curiosidad Dr Jekyll   Mr Hyde trata sobre el deseo de saber lo que no se sabe  el deseo de saber lo que no nos concierne  Y esta es una de las cualidades mas vigorosas del ser humano  lo que pondera la importancia del dinero y el conocimiento  lo que nos impacienta y nos ilusiona  indagar  saber mucho mas  lo que no siempre tiene un final feliz  02 12 2015 Der Konig ist tot  es lebe der Konig  So ahnlich fuhlt es sich an  Nach Beendigung von C  Setz  Die Stunde zwischen Frau und Gitarre  habe ich furchtbar gejammert wie es lesemassig weitergehen soll und jetzt passiert mir Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde  Diese langere Erzahlung habe ich mir wegen der Vorlesung Nabokovs gekauft und keine grossen Erwartungen in die Lekture gesetzt  Was fur ein Irrtum  Vom ersten Satz des Buches bis zum letzten Buchstaben war ich gefesselt  gebannt und sprachfasziniert  Das Buch ist grossartig geschrieben  eine wunderbare Parabel aufs Menschsein   sogar mit Auslassungen  damit der Leser seine eigenen dunklen Anteile einsetzen kann und das ohne erhobenen Zeigefinger  Vor allem der letzte erklarende Brief Dr  Jekylls  der dem Leser ganz am Schluss den Hergang der dramatischen Ereignisse erzahlt  hat es mir besonders angetan   den habe ich gleich dreimal gelesen  Grosse Erzahlung  grosser Autor   und ich habe bis dato von Stevenson noch nichts gelesen  Das muss ich dringend und schnell andern     If I am the chief of sinners  I am the chief of sufferers also    An expertly crafted and mercifully to the point classic  While subtlety may not be Stevenson s approach in this gothic exploration of the human psyche  neither is it called for by such a tale  The author s purpose is to unabashedly illustrate the duality of man  To this end  we are introduced to an upstanding and generally well liked Victorian chemist named Dr  Jekyll  whose attempt to separate his natures results in a devastatingly infamous case of split personality   Jekyll had more than a father s interest  Hyde had more than a son s indifference  Of course it s no spoiler to know ahead of time  thanks to its cultural impact  that Jekyll and Hyde inhabit the same man  But what struck me as most fascinating and resonant was the realization that Jekyll didn t despise the amoral part of himself  While he abhorred its behavior  he was ultimately more protective of it than anything  wishing to let it run free  The complacency and indulgence of an otherwise  good  man then becomes his tragic downfall    I sat in the sun on a bench  the animal within me licking the chops of memory  the spiritual side a little drowsed  promising subsequent penitence  but not yet moved to begin    The prose is rich  lurid  and visceral  Stevenson manages to take the time for masterful storytelling and appealing flow without wasting words   I could scarcely believe this was the same man who wrote Treasure Island  Though it was written in the late 1800 s  the premise is timeless and universal to the human experience  Every culture on earth has grappled with the concepts of good and evil  Countless proverbs from nearly every faith address this issue  and advise its handling  It is what modern psychology would refer to as the  Id  and those adhering to Christianity would term the  sin nature   It is every person s adversary  every self aware creature s battle  We are our own worst enemy If I had one complaint  it would be that the story seemed to end too abruptly  I would have happily steeped in more of this introspective eeriness  The behavior of Dr  Henry Jekyll  a renowned and highly respected London doctor  starts to preoccupy his closest friends and house staff members  as the good doctor seems to increasingly fall under the influence of a most intriguing and violent character  Mr  Edward Hyde  who has become a frequent guest at Dr  Jekyll s home and laboratory while the former is absent  Fearing for the life and reputation of his doctor friend  the lawyer Utterson  takes it upon himself to investigate the strange case  particularly when reports of Mr  Hyde s gruesome social conduct around London start to spread  Baffled by Dr  Jekyll s recent self imposed isolation from the world  Utterson seeks advice from a common friend  Dr  Lanyon  who has long since been opposing Jekyll on matters of ethics in science But when Edward Hyde is accused of brutally murdering a Member of Parliament  the case takes a dangerous turn  forcing Utterson to directly confront Jekyll at the latter s residence  And there is where he ends up finding out what has been really going on with his friend         I don t think I m going to spoil the novella s plot for anyone by revealing that Jekyll and Hyde are in fact the same person  the latter resulting from a bizarre scientific experiment developed over the years by Dr  Jekyll  The book has been around for so long that pretty much everyone knows this What people might not realize though  especially if they have not read the novella  is that the  Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  is much more than a story about a wacky science experiment gone totally wrong  and the aftermath of its consequences And the message hidden within the pages of the book has helped this 19th century novella to be as relevant today  as it was when it was first published in 1886 In essence  the novella talks about mankind s struggle to balance their good and evil sides  and how no one is really intrinsically one way or the other  It also gives great emphasis to the fact that social conventions and expected social behaviors can lead to incredible tension in dealing and processing this inner duality of personalities You see  Hyde is not meant to be considered as the complete opposite of Jekyll s personality  Edward Hyde is instead the result of Jekyll s personality stripped of all imposed social conventions and rules By conducting his experiment  the doctor was in fact trying to devise a way to give a body to the darker aspects which his personality intrinsically possessed  but which could not be openly expressed by Dr  Jekyll s in his social circuits  due to his established reputation as a good and sensible member of society As Jekyll confesses in the novella  had he approached his scientific findings with a less selfish and more positive design  Edward Hyde might have exhibited completely different personality traits  They would  however  still represent only a fraction of the doctor s complex inner self The concept of human nature s duality and of humanity s inner conflict regarding good and evil was pretty much in vogue in Victorian times  so it is not surprising that the novella was an immediate success with the public upon its publication The fact that people are still talking about it and analyzing it nearly 130 years later  goes to show how powerful the core of the  Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  is  and will continue to be  to all of us    A little gem of a book that deals with a major theme that affects all mankind  in an easy and comprehensive manner    Just don t expect to be wowed by the writing style  By Victorian standards  the writing is pretty bland  but nevertheless still effective  The star of the novella is definitely its message and the thoughts and debates it provokes  Esse mes no Clube do Livro debatemos um classico da literatura do horror  o estranho caso do Dr  Jekyll e Mr  Hyde  E a primeira coisa que me dei conta quando comecei a ler e que    eu nao o tinha lido antes  A questao e que a historia de Dr  Jekyll e Mr  Hyde esta tao inserida no imaginario popular que eu sabia a historia e por saber a historia  tinha a impressao de ja ter lido o livro As pecas que nossa mente nos prega   A base de O Medico e o Monstro representa um dos meus maiores medos  a ideia de perder a propria personalidade  anular se completamente  Claro que fora da ficcao esse terror nao se deve a um misterioso elixir  mas a doencas como Alzheimer  que tem como sintomas desde a perda da memoria ate a mudanca de personalidade tornada mais violenta  e nao avancemos para o momento em que a mente se torna um quarto vazio e um corpo desocupado  Nao sei se e possivel que Stevenson tenha se inspirado em algum caso de demencia para criar seus personagens  ou se a dualidade de Jekyll e Hyde e uma referencia direta a dualidade moral humana  mas o fato e que a historia e suficientemente aberta para fazermos uma serie de interpretacoes Como  por exemplo  a possibilidade de ser Jekyll homossexual   que e uma interpretacao inteiramente possivel e bastante crivel para uma obra do periodo vitoriano Quando escrevi o especial sobre Sherlock Holmes para o Coruja  acabei por ler um bocado sobre homossexualidade no periodo vitoriano  incluindo subtexto e codigos linguisticos  Minha conclusao e que nunca houve um periodo tao tristemente hipocrita quanto esse  A sociedade vitoriana era obecada por questoes de moralidade e sexo   serio  eles tinham de ter toalhas que cobrissem as mesas ate o chao porque nao era considerado de bom tom que as pernas da mesa ficassem a vista ou isso faria as pessoas pensarem em sexo  A suspeita de que alguma indiscricao de Jekyll o teria deixado a merce de Mr  Hyde e a primeira hipotese de Mr  Utterson para justificar a existencia do testamento  Considerando que Stevenson publicou seu livro em 1886   e um ano antes  o Parlamento aprovou a Labouchere Amendment  que transformava em crime toda e qualquer atividade imoral ocorrida entre homens  ainda que intercurso nao pudesse ser provado  e uma possibilidade  Essa lei  alias  foi a base da condenacao de Oscar Wilde  Curiosamente  o crime ocorria apenas se o casal em questao fosse do sexo masculino Agora  sobre a questao da aparencia   de principio me fez lembrar Lombroso  mas eu nao acho que seja de fato a aparencia de Hyde que cause repulsa nas pessoas  mesmo porque as descricoes que sao feitas dele sao muito vagas  A fisiognomia vai muito pela descricao da face   tamanho do cranio e das orelhas sao duas coisas de que me lembro das aulas de direito penal  Minha impressao e que a maldade de Hyde e algo como um    polo magnetico  que acaba por repelir as outras pessoas  Nao se trata simplesmente de circunstancias fisicas  mas de algo mais espiritual O que e hilariante e que a narrativa de Stevenson chegou a ser usada como exemplo em sermoes religiosos do que acontece quando voce  se desvia do bom caminho   Li um ou dois relatos sobre o assunto  que fazem questao de sublinhar o detalhe de que Stevenson teria rompido com o pai ainda na juventude por conta da religiao e nao se filiava a algum igreja  Minha interpretacao e exatamente o contrario da feita pelos pastores da epoca  O Medico e o Monstro demonstra o risco de reprimir completamente seus proprios instintos  Jekyll observa que precisou reprimir sua natureza  alegre  da juventude   e uma critica a moralidade vitoriana  I just read Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde for the 50th time  It was the last book my dad and I read together  so it has sentimental meaning for me  but I also just love it  it s short  a novella really  or a very long short story  and it gets to the heart of so much that I ponder in my own life  Stevenson grapples with the idea of people having both good and evil within themselves  Dr  Jekyll fascinates me because he is a man of the upper class  and concedes  in the end  that he does a lot that he s ashamed of  What can that possibly be  I wonder this every time I read it  Is it drugs  Prostitutes  Or is it some Victorian thing where even thinking about sex drove him to distraction While the writing is old fashioned  the concept of our own duality  of being at odds with ourselves is just so modern  My students have always been able to relate to how hard it is to be in battle with one s self  and they are in the thick of it  They want to do well in school  but many of them feel that they MUST have fun  slack off  go to parties  etc  They are in full on battle with themselves  and so am I for that matter  I know to get up early  I know to get exercise and to eat right  yet I find myself with that spoon and a carton of Haagen Dazs  I love this for its darkness  and for its old fashioned tone with a modern concern for evil  Classic  Are good and evil like oil and water  inhabiting the body together yet remaining separate like those liquids in a glass  This is an old question  Robert Louis Stevenson s treatment in this classic novel is an inventive  memorable and superbly written dramatization  The parable fits decisions big and small as we try to do the right thing  Of his efforts to honor his good side Dr  Jekyll says   I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep it   The novel makes a good case for the two aspects of humanity to be considered separate but suggests that good can not be defined or possibly even exist without bad  the triumph of good is only to be found in it s victory over evil  The flip side is the scary part  that eil does not savor anything of the good and can exist on its own  This novel has spurred millions of interesting conversations and several cheesy movies  that I love to watch   What comes out in the book is that Dr  Jekyll had an unusual drive to test his theories but that fundamentally he was not so different from the rest of us   After all  I was like my neighbors  concludes Dr  Jekyll  chilling  One of the literary experiences that I really wish I could have would be reading The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde de novo  with no idea what was coming  Sadly  that is something that is no longer available to pretty much any of the readers of the book  But every time I read it  I think this was my third time  in this case the audio recording  it is completely fresh  vibrant  suspenseful  mysterious and puzzling  It is also really well written  although also incomplete in that it tries to engage in black and white moralizing but never really explains why the good Jekyll would do everything he does for the evil Hyde  although the vice versa is more explained  Maybe we need to hear more of Hyde s side of the story  7 13 14 7 16 14            I m not sure if reading Jekyll and Hyde twice within one month is healthy  but it was interesting re reading it after reading Hyde and Mary Reilly  it felt like getting a different perspective but also an even deeper appreciation for how well written and constructed it is  Everything to be said about this short story has been said  I will therefore only write up on the passages and areas that have touched me personally  Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde  the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy  no  it was in my own person that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience  and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of temptation   I think that we all have our own Mr  Hyde and that not only is it beneficent  but essential  to let him out  This all brings back the notion exploited by Freud according to which we all have an animalistic side the Id   a controlling side  the super ego  and our self as a whole  the ego   What Jekyll is trying to do is let both sides of us go free without any limits  But  on their own  both sides aren t fulfilling enough  Hyde is lacking the moderation and Jekyll is lacking the fun in life  Jekyll Hyde is the representation of what all of us wish of having  a perfect life to show to all  but to let loose as much as we want  Sad for Jekyll that it didn t work out as he d hoped   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde remains a chilling reflection of the hypocrisy and contradiction within the victorian era  As captivating as this mystery was  the novel exploits the duality of the industrial revolution and epitomizes Charles Dickens  famous quote  It was the best of times  it was the worst of times     Stevenson explores the gentlemen class of London  those who were living  the best of times   Back then  a gentleman was expected to be well mannered but completely and utterly emotionless  Opinions were not received well and a gentleman had to merely nod his head at everything to avoid conflict in attempt to please everybody  Dr  Jekyll is the quintessential gentleman   he s rich  single  and emotionless  He tries to suppress his innate evil nature by creating another identity   separating his good and evil side  However  the abhorring Mr  Hyde begins to take control  seeping into Dr  Jekyll until he is no more  Furthermore  this upper class portion of London dwelled within its own hypocrisy and is really a novel highlighting the abuse of drug use as well  The chemicals Dr  Jekyll works with mirror society s tampering with science  i e  science vs  religion   Dr  Jekyll works with these chemicals in his laboratory  i e  meth labs   The gentlemen class may have seemed like the perfect class within social hierarchy  but many of them smoked opium and Stevenson criticizes this  This novel is in essence  an anti victorian commentary on the corruption of hypocrisy and the extremities within 19th century English society  Sintesi in tre righe  Un avvocato  con un cliente molto strano  Cosa gli stara succedendo riassunto della trama  In questo libro non si ha una data ben precisa sul momento in cui accade questa vicenda  Il libro narra che a Londra  Un giovane avvocato Utterson  una sera camminando per un vicolo vide un uomo basso e piu lontano una bambina che correva  Quando questi due s incrociarono l uomo basso butto per terra la bambina e gli diede un calcio  Utterson non aspetto molto prima d intervenire  allora si mise a rincorrere quell uomo  Quando lo prese chiamo un medico e la famiglia della bambina  Il medico  il padre e Utterson accompagnarono quest uomo alla sua casa  Per mettersi in pace l uomo gli diede un assegno firmato a nome del signor Henry Jekill  Dopo questo accaduto  Utterson  decise di capire chi era quel signore  Una sera lo pedino fino a casa sua e davanti al portone lo fermo  Gli chiese soltanto il nome e lui rispose   mister Hyde  Una cosa che aveva notato era di non riuscire a identificarlo  perche diceva che aveva un qualcosa di deforme che non lo aiutava a ricordare il volto  L unica cosa che poteva affermare era il fatto che fosse un uomo veramente basso  Mano a mano scopri che era un amico di un suo cliente il Dottor Jekill Jekill lo supplico svariate volte di essere gentile con lui e aiutarlo con ogni problema  Ogni giorno il dottor jekill peggiorava  non voleva mai sentire nessuno e si chiudeva a chiave dentro il suo studio  I camerieri non potendo entrare dovevano lasciare la colazione fuori la porta e poi lui usciva furtivamente per prendere tutto  Una sera Poole  il maggiordomo del dottor Jekill  ando da Utterson  spiegando che la voce del dottor Jekill non era quella di sempre e che una volta vide un uomo abbastanza basso con una maschera che frugava nei cassetti  Ma la cosa piu strana e quando capi che c era Poole nella stanza urlo e scappo via  Impauriti andarono a casa del dottor Jekill  presero delle asce e spaccarono la porta  ma quando entrarono si era suicidato l uomo era mister Hyde  Trovarono dei biglietti lasciati da parte del dottor Jekill  Dicevano che dovevano prendere un cassetto  precisamente quello con scritta la lettera E  Una sera venne una persona con degli abiti buffi che disse  sei pronto a vedere una cosa mai vista prima d ora  allora prese una siringa che era nel cassetto  prese una goccia di un liquido che si trovava dentro la siringa e lo mise dentro un bicchiere  Subito dopo prese un pezzo di carta della busta lo mischio con il liquido e se lo bevve  Di colpo inizio a urlare e si trasformo in varie forme di persone fino a quando divenne Mr Hyde  Utterson non ci poteva credere Commento  Una cosa che ho notato e che in ogni frase i personaggi gridano Dio invano  Di questo libro mi sono piaciuti molto i paragoni di Utterson quando guardava  di notte  le stelle e la luna  Quello che si potrebbe pensare e che il dottor Jekill bevve una pozione e si trasformo in chi sa che cosa Secondo me e tutta psicologia cioe  Jekill era pazzo  Come tutti i pazzi aveva una doppia personalita  per fare un esempio Smigol  Lui di giorno si comportava da gentil uomo e di sera faceva  come hobby  assassinare oppure molestare  Avendo queste due personalita lui volle che non fossero tutte due nello stesso corpo  Cosi creo una droga che di sera incarnava la sua parte malvagia in una persona di nome Hyde  mentre la sua parte buona andava nel corpo del Dottor Jekill  Lui poteva decidere quando essere uno o quando essere l altro  Purtroppo la parte malvagia  cioe Mr Hyde  prese il sopravvento  Cosi si dovette rifugiare dentro lo studio fino a quando Utterson arrivo e Mr Hyde  o meglio detto il dottor Jekill  non potendone piu  si suicido Commento tecnico  All inizio e come se stessi leggendo il diario di Utterson  Siccome alla fine e quasi incomprensibile la conclusione della storia l autore ha fatto anche un piccolo diario dal punto di vista del dottor Jekill   One of the original stories of schizophrenia  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde shows the duality of human nature    the good and evil within all of us  John Fowles claimed in The French Lieutenant s Woman that Stevenson s    Jekyl and Hyde was the ultimate expression of the Victorian ambiguity about human sexuality  good and evil  and science   faith     every Victorian had two minds    This  is the one piece of equipment we must always take with us on our travels back to the nineteenth century  It is a schizophrenia seen at its clearest    in Tennyson  Clough  Arnold  Hardy   Mill and Gladstone   Kingsley and Darwin   this  I think  makes the best guidebook to the age very possibly Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  The most horrifying things in our lives are the evils we realize in our own minds and actions     Jekyll and Hyde addresses this  as does Yann Martel s great novel  Life of Pi   Don t bother with the hokey cinematic adaptations  read Stevenson s novel  Stevensons ability to encapsulate satire and morality into this novella is magnificently orchestrated  The story challenges Victorian preconceptions of respectability and wholeness  placing Dr  Jekyl as an average and respected man against his nefarious and anomalous other self Mr Hyde  It highlights that Duality can exist in all of us  especially respected and reputed individuals such as scientists  This made me startlingly aware of how internal struggles can overtake the boundary of personality  perhaps even allowing the darker side of your person take control  The idea of the story is that Dr  Jekyl has invented a serum which will transform him into another self  This is not the large  monster like thing seen in movies such as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  more rather an undescribably horrid and lurid man  small and frightening   This scientific achievement is not seen as a good thing  and indeed can be seen as rather challenging tow victorian preconceptions as to the wisdom in the pursuit of science  which was the Victorians way of understanding and making sense of the world around them  It pays as a shrewd warning as to the dangers of treading where one should not The storys protagonist  himself divided  is set up against the backgrop of a dual society  that of the peasants and prostitudes  that of the rich and the respected  When transformed the Hyde side of the Doctors personality can run off to the confides of Old Town and hide his head among the poor and the diseased  It tells us an awful lot about the nature of Victorian life and the suspicious evidently held in their society  for example the fact that stevenson does not tell us what Hyde gets up to when in his ravenous and free state is very telling as to the customary acceptance of the 19th century  Though short the book is an excellent read and has blown away much that i have read before  It sets the ideas of science started in the 19th century into an intersting comparison with our own contemporary ideals  For example are interests in cloning and genetic modification  Stevenson seems to be warning against such things in his Gothic way  and thought this is only one way of looking at his intetntions in writing the story  i think it deserves some thought  Perhaps we should reclarify our aims in the pursuit of science today   it could all go so wrong  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde remains one of the world s great classic tales of terror  Against the fogbound  menacing backdrop of Robert Louis Stevenson s London  the  strange case  of the respectable middle aged physician Henry Jekyll  and his puzzling link with the menacing young Edward Hyde  unfolds through two key informants  both long time friends of Jekyll  The first  the lawyer Utterson  prides himself on his laissez faire attitude toward human frailty  and yet cannot bear it that Jekyll has inexplicably willed all his possessions to Hyde  The second  Dr  Lanyon  has cut ties with Jekyll on account of Jekyll s  fanciful  theories  The lawyer and the physician bring their respective areas of expertise to their investigation of the  strange case   until separately they arrive at the hideous truth of Jekyll s secret  In spite of all the movies  the parodies  the TV ads  the media s facile  Jekyll Hyde  references to every famous person who is revealed to be living a double life  the original story retains every bit of its power to surprise and terrify  and to make us question the mysteries of human identity  This book remains one of my favorites for the sheer reason of Dr  Jekyll a man so consumed with using science to rid himself of immorality  that he in turn becomes a victim to his own vanity  The epistolary verse of the writing and the fact that we see the mystery unfold through the eyes of Mr  Utterson is provocative and suspenseful  Also the idea of sin corrupting ones body is nothing new  The Scarlet Letter  but the description without a description is alluring and echoed in Spielberg s classic maritime adventure  Besides anytime a character is described as   a man with the signature of Satan on his face   or one who is  alone in the ranks of mankind  as pure evil   there is something to entice  I first read this edition as part of my Brit Lit class in the Spring of 2009  It wasn t my first time with the story and has certainly not been my last  In all  the story included is a total of 63 pages with footnotes  For any teacher looking to use this as a reading  pick this edition because Stevenson s language is tough  Lexille 1110   but the information about slang and uncommon words is a great add on for any reader  Additionally the  150pages of materials include book responses from the time  publication changes  and modern commentaries  The most insightful selections of these resources would have to be RL Stevenson s comments on the Penny Press  his letters to friends about writing  his short story Markheim and the literary Doubles commentaries  Katherine Linehan includes her work as the last critical essay but Brantlinger s comments on mass literacy are more inline with my views of the story as a religious allegory and Gothic tale of personal remorse   With every day  and from both sides of my intelligence  the moral and the intellectual  I thus drew steadily nearer to the truth  by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck  that man is not truly one  but truly two     Robert Louis Stevenson  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hydedrawing inspiration from a recurring nightmare  Robert Louis Stevenson wrote The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde  it was published in 1886  readers at that time referred to it as a  shilling shocker  but it was immensely popular  became a bestseller and ultimately a classic  the coexistence of good and evil within man is the focus of this strange tale about Dr  Henry Jekyll s unorthodox experiment that went horribly wrong and its dire consequences  it deals with man s inquisitive nature which prompts him to seek answers  trespass forbidden territories and undertake risks at a cost  alas  tampering with nature and its gifts bears tragic results  in the end  Dr  Jekyll had to decide on a course of action that would either damn him or liberate him from Edward Hyde forever Stevenson s writing is remarkable  i liked the way he structured his story using the third person as its main point of view and complementing it with a first person perspective through letters written by some of the significant characters  i also liked the pacing and how Stevenson built up the suspense and the tension   revealing facts a little at a time   until the mystery surrounding Dr  Jekyll Mr  Hyde is fully unraveled in the last remaining pages i have seen a few adaptations on the big screen and on television but nothing prepared me for the sheer pleasure of reading this incredible narrative  even if i had some idea about what was going on  i was still mesmerized by the whole affair  this is definitely one classic horror story that should not be missed  I expected Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde to be an incredibly creepy and frightening story  Maybe because I already knew the general idea of the story  it was not as scary for me  However  I saw the book as more of a commentary on human nature  When I read Dr  Jekyll s speech about Mr  Hyde  I could not read it as a scientific accident  but an allegory to morality  Whenever Dr  Jekyll transformed to Mr  Hyde and let him practice bad behavior  that part of him became stronger  Eventually it gets to the point that Mr  Hyde is so much more alive and strong that Dr  Jekyll cannot transform into himself again  Mr  Hyde represents the human desires to sin  The idea that seems to be behind this is that the more someone sins  the more you will want to sin  and the worse the sins will be  And after you feed this part of yourself with practicing these things  the moral part of yourself becomes overidden  and the sinful part becomes rampant  However  can someone really be in complete and utter control over themselves all the time  Dr  Jekyll should have recognized his  dark side  and accepted that he was not perfect  Then maybe with that in mind  he would not have had the need to let out his dark desires within the body and mind of a dangerous monster   One of the nice things my Audible subscription is doing is giving me the opportunity to catch up on a lot of the classics I never actually read  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is one such book  I d been intending to read since finding out I was going to Edinburgh for my birthday last summer  it being written by one of Edinburgh s literary sons  Robert Louis Stevenson  but somehow I never got around to it  Arthur Conan Doyle is on that list  as is Ian Ranking and I ve hit them  so I think I m doing okay  Anyway  this ain t a bad story  Not nearly as gruesome as many of the adaptations tend to make it but then  in it s own way  a bit more brutal  especially for the time  The plot  by this point  is so well known as to make recounting it a bit redundant  but I did enjoy Stevenson s monologues on the nature of evil and man s dual nature  I can only assume this wasn t as commonplace a notion as it is today  partly  I m sure  due to this book itself   It s not a long work  Stevenson gets to his point rather quickly  so the tendency modern authors and adapters have to invent other characters  hello Mary Reilly  is understandable if not always necessary    Could you imagine having two completely different personalities  Well in the book Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde it is the main conflict  I thought that the book was pretty good  The only thing that I would say is that the middle was very slow in some parts  The beginning the middle and the end were exiting but in between was kind of slow   The setting is in England in the late 1800s  The author really does a good job to make you feel like you are in England  He dose this by including cobble stone streets  Also the people in the book wear different clothing  The main story line is about a person who has two personalities  One is a regular doctor but the other one is a mean creature like person   There are only three main characters in the book  The first one is Dr  Jekyll  He is a regular Dr  the next is Mr  Hyde  He is a beast  The last person is Dr  Anderson he helped him   I think it is a good book  It was very interesting  It had pictures so it was cool   In Conclusion I think it is a good book   Just imagine having a dream that terrified you so much that you have to write it down to be able to accept it  That alone made it a must read and I can t tell you how many times I ve read it since  In many cases this is one story  similar to Frankenstein  where the movies have altered our perception as to what the character was like that the story sometimes pales in comparison Maybe that s what always drew me to this one  Unlike Frankenstein  I can relate to the character of Jekyll and Hyde in that we all have a dark side we d love to indulge in without care or worry for the consequences  The fact Hyde is a dwarf and the embodiment of evil compared to the caring and handsome Dr  Jekyll is a perfect illustration to how being one way can alter the perception of those around us When one was near Hyde  they felt miserable and couldn t wait to be away from him  In time  Jekyll couldn t control the transformation as he d go to sleep as himself and wake as Mr  Hyde  In the end the only way for him to escape was to take his own life or face the gallows for his crimes Was the fact he was the less desirable of the two sides of the good Doctor a figment of Stevenson s dream or done on purpose  I have no idea  I only know it s one of the greatest morality tales I ve ever read  I have been long familiar with this tale from literary allusions and film adaptations  but I just made it a point to read this novella  WOW  Yes  it has a great exploration of the dual nature of human beings  as conveyed in the film adaptations and pop culture reference  It also has a very rich narrative structure because of the  detective work  that Dr  Jekyll s friends and employees perform for the bulk of the text  Two school chums of Jekyll s    a lawyer and a doctor    struggle to make meaning of Jekyll s strange behavior and his affiliation with the shady Mr  Hyde  We also get the point of view of the head servant  the butler  who has the opportunity to observe things from inside the house  So with the lens of the legal world  the scientific world  and the domestic sphere  we join these three in an examination of the human condition  wrestling with its dual nature  Yes  it s a strong allegory that has the potential of oversimplifying the issues  but the novella actually contained more insight and fewer clear answers to this age old question  Still provacative and relevant today  The only troubling aspect was a startling absence of female characters    flat or round  It s a book that has men sitting around in studies  questioning each other about the issues  I guess Stevenson felt women were too delicate to entertain such topics or too angelic to war with such internal conflicts  Not this woman  I have watched friends and loved ones wrestle with their own problems  and I have stood in horror in the presence of my own flaws  A good detective novel  and a great catalyst for contemplating human nature  The following review is from my discussion essay for class  It deals with the similarities between Frankenstein and The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Reading Frankenstein prepared me to look for the horror  not in the monstrous creation itself  but in the man who felt the need to create such a being  Dr  Frankenstein made much ado over how his creation was a monster and needed to be destroyed  but the fatal flaw of hubris laid with him in his need for glory  It was his desire to bend the laws of nature and create life out of inanimate dead parts and his inability to properly deal with the consequences that led to his downfall  Dr  Jekyll is like Dr  Frankenstein  in that that first fatal flaw of hubris lies within his own heart   Dr  Jekyll is obsessed with social norms  how he is perceived  how he fits into society  and what he must do to keep his reputation in tact are pressing and almost over consuming concerns of his  In his confessions at the end of the novella  he states   I concealed my pleasures  and when I reached years of reflection  and began to look around me  and take stock of my progress and position in the world  I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life  Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of  but from the high views that I had set before me I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame   Stevenson 42  He never explicitly states what these  pleasures  are  but he does describe himself as having  a certain impatient gaiety of disposition   Stevenson 42   but this disposition of his  although not harmful  was for him  hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high  and wear a more commonly grave countenance before the public   Stevenson 42   In the Victorian Era  certain behaviors that displayed discipline and seriousness were considered admirable and respectable  Dr  Jekyll s natural personality seems to not have fit in to those Victorian acceptable categories  and he is sensitive enough to Victorian social sensibilities to desire to fit in enough to repress himself  So  instead of having the courage to be himself  Dr  Jekyll decides instead to find a way to have his cake and eat it too   This desire to fit into society is a trait that Dr  Frankenstein never worried about  In fact  society seemed the last of his worries  except for where it would further his needs  i e  the university and the professors  or where it would serve as a backdrop to exalt his coming glory  after all  wasn t that the point of him creating his creature in the first place    yet never once did he worry about how his erratic and unsociable behavior was viewed by his fellow university students  Dr  Jekyll  however  uses this worry as the main fuel for creating his double  Mr  Hyde  A similarity that both Dr  Jekyll and Dr  Frankenstein share would be cowardice  Not only are they both toying with elements they don t quite understand and perverting the laws of nature through murky science  they both refuse to accept the consequences of their actions  Dr  Frankenstein abandons a fully formed  gigantic monster with greater than human strength to wander alone and unchecked in the world  When the creature finally commits murder and blames it on Justine  Dr  Frankenstein does not save her  He does not speak out and tell the truth and admits it is his own cowardice of being called mad that stops him  In this  Dr  Frankenstein cares about his reputation  though not of his social standing like Dr  Jekyll  Dr  Frankenstein cares very much about the reputation of his intelligence  cares more for it than that of Justine s life  his pathetic laments aside   Dr  Jekyll does care about his social standing and it is to keep this social standing that he created Mr  Hyde  Mr  Hyde allows him to experience the thrill of being free of social norms and fully express his selfishness  However  like Dr  Frankenstein  he has no way to check Mr  Hyde s behavior  When Mr  Hyde murders Sir Carew  Dr  Jekyll is appalled and horrified  However  he decides not to come clean and explain about the created dualistic aspect of his nature  but instead  to deal with this demon on his own  He is too ashamed  too cowardly to tell the truth of the matter  not even to this good friend Mr  Utterson  By staying quiet he saves his reputation and exhibits that selfishness that he first attributed to Mr  Hyde alone  Once again  it is shown that a human life is not worth the shame that a confession will cause  And although Dr  Jekyll tries to make amends through good deeds and control Mr  Hyde  events spiral out of his control  As Dr  Frankenstein pursues his creation on his own  trying to destroy it  so does Dr  Jekyll  in a sense  follow the same path  He tries his best to figure out a way to destroy his dual nature but it is too late  In the end  as with Dr  Frankenstein  Dr  Jekyll must perish  Whereas Dr  Frankenstein tells his tale verbally to Captain Walton  Dr  Jekyll writes his confession down for Mr  Utterson  both express the truth  although slanted with justifications for their cowardly behaviors  to a third party  And like Dr  Frankenstein and his creature  Dr  Jekyll  the creator  dies first before his creation  Mr  Hyde  It is a death in the sense that the personality that made Dr  Jekyll is destroyed and consumed by the form of Mr  Hyde  Mr  Hyde  no longer having the support of his creator to survive on  commits suicide  This parallels Dr  Frankenstein s creature committing suicide after his creator died  but unlike that creature  Mr  Hyde does it not out of love and self loathing  but a selfish despair and fear of the gallows   I quite enjoyed reading this novella by Robert Louis Stevenson  Although it s short  there are many different ways to analyze it  I found it fascinating to find the common elements in the characterization and plot line that we saw in Frankenstein  I think this study into the darker motivations of men is a reason why both this stories are such classics   Sebuah berkat melimpah begitu aku mendapatkan karya klasik ini  Sewaktu mencarinya di salah satu toko buku di daerah kota tempat tinggalku  aku mendapat kenihilan dan menemukan bahwa stok buku ini habis  Awalnya aku benar benar kecewa  sebab buku itu sangat kuperlukan untuk melengkapi tugasku  melaporkan dalam bentuk review tertulis pada mata kuliah tertentu  Dengan kepercayaan akan tingginya harapan menemukan buku ini  aku melaju ke toko buku lainnya  Dan akhirnya buku bersampul cokelat cetakan GPU   Gramedia Pustaka Utama   ini menjadi satu dari sekian koleksi novel di rak bukuku Tidak bisa kupungkiri  kecintaanku pada karya karya klasik terutama karena alasan alasan paling mendasar dari pecinta karya sastra  Dan Robert Louis Stevenson telah menorehkan sejarah baru dalam dunia sastra dengan karyanya yang original dan mendebarkan ini  Dilandasi kekaguman akan aliran Gothic  Mystery  suspense  Horror  dan Thriller  aku memilih buku ini  berharap sang penulis mampu membawaku ke dunianya  yang ternyata berhasil membuatku terpana  Inilah kisah singkat sang dokter berkepribadian ganda Dr  Jeckyl  dengan nama lengkap Dr  Henry Jeckyl  adalah seorang sosialis ternama di bidang kesehatan  namun memiliki sifat yang berkebalikan dengan para dokter pada umumnya  sering galau  mudah depresi  pendiam  dan ekspresif  Ia dilahirkan dari keluarga besar yang kaya raya sehingga semasa kecil hingga ia dewasa  hidupnya benar benar terjamin  Ia sangat aktif dan ceria  sampai pada suatu usia dimana ia merenungkan masa masa hidupnya  ia menjadi seperti yang sekarang  Kekhawatiran dan perasaan tak nyaman memenuhi benaknya  membuat jiwanya terdesak  hingga ia merasa bahwa dirinya tak benar  bahwa ada satu kuasa dalam dirinya yang bergejolak ingin muncul ke permukaan  Hal ini terus menerornya  menajamkan indera inderanya  dan melemahkan batinnya  Ia berspekulasi  mendapati kesimpulan bahwa ia punya pribadi kedua  yang ingin ikut ambil bagian dalam kehidupannya  sisi jahat dirinya yang tak mau berkutat dalam alam bawah sadar  Kemudian suatu hari  ia bereksperimen menciptakan sebuah ramuan aneh dan mencobanya pada dirinya sendiri tengah malam itu  Hasilnya sangat mengejutkan  ia mendapati diri bukan dirinya lagi  melainkan sosok lain dirinya  pribadi kedua yang jahat  yang pada akhirnya akan mengambil alih dirinya sepenuhnya  Pribadi keji bernama Edward Hyde Karena merasa bukan sebagai Henry Jeckyl lagi  ia sebagai Edward Hyde melakukan perbuatan kejam untuk melampiaskan hasrat yang terbukur lama dalam dirinya yang muncul bersamaan dengan munculnya sosok Hyde  membuatnya brutal secara tak manusiawi  Kemudian kejadian kedua paling mendebarkan saat ia membunuh seseorang dalam tubuh Edward Hyde hingga membuat semua orang gempar akan sosok Hyde  Ia merasa sangat bersemangat  merasa jiwa mudanya kembali  buas dan brutal  Ia meminum ramuan penawar agar dirinya kembali menjadi sosok Henry Jeckyl seperti dulu  Namun hal itu tak berlangsung lama  ia menyadari bahwa sosok hitamnya menginginkan lebih  bahwa Hyde ingin sepenuhnya menjadi manusia dan bukan pribadi kedua  Mulailah pergolakan batin yang membuatnya gila dan membuat resah para pelayannya  termasuk rekannya Mr  Utterson  yang pada akhirnya menyingkap tabir misteri Dr  Jeckyl dan Mr  Hyde Cerita dimulai dari sudut pandang Mr  Utterson dimana ia curiga akanMr  Hyde yang mengganggu pikirannya  Naluri keingintahuannya mendorongnya sampai pada kenyataan pahit akan insiden pemukulan seorang gadis di jalanan serta kematian pemuka masyarakat terkenal  Sir Danvers Carew  dimana ia menemukan pribadi Hyde dalam aksi bejat yang menimpa dua korban tersebut  Hingga akhirnya  ia bersama pelayan Dr  Jeckyl  Poole  mengetahui rahasia terpendam mengenai sifat tertutup rekannya serta kemunculan misterius sang pelaku begitu menerima surat pengakuan terakhir Dr  Jeckyl mengenai apa saja yang terjadi  Penuturan langsung Henry Jeckyl menjadi akhir pamungkas yang menggetarkan sekaligus mencengangkan para penikmat kisah misteri  Secara pribadi  aku suka kisah ini  Bagaimana cara penulis menuturkan cerita agar pembaca ikut hanyut dalam setiap reka adegan menjadi nilai tambah tersendiri  Narasi yang diberikan cukup bertele tele  terlalu banyak penjelasan  namun itulah kuncinya  Penulis seolah olah menyeret pembaca dalam situasi yang diciptakannya agar pembaca benar benar terkesan tentang dunia kisah tersebut  kemudian di bagian akhir  ia mengakhirinya dengan kejutan yang membuat pembaca merasakan sensasi berbeda  Bagiku  kisah ini sulit dipercaya  Gabungan misteri dengan sedikit bumbu Sci fi   science fiction   diramu menjadi sebuah karangan fiksi sederhana yang hebat  Aku mengira sang tokoh hanya berkepribadian ganda  tapi ternyata memiliki  tubuh ganda  juga   dalam hal ini bertransformasi  Ide yang unik Alur kisahnya membingungkan  Aku kesulitan saat membaca beberapa bab karena kisahnya terlalu cepat  Namun untungnya  di beberapa bagian  narasinya diperbanyak sehingga aku bisa mengaitkan kejadian sebelumnya sambil memahami kejadian berikutnya tanpa merasa khawatir kehilangan alurnya  Intinya  kesulitan di awal dan paham di akhir karakter yang ditonjolkan di sini adalah sang tokoh utama  Dr  Jeckyl sendiri bersama alter ego nya  Mr  Hyde  Tapi penjelasan yang lebih gamblang ada pada saat penuturannya tentang ide membelah diri menjadi dua sosok berbeda  Di situlah letak kepribadiannya yang sesungguhnya  karakter lain adalah Mr  Utterson  sang pengacara dan sahabat sang tokoh utama  yang akhirnya memecahkan kisah misteri temannya itu  Selebihnya  tokoh tokoh lain hanyalah penunjang agar kisah ini kian misterius dan menggemparkan Akhirnya  aku memberikan apresiasi penuh kepada tuan Robert Louis Stevenson atas karya apiknya  dualitas manusia  yang mampu menghibur serta membekas di pikiran para pecinta karya sastra klasik Karya yang begitu menginspirasi  This book is beyond amazing  Stevenson builds up the suspense marvelously in the first half of the novel  what with the  haunted  house and some episodes being set at night time  which enhances the dark atmosphere  the murder  mysterious behavior of Dr  Jekyll etc  With each new scene we learn a little more about what s really happening  but it was Dr  Jekyll s letter confession that impressed me most  I was amazed how aptly Stevenson expressed in the literary form Freud like ideas decades before Freud  So  here we see on Jekyll s example the Freudian 3 part scheme of human psyche   Id is represented by Mr  Hyde  what a suitable name for the part of human nature that remains hidden and sometimes repressed   Super Ego is the part of Jekyll that strives to suppress his  lower  impulses and to be a paragon of morality and intellect  and rational Ego in Jekyll s case cannot find a compromise between two other parts of his nature  Therefore he makes a disastrous decision to separate the Id part from his Ego and Super Ego and thus creates Mr  Hyde  who  at first small and ugly  begins to grow in stature as the number of his morally dubious acts increases   Jekyll is a sad case of a man who can t live with his sexual impulses and appetites  which gives me the hunch that he might have been a closeted homosexual   but neither repressing them or letting them run absolutely loose brings him happiness in the end  It s also very interesting how Stevenson shows the link between sexual frustration and the destructive instinct  Hyde  suppressed for weeks by Jekyll  kills a man in a fit of frenzy  and between the subconscious Id and dreams  Jekyll would later always wake up as Hyde  not himself    Thus one can make a conclusion that it is extremely important to accept your sexuality as something natural and live in harmony with yourself  Suppression only leads to exacerbation of what one is trying to repress   Robert Louis Stevenson had begun writing at the age of eight and published his first book when he was sixteen  With this  when Robert Stevenson published Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  as expected  it became a best seller  I understood why Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was a best seller for it was an excellent story that kept you on your toes with its suspense and underlying theme of evil  The short story of a mysterious man Mr Hyde  a well known yet secretive scientist  and the relationship between them set up a dramatic and intriguing read  Throughout the book  starting from the first chapter  Stevenson used suspense and foreshadowing  The reason I personally enjoyed the book was because  at the end  the final chapter reveals great information in a creative way  The first example of foreshadowing  of Jekyll and Hyde s relationship  surfaced in the beginning of chapter two    We have common friends   said Mr  Utterson   Common friends   echoed Mr  Hyde  a little hoarsely   Who are they    Jekyll  for instance   said the lawyer   He never told you   cried Mr  Hyde  with a flush of anger   I did not think you would have lied    Stevenson 10   This quote made the reader question why Mr  Hyde knew Mr  Utterson was lying  why he became so angered  and presented the connection between Hyde and Jekyll  An example of suspense in the text was seen when Mr  Utterson and Poole communicated to see who would break down the door of Dr  Jekyll  The readers began to suffer wanting to see who lied behind the door and end the mystery of what Dr  Jekyll had been scheming in  The icing on top of the cake is how Stevenson ended the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  The final chapter in the short story is a letter from Jekyll outlining the whole situation between him and Mr  Hyde  The final chapter summed up the story by providing vital information and retelling the story from his point of view  A great aspect of the final chapter was when Jekyll retouches a scenario from the first chapter   Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door  and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll   Stevenson 60   Tying together loose ends from the beginning was a terrific way to end Robert Stevenson s short story  All questions are answered  all mysteries revealed  and all assumptions confirmed  A large reason why I admired this short story was specifically how it was structured with suspense and an exceptional ending  I enjoyed this book very much  and I would recommend it  Although it is a short story  I got very much out of it  It is a thought provoking book about the balance between good and evil  and what giving in to temptations  and your  evil side   can cause  In the book  the strength and influence of evil is shown as a charitable  kind  and popular man is destroyed by the influence of a growing evil  The necessity of a balance between good and evil is shown  and the utter destruction caused by submission to evil is illustrated as well  The fact that the book shows Mr  Utterson s perspective creates suspicion and mystery  as most questions about the struggle between Jekyll and Hyde remain unanswered until the end  For the majority of the book  the connection between Jekyll and Hyde is strange and unexplained  Although there is no real climax to the book  it keeps the reader hooked by withholding an account on the events from Dr  Jekyll s perspective until the end of the story  This story certainly deserves its reputation as a classic  being a mysterious story of the strange case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  written with rich but easily understandable language  and ultimately teaching an important lesson  After seeing 92747822  movie adaptions  I sure was surprised after finally reading the original But let me start at the beginning  I thought this would be boring as there are sooo many movie versions of this book out there   and having seen many of them I wasn t expecting to be wow ed reading the book Having said this  the first chapter starts of pretty slow  but this changes by the second one   in 2013 most people know the rough outline  but R L Stevenson writing from Jekyll s friend Utterson s POV who is absolutely clueless to what is going on  is still intriguing  Even knowing the outcome I could feel the suspense   this guy knows how to write Up to this point it was a solid 3 star rating for me  the Langley chapter where another of Jekyll s friends has written down his experience  didn t do much for me  I think this chapter was written as a gradual transition for readers back in the 19th century who didn t know the outcome of the story What blew me away was the final chapter a full account of what happened from Jekyll s POV  Now  in 2013 nearly everyone knows that  The strange case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  is about some crazy professor drinking a poison and mutating into a big bad monster and    WOW WROOOONG  What all those movie adaptions have had us all believe is WRONG  this is not a book about some nutty professor mutating into a monster  it is a psychological insight into how people see themselves and the strength of denial Dr  Jekyll doesn t  transform  into Mr  Hyde as mainstream media wants us to believe  the two are the same person  just two sides of the same being  Jekyll as Mr  Hyde starts doing things that the respectable   good  Dr  Jekyll would never have done  never have dared to do and Dr  Jekyll feels freedom and pleasure in doing all these things without having to worry about being chastised or reproached for them As tings get out of hand Dr  Jekyll distances himself from his alter ego Mr  Hyde   convincing himself that it is NOT him who has done horrible things  thus maintaining the image as  good  and  respectable  of himself  Instead of saying  I did  he now starts saying  He did  when referring to his deeds as Mr Jekyll The transition of Dr  Jekyll s feelings are subtle but clear in that last chapter  Stevenson did an impressive job This book made me think a lot  I many readers are impressed by how Stevenson captured the situation of mentally ill people in the 19th century  What  The strange case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  made me mostly question was how honest we really are can be with ourselves and what every one of us would do if we thought we could get away with it Last chapter alone would make me rate this as 5 stars   it s amazing and there are so many metaphors and pictures  at the same time so subtle and so clear   Opening a mystery book is like opening a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle  There are many different pieces that make up a whole big picture  Only when the puzzle is completed does the builder see the bigger picture  Just like these puzzles  only at the end of the story does the mystery book come together and all the missing links are connected back to the story  With this in mind  I was drawn to read a mystery story for the Independent Reading Assignment  Also  seeing how the puzzle pieces fits together creates a brain teaser for the reader and grasps the total attention of the reader  In every book lives main characters that tells the story through their eyes  In the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  the perspective is spoken through the eyes of Dr  Jekyll s long time close friend  Mr  Utterson  Mr  Utterson s words unravel the mysteries the story beholds by giving the reader all the different puzzle pieces but not putting them together to keep their attention  Mr  Utterson s outside perspective allows the reader to see the pieces but not put them together until the end of the story Before reading Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I knew the background to the story  but didn t know the story was told in a different perspective  When I first picked up the book  I was utterly confused due to the fact that the story wasn t being told by either Dr  Jekyll or Mr  Hyde  Instead the story was following the life of Mr  Utterson   The lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance  that was never lighted by a smile  cold  scanty and embarrassed in discourse  backward in sentiment  lean  long  dusty  dreary  and yet somehow lovable   Although he was a close friend of Dr  Jekyll  I couldn t quite understand the reason as to why the story was told in the perspective of Mr  Utterson  instead of the characters described in the title of the book  Only at the end of the story was I able to realize the importance of the character role of Mr  Utterson  Having the perspective of the story in his eyes allowed the author to hold the attention of the readers until the end of the story  This was because Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were two different people but anonymously connected to one another  Only if the reader reaches the end of the story does the reader know that these two men  whose personalities were on opposite sides of the spectrum  were in fact one person  Mr  Utterson was the last person to figure out this secret and since he was the last to know  the readers were able to connect everything together From a scale from 1 10  the perspective of the story would receive a high score of a 9  Having the story being told by an outside perspective allows the reader to get insight of the story but not figure out the mystery behind it until the end of the book  If the story were to be told by Dr  Jekyll or Mr  Hyde  the mystery aspect of the story would be gone and the attention of the reader would be diverted  Therefore the authors plan all along was to keep the readers interested in solving the mystery by putting the perspective and point of view of the story in the hands of Mr  Utterson  Without his role in the book  the story would have fallen to pieces The five star rating is for the Norton Critical Edition  I ve own a few different copies of this book over the years  I think I rated the story itself as four stars  I enjoy it  I enjoy the themes  the characters  and the things we can take from a book that was instrumental in the redefinition of the Gothic novel  However  I ve never been a fan of the  letter confession  format  You can find it in several books around this time  and for me  it cheapens the drama  You aren t reading about it  You are reading about someone else who is reading about what someone else experienced  We don t really do that in modern fiction  and quite frankly I am glad that particular mechanism is dead  Still  it was a different time  and letters and written correspondence were a bigger deal It s a very short story  It takes up around 60 pages of this edition  However  the really good stuff in the Norton Critical Edition is everything that comes with it  Letters written by Stevenson about the book  early pieces of manuscript that were later revised  and criticism by some pretty heavy hitters  including Vladamir Nabakov  I ve only skimmed through the supplemental material  which fills the book out to 210 pages  but it appears to be quality If all you want to do is read the book  you can find it for free  It s public domain  But if you want to really study the book  this is a great edition to have  I thought it very weird that throughout this book  people are terrified of Mr  Hyde  But  when they describe him and his activities  it s so vague  He s just  evil   And they don t really provide any examples of WHY he was so evil  I understand that he s the embodiment of the evil  selfish needs inside Jekyll  but if that s the only thing that makes him  evil  that doesn t seem very fair  The introduction to my version of the book mentioned that Stevenson had no issue with a man having sexual trysts with a woman  but that really seems like what he s implying Hyde was doing that was Jekyll s secret pleasures  It was just so vague it was hard for me to determine what the author was trying to say  Just about the hypocrisy of people during that time  How they put on a show for the public views  I feel like there was some message of the definition of evil in there that I must have missed  or was lacking  Otherwise  it was a fun story  I liked hearing the story from Utterson s view point and then ultimately understanding the story in steps until the confession from Jekyll  That made it more suspenseful in my opinion  Stevenson is a great story teller    The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  by Robert Louis Stevenson is intelligent  sensitive  and skillfully written  Unabridged Dover  1991  54 pp   My afterthought is I didn t experience Hyde as I did Dr  Jekyll  Jekyll is excellently portrayed  He learned in his experimenting that man  indeed  has an evil side that can get out of control causing human destruction Taken from  Henry Jekyll s Full Statement of the Case  Hence  although I had now two characters as well as two appearances  one was wholly evil  and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll  that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair  The movement was thus wholly toward the worse   The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order  The terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide  and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person  but he loathed the necessity  he loathed the despondency in which Jekyll was now fallen  and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded  I very much enjoyed the bookMinnie Estelle Millerhttp   www millerscribs com This was an intriguing book for many reasons  First of all  it is a literary classic  The story has been told and retold in books  movies  comics  plays  musicals  poems  songs  etc   It begs the question we as humans ask about man s nature  which Dr  Jekyll answered thus   That man is not truly one  but truly two  The original story by Stevenson does not have a romantic moment in the entire text  There is no love interest  Jekyll does not have one woman and Hyde another  It is also interesting to note that Hyde is not a large or beastly man  He is smaller than Jekyll  so much smaller that he can t wear Jekyll s clothing  and has to have his own wardrobe  The evil side of my nature  to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy  was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed  Again  in the course of my life  which had been  after all  nine tenths a life of effort  virtue and control  it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted  And hence  as I think  it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller  slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll  Jekyll  like all men  was not perfect  but he tried to be  There was a part of him that was evil  or gave in to evil tendencies  and desires  He lived a generally good and upright life  until he decided that he had to find a way to give into these desires  But he didn t want to feel the shame  the guilt that goes with living a duplicitous life  So he had to dissociate the two  If each  I told myself  could but be housed in separate identities  life would be relieved of all that was unbearable  the unjust might go his way  delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin  and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path  doing the good things in which he found his pleasure  and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil Jekyll thought he had found the perfect out  He could do all his evil deeds and give in to all his desires  and feel no regret because it was Edward Hyde that had done them  and Henry Jekyll could continue as an upstanding member of society Too late did he learn that you can t give yourself over to evil without being changed  and without the evil growing  When he describes his feelings when he transformed and committed murder he states  But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations  and in my case  to be tempted  however slightly  was to fall Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged  With a transport of glee  I mauled the unresisting body  tasting delight from every blow  The first time Dr  Jekyll was transformed there was immense pain and anguish  but now  The pangs of transformation grew daily less marked And I think that is the moral of the story   at least it s what I got out of it  Yes  there is evil in everyone  But it is a small and a weak thing  It is younger and weaker than our good upstanding selves  The guilt we feel for giving in is a good thing  when the guilt is gone is when we REALLY have to worry  The more often we give in  the less it hurts  and the less control we have to be our good selves  Eventually  if we give in enough  we will lose all control  and all that was good in us will be overthrown  because we let it happen   little by little   day by day  I held the opinion that this was just another book written a significant while back which I wouldn t get on with  so I was greatly surprised at how good it was  The style of writing really appealed and drew me in straight from the first page and continued to be well written to the very last sentence  Despite the time it was written  I found myself comparing it to modern day circumstances such as addiction and I feel it is still a very relevant story  Like everyone I am very aware of the common term  Jekyll and Hyde  in reference to personality   which in itself shows the influence of this book   however  I wish I could have read it before even knowing this hint as to what the story involved  because it would have probably seemed even more stunning and enjoyable  This is the first time I have read something by Stephenson  but I drew from the book that he must have been an intelligent and insightful man  He thought of and pulled off successfully an interesting concept I think this should be a lesson to all  just how easy it is to be sucked in by the bad sides of life and before one realises it  one is caught in the vice when it becomes in control   Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde was published in 1886  and takes place in London  The main character  Mr  Utterson  is a lawyer who finds himself caught up in the mysteries of Dr  Jekyll  and the monster of a man  Mr  Hyde  Overall  I found this book to be incredibly interesting  and fantastically written  It s one of my favorite of the  older  novels I ve read  It managed to keep me turning pages  even though I normally don t like older novels  The use of imagery is fantastic  depicting the streets of London as a vast labyrinth filled with mysteries  monsters  and crime  which creates a great feeling of dread whilst reading  Some of the key points of the novel are enthralling as well  developing a contrast between the good sides of people  and the bad sides of people A good connection for this book is Dracula  The depictions of a horrifying monster are both discussed within the two novels  Also  the struggle within one of the characters moral code shares a resemblance with the struggle within Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird  Both characters struggle with the notion of good and evil within themselves  although Scout s conflict is significantly less radical than the character in this novel   From the very first page  I was hooked  Despite knowing the general premise and characters  I was hanging on every word   partly because his language is mesmerizing  almost poetic  and partly due to the strange way the story unfolds  I love how vague some of his descriptions are  letting the reader fill in the gaps however which way  It all works out brilliantly There s so much going on here as far as duality  and the definite amounts of good and evil in all of man  It s a book that makes you ponder at every turn  and leaves a pondering puddle in your brain at the end  What s he saying here  What s he leaving out  What s he  thinking   It s a great thing  I got the version with Nabokov s lecture reprinted as an introduction  because I m a huge fan of the guy  but I have to say I found it quite dry  Maybe others will get something out of it  but for me  I preferred the afterword by Dan Chaon  Here s a nice little quote  For modern readers  the Jekyll Hyde legend seems to speak particularly to our nervousness about the solidity of the self  Who is the  real  me  What is the persona that people know as  me   We are more self conscious about the ordinary public masks that we naturally put on to negotiate our way through social interactions and the ways in which those masks separate us from the people in our lives we are supposed to be close to  Yep  The title of this book varies from one edition to another  Sometimes it is published with a  The  at the beginning  Sometimes  Strange Case of  is omitted  Sometimes it is even given simply as Jekyll   Hyde  It s not as though the printer needs to save ink  it s a very short book  a novella really  There are even more versions of Stevenson s story than variants of its title  Next to A Christmas Carol  it has probably seen more adaptations for stage and film than any other work of English literature  including parodies and re imaginings that  ha  ha  transform the original story almost out of recognition  I have seen and read several of these re tellings  which share little in common except the essential concept of a man who  by taking a potion  transforms himself into another person  in most versions  an identity compounded of all the dark  evil parts of himself  And of course  the trouble that bad Mr   or Ms   Hyde gets into  always complicates things for Dr  Jekyll as well What I never realized until now  on finally reading the story as Stevenson wrote it  is how different his novella is from any and all of the dramatizations  abridgements  contextualizations  and  for dummies  versions on the market  The popular idea of what this story is about is also quite out of order  It isn t about split personalities or  dissociative identity disorder   It is about a man s struggle with the conflicting powers of good and evil within his one personality  and the tragedy that takes place when he experiments with a drug to separate the two  It is a story about the course of a life destroying addiction  together with a man s losing struggle against moral corruption  guilt  and the terror of justice  It is a true tale of horror  It resembles nightmares I have had and  assuming that I m not alone in this  explores something that troubles many people with a well developed moral conscience and an understanding of the evil nature within each of us  And it does this in a story that combines shock  suspense  mystery  and a really chilling final confession  as only a master writer can  Here is a sample of the story you thought you knew  in case you ve never read it  This was the shocking thing  that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices  that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned  that what was dead  and had no shape  should usurp the offices of life When I started reading this story  I thought the quote I was going to drop into my review was going to be    If he be Mr Hyde   he had thought   I shall be Mr Seek    At first it doesn t seem to take the Jekyll Hyde mythology as seriously as it ought to  judging from more recent redactions  Pretending that we don t know what the story hasn t openly revealed to us  though we do know  we do   we don t find out what s up with Jekyll and Hyde until almost the end of the story  We come at the truth slowly  through the investigations of a lawyer friend of Henry Jekyll s  named Gabriel Utterson  Lawyer Utterson knows something fishy is going on between the good doctor and his bad protege  He worries that  by making his will in favor of the violent and amoral Edward Hyde  Jekyll puts himself harms way  But Jekyll tells him not to worry  Then Hyde is seen committing a notorious murder  and worrying is back on the menu  But the mystery only grows more perplexing as Hyde disappears and as Jekyll  after a season of unusually sociable behavior  suddenly goes into strict seclusion  A mutual friend of Jekyll and Utterson s  a physician named Lanyon  suddenly suffers a physical and mental breakdown and dies within weeks  leaving Utterson a sealed letter to be read only on the death or disappearance of Jekyll  The crisis finally comes when Jekyll s servants appeal to the lawyer for help  suspecting that Hyde has done away with Jekyll  They break down the door of the chemist s laboratory and make the kind of ghastly discovery that can only be understood after reading the last testament of both Lanyon and Jekyll  And the chill deepens the farther you read  all the way down to the bone This isn t about a man innocently  accidentally  and  at first  uncontrollably being split into two persons  one good and the other evil  and then having trouble keeping his double life from being detected  It is  rather  about a man who struggles with the spiritual duality within himself  He thinks he can create two persons out of one  and separate the bad from the good  but when he tries it  he discovers that he was wrong  The Jekyll part of him remains as he was before  with both the good and bad held in constant tension  the Hyde side  however  is deformed  stunted  and purely evil  Because of this imbalance in favor of evil  and the weakness of Jekyll s human nature  and the wicked abandon of Hyde  and the decreasing effectiveness of the drug  all working together  what starts as a weird experiment quickly becomes an addiction  And while Jekyll increasingly loses control  Hyde has become a hunted man  doomed to the gallows if captured  Any civilized and decent person must be able to imagine and sympathize with the horror a man feels as he sees himself becoming a monster  and knows that his identity will soon be lost  The top horror fetishes of the moment  zombies  vampires  and werewolves  can also be understood in the light of losing yourself and becoming something monstrous  But Dr  Jekyll s situation is  if anything  even more cruel  he has  at least to start with  the ability to come back to himself at will  But through his own weakness  errors  and the biochemistry of addiction  he lives through the agony of losing that saving grace  bit by tiny bit  And all the while  he knows that he brought it on himself by choice  nothing bit him or scratched him to make him this way  This is what he chose  rather than having to struggle between his high aspirations and his low appetites  It s an instructive horror  then  for the rest of us who sometimes feel discouraged as we fight our own inner demons  But it s also a horrible horror  and no mistake  I  for one  will have something new to pray about tonight  after finishing this book  I might as well pray anyway  since I ll be lying awake  Antara buku yang mencuri sebahagian zaman kanak kanak saya selepas menguak rahsia takjub di Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Kelantan di sisi  ketika itu   Kota Bharu  Dengan penguasaan bahasa Inggeris pada tahap minima  masakan tidak subjek BI di sekolah pun  seingat saya diajar dengan bahasa Melayu    buku buku terjemahanlah yang menjadi eskapisme daripada dunia yang sepi kepada dunia yang bingit dengan cerita Secara tidak langsung   barangkali Doktor Jekyll dan Encik Hyde juga adalah sedikit cerminan hidup pada zaman kanak kanak yang sudah tentu dalam konteks yang lebih baik   kerana pembaca buku sebenarnya mempunyai dua watak yang berbeza  yang satu watak di luar bukunya dan satu lagi watak apabila dia bersama sama dengan watak watak dalam karya yang ditekuninya Lima bintang yang saya berikan ini tentunya kerana ia gemerlap dengan dunia kanak kanak yang semakin jauh tetapi pada ketika ketika tertentu tetap dirindui dan dalam diam diam semacam menjadi  tidak bersyukur  kerana mahu kembali lagi ke dekad berkenaan Ya  ini lima bintang nostalgia  Yang jauh  tetapi sering direnung dalam gelita malam  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  written by Robert Louis Stevenson is a book I ve been wanting to read for a while now  since every time I seem to hear some random quote or remark on that story in particular  It is a drama thriller book told from the perspective of Utterson  an English lawyer who is friends with Dr  Jekyll and Dr  Lanyon  Although the book is from his point of view mostly  it s not written in first person  but in third I have read a previous book from Stevenson  but I didn t like it that much  It was called  Treasure Island  I was interested on it  but the writing didn t captivate me  However  with The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a whole new thing  It was so purely written  that you get suspense from beginning to end  It takes some unexpected twists and turns and it gives incredible descriptions So  without further delay  I ll give you my summary of the plot  Utterson finds hmself investigating the strange occurrences between his friend Dr  Jekyll and an unknown man  Mr  Hyde  There has been a series of crimes and they all seem to point out to the later  Dr  Jekyll is involved somehow  and he is keeping a secret  something big that no one knows of  Problem is  Mr  Hyde seems to disappear randomly after the crimes occur  Dr Jekyll seems to be changing as well  Utterson discovers the truth at last  but it is nothing he could have ever dreamed of  I really enjoyed this book  like I said before it is beautifully written and it is captivating  Stevenson brought to paper a new type of book  writing a fiction about the mental condition of split personality  It had such an impact that often you hear the phrase  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  in common language  when referring to a sudden change of traits  character or people  Quoting Sirius Black  We ve all got both light and dark inside us  What matters is the part we choose to act on  That s who we really are   This says it all basically  for those who have read the book you know what I m talking about  That s why Dr  Jekyll couldn t go back to his old self   The only bad thing I found on this book is that is too short  The plot develops nicely but for me  I needed a little bit more  Maybe some more things about Dr  Jekyll dealing with this other trait of him  But the book is awesome  I wouldn t recommend it to younger kids because it is a classic novel  and as all of them are  it would be a little bit difficult for them to follow the plot with the writing style used here  I do recommend it to young adults and above  Enjoy reading   D Ahhh    Victorian gothic horror lit    Re read this  such a classic  May as well throw in a few comments as I haven t reviewed this before You just have to read this book  It s one of those tales that never leaves cult fiction  and makes an ever lasting impression on the world  It is a short story  About the human capacity for evil   the subconscious and the conscience  A murder mystery  with a twist Tracking down this  damned  young man is difficult  as he dwells inside the most unexpected companion  No one would suspect that Doctor Jekyll could be hiding such a deadly secret Plays on themes also found in Shelley s Frankenstein  about the human capacity for evil  Both Hyde and Frankenstein s monster have no remorse for their victims  It is about the blurring line between good and bad  the idea of a double person  that we are in fact two creatures  one good and one evil and the eternal struggle between what s right and what s wrong  Another perspective is the father son concept  Hyde refers to Jekyll as a  father  figure  his creator  Again reminiscent of Frankenstein  where the monster is seeking his creator s love and approval  Here Hyde knows what Jekyll thinks of behaviour  and flagrantly disregards him Another idea  that we can pin our sins and misdeeds on another side of ourselves  and the good side be completely blameless at heart  is a little harder to reason with  In Jekyll s descriptions  he changes from speaking of them as one person  in that Hyde was really him and that he felt powerful  to then speaking of them  after the murder  as separate entities    I felt   He did  which is incredibly interesting The other tales in this edition are  The body snatcher    a very eerie little tale  with a fabulous spooky ending  The graveyard and the Gothic elements add to the horror  Also  Markheim    a tale of crime and guilt  Loved the personification of the clocks and the rain as witness to the crime committed and the terror that builds up  And finally  The Bottle Imp    An odd cautionary tale of where the genie in the lamp will lead you  and how greed can carry you away  There are two lawyers  Mr Utterson and Mr Enfield  Every Sunday they go walking together  rambling through London  sometimes talking  sometimes in companionable silence  When they chance upon a particular doorway in a particular street  Mr Enfield pauses to tell his friend a peculiar tale   On a black winter morning   Mr Enfield walked down this street and witnessed a man and a little girl collide  The girl fell and the man put his foot on her  trod on her as though she was nothing  and walked away It seems a small thing  a little disdainful violence  but perhaps that is part of the reason Mr Enfield finds it so distasteful  The other  the chief part  is the man himself  the ugly little man  He is impossible to describe  but inspires sick hatred and loathing in those around him  simply by being This man agrees to pay reparation for the hurt done to the girl  He enters the particular doorway and returns with cash and a bank cheque for the remainder   another man s cheque Mr Utterson finds this story disturbing  Not from any sympathy for the girl  for Mr Utterson is a cold man  but a man tolerant of the excesses and depravities of others  He is disturbed because he knows both men  has as his client Dr Jekyll  the man with the money and the door  and has in his possession Dr Jekyll s will  in which Mr Hyde  the ugly little man  is the chief beneficiary This is such a well known story  It s impossible not to know what it s about  not to have seen its many incarnations play out in many other stories  of the good man who drinks the potion and becomes the monster  It s a myth  mythic  the Jekyll Hyde  the doppelganger  the shadow self  It s so easily recognisable because  even knowing that we are each more complicated than two halves  that we do not make choices listening to the devil on the left shoulder or the angel on the right  that we are not the strange monster beneath the bland public face  it resonates  Jekyll himself acknowledges that others will no doubt find that we are more than two selves  that we are likely to be found to be of many and various disagreeable parts I thought about that as I was reading  about how this stands against psychological frameworks I only vaguely understand  so I won t embarrass myself by attempting to outline here  I thought  well isn t this simple  and isn t it wrong  I thought about Dr Jekyll as an unreliable narrator because from the moment I see  I  on a page  I assume that there are justifications and gentle elisions and outright lies  Mostly of course  there aren t and I am quite wrong  or it wouldn t make any difference anyway  I started from a place of distrust  and I assumed that Dr Jekyll was not as good a man as he protested to be Of course  it is impossible that he would be a perfectly good man  a perfectly good man would have had no desire to be Mr Hyde at all  But Jekyll made his case for being an ordinarily good man  but a scientist  Creating Hyde was seeking a truth  And he was an ordinarily good man in that he had some weaknesses  and creating Hyde allowed him just a small indulgence of a holiday from himself  That Hyde is a small man  and a younger one  is surely evidence of Jekyll s goodness  for clearly his size is indicative of how small and undernourished Jekyll s wickedness is So I read it as a man who wanted to be thought good  but desired to indulge in his secret dark twisted desires without fear of exposure  Given that this is allegory  I m aware that there is a lot of thought on what those desires were  Sexual fantasy is very popular  and has a natural fit with how we generally see the Victorians as repressed  But it could be any or all vices  or very few  What is on the page and in evidence   Hyde stepping on a child  Hyde beating an old man to death  seems relatively tame  Modern fiction has made me accustomed to more violence  and perhaps I should accept that these crimes are terrible and violent enough within this context     but it did strike me that Jekyll s confession refers only to these two  known events  He could have drawn a veil over much worse  Or  over nothing at all Or  that itself is a simplistic reading  because Hyde is more than a disguise  If this is a disguise it is like  Dorian Gray  where the rule is that a soul stained with evil must result in some physical manifestation  There is a hint of that when Jekyll finds that he has lost control of the transformations  Jekyll talks of Hyde as a separate person  and Jekyll is in Hyde s head and reacting to Hyde s actions  but he thinks that Hyde is largely indifferent to him  Which is interesting and unequal  because perhaps for Hyde Jekyll is a disguise  but for Jekyll  Hyde is something more As well as thinking about Oscar WIlde s  Picture of Dorian Gray  I thought about Rimmer from  Red Dwarf   I don t remember it very well  but in one story Dave Lister  Rimmer and the Cat all imbibe or interface with a substance called  Better than Life   It allows the user to live out their dream life  every wish comes true  and for Rimmer it is at first as wonderful as it is for the others  but it doesn t last  Rimmer hates himself  and self sabotages  transforming his perfect life into a perfect nightmare  Jekyll never seems to loathe himself  or to loathe Hyde  While ultimately Jekyll s story ends in self destruction  it is not because he hates himself or hates what he has become  it is because he will not be forced to confront what he has become through anyone else s eyes  He tells his story  but on his own terms  I read this and was satisfied  because I like ambiguity and I like words and Stephenson is good with both  I also like that this can be read as an allegory  but without really needing to determine that it is an exact allegory of some particular thing   When I decided to read this it was just before bedtime  The owls were outside hooting  the moon was shining full  and the frogs were peeping in the distance  I took a look at the cover  It looked very Gothic  I read the description on the back and immediately started reading the book  in bed of course   The first words of it captured my attention and I couldn t put it down A couple of hours went by  I had no idea that Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were the same person so when I read this I naturally believed them to be separate beings  This was so interesting and horrifying  This was suspenseful  When the dreaded truth that they were the same person by some scientific chemical mixture that changed Dr  Jekyll to Mr  Hyde I screamed with thrill and horror  well in my mind anyway As I closed the book  quite bewitched  I looked at the clock on my wall and perceived the late hour  It had just flown by just like a bird in the sky  That night I think I slept well but I was somewhat haunted by this  This book as everyone knows is about the duality of man s soul and this concept of duality is used as a metaphor throughout the book  It is a short book but the words on each page are powerful and beautifully put together  For example we are soon introduced to Mr Utterson  the lawyer  and he is described as  backward in sentiment and yet somehow loveable and when in company and when the wine was to his taste something eminently human beaconed from his eyes  There are constant references to duality  Mr Utterson mentions that he inclines towards the Cain heresy  Mr Hyde s door is part of a  sinister building with its gable thrust forward on the street   the door to the same building was  blistered and discoloured  all in contrast to the air of invitation that shop fronts on the same street gave My favorite contrasts a bottle of a French wine with the London night that it was drunk  In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved  the imperial dye had softened with time  as the colour grows richer in stained windows  and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London  The metaphor has also been used to describe the differences between the secretive city of Edinburgh and Glasgow  the city that wears its heart on its sleeve  Of course the book is set in London but Stevenson was brought up in a strict Presbyterian household in Edinburgh I think Stevenson concludes that man  s duality needs to be acknowledged and that one of the problems with Victorian society was that it never was  People were encouraged to be respectable like Doctor Jekyll and so called respectable people didn t have darker sides  Like Plato s charateer  however  man has to make sure that he is in control of the white horse and the black horse  Simply ignoring the black horse is not an option  I read this when I was around 11  12 at most  I was attracted to the cover  a children s edition showing a respectable looking man surrounded by a ghostly image of some sort of evil spirit  I read and  well  it was a bit difficult  especially at the start  a bit slow going for a young girl  And then  it bloomed like a particularly inspiring flower Few people nowadays ignore the truth about Henry Jekyll and his mysterious relationship with the monstrous little man seemingly haunting his life  and I can t remember if I knew it as a child  But the great thing about great stories is  knowing the spoilers doesn t actually spoil the fun  The themes are universal  the animal drive for pleasure  the natural fear of death and decay  the carcan brought on by society    Stevenson shows his readers the reality beneath the polish  even the best of men can be seduced by beastly things and drawn to beastly acts The novel is the very essence of  fantastique   an realistic world contaminated  little by little  by eerie abnormalities  One of the things I like most about it is the way Stevenson switches between several narrators to bring home how several completely different experiences all agree on the same indescribable sensation of  wrong   All of them are rational  cultivated men  who can t rationalize what happens to them  In the end  even the man who should know all has to admit his own ignorance  from where the horror came  Just like Dracula  Hyde enters the world through a back door no one knows about  I love this book because it didn t close it  I finally finished this book  The only reason it took me so long to read this book is because I had some ER books that needed to be read before I could finish this book  I am glad I waited until I finished those books to read this one  I was able to concentrate on Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde I really enjoyed the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I had seen a play this summer and that is why I decided to read the book  I wanted to see how the book was compared to the play  The book was just as good as the play I had seen I have to say that this story is fantastic and as I was reading it I could tell that it was about the two personalities people have in themselves  The good and the evil that are always fighting inside you  I found it interesting when I read the letter from Henry Jekyll about how this all came about The afterword by Jerome Charyn was very well written and informs the reader about the author and some of the possible connections between the characters and Robert Louis Stevenson  Il Mostro e dentro di noiCominciamo con una piccola digressione nostalgica  Robert Louis Stevenson e un nome legato indissolubilmente alla mia infanzia  Quando possiedi solo poche decine di libri  infatti  inevitabilmente a un certo punto cominci a rileggere piu volte i tuoi preferiti  e nella mia personale top ten figuravano sia L isola del tesoro che La freccia nera  del primo fra l altro avevo una bellissima edizione illustrata che pesava quanto me XD   Eppure  strano a dirsi  negli anni successivi non mi e mai capitato di leggere quello che probabilmente e il capolavoro del narratore scozzese  Lo strano caso del Dr  Jekyll e Mr  Hide  Da amante del fantastico  sono ben felice di aver finalmente colmato questa imperdonabile lacuna  grazie anche all apprezzata iniziativa della Newton Compton che  riecheggiando i mitici  100 pagine 1000 lire   ha cominciato a proporci una selezione di titoli piuttosto interessanti all irrisoria cifra di 0 99 centesimi   Ma andiamo al romanzo in se  Nel panorama letterario esistono storie e personaggi talmente riusciti che finiscono per vivere di vita propria  e che tutti conosciamo da sempre anche a prescindere dal testo che ha dato origine al mito  Questo e proprio il caso dell inquietante vicenda  forse la piu inquietante mai raccontata  del Dr  Jekyll  stimato professionista londinese che  tramite un pericoloso e ardito esperimento  riesce a dare corpo alla propria parte oscura  il ripugnante Mr  Hyde  Questo breve romanzo mi ha sorpreso sotto molto punti di vista  Innanzitutto  non avevo idea che la maggior parte della storia venisse narrata non dal punto di vista del suo famoso protagonista  ma da quello di un osservatore esterno  l irreprensibile avvocato Utterson  uomo perfettamente integrato nella rigida societa vittoriana  severo con se stesso ma tollerante verso gli altri   incline ad aiutare piuttosto che a biasimare   Una scelta singolare quella di raccontare la storia tramite gli occhi di qualcuno che non sa  ma che semplicemente assiste con preoccupazione crescente ai misteriosi eventi che sembrano coinvolgere l amico di vecchia data Henry Jekyll  Una caratteristica  questa  che aggiunge una suspense vertiginosa al racconto  o meglio  che l aggiungerebbe se tutti non conoscessimo gia il punto focale della trama    peccato non poterlo cancellare dalla nostra mente prima di iniziare la lettura  P  e che ci permette di calarci nella storia da una prospettiva molto particolare  quasi fossimo anche noi dei  reali  spettatori della vicenda  L altro aspetto che mi ha molto colpito sono stati i motivi che hanno spinto  l infelice Henry Jekyll  a intraprendere il suo folle esperimento  gli stessi che l avevano originariamente condotto alla consapevolezza della duplicita della natura umana  Nella lunga confessione finale  Jekyll dice a chiare lettere che tutto e scaturito in primo luogo dalla necessita di nascondere al mondo quei vizi e quelle debolezze che  se venuti allo scoperto  gli sarebbero valsi la disapprovazione e il biasimo altrui  Diversi anni prima che in giro si cominciasse a parlare di Es  Io e Super Io  Stevenson aveva gia messo nero su bianco quello che sarebbe divenuto il nucleo della Psicanalisi freudiana  l eterna lotta fra le nostre pulsioni inconsce e l apparato di norme e regole dettate dalla societa  interiorizzate e cristallizzate in quella che normalmente definiamo  Coscienza   E  proprio il desiderio di non soffrire piu di questo lacerante dissidio che spinge il Dr  Jekyll a rischiare la sua stessa vita  l aspirazione a compiere il Male senza alcun rimorso e quella a compiere il Bene  ovvero  cio che la societa ritiene buono e giusto  senza avvertire quel senso di frustrazione che deriva dalla repressione dei nostri istinti piu inconfessabili  Ed e cosi che  tramite un processo non meglio definito  Jekyll riesce non a scindersi in due  badiamo bene   ma semplicemente a dare forma alla sua parte maligna  Quando egli torna a essere se stesso  e ancora lo stesso uomo di prima  quell insensato  dal suo punto di vista  miscuglio di Bene e Male  ma quando diventa Hyde    egli e Male allo stato puro  un essere che   anche nei momenti in cui non compie nulla di efferato o malvagio   provoca in chiunque lo incroci un istintivo e inspiegabile senso di ribrezzo  dovuto ovviamente al fatto di trovarsi di fronte al  Gemello Cattivo  di qualcuno  un abominio che tuttavia si trova racchiuso in ognuno di noi  Perche e proprio questo che ci spaventa di piu  il fatto che Hyde sia dentro tutti noi  in agguato  pronto a venir fuori e a costarci il biasimo della nostra coscienza e di coloro di cui desideriamo la stima e l approvazione  In effetti  nel corso del romanzo non assistiamo a nulla di veramente  terrificante   gli episodi di maggiore violenza ci vengono solo raccontati attraverso gli occhi dei loro testimoni  per il resto  Stevenson sorvola volutamente sulle malefatte di Hyde  Quali saranno queste terribili perversioni che questo grumo di malvagita si diverte a soddisfare  Non e dato saperlo    In questo caso il terrore che ci attanaglia durante la lettura e interamente costruito sul non detto  Stevenson e riuscito a prendere le nostre peggiori paure  valide nella repressiva Gran Bretagna vittoriana ma altrettanto valide qui e oggi  e a sbattercele in faccia  riuscendo in una manciata di pagine a costruire un atmosfera unica e a precipitarci nel suo incubo personale  Vi dico solo questo  la notte successiva al pomeriggio in cui l ho letto  o meglio  divorato  non ho fatto altro che sognare vicoli londinesi invasi dalla nebbia  XD Una piccolissima nota sull edizione  a quanto pare il traduttore ha avuto parecchi dubbi sul nome del protagonista  che passa alternativamente da  Henry  a  Harry   Ma per 0 99 centesimi ci puo stare ampiamente   P There s a certain satisfaction in having finished reading a true classic   especially one the caliber of Robert Louis Stevenson s fascinating  though somewhat brief meditation on the predatory nature of the murkier side of the human condition  For certainly  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is the kind of tale that just about everyone seems to have encountered at one time or another  but perhaps few have actually bothered to read in its original form That s pretty much exactly what drew me to the title  Like the villainous Hyde s monstrous literary counterparts  Dracula and Frankenstein s Monster  everyone  it seems  has been exposed to the plot and the characters of this seminal Victorian horror story  via some vehicle of modern pop culture or another  but what of the original prose itself As was to be expected  Stevenson s tale does not disappoint  but I honestly don t recommend reading the introductory essay by Vladimir Nabakov  His windy introduction is mostly tedious  repetitious and really rather unnecessary  Nabakov does offer a few valuable insights  but I found the appropriately brief Afterward by Dan Chaon to be much less of a distracting road block  obscuring the actual novel itself The fact that The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde isn t all that long to begin with seems to be why Signet Classics chose to preface the book with Nabakov s essay  but for me  it nearly spoiled the story  since so many complete paragraphs of Stevenson s work are quoted in the foreword  and so much of the story is tediously pre analyzed in such a way that it mostly comes off as little more than a very annoying college lecture that one is forced to sit through  just to find out what the actual reading assignment will be So  read the actual book if you already haven t  but skim or totally disregard the wordy introductory essay  Trust me  Stevenson tells his story a hell of a lot better than the verbose Mr  Nabakov ever could     To be honest I did not know what this book would be like  I believed it would just be a horror  All the TV shows I have seen about the book also did not really follow the format of this book  So I was quite pleasantly surprised I always believed that you follow Dr  Jekyll s story  but in fact you follow Mr  Utterson  It is like a very short mystery of a man trying to uncover this strange case of his good friend Dr  Jekyll and a much less liked acquaintance Mr  Hyde  I really liked this format  the writing and the characters as they all tie into this short mystery  Only at the very end is all explained by the good doctor in the last chapter  Although I ve grown up knowing the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde I can imagine how Victorian readers must have read this story for the first time an be floored by the ending The theme that Robert Louis Stevenson tackles head on continues to be topical to this day  I do know Victorian society was very rigid in their ways and you simply could not indulge yourself in anything as it was viewed as taboo  and I could see how that might have frustrated many people in the era  Even today people struggle to accept the fact that we are all both good and bad  and it is our choices that define which side wins  But ultimately we kind of need both sides  it remind me of an old Star Trek episode in which Captain Kirk was split into two people by a transporter accident  His good side cared was caring and everything you love about the character  but he was weak and indecisive  On the other hand  his bad side was cruel and dislikeable and he had no control over fear  but he was decisive and strong I guess this story seems to be the father of such future stories  We all want to be good and fit in society  but we also have indulgences and dark sides  If we try to completely suppress this dark side we are miserable and may just give into it  If we just indulge in our dark sides then we equally miserable  We need to acknowledge and balance both sides to really be at peace  It seems this book explains it in the end whenever Dr  Jekyll gave one side too much control the other side fought to gain more control  this seemed to go on until the doctor lost all control of himself Despite all of this  the book as a very interesting and fun read  I became interested along with Mr  Utterson and wanted to investigate with him  not to uncover the truth but to see how the truth becomes revealed  Only a really well laid out and written story could do that when I already know the ending  The last chapter was very good and just cemented my decision to give this 5 stars  I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde deserves its place in classic literature as a fine example of suspense and horror and human psychology The story focuses on Gabriel Utterson  a lawyer who also happens to be a close friend of Dr  Henry Jekyll  While Mr  Utterson and his friend Richard Enfield are out and about for a walk  they chance upon a darkened doorway  and Mr  Enfield relates an unusual tale about a strange  short  loathesome man who literally ran right over a young girl without stopping or checking on her  When Utterson learns the name of this man    Hyde    he suddenly remembers a will that he reluctantly drew for Dr  Jekyll  involving one Edward Hyde  So begins his mission to learn about his friend Jekyll whom no one has seen for some months  Yet as he uncovers more about the friend  he soon learns the awful price Jekyll has paid to unleash his inner demons This story brings to life the battle each one of us has within ourselves  Dr  Jekyll calls it his  dualtiy of purpose   The struggle of good versus evil  told in that colorful language of classics  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde was an enjoyable read  It kept me wanting to know more and more as the story went on  The two face personality made me wonder like there was no tomorrow  How could someone so nice be so mean at the same time  I always have loved psychology and investigations this read had psychology detective written all over it  To sum it all up  the story was about a lawyer  Mr  Utterson  trying to find more about this mystery person Mr  Hyde  Not knowing Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde shared personalities  Mr  Utterson was out on the scene trying to find this Mr  Hyde  who was accused of crimes  actually done by Dr  Jekyll  Being the same person Dr  Jekyll got excitement out of committing crimes but he did not want to be the one committing the crimes  Dr  Jekyll then created Mr  Hyde  in his laboratory  I don t want to give away to much of the story  but you are left with a wowing surprise at the end of the read  I would recommend this book  Robert Louis Stevenson  did a very nice job of adding suspense a little bit of suspense to this book  It had you thinking the whole time what was going on  It had me wondering throughout the whole story  of how it would be to have two personalities and be changed into something your not  I could not imagine going back to my normal self and acting as if nothing had happened  Some of Robert Louis Stevenson s symbolism was really nice  For example Dr  Jekyll  or if you would like to call him Mr  Hyde  had a laboratory and a separate house from his laboratory  They both symbolized the dark side  and the light side of Dr  Jekyll  The story was nice and not to difficult to read  I also Loved the fact that Robert Louis Stevenson chose to write in both a psychology and a detective theme  Robert Louis Stevenson Combined two of my favorite genres  and if you like either one of these I recommend this book   I gave this book a 5 because it was a nice quick read  and it was all I was looking for in a book  To sum it up it is definitely in my top choices  I would recommend it if you like psychology detective pieces  It also does not leave you with a lot of questions unanswered  It is a very nice quick read   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde takes place in nineteenth century London and is never quite specified by Stevenson the exact years that the story takes place  It is the story of Mr  Utterson trying to unravel the mysterious connection between Dr  Henry Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and it is a truly chilling one  Robert Louis Stevenson is a master of description  who uses his ability to manipulate his readers into a state of curiosity  suspense  and dread  This tale captures the pure sense of insanity  The plot of The Strange Case begins by setting the scene in a dark mysterious section of London  in which a Mr  Utterson and Mr  Ensfield take a walk through the streets  Ensfield tells the tale of a decrepit man running into a poor little girl  then continuing on his way  Utterson is startled by the tale and continues home where he ponders the peculiar will of one of his dear friends  Dr  Jekyll  The will entails Dr  Jekyll leaving his estate and all his possessions to a Mr  Hyde if he were to become deceased or missing for more than three months  As the story progresses  Mr  Utterson tries to find the link between the two polar opposite characters  When it comes to the point that a man is killed by this mysterious Hyde  he disappears and Jekyll surely enough has a change in attitude  However  Jekyll s attitude later changes from joyful to morbid and secluded  In the remainder of the story  Utterson s friend Lanyon dies and leaves Utterson information regarding the mysterious bond  In the end  Hyde is killed and Utterson reads narratives from both Lanyon and Jekyll that reveal the true link between the two  Through Stevenson s tale  the audience is able to learn of the duality of human nature  By splitting Hyde and Jekyll into two different characters  yet being the same person  Stevenson can emphasize the different personalities in not only his character  but everyone in the world  Anyone and everyone has more than one personality and whether or not they can hide it  it will always come out  The theme is to remember that there are two sides to every story  and in this case every person  Overall  I really enjoyed this book  I like Robert Louis Stevenson s work  including Kidknapped and now Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I love how he uses such sophisticated descriptions to capture even the smallest of details  and even though it may be hard to read sometimes  I always reach a part the pulls me back in  I also enjoy reading the old english style of his literature  Also  Stevenson being from Scotland just makes it all the better  So you know how you think to yourself  I should really read more classics  but then you remember the other million books you still have to read and you think  well I know that story so maybe I ll skip that classic  Everybody knows the story of Jekyll and Hyde   they ve put in in cartoons for crying out loud  We ALL know what happens  so really  what s the point of reading it  right  WRONG  Read the book  Just read it  This book is one of the best arguments against not reading a book because you know what s going to happen  It s one of the best arguments I ve seen to show the importance of how a story is told  not just what it tells  I can t remember the last time I was so actively engaged in a story  Making notes and highlighting and everything  In the space of a few pages  and all you authors out there who feel the need for sequels on top of sequels can learn something here  we see a man completely taken over by his worse nature  It s terrifying  And not at all less so because we know how the story ends  Read it  Let me start by saying that this novel is not what you re expecting  Yes  there s the experiment gone wrong and the multiple personalities of Jekyll and Hyde  but that just sets the stage for Robert Louis Stevenson  the author  to explore some very deep and dark parts of humanity Structurally  I didn t enjoy the very long paragraphs in the novel  but something about the novel kept me interested  I didn t notice anything special that Stevenson did  but Stevenson kept it interesting  It s very hard to pinpoint my point of interest though  However  the final paragraph is absolutely golden For his time  Stevenson was a bit of a genius  I really enjoyed his exploration of the darkness inside the human heart  Jekyll is a well kept and intelligent man  but Hyde is the beast inside of him  Hyde wants to have fun and do whatever he wants  Hyde is the physical manifestation of Jekyll s anger and twisted thoughts The novel left me with a haunting chill  I wanted more Jekyll and Hyde  more of their story  It really got me thinking about the  Hyde  in all of us  Review of  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde Robert Louis Stevenson story sometimes simply referred to as  Jekyll and Hyde  delves into the dual personality of the pleasant going Dr  Jekyll  The book was published during the Victorian Era in Scotland  1886   The book s title character  or characters  has become one of the most recognizable faces in horror literature  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde stands out as one of my favorite books and second in Stevenson s catalog  only behind Treasure Island   Fair warning  this paragraph contains spoilers  The story begins with two characters recalling an incident that had occurred recently  A hideous and deformed man had run over a little girl and would ve continued on his way had the nearby locals not pressured the man  named Edward Hyde  into writing a check as compensation  Utterson  the main protagonist  investigates the strange Hyde  discovering that he has connections with Dr  Jekyll  The doctor assures Utterson that Hyde is not a problem  though Utterson still has doubts  A year passes  and then a man named Danvers Carew is murdered  Utterson and the police investigate Hyde s apartment and find a cane  the murder weapon   one that Utterson had given to Jekyll in the past  He investigates  returning to his friend once more  Hyde doesn t appear for a few months  but Dr  Jekyll s mysterious and sudden reclusiveness has many worried  Dr  Lanyon dies of shock after receiving information about Jekyll  but before he does  he gives a letter to Utterson that is not meant to be opened until Jekyll is dead  Utterson and Enfield go to Jekyll s house  break into his laboratory and find Edward Hyde dead  presumably from suicide  There is a letter in the room that explains the situation  Turns out  Jekyll was Mr  Hyde and he had been experimenting with having two bodies  one that is good  the other that does the sinning  Hyde began to control Jekyll  though  and the doctor was left with only one choice  suicide  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde has been adapted into multiple movies as well as a play  The movies were released in 1920  1931  and 1941  I ve had the gift of seeing the first  It is a silent movie  but what it lacks in dialogue it makes up for in mood and antics  The movie also adds in a romance plot with Millicent Carew  daughter of the late Danvers Carew  She plays an important part in the plot and is hurt by Jekyll s sporadic and unpredictable behavior  Mr  Hyde goes to a club  the one where Dr  Jekyll had been tempted by one of the dancers  His behavior is a huge contrast to his creator  who chooses to ignore the earthly desires and focuses his studies on getting into the afterlife  The movie modifies the original plot presented on Stevenson in a respectful and original way  It adds depth to a story whose only flaw is its simplicity and shortness  Mr  Hyde made an appearance in another recent movie  Van Helsing  His character is quickly discarded  but the fact that he was chosen shows that Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde are both still relevant and ripe for new ideas   I think many of us know the basic premise of the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Dr  Jekyll is  the good guy  who drinks a potion and turns into Mr  Hyde   the bad guy   He drinks the potion again and turns back into himself In actually reading the story for the first time  I found that I was greatly mistaken on the particulars of the story  I won t list them in detail here  because I dislike spoilers  You ll have to read it yourself    I will say that Mr  Hyde isn t some kind of Incredible Hulk  which was the idea I d always had in mind  Also  the potion isn t always involved with the switching back and forth  Beyond that  you ll just have to read it yourself to find whe your own misconceptions lie As for the story itself  it was excellent  I imagine that back in the day it was quite a shocking thriller  There are loads of deeper Truths in it as well  for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear  Not the least of which is what it means to be a true friend to a friend in need The version I read was a free book for my Kindle software on my iPad     Mi ero quasi scordata di questo racconto  ed e proprio grazie ad una discussione qui su GR che mi e tornato alla mente in tutta prepotenza  Come qualcuno notava  il grosso problema del racconto sta nel fatto che la sua trama e stata esposta in lungo e in largo dalle innumerevoli trasposizioni cinematografiche  teatrali e musicate  per cui non e materialmente possibile goderselo in pieno  con tanto di effetto sorpresa  Nonostante cio  e un racconto decisamente forte e reso pregnante da molti livelli di lettura che non sto qui ad elencare  non ne ho voglia   Nato da un incubo  ne mantiene le caratteristiche  sospeso in un mondo apparentemente calato nella realta ma di fatto fluttuante in uno stato sognante  rimane dall inizio alla fine carico di un inquietudine strisciante che a tratti emerge come un onda lenta ma inesorabile E  uno di quei libri che mi hanno arricchita profondamente come psichiatra  aiutandomi a scorgere aspetti dell animo umano che non potrebbero mai essere descritti in un libro di testo  cosi come le letture di Dostoevskij e Tolstoj  ma soprattutto il primo   A differenza degli autori russi pero  Stevenson e un autore dal taglio decisamente laico  asciutto e implacabile A dispetto del fatto che per molti aspetti e un libro datato  i suoi suggerimenti e il suo sguardo sull essere umano ne fanno comunque una lettura al di la del tempo   With every day  and from both sides of my intelligence  the moral and the intellectual  I thus drew steadily nearer to the truth  by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck  that man is not truly one  but truly two    The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is R L  Stevenson s highly acclaimed classic that first came out in 1886 and dealt with the split personality phenomenon  An instant hit  it has been adapted for TV  movies and on stage multiple times Living in the Victorian era in England  Dr  Jekyll is a respected man held in high esteem by his colleagues  He is also famous for hosting great dinners and for his gentlemanly ways  But what no one suspects is that Dr  Jekyll is also the mysterious and cruel  Mr  Hyde who had ruthlessly trampled a small girl once without any qualms Mr  Utterson  a close friend as well as the attorney of Dr  Jekyll  is concerned about Dr  Jekyll s close companionship with Mr  Hyde and also worried about his safety  He suspects that Mr  Hyde is biding his time and planning to kill the doctor at the first chance that he gets  So it is Mr  Utterson who investigates the strange occurrences that start happening with Dr  Jekyll and the mysterious gaps in Mr  Hyde s sightings As Mr  Utterson says when he decides to find all about Mr  Hyde   If he be Mr  Hyde   he had thought   I shall be Mr  Seek    I still remember the first time that I read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde and the thrill I got after reading it  one would suspect that it would diminish the second time one reads the same book but that has not been the case with me  Howsoever times I read this book I feel the same excitement and the same chill  The effect that R L  Stevenson produces on the readers has stood the test of time  The atmosphere is of secrecy  mystery and horror  There is a good man and a bad man  With nothing in common but yet they share such a friendship that the good man  Dr  Jekyll is averse to listening to anything foul about Mr  Hyde and is so inclined towards him that he evens pays off any problems that he might encounter like he signs the check to payoff the small girl s family after Mr  Hyde has trampled and injured the girl  But the same cannot be said for Mr  Hyde who is indifferent and uncaring towards everyone and everything  He has a craving for violence and has no patience for society norms   Jekyll had more than a father s interest  Hyde had more than a son s indifference    The story does not have many settings  Everything is either happening in the lab of Dr  Jekyll or through letters  There is no direct POV of Mr  Hyde and Dr  Jekyll also only voices his perspectives at the very end  Anyone will think that this should dampen the appeal of the book where the main characters are for the most part in the background but no  the expertise and skill of the author in handling the streaming of the flow is admirable and he keeps the reader entranced the whole time  I was totally enchanted by the vivid descriptions of the Victorian London and the scenarios  Everything was happening like a movie playing in my mind and I could imagine myself walking beside Mr  Utterson when he first learns of Mr  Hyde or could definitely imagine myself looking up to see Dr  Jekyll sitting at his window looking pale and mysterious A book that will enchant and give you nightmares  This is a story that debates the issues of suppressed desires and the belief that everyone is made up of a good part and a bad part   If the good and the bad are separated then what will happen  Will it always be like it was with Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde or is there another solution  The characters are sketched such that they remain with you long after you have finished the book  Dr  Jekyll is a gentleman and a highly acclaimed doctor  At first sight he is the perfect specimen of good breeding and high education but  can we ever know anyone fully  Mr  Hyde is his dark side  A man with no conscience and an utter disregard for any rules of morality or society  he is man of high action and no consideration   All human beings  as we meet them  are commingled out of good and evil  and Edward Hyde  alone  in the ranks of mankind  was pure evil    Mr  Utterson is a serious man by all regards but also a loyal friend who is persistent in his actions to know the problems haunting Dr  Jekyll and help solve them  He is also very inquisitive and ready to take risks to quench his curiosity  His character also gives us a glimpse of duality where on one hand we have the serious and very professional attorney and on the other hand is the man ready to take risks and act on impulse The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde makes the reader ponder and think about the scenarios where many a times a seemingly good person is accused and proven to be someone entirely different from his expected character where people often can be heard saying   He was such a good man I don t know how he could be a murderer    or   She was so devoted  definitely didn t expect her to be capable of doing something like this   A story with multiple layers to it and many ways of taking the story  I give The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde a shining 5 out of 5 and highly recommend this book to everyone  An unforgettable epic from R L  Stevenson  this is not to be missed      There comes an end to all things  the most capacious measure is filled at last  and this brief condescension to evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul    This review is also available on my blog http   njkinny blogspot in Actual rating  4 5 5 starsI ll admit it  this is one of those books that I  sort of   pushed myself into reading  because it s considered a classic  Although  I really did enjoy reading it  and I understand its reputation  Unfortunately  the problem with catching up on classic  well known novels is that the stories end up spoiled simply by society  Nowadays  the names  Jekyll  and  Hyde  are used in a synonymous way as words that describe multiple personalities  Thus  most readers today would know that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person  through adaptations  plays  and tributes  more than half the story has already been spoiled  In other words  the novella  while it is a great read  isn t as relevant as it was when first written published I frequently wanted to turn the page  and there was still enough suspense discovery to make me want to keep reading  The only problem with the writing itself is that I would have liked to read a little bit more about what led Jekyll into wanting to be Hyde  The last 50 or so pages  with all the letters  are great with detail and wrap up the book brilliantly  but what were Jekyll s motives  Psychologically  what made him want to become Mr  Hyde  A look into the mind of the doctor would make it even better Overall  you should definitely read it if you haven t  Despite less relevance today  it s a page turner  and it was still nice even when I basically knew what the ending meant  Another spectacular book by Robert Louis Stevenson  His writing enthralls me  It s so easy to find yourself held spellbound by his description of settings and characters and mood  painting such a clear picture of every aspect of the story that you can t help but shudder as if experiencing the horrors in person  One of my favorite written descriptions sets a clear image of the early morning  fog laden streets of London and the eeriness accompanying the pursuit of a murderer   It was by this time about nine in the morning  and the first fog of the season  A great chocolate coloured pall lowered over heaven  but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours  so that as the cab crawled from street to street  Mr  Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight  for here it would be dark like the back end of evening  and there would be a glow of rich  lurid brown  like the light of some strange conflagaration  and here  for a moment  the fog would be quite broken up  and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths  The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses  with its muddy ways  and slatternly passengers  and its lamps  which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness  seemed  in the lawyer s eyes  like a district of some city in a nightmare  And this   perfect words to describe the awful demon that was Mr  Edward Hyde  Is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through  and transfigures  its clay continent      O my poor old Harry Jekyll  if ever I read Satan s signature upon a face  it is on that of your new friend  Edward Hyde  I enjoyed this tale  a dark glimpse into the struggles of every man  resisting or succumbing to vile temptations  This was a short story  but an intense read   What a wonderful read this is  Stevenson s touch is light and yet powerful and we can draw many personal conclusions from the tale  Jekyll and Hyde is such a familiar term to us all  but we tend to mean it to describe a person prone to mood swings What the true Jekyll and Hyde explores is not a temper tantrum but the levels of personality in us all  In truth  we all have a dark side  and some of us indulge it more than others  What would happen if our dark side took physical form and was left unchecked  What if that alter ego looked so physically different to us that no one would ever know who it truly was  What if it not only came to life but also usurped our place in the world  How could we seek help This novella raises many questions if you wish it to  It is also a tale you can devour without taking it as more than an enjoyable read  Similar to Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  it examines ambition and drive gone awry but it also examines the idea that each of us can be more than one person  that we each exercise a great deal of control over our primal instinct and desire for good reason  and how this can at times tear us apart Movies we ve seen don t do this work justice and at such a small size there is no argument for not reading  Although in this edition there are only 88 printed pages  There s a small cluster of blank pages at the back from the binding  but you can use these to make notes  either on the novel  or on your own

gothic theme  In my opinion  it moves the genre to an all new level  The story is told through the eyes of a man with the name of Utterson and who is also a lawer  At the beginning of the story  he is worried for his friend  Henry Jekyll  a violent man living in Utterson s house  Every time Jekyll is spoken to he avoids the one trying to speak Later in the story  Jekyll locks himself in a labratory  Utterson gets really worried for his friend so he breaks in and trys to save him  when Utterson gets in he finds Jekyll dead  killed by his own hands  He also finds a letter  a letter written by Jekyll  It explains that the doctor had created a potion that divided to personalities  the good and the bad  with the bad transforming into two different people  Everyone was overwhelmed by his evil side  At the beginning of the transformation  Jekyll found it very interesting and rewarding  It seemed that he tried to live a life full of evil and sin regarding the danger  Mr  Hyde began taking over and Jekyll couldnt handle the process that came with the transformation so he killed himself More than anything  Jekyll and Hyde work as a view of the good and evil that can be in a man  Under the restrictions of a different society  Jekyll just seems to give into what he wants inside atfter he is transformed into Hyde  The normal and controlled part of Jekyll attempts to keep his personality contained  He tries to make Hyde controllable  It s like the force of nature inside of a person usually leads to bad consequences In this story it leaves the impression on me that Dr  Jekyll is a very smooth and nice guy that means absolutely no harm  As it goes on  everyone changes in there own unique way  It was a little bit hard for me to keep up with everything but as it went on everything started to fall together  which was good because I heard alot of good about the book and I didn t want to ruin it for myself  Both an exciting story and a great perceptive on what it s like to be human  This novel poses an interesting question about human nature  are humans inherently good virtuous and evil  or are we all simply primitive by nature  brought under tentative control by civilisation  law  and conscience  That is  is  man not truly one  but truly two   or are we all immoral  not amoral  Hydes  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a psychological mystery novel that studies the nature of man  and what constitutes his soul Throughout the novel  Stevenson focuses on the secrecy  and apparent civilised nature of Victorian society  One of the main  if not foremost concerns of 19th century Victorians was the preservation of one s good reputation  As long as one lived  one s reputation must not be soiled  but to hell with it when you re dead because  hey  being remembered for a scandal is better than to be forgotten I really enjoyed reading this story  it was riveting  and kept me on the edge of my seat  I think I would ve enjoyed it much better had I read it in book form  though  I was forced to endure reading it on the computer screen   Nonetheless  the mystery and suspense was great  I could hardly breathe while reading  At the end  all was revealed to me  except some of the indecent acts of Jekyll s youth  these  I believe  were not made explicit to the reader so as not only to retain a degree of the novel s eeriness  but also because they might have hinted at Victorian society taboo  eg  homosexuality  Throughout the novel  Stevenson s language  eg  nightmarish imagery of the urban landscape of London   hinted at the supernatural  and I think it was owing to this that gave this novel that extra touch that made it so indelible    the setting too makes Hyde seem at home whilst committing his crimes  in this way  Stevenson sets London up as a city of unspeakable  secret  crimes that people  rather  society  simply refuse to unearth  To start this book was fantastic  I read it through in one day although given the length that should be expected  Going into the book I believed I was meant to be reading about a case of schizophrenia so when presented with the different descriptions of Jekyll and Hyde was unsure if I d been wrong or alternatively how he would still pull off the reveal  Either way I found the way that he did this not so ridiculously unreal as I imagined it would have to be  The book itself I thought was well written and I was impressed that the main subject of the story was never once the narrator to the book  The letter was the closest we got to having a first hand account from him and I think many writers would struggle to do this without the book seeming distant and the way that Stevenson manages it while still engrossing you in the story is fantastic  Back to the length of the book I also admire how Stevenson put so much into so little space without the feeling that is similar with other books of that length where you feel the end of the book is actually missing  and feel rather disappointed such as the case with H G Wells   The Time Machine  All in all a job well done and the tyle of  classic  undoubtedly earned  Robert Louis Stevenson wrote with a flourished prose  while keeping a very fast narrative pace  and his short stories are very good displays of his style  My copy of the book had 3 short stories  gothic tales  I think they may be called   The Body Snatcher    Olalla   and  Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde   These were written within a two year time frame  and while sharing stylistic aspects  they vary in theme  and seem to display an evolution of style  The body Snatcher   a very short story involving two medical students and a shady business of buying bodies for medical study  It is a very involving tale  that  while predictable  still manages to convey a very eerie feel  Olalla  is more extensive  and explores the theme of hereditary traits  through the tale of a soldier that  at the advice of his doctor  recovers his health resting in a lonely house in the mountains  shared with the three strange members of a once noble family fallen from grace I found this story to be very contemplative  and with a fairly anti climatic ending  The ideas are there  but none as powerful or as well presented as in    Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde The one I was truly eager to read is a riveting story concerning the duality of the human spirit  and the idea that the side that we choose to exercise the most will be the one that will surface more often Famous and many times adapted  it is still a fresh and exciting read  with strong pacing and characters  and a well though out and reflective narrative structure  that provides us with the account of characters  even after they have died without ever abandoning Mr  Utterson  Dr  Jekyll s lawyer and old friend I was very happy that the edition I own chose to include all 3 short stories  as they show a growth of style  that culminates in a strange case I won t soon forget 5 red stars Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a short story written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886 This short story is one of the most popular books written by Stevenson The story deals with a character called Mr  Jekyll  a doctor who lives in London and other secondary characters such as Mister Utterson  Mister Utterson s cousin  Richard Enfield and Poole  Dr Jekyll s domestic  The story takes place during the 19th century in London  The narrator his unknown but the story is all about Mr  Utterson s perception and investigation on the case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde But it is not that simple another  character  is also referred to in the short story but in fact this character is nothing but Dr Jekyll s double  this creature is created by Dr Jekyll himself  he invented a potion to separate his soul into two parts  a devilish part and a good part but he managed to separate his soul but he also managed to create another  himself  who is called Mr Hyde This Mr  Hyde is the worst part of Dr Jekyll  he is described as being very ugly  bad and awful  During the short story  he commits several crimes What is interesting about this character is that he is very endearing even though he is an awful creature  because the reader knows that it is a part of Dr Jekyll and that he doesn t really control what he does and we feel sorry for him and for his situation  In the short story there is a real fight between these two individuality who are constantly misunderstanding each other  There is a conflict between good and evil  This short story is more than a normal horror story in which there is a creature that terrifies people because here the creature is also the saviour  and more than that this short story can be interpreted in a philosophical and psychological way  Indeed there is a real question here  What am I really  Am I a good person or not  And it also raises the question of Dissociative identity disorder which is completely involved here This book is really disturbing since we do not know a lot of things on what the two main characters think   especially Mr Hyde   we only know what he looks like but not what he thinks and why he does all those misdeeds  But it is a great thing because it creates suspense and mystery  we are not forced to know everything and it is what makes the reader to continue his reading in my opinion  Mystery is the key for a good book and in that case  Stevenson knows how to use it  it creates a nice atmosphere all along the story  indeed there is a huge mystery in Stevenson s short story which gives the reader the envy to read the story completely Personally I loved that book because of the characters and the setting  I completely entered in Stevenson s world and in this past London  and I found the psychology of the characters really interesting   but I found this book a bit too short and I would have wanted to learn more about Dr Jekyll s double and his perception  I was very disappointed when reading the last chapter   less   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Even if we have not read Robert Louis Stevenson s novella   The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde   most of us are familiar with the concept    a Jekyll and Hyde personality  The concept connotes a rare mental condition of a  split personality   where within the same person there are two distinct personalities  The novella s impact is such that it has become a part of the language  with the phrase  Jekyll and Hyde  coming to mean a person who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next  In Doctor Jekyll s case the two personalities are apparently good and evil  with completely opposite levels of morality  Written in 1886  it was an immediate success  and is one of Stevenson s best selling works  Stage adaptations began in Boston and London within a year of its publication and it has gone on to inspire scores of major film  television and stage performances  Wiki The tale is well known  Aimiable Doctor Jekyll  invents a potion  which transforms him into the brutish Mr Hyde  There is another potion that changes him back to Doctor Jekyll  In the persona of Mr Hyde  he commits the sort of atrocities that nightmares are made of  But the transformation becomes involuntary  and Doctor Jekyll is unable to reverse it because he has run out of the original batch of the powders   The brute that slept within me  is now in control  When he falls asleep as Jekyll  he wakes as Mr Hyde  Could the character of Hyde irrevocably take over  Concerned that he had overstepped his bounds  Jekyll chooses to give up the freedom of Hyde and for two months maintains the identity of Doctor Jekyll  But he is tortured with Hyde s longing to freely take part in evil doings  and he once again he takes the potion  During this transformation  Hyde commits murder  There is a manhunt for Hyde  and Doctor Jekyll vows never again to make the transformation  He sets out to try to remedy the evil inside him  But he has given too much power to his evil side  Hyde is an irrevocable part of Jekyll s character  and the many transformations and evil behaviors have only strengthened his power  One night  while contemplating Hyde s deeds  Jekyll spontaneously transformed into Edward Hyde  Finally  Hyde kills himself  thus finally releasing both Jekyll and Hyde Stevenson never says exactly what Hyde takes pleasure in on his nightly forays  generally saying that it is something of an evil and lustful nature  so Stevenson is writing within the context of the times  Whatever Hyde has done  it is abhorrent to Victorian religious morality  Stevenson had to take into account Victorian sensibilities  Hyde may have been reveling in activities that were not appropriate to a man of Jekyll s stature  such as engaging with prostitutes or burglary  However  it is Hyde s violent activities that seem to give him the most thrill  driving him to attack and murder Sir Danvers Carew without apparent reason  making him a hunted outlaw throughout England I think that if it were written today  Mr Hyde would be a counterpart to someone like Josef Fritzl  We wouldn t be talking in veiled terms of evil and lust  We would be talking explicitly about rape  sodomy  torture  incest  bestiality  necrophilia  We d be thinking about stuff that even Hannibal Lector couldn t dream up  But I think that Stevenson s novella is all the more compelling  because of what he doesn t say  Our own imaginations are more powerful than anything that can be written down http   en wikipedia org wiki Fritzl_case Realizing he will soon be Hyde forever  Jekyll leaves behind a testament  pointing out that while Jekyll often felt like a charlatan  Hyde felt like a  genuine man  years younger and far more energetic than his more  sociable  self  He also states in his final confession that although Hyde knew people recoiled from him  he  Jekyll  did not  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde   pre empts Freudian psychoanalysis  As far as I can ascertain  Sigmund Freud was not talking about the Id  the Ego and the Super Ego  before 1899  when he published  The Interpretation of Dreams   As I said earlier  Stevenson published his book in 1886  So  Stevenson was talking about repression  and the return of the repressed and demonstrating the concept through his characters  before Freud had even thought of it  Although the reader of Jekyll and Hyde is led to believe that the threat of evil comes  as in earlier Gothic stories  from without  it is actually within the breast of the good and kind Jekyll that the danger lurks  Perhaps Stevenson himself  was afraid of what he had unleashed in his creation  Mr Hyde It is a creepy tale  It has been a long time since I read it  but whenever I think about Stevenson s novella  I think about the CI programmes on Sky  that I am addicted to  Sky even has  Serial Killer Sunday   I watch programmes about Ted Bundy  Ian Brady and Myra Hindley  It seems that serial killers  really cannot stop killing  And neither can Mr Hyde  Stevenson s creation  revels in the choking ashes of the dark and primal I think of Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita   where the monstrous Humbert Humbert  the handsome academic  who hides his paedophilia so well  constantly insists     I am not a monster   Is there a monster lurking beneath the surface in all of us  When I think about some of the weird stuff that I think about  that I write about in my fiction  I sometimes think    where the hell did that come from The only honest answer that I can give is    I don t know    The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde   was initially sold as a paperback for one shilling in the UK and one dollar in the U S  The American publisher issued the book on 5 January 1886  four days before the first appearance of the UK edition issued by Longmans  Scribner s published 3000 copies  only 1250 of them bound in cloth  Initially stores would not stock it until a review appeared in The Times  on 25 January 1886  giving it a favourable reception  Within the next six months  close to forty thousand copies were sold  The book s success was probably due more to the  moral instincts of the public  than any perception of its artistic merits  it was widely read by those who never otherwise read fiction  quoted in pulpit sermonsand in religious papers  By 1901 it was estimated to have sold over 250 000 copies   Wiki This is a classic short story  that even if you haven t read the story  you will be familiar with the case of Dr Jekyll and his alter ego Mr Hyde  I wasn t sure whether I would like this story  as I m not normally to keen on the archaic language  that was used in this era  I was pleasantly surprised by this novel  as I really enjoyed it  and found the language didn t reduce my enjoyment of the plot at all The novel itself is very eerie  especially when our main character is trying to discover what has become of Dr  Jekyll  Robert Louis Stevenson did a really good job of building the tension throughout the story so by the end  you are nervous about the outcome  The plot is written like a mystery story  with the main question being what has happened to Dr Jekyll  Unfortunately most people know the plot of this story  so the mystery aspect of the story is lost a little The characters in this story were really good  they were developed nicely by the author  even though it was a relatively short story  The main character in the story is Dr Jekyll who is a very clever scientist who creates a potion which allows his inner persona  his bad side  if you will  to take over his thoughts and his body  The story is told from a 3rd person point of view  and we as the reader follow another character s story  Dr Lanyon  He is the man Dr Jekyll eventually trusts with his secret  Dr Lanyon is a good character  who is your typical gentleman  caring about others  brave and level headed I really enjoyed the end of the story  even if it was a little confusing  The story ended with a letter written by Dr  Jekyll describing exactly what happened and basically solving the mystery of the stroy  I thought this was a very clever way to end it  as it answered all questions and tied up all loose ends in a nice concise way Overall I absolutely loved this novel  and I think it s one of my favourite classics that I ve read  I gave this 5 5 stars and I highly recommend that you read this  as it is short  but is definitely worth it  Like other reviewers  my knowledge of this story was from Sylvester and Tweety  In some of my other readings I discovered that the story is meant to be a commentary about human nature  and that it is  I found the Easton Press version of this book at a used bookstore and got it What surprised me about the story is that it is written more like a mystery  The story unfolds from the point of view of Dr  Jekyll s lawyer  A certain Mr  Hyde is loose about town  committing cruel crimes  and for some unfathomable reason Dr  Jekyll includes him as his sole heir in his will  The more our protagonist tries to dissuade Dr  Jekyll and to understand what is happening  the stranger the case becomes  It s not until the end when Jekyll s lab notes are discovered that he  and you  understand the truth You probably already know how it ends  so the beginning and lead up will be the surprise  And  just in case you don t  I won t say more  The idea of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is deeply ingrained into our culture  but Stevenson s message behind the story deserves to be more well known  This is one of those favorites of which it seems everyone knows the story even though they may only have seen one of the film adaptations of the original book  It is their loss for the book is a minor masterpiece and the best offerings of Hollywood  my favorite is the 1941 version with Spencer Tracy but Frederic March  1931  is a close second  wander far from the text of the book  particularly with the addition of a love interest for the good Dr  Jekyll that just is not there  That aside  the book is high Victorian speculation about the nature of evil and man s ability to create life or at least modify it  It reminds me of Well s The Island of Dr  Moreau  published a decade later  except Stevenson is a bit more of a romantic  It also provides an example for the theories of Dr  Freud  who was not on the scene when Stevenson was creating his short novel  There are many explanations for the dual personalities presented by Stevenson  I like to think of it as a variation of the doppelganger literature of which Poe s William Wilson and Dostoevsky s The Double are classic examples  Stevenson s story and character has entered our literary mind and vocabulary and was popular from the beginning with good reason  It is a great read  Dr  Jekyl and Mr  Hyde is truly a classic  Robert Louis Stevenson  the author  writes about the duality everyone faces in life  good and evil  and how one man  Dr  Jekyl  cannot deal with his evil temptations so he invents a way to live another life and get out all his evil ambitions  The last chapter of this book summarizes all of Stevenson s ideas about escaping one s  evil half   The last chapter is a narrative by Dr  Jekyl about his explanation to his reasons of taking the drug and what results because of it  At first Jekyl feels amazing  having a new life and no responsibilities  he lets Hyde run wild  but after a while he realizes that he can no longer control Hyde  or return to his former self  and that is what I love about this book  the realization that when Jekyl was taking the drug all that was changing was his appearance  not his personality  Jekyl said himself that he always lived with his evil ambitions  so who s to say all the drug did was change Jekyl s appearance   Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is about two men  actually  one man  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde are main characters  In this book  it is hard to tell the main character is one or two  because Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is same person  Dr  Jekyll makes strange medicine to become Mr  Hyde  who is evil  And he expresses what is really inside his mind While reading this book  I made a text to world connection  I heard about a woman who is just like Dr  Jekyll  The woman was a nanny and she worked for 15years  So  the baby s parents believed her  However  when she was with baby  she kicked  threw and hit the baby  The parents saw that through an observation camera and called the police  This evil nanny had evil inside like Dr  Jekyll I would definitely give this book 5stars  It s really great  It s a masterpiece  It describes the pain and poisoning of Dr  Jekyll very well  Why he can t stop and his ecstasy when he is Hyde  I want to recommend this book to anyone who likes horror and mystery  I loved this book  The dichotomy of Jekyll and Hyde and good and evil was very well done  It was also interesting to watch Hyde gain power the more he was released  kind of like a muscle you can exercise  You can read a million other reviews about the literary importance and success of this book with much better analysis than I feel like doing right now  so suffice it to say  I had a lot of fun reading this book  It was interesting  well paced  and if you like this genre of books I would definitely give this one a go    This book is scary and entertaining all at the same time it s called Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson  I liked how the story was always so intense and how they always would keep it interesting so the reader would want to find out what would happen next  I also like it how he had to stay as Mr  Hyde because the original drug that changed him into Mr  Hyde could t change him back to himself again  I recommend this book for any Science fiction book lover   I cannot believe what a low rating this book has  If you love dark thrilling mystery  this book is the one to start with Well  it just blew my mind I had heard the story  maybe seen a movie version or two and had seen the British mini series Jekyll with the brilliant James Nesbitt  So   when I got into this  I was in the perfect frame of mind  I WANTED the original and I got every little bit of it injected right into my veins The story is dark and desperate  just what I need  Oh how desperate is the main character  The main character makes me feel sorry for him  poor guy  I don t know if it s what Stevenson intended but I do feel he wanted to explain Mr  Hyde in some way  I knew what would happen at the end  but oh man  I didn t want that to happen to him  I wanted him to somehow make it all better and recover The story unfolds beautifully  it flows like a river of blood and I think it ends right where it s meant to  Dramatic and moving  All at the same time  george orwell in hayvan ciftligi gibi olmus  yazari stevenson biraz daha yasasaymis bir 1984 cikarabilirmis ayni konudan  erken olmus malesef  cok zevk alarak ve hayranlik duyarak okudum kitabi  dr jekyll ve hyde birbirinden uzaklastikca diyalektigi dusundum  birinin var olmasi icin oburunun de var olmasi sart  bu iki butunlesik yapiyi birbirinden ayirmaya calismis yazar ki aslinda psikolojik degil felsefik bir yapit olmus  keske daha yasasaydi da bu konunun 1984unu okuyabilseydik  A true classic  much better than Frankenstien by Shelley for me  A much more fluent style which I think was made possible by this being  just  a short story  I do wish I didnt know the tale of Jekyll and Hyde and could read the story blind so to speak and experience the reveal first hand  A lot has been said about the meaning  for me it is just as it says  the classic victorian rebellion against that repressive and judgemental society  releasing the beast in all of us   So I have known this story for many years and have always been a fan of the various film versions but  for some reason  I had never actually read the book version  So I m proud to say that I ve finally read it   and loved it  For some reason  this version was so much better than all of the other versions  That s probably because of the last chapter  the one where Jekyll explained everything  To hear it in his own words   the account of his transformations  of looking in the mirror and finding that it wasn t his face starting back  of finding that there were two sides of him and he could no longer control his evil desires   it was a mixture of pure beauty and pure horror  This story is utterly brilliant  No wonder it has stood the test of time  It s no wonder it s one of the best known tales of our day or one of the most adapted stories  It s because it s brilliant  beautiful and frightening   all rolled into one neat little package  What more could you want  El final es tan conocido  que es dificil interesarse demasiado por el misterio planteado por el libro  Sin embargo  es excelente  Por eso se sigue reinterpretando una y otra vez  y la historia sigue tan vigente como cuando se publico  Los temas son profundos y la reflexion duradera  La dualidad del hombre  el encuentro con nuestra  sombra   Lo recomiendo muchisimo  El lenguaje es un poco pasado de moda  pero es de esperarse para una obra del periodo romantico  It s been so long since I ve read this that I d forgotten an important part of the story  Jekyll was not trying to sublimate his baser desires    but to free himself from remorse  As a result    he loosed his own inner demon to do as he pleased without conscience    but failed to release the corresponding force for good he believed to reside in every man This is one of the two major Victorian novels of vice and repression  The other is  The Picture of Dorian Grey  I try to imagine what it would be like to read this book without knowing the story  It s become such a known thing  an iconic cultural reference and sadly that makes it hard to read it properly  Trying to imagine not knowing  and world in which Jekyll and Hyde would not be assumed to be the same person  is worth the effort  Is a classic  wonderfully written  that has contributed to our collective narrative of the human psyche This is a book from the end of the 1800s  a period of huge literary disquiet that created a great mny of the uncomfortable classics  Why that period was so fertile for troubled minds  I don t know  There was a kind of fatalistic  millnial attitude in response to the end of the century  and it may be that looking bck  patterns emerge that exist only for the retrospective look  But if you are interested in the history of horror and the emergence of this genre  don t just read Jekyll and Hyde  look at the contex in which it emerged  In the world of literature  there are many books that can capture its lector in a way that he enters this unwonted world and lives the wonderful situations that are being presented  And  without any doubt  one of these books is  The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde   A book in which you will be able to see the person itself and its duality  its two sides  good and evil  and its equilibrium between them  A book that tells the story of two men who are completely opposite  but however  try to coexist and a book that  even is fictional  you will be able to relate to your daily life  A book that has many positive things to offer you  such as its ability to spark curiosity so that it will keep you interested and its creative storyline  But that  on the other hand  will be a little bit confusing because of its language  However  it is a fiction I m pretty sure you will love as much as I do and that  once you start reading  you won t be able to stop  Hacia tiempo que tenia intencion de leer esta historia  Es un tema que siempre me ha atraido y que no me he atrevido a conseguir por si me daba miedo  Ahora que por fin lo tengo  he descubierto que es facil de leer por su extension  apenas supera las 100 paginas  A pesar de las altas expectativas  le doy mi nota mas alta porque he terminado de leer igual de ilusionada o mas de lo que empece Un clasico digno de leer y que es muy recomendable As the phrase goes   often imitated  but never bettered   I love the language  the atmosphere  the pioneering themes  People need to understand that  at that time  this book was both controversial and earth shattering  We are lucky now  in that we have a century of writing that has been built upon works like this  but even the best examples of human dualism stand on the shoulders of   and could not exist without   books like this  Grateful  Totalmente ame este libro  Dios mio  Lei este libro en verano y lo re lei casualmente como obra de plan lector para el colegio  bueno  este libro es lo mas de lo mas  es decir  ya se sospechaba como era la trama y todo eso  mas en como la forma en como Dr jekyll y Mr hyde se desenvuelven a lo largo de la obra  increible  Y no podia creer esto  pero este libro me hizo preguntarme    Como seria yo en la parte mas profunda de mi alma   O Estranho caso do Dr  Jekyll e Mr  HydeEsta e a historia de um medico  o Dr  Jekyll e que mantem uma misteriosa relacao de amizade com um homem de caracter duvidoso  o Sr  Hyde  sendo que e narrada por um advogado amigo do Dr  Jekyll  Utterson  o advogado  fica bastante preocupado com esta relacao e tenta sempre dissuadir o Dr  Jekyll a terminar esta amizade Este era outro conto que andava ha anos para ler e finalmente peguei nele Tem um ritmo um pouco lento  em que a historia gira em torno do misterio sobre  quem e o Sr  Hyde e como e que tem tanta influencia sobre o Dr  Jekyll   Mas estas questoes so sao reveladas na parte final da historia  mas apesar de tudo nao torna o conto chato  e permite nos questionar sobre a dualidade humana  e em como todos nos temos um lado bom e um lado mau Gostei bastante deste conto  e mesmo tendo um ritmo mais lento  sentimos sempre um clima misterioso ao lado de toda a historia  This book was a lot more exciting than I thought  It first interested me when I watched John Barrymore s silent film interpretation of the book  so I decided I wanted to compare the book with the movie  see which I liked more  et cetera   I wasn t expecting much  and went into the book halfheartedly  What I found  though  was an intriguing tale of well developed characters  It had everything I enjoy in a book  pain  angst  science    Even a bit of a mystery  though I already knew that Jekyll and Hyde were one and the same   But what I really liked in this book was the ending  I love it how Robert Louis Stevenson ended with Dr  Jekyll s point of view  The whole last chapter was very sad  poetic  even  And that s what I really like in a book  a good ending  So hats off to Robert Louis Stevenson  for being able to finish writing this entire book in three days  but not lower the quality of his writing in the slightest   While some of the shock and thrill is lost because the idea of Jekyll and Hyde is so prevalent in culture  the novel still delivers an impossible to put down telling of the classic story  The novel is very scant on details using memories from disturbed witnesses to tell the acts of Hyde  However  it adds to the suspense and possibilities of the outcomes because so much is left up to imagination  The story is also told as a detective story from the perspective of a lawyer trying to figure out why Hyde has such an influence over Dr  Jekyll  The novel ends with two explanatory notes telling the connection between Jekyll and Hyde  After reading this  many aspects of the Jekyll and Hyde idea prevalent in modern culture have been changed since through time and multiple retelling the idea has been changed  I only wish that I could have been able to experience the shock that original readers got from the big reveal at the end  It was an excellent book  Some people think that Mr  Hyde was as alter ego of Dr  Jekyll  and if you analyze the book carefully you can understand that perspective  If you are familiar with Freud s theory  you might say that Mr  Hyde was Jekyll s true self but in a much primitive nature or his Id  Overall the book was great from cover to cover  I would recommend to a friend and I would most definitely read it again  There is something that Robert Lewis Stevenson does that makes you feel like a child when reading his work  at least I feel that way   and I do not mean that in any bad way  it is as if you are being told a story by a grandparent you admire  you can not turn away I read Treasure Island about two or three years ago and felt like I was ten years old  with Dr Jekyll   Mr Hyde it is also similar  One thing is for sure though  the language used in this story is truly beautiful it tends to pull you in  almost made me miss my train stop This story has been recreated into many films yet none that I have seen actually followed the story properly  all of then simply ignored Mr Utterson who is actually the main hero in this story This story is better than many of the books I have read  its a fast read since it is a short story  around eighty pages  plus you will not wish to stop reading so the time will fly  I hadn t read this classic until this past week  and one of the only reasons why I read it was because Whitley gave me the equivalent of a class set  I might teach it  This novella quickly has become one of my favorite stories  Far from simply a horror story  Stevenson delves into pretty heavy duty issues of psychology and modern science  The story unfolds as a whodunnit of sorts  with Mr  Utterson  a lawyer  trying to figure out the reason for a troublesome will written by one of his friends  Dr  Jekyll  As Utterson begins to research the matter  he begins to make some sinister connections between Dr  Jekyll and a certain Mr  Hyde  a devilish man that is terrorizing London  You probably already know the story  However  if you haven t read the book  it s an extremely well crafted tale told through a series of short stories and letters  It s also quite short  so you can read it quickly  Highly recommended  I ve known the story of Jekyl and Hyde since I was a little girl watching Bugs Bunny do spoofs on the novel  I finally got around to reading the book  I have to admit that a lot of the book seemed anti climactic since I knew the secret of the story before I ever picked up the book  But it was still a great read because of the issues about humanity and our duality that it brought up Sometime we re good  sometimes we re evil  What if we could separate those two beings  Even Star Trek had to do an episode exploring that issue Is there a part of us that wants to be bad  How much of our goodness is for show I couldn t help but wonder if Stevenson got the idea for this story by watching people with drug or alcohol problems  since those substances seem to bring out the worst in humanity Anyway  any book that can make us as a society examine ourselves the way this book has  deserves five stars  O livro  O medico e o Monstro   no original ingles  The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde      Ja ha muito que conhecia a historia mas nao tinha ainda lido a obra  Nao defraudou as expectativas Trata se de um romance escrito pelo autor escoces Robert Louis Stevenson e publicado originalmente em 1886  O personagem principal e um advogado londrino chamado Gabriel John Utterson  que investiga estranhas coincidencias entre o seu velho amigo  Dr  Henry Jekyll  e o misterioso Edward Hyde A obra e conhecida por ser uma alegoria do fenomeno de multiplas personalidades  no sentido que dentro da mesma pessoa existe tanto uma personalidade boa quanto ma  ambas muito distintas uma da outra  O impacto do romance foi tal que se tornou parte do jargao ingles  com a frase  Jekyll and Hyde  usada para se referir a uma pessoa que age de forma moralmente diferente dependendo da situacao E conhecemos tanta gente assim    Ooohh  I love this portrayal of the psychological split that happens when a person tries to block  ignore  compensate for  or numb out the parts of himself that he is ashamed of  The impossibility of  faking it   It s so true  I see this self destructive pattern  and yet the culture I live in buys into it  Thank you Stevenson  for this depiction How much better to acknowledge the Hyde inside of ourselves  see it  admit it  a little Brene Brown here  being vulnerable and admitting weakness in order to eliminate shame   and then authentically resolve it or learn how to live with it  so that when we finally become the person we want to be  we are whole  nothing split off  Yes  we aren t the impeccable Dr  Jekyl  and yes  in my experience the world sees us as weak or flawed  But we are free and we are whole and we are real  And  I guess  we don t have the fear of losing ourselves to the things we are hiding from  I was initially surprised by the direction of the story  telling the circumstances through the eyes of Dr Jekylls friend rather than through the main character himself  It worked extremely well  bringing the reveal as a big twist that s superbly delivered  The last chapter is where the magician reveals his tricks  as we discover Jekylls motivations and his overall story  a tale that deserves it s status of being labelled a classic  I love this book  I m still so amazed by how good this book was that I m not able to put in words what is it that makes me love it so much  Not only the story was very creative and meaningful  but the charactes and the way the tale developed were outstanding  I m enchanted with the way Dr  Jeckyll portraits human s duality    I guess I just love how wicked he was and how liberated Mr  Hyde made him feel  The shortest book I have read for a very long time  but also one of the most meaningful pieces of fiction I have read in ages  I place this alongside books like Wells  Invisible Man and The Time Machine  as well as Shelley s Frankenstein  all novels that speak to the human condition and interrogates it as to what it truly means  the existence of limits  if they should be tested  pushed against or contravened  and the fallout of stepping over the threshold of permissible humanity  If anyone of us hasn t  at one time or another  or at one level or another considered the question  what if we could do anything sans consequences  They are liars  plain and simple  We only need to look around and see what a fragile and hypocritical facade being civilised is  Morality and conscience are such ephemerally powerful constructs that cage and empower us  do we control it  or does it control us   It isn t just that Jekyll and Hyde are so well rounded and interesting  or that the suspense keeps you going even though everyone knows how this ends by now  To me  it s Mr  Utterson and what a fine and respectable sir he is I m guilty of easily relating to people  or just characters  I ll leave it undecided  and Mr Utterson is the one I went for this time  I won t spend paragraphs indulging myself  instead I ll just say this book had me from page one  when I realised that I too  like Mr  Utterson   incline to Cain s heresy  I let my brother go to the devil in his own way   I remember having this book read to me in elementary school  My teacher would read on and I remember watching the computer sleeping screen that traveled along a maze  One of those 90s screen savers  That s what the story looks like  still  It s really interesting to finally read a story where the twist has been revealed to us since childhood  I can see the Victorians freaking out  though   Like many  I was familiar with this book because of the common Jekyll Hyde motif in pop culture  But actually reading the story blew me away  It is so much more complex and nuanced than I previously imagined  with Stevenson doing some heavy reflecting upon the dualities of good evil and persona  The story itself is gripping and quite chilling as well  This is both an effective and enjoyable read   The last time I read STRANGE CASE OF DR  JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE the true title  was when I was very much younger  I liked it well enough  but my favorite Stevenson work was  and still is TREASURE ISLAND  It had everything a young boy liked  Pirates  adventure  and pirates Still this was a good one  From a much older adult perspective  I find I enjoyed this classic a bit more than way back then One of the most adapted works  whatever the medium  of all time  none I ve ever seen was close to the book  You know the story  Man delves into areas best left alone and pays the ultimate price  being caught up in the evil desires of his Edward Hyde persona  a creature freed of all moral compass  Jekyll is usually portrayed as a young man with hubris that gets his comeuppance in the end  In the book  I hadn t remembered  Jekyll is an older man If you haven t read this one  recommended   It took me more or less 3hours to finish this book   ofcourse  midnigt nosh and bathroom breaks included   At exactly 1 15 in the morning  I came to the end of the book filled with satisfaction i never half expected  I loved the gothic and mystery blend of this book  the reason why I never stop reading  and finished it in just a short period time  aside from the fact that this is a really thin book  It actually gave me chills  y know  I imagined every dark scenery of the story  the creepiness of people s weird mystery  the gothic horror   everything   The story has more than a typical horror mystery fiction we usually read  there s more than that  The story actually gives a nice portrayal of the person s good and evil side we usually encountered in our everyday life  which gives a wide texture to the story  Read this book if you haven t read this one out  I tell you  it s worth reading   This was the shocking thing  that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices  that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned  that what was dead and had no shape should usurp the offices of life     that this insurgent horror was knit closer to him than a wife  closer than an eye lay caged in his flesh  where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born    Well played Bob  I read this book in 7th grade  It was dark  dark  dark  yet intriguing  It challenged the mind of a 12 year old girl  which I appreciated  At that age I came across a few dry parts that forced me to stop reading  Eventually  though  I picked it back up and finished it  It makes me wonder how I would feel about it now that I m older  I liked it then  who s to say I won t like it now     La premiere version de Dr  Jekyll et Mr  Hyde terrifia son propre auteur  et son epouse  surtout   Plus long  sans doute  et partiellement autocensure  ecrit en un seul jet et sur trois jours  le texte definitif conserve neanmoins toute la force du reve qui l a suscite  Dedoublement de la personnalite  retour du refoule  instinct de mort  la psychanalyse etait encore dans les limbes quand ce fils de clergyman ecossais  en 1885  explorait les profondeurs du psychisme avec une audace inouie  Car il en fallait de l audace  a cette epoque de puritanisme triomphant  pour dissequer ainsi nos pulsions les plus obscures  Erige au statut de mythe  maintes fois porte a l ecran  simplifie et trahi  Dr  Jekyll exige une relecture attentive   alors se decouvre une oeuvre rigoureuse et inspiree  d une richesse de pensee et d une modernite absolues  There is more to the story of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde that we know as just some cartoon a  man transcending into a  monstrous creature after a  drinking some potion    but Its a very different well play scripted and wonderfully written book after all That runs mostly around Utterson the lawyer and all which i dint expect    To me its not a disappointment but only a suspense well preserved over time as it presents with new possibilities to stream our imagination on  This book is truly a classic yet a novelty The duality of a person the shades and contrasts of human nature and all the so so semantics of this book shall need no review from me As it is a benchmark of the same The book is remarkably short and can be read within few hours but I recommend reading it slowly over night and to enjoy the full comprehension of the work that hides between those lines  Ich habe dieses Buch von einer Freundin zum Geburtstag bekommen und fur mich gehort es zu den besten Geschichten aus dieser Epoche und sowieso aller Zeiten Es gibt Bucher  in denen der Hauptcharakter  die meiste Zeit ohnmachtig irgendwo liegt  Dieses Buch ist spannend  mitreissend und nervenaufreibend  Jedem zu empfehlen der es Spannend und gruselig mag   Although most people know the basics of the story  it s another thing to read it for yourself The plot develops through conversations and letters  and it s only at the end that the  strange case  is revealed My son had to read this for high school  and it will seen pretty tame to a high schooler whose usual reading material is more active  and has a great deal of vocabulary to which they are not accustomed Still   great story and I m very glad I ve finally read this book  To think it s by the same author as A Child s Garden of Verses  Okay  this is a BIT of a spoiler  but I knew this when I read the book  and it was just as exciting  This book is about a man who discovers how to switch from his evil self to his good one  purposefully  It is Gothic  creepy and mysterious   and very exciting  It is only about 100 pages long  and so the suspense is kept up through the entire book until the end  Stevenson s language is very chilling  This quote gives you a great sense of the style that the whole story is written in  they heard a  dismal screech  as of mere animal terror    61   I give this book a thumbs up because it is an interesting mystery  just creepy enough  Stevenson knows how to keep us on our toes  and make the story continue to be interesting with different perspectives on the same topic of what defines good vs  evil  as well as just adding some good old action   Cam singura lucrare a lui Robert Louis Stevenson pe care am reusit sa o citesc pana in prezent  insa  spre marea mea surpridere  prima nuvela citita care a reusit sa mi trezeasca un interes foarte intens fata de un personaj  sau mai bine spus de laturile si sentimentele sale care se divid  reusind sa ia nastere un alt personaj  o alta creatura  o alta personalitate  un nou temperament si un nou caracter  toate acestea intr un singur individ  Jekyll si Hyde par a fi o balanta in cadrul careia echilibrul sufera modificari drastice  Bun Rau  Pozitiv Negativ  Frumos Urat  Miracol Dezastru  acestea sunt relatiile care definesc ideea centrata de autor  E uimitor sa observi cum ele se despart  impartind totusi acelasi spatiu  Dupa parerea mea aici ia nastere o simbioza  astfel incat binele si raul nu pot exista decat unul in prezenta altuia    My devil had been long caged  he came out roaring    love that line Classic tale about the good and evil inherent in all of us  In a religious sense  can be seen as an allegory for the natural man  I love Stevenson s writing style  A few favorite passages   I sat in the sun on a bench  the animal within me licking the chops of memory  the spiritual side a little drowsed  promising subsequent penitence  but not yet moved to begin   It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous fagots were thus bound together that in the agonized womb of consciousness  these polar twins should be continuously struggling  How  then  were they dissociated  The face of a man who was without bowels of mercy  All human beings as we meet them are commingled out of good and evil  and Edward Hyde  alone in the ranks of mankind  was pure evil   The execution of everything in this book is phenomenal  I am especially floored with the way he shakes up the language  one minute it seems like we re reading a case file  business like and blunt  but when it comes to the darker supernatural parts of the narrative he uses rich  evocative  and poetic descriptions to drive the point home  That by far is my favorite example of duality in this book  RLS is a beast  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It was such a unique idea at the time and it is definitely presented in a unique way which is great  The idea behind The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde very scary  even more so because of my knowledge of Multiple Personality Disorder or Split Personality Disorder  This is a book I will read over and over   a year has passed since I read this book yet I still applaud Mr Stevenson  whilst it was initially spine tingling this was a book that grew from beyond the pages finished in a single day  it definitely made me forget the ongoings of my own life  submerging me within the life s  of Dr Jekyll   I can only feebly imagine how his  transformation  occurred   however in my mind it was an unsightly affair   it definitely is one of those books that  as the plot develops  the penny drops  an understanding of the reasoning behind previous pages floods you  the philosophical conclusion that the book implores isn t one that highly resonates with me currently  I must admit  however  I am grateful for the perspective as it could fuel modes of analysis all in all  this is a book that is ridiculously consistent and plentiful in imagination  This was a fantastic book for being so short  While I think it would be more effective as a horror story if one were unfamiliar with the plot prior to reading it  I understand that this would be really difficult given its fame and cultural pervasiveness  Regardless  the ending few chapters are incredible and chilling  and I was surprised to find that I was totally naive to some of the deeper details of the story  The theme of the dual nature of man is one of my favorite themes  and this book pulls it off flawlessly  The imagery itself has been stuck in my mind since finishing the story and I will certainly look into some of Stevenson s other works  I m so pleased when a classic exceeds my expectations  as this one did  I enjoyed that the original version of Hyde is different from what I thought he was from popular media  This is a great picture of the effect of temptation to do evil  casting off of inhibitions  and self indulgence  and how they lead to disastrous consequences for the individual and those around them  A short and rich story  well worth checking out  A perfect read around Halloween  It provokes introspection of one s other self  or selves as the case may be  and how it can be that one mind can contain  influence  and embolden one reaction over another  By happenstance  I also recently saw the film  The Three Faces of Eve  which explores this topic as well  I highly recommend both  Absolutely loved this book  There s a flavor richness  and detail to some of these classics that I can t find in modern novels  Leaves me feeling nostalgic  as I read many of the classics in my youth  This book is entertaining  creepy  and full of atmosphere  London fog  monsters     and science experiments gone wrong   amazing   I was pleasantly surprised upon reading this Classic  I loathe the writing styles of most of the Classic authors  I devoured this book within a day  and was left with the desire that the book be longer  The duality of Man is questioned and the book proves to be a warning against trying to  split  yourself into separate beings    Amazing  This book was a blast  Weighing in at just over an hour or so of reading it is fun  exciting and intensely thought provoking  The edition that I read  not the one here  had a fantastic essay at the close about the relationship between Jekyll and Hyde not being as simplistic as it would appear  Because much of the story is given by way of letters and accounts of the characters you must continually be asking if someone is hiding something  twisting something  or even lying  It was a great deal of fun  but deceptively complex  Oh  if you haven t read it  but just gotten information from popular cartoons and film versions  as I had  then throw away most of the notions that you know what the book is going to be about  Most of them did serious damage to the events  characters and the major themes in order to turn a quick buck   Este e um dos casos em que e uma pena sabermos tanto antes de ler o livro  Ao ja conhecermos a ligacao entre Jekyll e Hyde perdemos o misterio que lhe e inerente  ou seja  a tentativa de descobrir o que une o doutor respeitado Henry Jekyll a uma figura horripilante que da pelo nome de Edward Hyde  Nisto tive pena  gostava de ter experienciado ler o livro sem este conhecimento  tentar descobrir por mim o que se passava  mas nao foi nem sera a ultima vez que tal acontece  Felizmente a historia e solida e muito boa  nao vive apenas de uma descoberta  esta muito bem desenvolvida e a sua tematica e interessante  pois mais do que um misterio e um estudo sobre a dualidade do ser humano  em como uma pessoa e boa e ma ao mesmo tempo Mais em  http   alternative prison blogspot pt    Just read this for maybe the 8th time  this time with my Victorian Lit class  For such a short novel  a novella  really   it presents an incredibly comprehensive image of some of the central anxieties of Victorian culture It s not much like the various films made from it in violence  there are only two murders in the book vs  some of the veritable blood baths that occur in the films  But the insight into internal conflicts and struggles  especially considering the Victorian concerns with belief  keeping up middle class appearances  and science religion controversy  is eye opening One thing to keep in mind as you read is that the conflict is not between Jekyll the good and Hyde the evil  but between Hyde the all evil and Jekyll the good and evil  Also  be aware of the subtext of whether one is one s brother s keeper  I really really enjoyed this book  My favorite part had to be when Mr  Utterson found the letter that Dr  Jekyll had written to him about the events that had occurred with him connecting him with Mr  Hyde  It kinda helped me understand exactly what happened  My favorite character had to be Mr  Utterson  He was not like    Nosy but he was very intrigued to figure out what had happened and how it happened  I wish that Dr  Jekyll was alive to tell Utterson about what he wrote in his letter  I think it would have made it a little more interesting to see what Utterson s reaction to Jekyll s face  My   for the author is  was it meant for that everyone could separate themselves from their good side  to their evil side  Or was it just that Jekyll figured out a way to separate his good and evil side  I really enjoyed the book     Mia aristourgematike psukhographike kai ethographike noubela

scary  This was the first book in which I actually felt a bit scared  The author has such a great writing style that creates this atmosphere that has the reader expecting anything  Sometimes  nothing will  happen  and just when you think nothing is going to happen  the next big turn of events happen  This was an amazing book  A little old fashioned  but just as good  Definitely worth a read  Unlike many of the  monster  movies  this original book presents a solid and sensible tale of a doctor who wishes to remove the violent  hateful side of the human psyche and bring the good to the fore  Unfortunately he fails in this utterly and achieves the exact opposite  with predictable results  Although Doctor Jecyll s methods are certainly questionable and his continuing in the experiment even when murder and obvious failure results   one cannot fault his intentions or goals  Indeed  it is something many scientists have likely tried in real life with more or less success and failure   After all  aren t anti depressant  mood stabilizing and anti schizophrenia medicines a result of such endeavors   In my opinion not as good a book as Mary Shelly s Frankenstein  nevertheless a fine read and engrossing throughout  This was a fascinating book  It was filled with gothic atmosphere  as well as that distinctly British style of English that I love so much in Agatha Christie and Alexander McCall Smith  Stevenson is a bit more pessimistic about human nature than I am    when Jekyll s personality splits  it doesn t become an evil entity and a good entitiy  it becomes an evil entity and a human entity with good and evil tendencies that must be moderated by a conscience  so Stevenson seems to be saying there is no purely good side to human nature and I disagree with that  otherwise where did Jekyll s good tnedencies come from    The only thing I can think of that would have improved this story is if I hadn t known the outcome ahead of time  What an in your face ending this must have been before Jekyll and Hyde permeated the culture  Short and obviously old    Original and since much imitated   one would expect therefore to be a bit disappointed  Not a bit of it   tense  very dark and not quite the story in my head from film etc I really enjoyed it  Does show also what a great storyteller can convey in so few pages  A classic and quite right too  One of the most amazing things about Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is its length  Being able to read about one of the most well known monsters in literature in less than 100 pages is absolutely fantastic  The story is set in London during the early 19th century  Most of the story is told by an anonymous narrator from the point of view of Mr  Utterson  a well respected lawyer  The story is about a Scientist  Dr  Jekyll  who creates a potion to separate his good side from his evil side  This results in the creation of Mr  Hyde  a hideous alter ego of Dr  Jekyll who has no conscious and commits a slew of violent crimes  Suspicions about the relationship between Jekyll and Hyde grow as the story progresses  If you enjoyed this story then I would definitely recommend this  http   www youtube com watch v MiB4dM    I can see why this is a classic  Robert Louis Stevenson wrote this after being inspired by the true story of an Edinburgh man named Deacon Brody  a pious church goer and respectable man by day  and a criminal scoundrel by night  I wish I could go back in time before the ending was so well known  Comparing a person to  Jekyll and Hyde  is so common now that we miss a little of the mystery of this book  It must have been a really creepy read when you didn t know the outcome  Still  this is a great dark page turner  and the theological implications are interesting  When he drinks the elixir  he goes from being a mixture of good and evil to being solely evil  Although I don t know the author s religious tendencies  it s interesting that there s no way for a man to be solely good  Lots of fun to read  An obvious classic  Stevenson presents a familiar  allegorical tale of a divided personality  although  in this instance  he does so in the most literal sense  The author reveals the mystery surrounding Mr  Hyde  and even that of Dr  Jekyll  carefully and slowly  allowing the reader to piece together this  strange case  bit by bit in each ensuing chapter  The fact that Mr  Hyde appears so seldom in the narrative itself shrouds him in obscurity  compelling the reader to construct an image of the monster based significantly on one s imagination  An excellent read for any time of year  but I would recommend venturing through it near Halloween  when we are all a little more susceptible to fear and suspense  It is a quick yet fascinating read that will forever hold a reverent place on bookshelves everywhere  I first read Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde many years ago  but I don t really remember what I thought of it  This reading though I know that I loved it  It held me so spellbound that I would have read it in one sitting if I had been able  Great writing  intriguing story and awesome thoughts on the good and evil that can fight within a person  I will be rereading this story again sometime  Twisted and backwards  weaved storytelling  leaving one to piece the story with an underlying fact that need not be said  This is amazing  everyone should read it  It paints a picture of the things you wouldn t want to admit to yourself  showing it to the reader through the works of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   ClassicIn hearing about this classic story in movies and stories to finally read the original  what I can tell you is what you think this story holds is partly true but you must read this book to understand the true struggle of a man attempting to re gain control of the human psyche and an uninhibited moral I ve never read this before  but when I saw that it was fairly short  I thought I d give it a go  It wasn t quite the story that I expected  I always envisioned Hyde as some huge monster that roamed the streets of London  This story was more about the good and evil that we all have inside of us  As Jekyll gave access to the evil  it become more and more a part of him  which is probably true for all of us   I have been aware of the idea of Jekyll and Hyde  the two faced aspect of it  but I didn t know the actual story  I wasn t actually aware the source material was so short  and it was a surprise to be able to get through it so quickly  much as it was with Sleepy Hollow The story was a lot tamer than my wild imagination had pictured  Rather than some strange mythical two faced or two headed being  it was simply the mystery of two men who were never seen in the same room at the same time  I really enjoyed it  all the way through the mystery  and through the big reveal at the end  I felt sorry for Jekyll  forced to admit defeat and succomb to a fate without knowing what it was Very intriguing  and I can see why the imagery and concept has resonated with people   in whatever form   for so long  One key problem with reading classical literature is that the memes have become so ubiquitous that ideas that are intended to be revealed at the end of the book are already known to the reader before starting  That said  if you read this book as if you know nothing about it  it s quite enjoyable   A Classic study of Human NatureThis book has always been so favourite of mine  and the play that was created on its basis  The concept of the dueling natures of humanity  and the descriptions of each  along with the temptation to fall to either side  is very well imagined  This is one of those books that is so ingrained in the public consciousness  via countless TV  film   radio adaptations and parodies  that you assume you know the story before you ve even picked up the book  All I can say is that I still found much that was new and surprising in this lean  brooding and extremely well written novella  The story is told from a third party point of view and plays out as mystery and whilstyou will probably be aware of the eventual outcome  I still found the narrative to be thrilling and gripping as the narrator slowly uncovers the tragic tale of Dr  Jekyll  ratcheting up the tension with each subsequent chapter  In summary  a book that lives up to its reputation as a literary classic   well worth checking out  even if you think you know all about it already  A truly fantastic book  Even if pop culture has spoiled the twist  it s still a great read  Stevenson really knows how to draw you in and keep you reading  a lesson I m learning a second time now that I m going through Treasure Island too   I d recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about science gone wrong and the inner battles of a man s character  I heard this book when I was a lad on the ladybird tape and loved it  I have since red the proper book and loved it even more  What you feel is the dark atmosphare of the book the idea that jakel is being threatened by Hide the words  Not till the death or dispearance of Henry Jeckle   capturing the imagination  The moveies always make Hide out to be a giant but in the book he was almost a dwarf he was very small and was never actually described it was the oreror of evil about that him that came thorugh the descriptions   I know the difference between right and wrong  and I desire to do good  But the good which I desire to do  I cannot do  and the evil I do not want do  I find myself doing just the same  Oh what a wretched man I am   The words of the Apostle Paul from the book of Romans written several centuries before Mr  Stevenson s spectacular novel  But  they may just as well be the words of Dr  Jekyll  indeed they are the words of every man  woman  and child  We know the right the to do most of the time  but it is so much easier to do evil  Why does it come so naturally to us  Robert Louis Stevenson does an excellent job of portraying the inward struggle between good and evil in every man  In this chilling novel a man can come face to face with his deepest fear  and his worst enemy  Himself  One of the best books I ever read in my entire life  Very solid characters  a incredible  scary enough plot and it is definitely a story to read until the end without stopping  Props to Stevenson  I would like to know what was the reaction of the public when the book was released   With every day  and from both sides of my intelligence  the moral and the intellectual  I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth  by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck  that man is not truly one  but truly two  Be careful which side you feed  This was soo good    What an amazing mind Stevenson had  I never thought that i would enjoy a classic as much as i did  wow  I don t get scared of books but this one    It was really creepy  When i was trying to fall asleep it felt like Mr  Hyde was over there  just one step away  R  L  Stevenson guys    fascinating   Forget every movie version you ve ever seen  This is a powerful allegory and a fun read  Sit back and watch those pages fly by Read my full review at Carstairs Considers  Two men walk along the street There is a weird  creepy house they pass by  The door appears old and hardly ever used  The windows   if there are any   are firmly shut They know that to be the back door of a highly respectable man s house  though the only person anyone has ever seen entering that door is the most bleak and aberrant being  his face sculptured with horrifying features  as if it was the essence of evil itself The message is always the same  as Dr  Jekyll is really two men  so every person is torn into two different personalities  The most you push down and repress the evil side  the most powerful it ll be its takeover  as soon as you ll let it breathe  even if only for once To read the full review  InkCage Well  I suppose we all know the surprise ending to this story  if you don t I won t let on   Nevertheless it is a very well written story with a number of twists and turns  good characters and gripping storyline  Knowing the solution to the mystery did not spoil it for me   I did not know that the story was not told by Mr Jekyll  inside out of the mystery of double personality there a good plot besides the characters are well defined on each chapter  there is something I could even say about this book  probably is the father of each double cross personality topic in book  A very fascinating  intriguing  yet quick and easy read  Found a cheap paperback of this for  0 90 and one can t pass up just about any book for 90 cents As for the writing  some of the best I ve read  although as I ve said in other reviews here  that in and of itself  isn t saying much  The book offers an interesting perspective into what we may now understand are mental disorders and to some extent the experience of one addicted to substances  How much insight it gives to each of these is up to the interpretation of each reader  At 64 pages in this particular print edition  it s a VERY fast read but leaves the reader with seemingly endless thoughts about the content and character of the book  Well worth everyone s time for the few hours it takes to read  It has been a story I have always wanted to read for my self since my childhood and have only got to it know Everyone knows the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr  Hyde if you have not seen it on tv or in movie form  its one you might want to read first Alsa I have watched to much but I am glad I have read the story rGm  n bh nz

 wmmt   bl  y  shk  ClassicI have always been interested in early literature and this book was never a requirement when i was in school so I thought I would give it a read  I rated this a 5 because it is so much better then any movie interpretation  Highly recommended I knew bits of the story but I was pleasantly surprised how it was written  It was really enjoyable to see the different point of views  I am often too strict with rating books but this one I really enjoyed  Probably because the writer keeps the reader in the dark  Yes  yes  Very good  Some tale of the duality inherent to all human beings  Non english readers beware  though  the writing is heavy and will cause some headaches ate first  The final two chapters are some of the most well written I ve ever had the pleasure to lay eyes on 2015 Reading Challenge  a book you can read in a day Good story really amazing  Dr Jekyll and Mr  Hyde both are same person  it get known by the end of the story with the letter written by Dr Jekyll for Utterson  a lawyer holds the case  it is useless because Dr Jekyll is no more when he reads it     Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other   I love Gothic Fiction  The dark  mysterious and haunting atmospheregot me completely carried away  Big thumbs up   The murderous Mr  Hyde has been roaming the streets of London  as well as caught the attention of Mr  Utterson  And now there seems to be a connection between Dr  Jekyll  the friendly  well known doctor  and Mr  Hyde  But is there more to the connection than meets the eye  Will Mr  Utterson learn the mysteries of his good friend Dr  Jekyll and the evil Mr  Hyde  Will we finally learn what the deal is Mr  Hyde This book is very good at starting Good vs  Evil conversations  so  who do you think wins in the end of The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Good or Evil  I found the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr  Hyde to be quite fascinating on a psychological level  In a way it teaches about the uglines of evil and the easily corrupted nature of good  I think that everyone should at some point in theor lives read it  Una excelente historia que nos hace reflexionar sobre el lado obscuro de las personas y quienes somos cuando nos sentimos libres de ser juzgados por la sociedad y al mismo tiempo nos muestra aquella lucha interna que realizamos todos dia a dia   Loved this novella  I had to read it for class and now I m writing a paper on the biblical references made throughout the story I love how there s not just one way to interpret the story and there s so much depth in every word of the novella  Best presentation I ve ever made was about this novel  because I truly believe in every single letter of it   The main point of this novel is the ugly inner of human being which they are trying to hide in order not to hurt people dear to them  How could I not rate this classic 5 stars  It has yet to go stale  even after who knows how many re readings  As for this edition   Norton Critical    I enjoyed RLS s selected letters  the reviews from the 1800s and the bonus short story  Markheim   The rest of the material  while well intentioned I suppose  was as mixed bag that generally didn t do anything for me  especially in view of the fact that much of it seemed abbreviated from printings elsewhere   This book was simply amazing  I could not believe how good the book really is  I liked better than Mary Shelly s Frankenstein   To avoid spoilers  read the book so we can talk about the  change  into Hyde and what Hyde really is  Very well written  What got me about this chilling Gothic novel was the fact that the content is not necessarily scary  yet I was terrified while reading it  The novel forces the introspective reader to face his or her own Mr  or Ms  Hyde  It is not very long  and reads quite easily  but is certainly worth the two or three hours it takes to read it  and definitely worth re reading  It requires considerable deductive abilities at vital points to be able to follow the story  but is not what I would call challenging  In light of all the film adaptations and references in other genres  prior knowledge might  spoil  the excitement of the book at first  but one soon realizes that no copy or remake can do justice to the original  Can someone love a book as much I love this one  So easy to read but so exciting and impressive  It has to be in the   books to read before I die  list  Amazing  It was a birthday present from one of my teachers and I m so thankful for that  Highly recommended  I started reading this book because I was occupied elsewhere and found it to be a short and sweet book For most of the part  I was bored with the contents  We have all heard the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr  Hyde countless times  how one man changes into a sinister and evil form  It was only in the last chapter i e   Henry Jekyll s Full Statement of the Case  that it captured my attention  In spite of that  I found myself thoroughly enjoying the book  I so wish I had not known the story earlier Rarely have I read an experience described so vividly  Other people have written better reviews and I find myself short on the quality of prose  I ll just conclude by saying that I strongly recommend it to one and all   I only read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  The confession of Jekyll reads as the struggle with sin of Saint Paul in the books of Romans  There is also a conflation of sin with the lower evolutionary forms of mankind   Sometimes the man who does it first does it best  and in Stevenson s case I think that s true  Anyone who s ever known or been an addict will find The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde terrifyingly familiar  Stephen King called this the archetypal werewolf novel  but that description only scratches the surface  Read this book  Then look closely in the mirror  if you dare  This book would have shocked me more if only I didn t know what the real mystery was  But Stevenson s novella  I actually think it s more like a short story  is such a masterpiece that it s inevitably being referred to a lot of times  In my case I first heard of it through Van Helsing  and I was really fascinated by the thought of having dual identities  I even went so far as to name my two sim cards  my phone s dual sim  after Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde   deadseriousSo now  at least I know what the story behind the two famous characters really is  It sounded more like a mandatory thing to me  reading this book   Though I hoped it wasn t  If only I read this before getting wind of the cultural references     This book is absolutely incredible  I can see why it s a classic  It really got me thinking about the strength of emotion and power that we have in ourselves  Everyone has a repressed darker side no matter how hard they try to hide it or how well  I wonder what shape it would take Not a typical story of  good conquers evil   which I enjoyed  I think sometimes we need to accept the fact that sometimes  evil wins  and sometimes it s from within us  Though it does take more strength and courage to fight it than to give in This story was so dark and tragic  and perfect  I have so many different interpretations running through my head at the moment that I can t seem to focus on just one long enough to get it down  whilst this novella is brief  within it lies an engaging plot and many very poignant messages  jekyll and hyde is a phenomenal insight into victorian society  mental illness  reputation and drug abuse  a must read   It was also very enjoyable  I am for sure going to but more books by Robert Louis Stevenson  I really enjoyed the pace of the story  It is good for when you want to read a book  but don t want a really long one  Perfectly written   to my eyes at least  The tempo  the prose  the not pretending to be a 3 or 4 hundred page novel  Just a damn good short story that most of us know  or think we know from cartoon interpretations on this theme  Do yourself a favor and read Stevenson s Classic work   By far the best I ve read by one of my all time favorite authors  An all most perfect picture description of our true human nature or at least what we are each capable of if left unrestrained  RLS is one of the best  I wish people still wrote this way  Or at least  still wrote this way WELL Just the first sentence is great  Stevenson really has a great way of describing people  both physically and characteristically One of the most interesting things about this story is all the possibilities and underlying meanings you can get from it  The way Jekyll refers to both of his personalities in third person  his underlying thirst for and pleasure in evil  his addiction to Hyde  etc  It s actually pretty dark  and I m sure we can all agree that Jekyll is a bit on the crazy side But there s definitely a reason that Jekyll and Hyde have become household names and inspiration to countless stories and characters  Amazing how well this book holds up  even when reading for the second time  It totally captures the Jungian concept of the shadow  long before Freud or Jung appeared on the scene  A tight  short  fascinating read  I figured if my 14 year old had to read it for high school it was time for me to read it  I m so glad that I did  it was an absolutely wonderful story about the duality of man  Suspenseful and moody   I loved it  5 stars  A great gothic novella  My seniors took a while getting into the writing  but have been enjoying this dark little tale about the division within the human soul  I  personally  love Stevenson s writing  I read this when I was about 15 and when I did I really loved it so that s why I rated it 5 stars maybe if I read it right now I wouldn t rate it that high but the plot twist at the end was like wooooooooooooooooooo  well bye wow  Incredible  I can t believe I hadn t read this until now  I loved the style  loved the presentation  the  story within a story   There were some incredible quotes  and really  my only complaint about the book is it s brevity  There is so much more that could have been said  done  explored  etc etc  But maybe that s why it s such a classic  With it being so short it s incredibly relatable  and I think that if the personalities and actions of both Jekyll   Hyde were expanded upon even more  then maybe some of the relatable nature would suffer  it would become  just a story   Regardless  I really enjoyed the book I think I ll be spending quite a bit of time with Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde in the future  I heard the soundtrack to the musical first  Then I saw the musical  Then finally  years after falling in love with the musical  I read the book   And since then I ve read it multiple times  even once in another language   The story itself is beautiful and tragic  but the writing puts this book over the top  I love the descriptions  the conversations  and basically everything on these pages  Just as a science fiction story  with a little horror thrown in there  it is fantastic  but even while enjoying those things the reader begins to think about deeper themes and issues  For me  that is the mark of a classic   something that sticks with you after you ve read it and makes you think about life in a new light   I loved this book  Stevenson excellently portrays the duality of man throughout this novel and provides a captivating story with a strong and clear message  I consider this to be one of Stevenson s best  I loved the language and storytelling in this book  Writing has changed so much since this book was written and I love going back to these classics occasionally to see the difference  This was a good one  Film adaptations do not do this story any justice  The films concentrate on the  monster  form of Hyde while only scraping the internal emotional struggle Jekyll has and exactly why he created the potion  Wonderful story and a great Gothic tale  Classic English literature  loved the prose and pacing of the novella  I greatly enjoyed the book and found it quite suspenseful  despite knowing nearly the entire plot beforehand  Would definitely recommend   I came into reading this book as a massive fan of the original production of The Jekyll   Hyde musical  I was surprised at how much I the musical differs from the original plot  I can see how the novella gives a taste of what the story could entail and that is where the musical expanded  Both are absolutely excellent I both read it and listened to the audiobook read by Tim Pigott Smith  which I highly recommend  He has a fabulous voice do the content and I loved his versions if the various characters I won t lie that I kind of missed Emma and Lucy  but their absence makes me appreciate the originality if the musical even more  However  in and of itself  the novella is pretty much perfect  It s the third time I read this nightmarish story of the darker and evil side of man  Although I know the plot I m strucked by the brilliant storytelling   how elegant Stevenson reveals the horrifying truth bit by bit At the moment we are very occupied here in Denmark of the trial of Breivik and his evil deed in Norway where he slaughtered many innocent young people  What goes on in the mind of such a man  I kept thinking about it when I read the transformation of Dr  Jekyll and this personification of evil in Mr  Hyde  And the frightening truth that this is about all of us  That it s there lurking in all of us    and that evil unchecked  unrestrained and unleashed is a terrible  terrible thing  This book is wonderful  It still is on my favorite book lists after many years  I am one to never read the same book twice  Nothing against it  but I just get bored   I already know what happened so why read again  I also have an extremely hard time reading books AFTER seeing the movie Anyway   this book is written unexpectedly   not by the main character  at first at least   At some points  the book can drag along and become boring  but it kept my interest  It s crazy to think that one day we might could have the ability to change ourselves into our  alter ego   Scary thought too  I don t really have too much to say about this book other than I love it and it is a must read    at least once  A quick  easy classic to get on your list  I had to proofread a study guide for this book and it was so much fun  I can t believe I ve never read it before  Go ahead  take a day and read it   Genius in its simplicity  my complaint is that it wasn t longer and the characters thoughts and actions more developed  Incredible theme of the monster living inside man that we strive not to let out Here at Goodreads one can always add  Date I finished this book   In the case of  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I m skipping that info because I keep reading it over and over again  It must have been decades ago since I read it for the first time in my native language  an edition that unfortunately wrecked the title into  Jekyll and Hyde   But it was a good start  I now own a fine unabridged English version  the Dover Thrift Edition  with its full title restored  This work by Robert Louis Stevenson is among the finest in world literature  a masterpiece of insight that has made Jekyll and Hyde into a part of our language  and a masterpiece that has stood the test of time  I really like this book  the descriptions are really good  and the say it is written  There are both good and evil in everyone  it is the struggle for Jeckyll   the dark side take control  Sahane bir kitapti  ilk sayfalarda gizemli iki kisi arastirilirken  son bolumde yapilan tatmin edici aciklamalar ve insanin karanlik yonundeki tespitler mukemmeldi  Olumsuz bir eser  Okunmali  okutulmali    The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is a classical book that has  and forever  will have a place in my heart  It is a gothic tragedy  The book explores man  moral  and actions  There are many interpretations of what exactly happens between Jekyll and the elixir  Some interpret that Hyde is his own being  Others think it was Jekyll entirely  that the potion did not bring out the evil in a man  and separate him  rather just disfigure his appearance  I support both ideas  Jekyll is a man who spends his life being a good and kind man  The fault of man is that there is evil in him  The elixir kills the good in the man  it lets Jekyll become the evil and disgusting Mr  Hyde  Fog  fog  mist  fog  sun  moon  cold  warm  fog  mist    Bloody brilliant though  Just reread this in a little under two hours  Stunningly crafted to within an inch of its gothic life  I never actually read this before and I m glad I did  Fantastic novella  The suspense doesn t hold up because it s so iconic  But the last chapter is great  gripping and thought provoking  So frequently the classics are avoided by readers because they are  old  and  classic   I have to admit  I have often felt that way too  When I decided to read Jekyll and Hyde  it was more like taking my medicine than an exciting  next book  decision  I wanted to have this classic added to my list of classics that I ve read in my lifetime I m so glad I read it  While it is a classic  and occasionally reads like one  there is so much story that I forgot that it had been written so many years ago  It is a solidly good story  probably with loads of social commentary  I read it for pure escape and enjoyed it immensely  I have recommended it to others and recommend it here too  All I have to say for the story is that I loved it  Everything from the detective mystery element to the theme of duality of good and evil  It s probably one of the most clever things I ve read recently  It combined mystery with sci fi with philosophy seamlessly and the amazingly brilliant plot drove it all home  I liked how Stevenson gave you enough in the beginning to half figure out the ending but it still came as a shock and an interesting twist at the end even if you ve suspected Hyde s true identity the entire time  He captures the characters so well and the conclusion was beautifully written and connected all the dots from the strange happenings throughout the book   Alter EgoTo me this story has always been about the dark side of human nature  Dr  Jekyll creates some mind altering drug that transforms him into his malevolent alter ego with dire consequences  A book that I think has been lost to Hollywood horror films  but in reality tells the battle of man s greatest enemy  himself  I place this with Conrad s  Heart of Darkness  Clearly it s impossible not to know the twist  but even so this is a great read  It s a well paced and suitably grotesque chiller  but most of all a thoughtful meditation on the duality of man  I loved it  OH MY GOD  When I started this book I didn t know I was going to enjoy it so much  The story was truly fascinating  and the way that the author presents it makes it even more interesting  It was such a pity that I already knew the ending  What I liked the most about this book was Stevenson s writing style  It was so gripping that I couldn t put the book down    All human beings  as we meet them  are commingled out of good and evil   Really enjoyed the reading experience  Short and concise  a very thought provoking read about the duality of the human nature  What an excellent book  An accurate portrayal of man s dueling natures and what happens when the favoritism of one  along with the gradual succumbing to temptations takes over  Great life lessons are found in these pages   A science experience gone wrong  or right pending on how you see it  Dr Jekyll finding out what happens when he releases his other alter ego Mister Hyde  Interesting read   Classic    I always enjoy a classic  I like this book very much and it was a quick read  If I can get lost in the pages of adventure then it is a great book  mi e piaciuto moltissimo fa riflettere e nonostante sia stato scritto non proprio di recente si legge in poco tempo  non mi aspettavo che un classico potesse prendermi cosi  Dr  Jekyll is a scientist  one day he makes a potion  and drinks it  this potion is made to separates a person s evil from his good self  once taken  the potion tuns Jekyll into the horrible Mr  Hyde  back and forth the two change  it becomes so bad  Dr  Jekyll eventually locks himself up in his own house  this book reminds me of the series of unfortunate events  it shows this man who has nothing but bad luck  this is just the the Baudelaire because they to have awful luck  this is an awesome book  and it s perfect for Halloween  my favorite part was at the end when Dr  Jekyll leaves a note for his friends to find  explaining what he did  I loved this book  it was very well written and is a thought provoking story  Most people seem to think that Dr  Jekyll was a good person and that the horrible Mr  Hyde a whole different person  But you should consider how the doctor handles all of this This novel is quite possibly the most supensful and chilling book ever written  It deals with Henry Jekyll s addiction to a drug that will bring out his evil side  mr hyde  There are several especially chilling parts  the trampling of the little girl and the death of the lawyer are extremely gripping It is short  to the point  so even if you don t like it it s over before you know it How can you not like it  If  like me  and the fellow who writes an afterword in this version   you really only know Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde through Warner Bros   Sylvester the Cat and Tweety Bird  you have to take a morning to read this original text  Evil twin  Good and bad  Gemini  Bi polar  Original sin  The manuscript is littered with so many layers of allusion  it was surprising to me how two dimensional our absorption of this character into our collective consciousness has been  Dr  J    Mr  H  is full of qualities that truly make it a classic  It is a wonderful example of how to write to engage the reader s mind  more by what is left unwritten than what is actually on the page   Une experience incroyable  Une ecriture qui a su me transporter bien plus loin que je pouvais l imaginer  Une douce melodie qui me bercera pendant longtemps  Une histoire racontee de la plus simple des facons  Sans fioritures  Sans exces  Juste ce qu il faut de maitrise et de grace    A fantastic example of  situational horror   Robert Louis Stevenson successfully exploits the deepest desires of mankind  It is one those books  where the narration digs the abyss to the most secret corners of the human heart and screams the unutterable craving for liberty  Having only heard about this story in comedic references and witty comebacks   I figured it was time to actually read the story to which I have heard and made so many references to From my previous knowledge  I thought this book would be focused on Dr Jekyll  But it s actually about a murder being investigated by the lawyer of Dr Jekyll  and the secrets that Dr Jekyll hides in his laboratory  My edition was less than a hundred pages and I think it s amazing when SO MUCH can be fit into so tiny a book  the book is exciting suspense filled  smart and thought  provoking  read it before you die  it ll only take you a few hours  teeny weeny book  big impact  Amazing book  Accuratelly describes the duality of men and the eternal fight between good and evil  A book that  maybe not everyone will love  but I think many can relate  Easy to read and though short  deep enough   It s a very short story and very easy to read  There may be several gruesome occurrences  but overall this novel will leave you in deep thought afterwards  Una historia muy realista que no necesito de muchas paginas para hablar sobre el bien y el mal  Esta historia me recuerda que todos tenemos nuestro lado bueno y nuestro lado malo y solo nosotros podemos elegir cual de estos dos lados va a dominar nuestras almas  Eso si  como nos ensena la historia  el lado malo  el lado malvado  el lado negativo siempre es mas dominante que el lado bueno y si nos dejamos dominar por el podriamos no escapar y quedar esclavizados ante su dominio para siempre  Definitivamente recomiendo esta historia porque ella nos ayuda a reflexionar y a entender un poco mas sobre la naturaleza de nosotros los seres humanos      This is a fascinating exploration of the commingled natures of good and evil that reside in man  From a theological perspective  some ideas espoused by thinkers like Karl Barth and Augustine of Hippo can be found in the pages of this wonderful novel  The privation of good as the result of evil and the non existence of evil  Augustine and Barth  respectively  are themes delicately balanced in  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   Regardless of your theological or transcendental opinions  this book is not only exciting and extraordinarily well written  but also provokes thoughts striking dissonant and resonant chords deep within the common soul of humanity   I love this book and the allegorical nature of it  Dr  Jekyll refused to lay his passions to rest and die to his flesh and Mr  Hyde becomes master  finally found the time to read this and was pleasantly surprised at the rich prose and the fantastic critical apparatus and introductory articles  ClassicClassic story of the coexistence of good and evil within us all  Brilliant story and a free kindle read  Recommended  There is a certain quality that the classics have that are sadly lacking in modern literature  Mr  Stevenson s work is a prime example  The language he uses is elegant and enchanting and aids in swallowing the reader wholly into the tale he spins  It adds to the eerie quality of Edward Hyde s appearance and behavior and emphasizes the stark contrast of Dr  Henry Jekyll s affability  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde as well as their story have stood the test of time because they were so well formed that readers for centuries to come will continue to be sucked into their tale  Bravo  Mr  Stevenson  Another great to add to my  favorites  shelf  It describes the dual nature of the human being which comes to a seemingly end every time we make decisions and choose  I enjoyed it very much   AwesomeJust awesomeIt was vary GermanicIt was funny Time to timeI recommend this book to any body who likes these books I did think it took a while before the story really started to pick up  But  it was a very interesting read and a little scary creepy  It s really easy to read and understand  It s pretty small too so it s nice for when you re busy or if you want to start reading gothic classic books  I loved how Mr  Hyde was described  I could really picture him in my head and it gave me goosebumps  I really liked the concept and atmosphere of the book  The writing style made me think a lot of The Great Gatsby  that I had just read  it is written from the point of view of the secondary character and uses the word   gay   and   Gaiety   a lot   What a great classic  I recommend this read  I really enjoyed doing it  The plot is well done and thrilling from the first past until the last  Amazing  Reading it was a way to experience the human mind  It s complications and alters  It s higlights and lows  It s beauty and reality  I was surprised that this was so short  I also was surprised that while the story is well known it seems to be watered down when told to children losing much of it moral message   ktb ry   jdan wklsyky ytklm  n ldktwr jyykl wmfhwm  lfSl lkhyr  n lshr fy lshkhS    ttmsk blqym  n lSdq  wshrf lmhn  wshy Gyrh    nSH bh Pure old fashioned awesome  I can t believe I hadn t read this before now  and I thought I knew it because it is so ubiquitously referred to but I didn t know it at all  Full of surprises    After all  I reflected  I was like my neighbors  and then I smiled  comparing myself with other men  comparing my active good will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect   A powerful tale that would make a great SVU episode  Dr  Henry Jekyll has a secret and after his home made potions he transforms into the younger  shorter and creepier Edward Hyde  This story is seen in so many modern manifestations  To still be around after being published in the 1860 says it all  The language is intense but for a short book it has it all  No love story which is great too sometimes  It s always a mystery  it s always dark  Who lurks inside of you   An excellent read from start to finish  A classic story highlighting the struggle of good against evil in one man  Jekyll starts off with good intentions  trying to separate the good from the bad within himself but only ends up creating a monster  The story is almost entirely told from Jekyll s lawyer s perspective leaving many holes until the final chapter about Jekyll s confession  Jekyll s confession is one of the best chapters in any story I ve ever read  Muy buena historia  abarcando el dualismo humano de forma misteriosa  Puedo considerar a Robert Louis Stevenson como uno de mis escritores favoritos  Scott Brick narratorI truly enjoyed this book  it was my first ever text to speech book and I look forward to my more   Really enjoyed this book  easy and entertaining   a classic  Makes me wonder a bit what the author was like to have written this though     Do you know Poole   he said  looking up   that you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril   OH WHAT A CLASSIC  It was so interesting reading this  It reminded me a bit of Sherlock Holmes and Frankenstein Love myself some mystery and Gothic fiction  Perfect to be reading alongside THE BRIDE OF SCIENCE  Also a great companion to MARBLES  as the mental health piece is interesting too   life changing and yet another  thank you mom  also  i almost mauled a friend of mine for touching my 1942 copy of this      Loved the story  Excellent development of plot and characters in under 100 pgs on Kindle  They don t write them like this anymore  i have found myself in this psychological exploration of the conflicting states of human psyche  I could read it again in the future  I was probably 11 when my dad gave me this book  among others  as a birthday present  The others were Shakespeare dramas  unfortunately  i could not develop a taste for dramas but i remember reading this book and i remember feeling disoriented  I had no idea where the story was going  what was happening and who were all the characters  I abandoned the book in the middle but it always stayed with me  I knew I will read it again Then i read it about a year back and My God  what a creation  so intricate  so classic  so unique and so hazy  I loved that i had to reread dialogues to reorient myself  It was that gripping   D When I as traveling in Italy the subject of Jekyll Hyde came up  and I was asked to give a summary of the story to the Italians who weren t familiar with it  This inspired me to read the story again after many years  and I must say it is so effective at economically creating suspense  even when you know what is ocurring  that no wonder it is regarded as a masterpiece  And the transformation metaphor it presents is iconic now  I wonder why that duality transformation theme hadn t been presented as lastingly in any other fiction prior to Stevenson   or had it  What can I say other than this is one of the pillars of modern horror writing and it ll stay that way for the rest of time  Very powerful considering its length and my familiarity with the story  Exceptionally well written by RLS  needless to say  A Jekyll le gustaba la gozadera y lacreo en el fondo  nunca lo acepto y ahi tienen lo que le paso Despues de 10 semestres de psicologia puedo decir  no hay mal ni bien  solo personas que se comportan  Robert  Sometimes you have to go back to the source  So much more powerful Read this and you will see the roots of Lovecraft   Excelente libro  desde un principio te atrapa y te mantiene con los ojos abiertos en todo momento  Una lectura sencilla y muy buena   recomendado al 100   I love it  A cold depiction of the duality of man s nature  good and evil  civilization and savagery  One of my favorite books  This story was fantastic  The basics of the story are well known  but I don t ever remember reading it  The writing and description are beautiful with rich detail  It is a true horror story  with the basis that every person has evil in themselves  When Dr Jekyll first releases the evil side  Mr  Hyde   he was small in stature and younger bc that was his less powerful honed side  but as his well meaning ambitions take the form of evil and falling into temptation  his  good  side becomes powerless to stop the  evil  side  I really enjoyed the story  and so impressed that it was written in the 1800 s  yet so relevant today   Few books have as enduring an impact on the literary psyche as Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  The dichotomy of the characters is matched only by the understated correlation  that there is a little Mr  Hyde in all of us  no matter how good we may seem  waiting only the right events or situations to bring that dark side to life When I read some new books  those that lack the same impact of the classics  that make me feel like something s missing    sometimes I cry out  as Dr  Jekyll did   Oh God  give me some of the old   That is what separates a classic from all else  I think  and this book is a superb example of that  bHb lrwy  dy wy kl mbkwn

about the dichotomous nature of the human spirit  God alone knows just what we hide deep down in the murky pools of our subconscious  Truly terrifying when you think about it  Especially when we consider the acts people are perpetrating today that make us wonder how ANYONE can be capable of such things Highly recommended to anyone with a genuine appreciation of good  old fashioned quality writing  And to those who don t   try it with an open mind and see if it doesn t awaken a longing for more of the same  Mmmm  think it s time for a re read  Lol  Fantastic plot exploring bio ethics and the unintended consequences of attempting to suppress portions of human nature  So glad to have finally read the famous Jekyll and Hyde story  It was a really great fast paced read  and well worth it  What I find exceptionally compelling about the Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is the symbolism of the orthodox dual nature of life and of man alike  Being the paradoxical phenomenon that it is since time immemorial  the tension between good and evil is well expressed here as being between two complementary concepts that may well exist alongside one another  Henceforth  the inability of man to unequivocally elect which of his two natures to manifest is mirrored in this story  Indeed  to attempt to freely transform from one personality to another at one s own will is to teeter on the edge of insanity  I hope to win this book  read it and enjoy the story     If I win  the review will be updated once I finish the book    What a classic tale  Probably the most influental work of the modern psychological thriller and horror genre   rwy  fkrth ry  h mbqsh fyh f  rwyt dlwqt  fkr mbtkr  blshkl dh lwSf fyhry   jd Hj  tHs fyh ryH  lndn f l Swr lwsT   This short is cleverly plotted as well as written  After reading Treasure Island this has been on my reading list for quite a while  and I advice all who have not read this to stop whatever occupies your mind  or hands  and read this story    Although I like many horror stories and some of them are better written than this title  Robert Louis Stevenson had me in this book the moment he inserted duality in it and made that duality grow and spin and intertwine  all yin yang like  More than considering it a great book  I consider Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde and important book  in it we can exorcise and see the duality of our own spirits and see our dark nature is not only a headache we can civilize  but is a raging full individual who can grow  learn and think for itself and more   who can be either pacified or fought  but will never be truly gone  Can only imagine the shock of first readers   best twist ever  The horror conveyed is skilfully done  Very interesting and one of my  on the go  books because of its  few  pages  Definitely a  must have read once   The writing of long ago makes me swoon  So good  So creepy  So sad that I waited so long to read it   Review is here http   misterfweem blogspot com 2014     Exelente libro  te cuenta una historia muy grande en 71 paginas Es muy profundo  me encanto la forma de redaccion  misterioso  con suspenso  perfecto No es una lectura juvenil en si  no tiene amor  pero si que entretiene a personas de todas las edades  Me ha encantado  sin duda se ha convertido en uno de mis favoritos  La manera de narrar la historia  como su final abierto son impresionantes  Me ha cautivado desde el principio  y me ha rematado con la idea de que todos tenemos un Mr  Hyde dentro de nosotros  y yo me pregunto  como es el vuestro  Magnificent and profound its theme haunted me up to the point I couldnt stop reading  It still haunts me   A compelling and classic story  this is a great read for anyone looking for a suspenseful and fast paced read Short but oh so sweet  At his best  Stevenson wrote like a house afire  and this is some of his best  One of the truest studies on humanity ever penned  I believe  What would you do if you escaped consequence    Ha ja alguns anos que tinha este pequeno livro na estante e pareceu me uma boa aposta para a letra R  tendo em conta que queria ler este livro ha mais tempo de que o tenho  Antes de comecar a ler  perguntei me o que ja sabia da historia  Desde a personagem interpretada por Jason Flemyng no filme A Liga dos Cavalheiros Extraordinarios a fantastica serie Jekyll  a minha ideia era a de um medico que sofria de algum disturbio e desse disturbio nasce Hyde  Basicamente  e isto  Mas e isto e muito mais  Leiam o resto em http   eu e o bam blogspot pt 2013 07    Aunque me termino dando mas miedo el episodio de los Looney Tunes donde parodian la historia  me gusto este cuento    Aun y cuando termine sintiendo mas lastima por Hyde de lo que pense que haria   Ahora si   a ver todos los musicales y peliculas que pueda  1    2 Loved every page of it  Great plot  unexpected ending and amazing writing  Couldn t put it down   My bipolarity instantly makes me relate to this book  I ve read it like a million times  Love it Engaging read  I started reading this classic on the Kindle app and finished it one sitting   Laba klasika  kas atbilst ceretajam  Jalasa brizos  kad nav nekur jasteidzas  bet jabauda patikami lenais stastijums   An almost flawless story except for the ridiculous will signed by Jekyll which made no legal sense I think this is my favorite Robert Louis Stevenson book  I love the dicotomy of the two characters  I hadn t read this since middle school and I loved it so much more this time  I m giving it 5 stars simply for creep factor  Even though I m very familiar with the story  as are we all   I found myself in suspense and a little frightened at certain moments  What a writer  And I of course picked up on some of the bigger themes this time around that were completely lost on a middle schooler  What happens when we start to indulge our impulses and rationalize the behavior  At what point have we surrendered ourselves to evil  Some good stuff  I thoroughly enjoyed  A good October read  There are so many time when I am reading the classics that I sincerely wish the story was not bastardized and retold throughout popular media  Everyone thinks they know the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde but there was more to the story than I had previously known  I can only imagine how enthralling this tale would have been when it first came out  before anyone had the notion of the basic story  I would have really enjoyed not knowing that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde were the same person  Even with that being a known fact I still enjoyed this story  I found it to be delightfully creepy   Odd  But Definitely InterestingI personally have not had much experience with literature by Robert Lewis Stevenson  but after reading this  I will be looking for more  This is a mystery if sorts  Because of its older language  I sometimes found it difficult to understand  but this is my own problem  The story is well written  and holds the reader in suspense till the end  For those who like a nicely wrapped up ending  this narrative will satisfy  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  A eerie story about a man with dual personalities  Dr  Jekyll has tried and successfully made an elixer that gives him the abillity to be two people  The new Mr  Hyde is young  but has a short temper  One night  Jekyll goes to bed and wakes up as Mr  Hyde  He realizes that he has no control between becoming Hyde or Jekyll  Then  Hyde bludgeons a man to death  Jekyll decides that this must stop and kills himself  I loved the way Robert Louis Stevenson brings it to life with decriptional words and names  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes split pesonality stories or mystery  Everyone knows the story of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde  but only those who have read the tale for themselves know of it s frame story  The narrative is told through the eyes of a London man as he witnesses some odd goings on in connection with Dr  Jekyll s strange disappearance This protagonist  whose name escapes me  has been extricated from nearly all subsequent tellings of the Jekyll and Hyde story I find it interesting that Stevenson opted against a straightforward telling of Jekyll s struggle between good and evil and instead chose to tell it as an amateur detecive story  I love the classics  and this one is definitely a classic for a reason  A short story which is told so incredibly well you can read it again and again  I find myself relating to Dr Jekyll in the sense that having an out for the tedium and monotony of the daily grind and monotony is fulfilling since it satisfies a side of me which defies propriety  One of the things that I love about the authors of the classics is that though they write about a different culture  a different time their principles and ethics still speak to the soul in whatever era you live in  Robert Louis Stevenson  Genius  Ahhhhh  Fantastic  The horror  My only wish is that I knew someone else who has read it and loved it so that we could exchange theories and observations  Stevenson s use of language was enslaving and it keeps coming back to haunt me  It is amazing how he could pack so much into such a little book  Edit  I saw a  Young Classic   or some name like that  version of this book laying around so I grabbed it to relive the horror  It turns out that one was adapted  It was no good  it took what I considered the main turning point and minimized it  So  read the unadapted version   This book was amazing and I had to read it for college  No wonder it s a classic   This is a great book of mysteries  Full of puzzles and an adventure waiting to happen  What a great read  I normally don t go for these types of stories  but this was way more enjoyable  and thought provoking  than I expected   Never read when I was younger  such an amazing book  loved the way Stevenson wrote  A story that influenced generations of writers  Imaginative  monstruous and epical   I have always wanted to read this story  and I was very satisfied after doing so  An insightful glimpse at the nature of good  evil  and the consequences of progress  It s important to practice moderate sin and vice  lest you crack and become like Hyde  Although I ve seen the movie many times  this was my first reading  and while the movie terrified me  the book did not  that is  until I got to the last chapter  Henry Jekyll s Statement Stevenson s thoughtful analysis of the duel nature of man is haunting  Stevenson was way ahead of his time as he developed this thought provoking tale of schizophrenia In this tale  Jekyll  a physician with a basically good nature  releases  through a potion he developes  his alter ego  the completely wicked Edward Hyde A great book and an interesting study in the human mind and heart  A timeless piece  on a simplistic level  the story of a formula which turns one  evil  is an entertaining concept which is imitated to this day  However looking at it with an analytical eye you get a sense that Mr  Stevenson was making comments on the duality of man s nature with relation to Victorian values  Can those ideal values of noblesse oblige be consistently held  or will man ultimately succumb to his more barbaric side  Is man more free when tapping into his id  An excellent timeless page turner  whether you re into social commentary or simply into gothic horrors   tqryb mn wy l lHjt ll  qrtyh

when I randomly came across it on the library I decided to read it and I don t regret my decision  Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde is one of the classics but it still isn t that hard to read  unlike Shakespeare for example  it s hard to read his plays  don t get me wrong I love Shakespeare   The story that is told in Jekyll and Hyde is still very entertaining today  it s thrilling and a little scary  the story is build in a good way  and I really liked it  not much else to say  Fine storytelling and nothing like I remember from reading it 35 years ago   A very good book for those readers who love the mystery and suspense   Not sure if I had every read before  Great writing and a very quick read   Another book that reminds me why I m an English major  Not nearly as good as  Frankenstein    close though  One of the early books on split personality  Really enjoyed reading it  Brilliant classic  This particular book also came with The Bottle Imp  Very very good  I read this in one sitting and absolutely fell in love     Great story and a wonderful exploration into the duality of human beings   I thought I knew this story when i opened the book but I was not prepared for the style the book was writen in  Stevenson is truly a master and this will always remain a horror classic Obra de arte Lo considero desde ya mi libro favorito  por diversas razones  Victorian era science fiction novella that s really more a psychological study of duality  mental illness  drug addiction and repressed sexual perversion  Truly brilliant   I looove this story  Robert Louis Stevenson is so good  The thing is I knew who Mr  Hyde was from the very begining  and that made me want to know what s next even more  just to see if I was right  and I was  so I m satisfied with the whole story    My favorite character was  Mr  Gabriel John Utterson   My favorite moment was     Here then  as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession  I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end    Rating is for the text of Jekyll and Hyde  although I do love all of the extra material that is included in Norton Critical Editions  nh mn fDl lrwyt lt  qr th Ht  ln wTwl mn bqr h wn mtnH   D  This book was simply incredible  Although the beginning is a bit confusing  as one would expect the story to unfold around either one of the characters in the title  the rest of the novel is simply superb  The style with which Stevenson writes is simply captivating  The layout serves to maximize the thrill of the story itself  allowing even someone of this day and age to put themselves in the shoes of those who do not yet known the ending to the story  Lastly the quality of Jekyll s confession is enough to bring this wonderful and concise story to a very satisfying end   This story is compelling  Captivates you from beginning to end  Out of all of the classics this is one of my favorites  I was happy to see that Amazon was selling the Kindle edition for free  so I had to read it again   Opravdu me tyto pribehy napresto uchvatily a to jak svym tematek tak i stylem vypraveni  A GREAT classic  a must read    for everybody   The way it is writen    aw  awesome   awesome   Interestingly written and the opening chapters are atmospheric  just wish a bit more happened  The bonus story  The Bottle Imp  is fantastic  This is the best book ever written about anything ever   Sir  if that was my master  why had he a mask upon his face    I felt nostalgic so looked for an old classic  It s an interesting story and I envy its first time readers   Why didn t I read this before  Strangely postmodern Victorian text    Yes  we are all used to a less formal style of writing than one will experience in Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jeckyll   Mr  Hyde  And  of course  most have seen at least one film adaptation of the story  Yet  you do yourself a disservice if you do not take the time to read this wonderful classic  No film can bring to mind the terrible struggle of two men of differing spirit in one body  This story is psychological illness made physical in all it s terrifying forms  What a brilliant concept  What brilliant writing Copyright  c  Clayton Clifford Bye 2009 Spooky and Thrilling  A MUST READ for Sci Fi Lovers    Quien pudiera saber los ingredientes secretos del brebaje  very good look a the darker side of the human condtion I wonder what it was like to read this story without knowing the ending   I have known about this story since I was little  cough  scooby doo  cough   It was only after my discovery of the musical based on this work that I remembered that this book was on my to read list  Well worth the read  I was hooked and read it in less than 24 hours   Great  Classic gothic horror story  My favourite   No hay peor lucha que la de uno contra uno mismo        Si dev essere cosi il fantasma di qualche passato errore il cancro di qualche segreto disonore e la punizione arriva pede claudo dopo molti anni che la memoria ha scordato e l amor proprio ha perdonato l errore   Finished this book in one sitting and enjoyed it very much  Meraviglioso  Molto piu di quanto mi aspettassi  Recensione completa sul mio blog One of the  best  books I ve ever read   2011  I have always wanted to read this  It s a short story  about 80 pages  and took me not quite 24 hours to read  This is a brilliantly written  terrific little piece of classic literature that everyone should read    and at 80 pages it s not too much to ask  I was torn between feeling pity and disappointment for Dr Jekyll as he loses his grip on  his  reality in favour of Edward Hyde s extreme hedonism  And it makes me think  can you ever truly separate those two basic parts of yourself  Would you want to  And which would you choose if you could   Wow  Really short but excellent read about a man who through scientific means attempts to rid himself of his sinful nature only complete be given over to it  Powerful illustration of the destruction and death in sin and the flesh and yet it s addictive and alluring pull on us  I love how Jekyll just tries to give himself to Hyde only a little and a little to satisfy those fleshly urges but how Hyde just takes more and more and Jekyll refuses less and less  Stevenson had remarkable insight into our nature that I did not expect to find so deeply here   A highly intellectual book  and a classic for a reason  A lot of people complain that much of the suspense is taken away since everyone knows how the story goes  However  if you look deeply at the writing  what is being said about the nature of man is incredibly profound  and for me  makes this book much less about being thrilling and much more about commenting on how people live with multiple sides to themselves While the writing is thick  the book is short and therefore I think this is worth the read for the psychological depths it explores  This book reflects in extreme ways the dark insides of England s Victorian era  Stevenson used Dr Jekyll as a means to describe how the society of the 1800 s hid the crude and vulgar actions of each person and to explain that the society as a whole was merely a facade to hide the animal like tendencies seen when mr Hyde comes into play  This book is a very short read   but an extremely meaningful one and long as the reader stops to analyze the socio historical context and how Dr Jekyll and mr Hyde relates and reflects the time period it is set in    Incredible imaginary  incredible narration  incredible style  what else can I say As I was just saying to a friend today  what thing tht is amazing about classics is how they were written hundreds of years ago  when inspiration was all from the own writer  when archetypes where not fully drowning the people of that age  Maybe these horror books of the nineteen century will not longer frighten us to the bones  but they will strike us for the imagination and the fine writing from which they are made of  And this book is an excellent example of it  The plot was spoiled  how could it not be since the main character has been portrayed by Tweety Bird  has been used as a catch phrase for split personality  and is right up there with Dracula and Frankenstein as favourite monsters  None of us in our book group had ever actually read the book until now  It s a novella  a short 75 page story  And it s still has terrifying passages  It s a treat to read great  compact writing  Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde was written in 1886  the same time writers of Europe were borrowing from the literary school of naturalism  I was cleaning out book shelves with my kids and they tossed this in the giveaway pile  I had never read it so I figured I would before we gave it away  I am glad I did  Just like Frankenstein  it such a better book that all the stories we know  I have always claimed that I am not a sci fi person but these old books just come to life  They really deal with man s struggle with himself  I LOVED the way the story was weaved  I never got lost even though it was being told to me by different people  My kids told me I d like it and they were right   Loved the part where Laynon finally reveals the identity of Hyde  Scary and horrible but a very good plot  Really well written full of mystery  I loved it The original doppleganger double book  Brilliant  Brilliant  the precursor to and the original  Tyler Durden Dark and suspenseful  gothic masterpiece One of the best classic books I ve ever read  Loved it  Scary and not at all like the movie    Sir  if that was my master  why had he a mask upon his face    I felt nostalgic so looked for an old classic  It s an interesting story and I envy its first time readers   Why didn t I read this before  Strangely postmodern Victorian text    Yes  we are all used to a less formal style of writing than one will experience in Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jeckyll   Mr  Hyde  And  of course  most have seen at least one film adaptation of the story  Yet  you do yourself a disservice if you do not take the time to read this wonderful classic  No film can bring to mind the terrible struggle of two men of differing spirit in one body  This story is psychological illness made physical in all it s terrifying forms  What a brilliant concept  What brilliant writing Copyright  c  Clayton Clifford Bye 2009 Spooky and Thrilling  A MUST READ for Sci Fi Lovers    Quien pudiera saber los ingredientes secretos del brebaje  very good look a the darker side of the human condtion I wonder what it was like to read this story without knowing the ending   I have known about this story since I was little  cough  scooby doo  cough   It was only after my discovery of the musical based on this work that I remembered that this book was on my to read list  Well worth the read  I was hooked and read it in less than 24 hours   Great  Classic gothic horror story  My favourite   No hay peor lucha que la de uno contra uno mismo        Si dev essere cosi il fantasma di qualche passato errore il cancro di qualche segreto disonore e la punizione arriva pede claudo dopo molti anni che la memoria ha scordato e l amor proprio ha perdonato l errore   Finished this book in one sitting and enjoyed it very much  Meraviglioso  Molto piu di quanto mi aspettassi  Recensione completa sul mio blog One of the  best  books I ve ever read   2011  I have always wanted to read this  It s a short story  about 80 pages  and took me not quite 24 hours to read  This is a brilliantly written  terrific little piece of classic literature that everyone should read    and at 80 pages it s not too much to ask  I was torn between feeling pity and disappointment for Dr Jekyll as he loses his grip on  his  reality in favour of Edward Hyde s extreme hedonism  And it makes me think  can you ever truly separate those two basic parts of yourself  Would you want to  And which would you choose if you could   Wow  Really short but excellent read about a man who through scientific means attempts to rid himself of his sinful nature only complete be given over to it  Powerful illustration of the destruction and death in sin and the flesh and yet it s addictive and alluring pull on us  I love how Jekyll just tries to give himself to Hyde only a little and a little to satisfy those fleshly urges but how Hyde just takes more and more and Jekyll refuses less and less  Stevenson had remarkable insight into our nature that I did not expect to find so deeply here   A highly intellectual book  and a classic for a reason  A lot of people complain that much of the suspense is taken away since everyone knows how the story goes  However  if you look deeply at the writing  what is being said about the nature of man is incredibly profound  and for me  makes this book much less about being thrilling and much more about commenting on how people live with multiple sides to themselves While the writing is thick  the book is short and therefore I think this is worth the read for the psychological depths it explores  This book reflects in extreme ways the dark insides of England s Victorian era  Stevenson used Dr Jekyll as a means to describe how the society of the 1800 s hid the crude and vulgar actions of each person and to explain that the society as a whole was merely a facade to hide the animal like tendencies seen when mr Hyde comes into play  This book is a very short read   but an extremely meaningful one and long as the reader stops to analyze the socio historical context and how Dr Jekyll and mr Hyde relates and reflects the time period it is set in    Incredible imaginary  incredible narration  incredible style  what else can I say As I was just saying to a friend today  what thing tht is amazing about classics is how they were written hundreds of years ago  when inspiration was all from the own writer  when archetypes where not fully drowning the people of that age  Maybe these horror books of the nineteen century will not longer frighten us to the bones  but they will strike us for the imagination and the fine writing from which they are made of  And this book is an excellent example of it  The plot was spoiled  how could it not be since the main character has been portrayed by Tweety Bird  has been used as a catch phrase for split personality  and is right up there with Dracula and Frankenstein as favourite monsters  None of us in our book group had ever actually read the book until now  It s a novella  a short 75 page story  And it s still has terrifying passages  It s a treat to read great  compact writing  Dr

best classic books I ve ever read  Loved it  Scary and not at all like the movie   Yo me dejaria vencer por Mr Hyde  Este es el tipo de novelas que me gusta leer     Uncover your own dual nature  YOU are both Jekyll and Hyde   The ending was a little   not abrupt  but unsatisfying  almost like the cheater s way out   The viewpoint character was told everything in a letter  It s too bad that I already knew the basis of the story  having watched Arthur the Aardvark when I was little  because I think it would have been a better experience had the story unfolded as I went   although the back of the book does tell you  since they expect it to be common knowledge  Overall  this was a great book  though  and definitely took some genius to write  This is one of my favourite classics  I find the duel personality of Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde fascinating  What the split did to the good doctor which in turn resulted in his demise  why he felt it was necessary to split the immoral vices   dark desires to ensure that he did so without being persercuted   losing his reputation  It shows the double lives led by the Victorian upper class society  showing one face to be respectable to the more seedier side where it will have tarnished the reputation of the upper class   I am currently studying this book in my English literature class and have fallen head over heels with it  I think the themes it addresses are brilliant and Stevenson s description is simply phenomenal   in the last chapter especially  I am studying it in depth in class and I cannot get over how perfectly crafted this novella is  Definitely worth a read  it s extremely thought provoking  and seems to be the gateway to Gothic horror   I enjoyed it so much that Dracula and Frankenstein have since been added to my bookshelf  Loved this book    Genial    Me encanto      A classic tale about the evil that can hide in everyone  this book has stood the test of time for a reason   Great read  Great classic  Excellent   TOTALLY LOVED IT The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde lives up to its popularity  Stevenson enthralled me with his imagery and depiction of Jekyll s fall from grace  The last 10 15 pages are absolutely wonderful in tying together the entire plot  and are definitely a strong point of the novel  I would strongly suggest this to anyone who likes psychological thrillers  Oh  and a HUGE plus is that it s pretty short  My copy was only 99 pages  so you re not risking much of your time with this one So READ IT     Can see why a modern master storyteller like Ian Rankin is such a fan  Almost perfect in every way  Loistava klassikko  Stevenson  Riveting book  A true classic   bqry  l b d Hd  Awesome classic Spooooooky Still a great book  I read this for the first time when I was in 8th grade  I ve read it three or four times since then  Every time I read it  I find new depths in the story  The way it develops    from a sidewalk observation to Jekyll s confession    is masterful  The description is lovely and evocative  the characters are all fully drawn  and the themes of addiction and our struggles against what gives us purest pleasure are universal  If you haven t read this  treat yourself  If you have  reward yourself by reading it again  Di questa storia forse si sa gia tutto  eppure puo ancora sorprendere  Quando lo lessi rimasi incantata Il modo in cui i temi vengono trattati meriterebbe da solo una medaglia olimpica  E Stevenson e davvero uno di quegli autori che riescono a dire cio che devono con il giusto numero di parole  senza una sillaba fuori posto o in eccesso  Una volta finito di leggerlo  mi stupii di come avessi potuto assorbire una simile mole di informazioni  e di emozioni  senza aver letto un libro di settecento pagine almeno    Challenging text  Horror itself  Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde is extremely suspenseful  engaging  and entertaining  but what makes it great is the final chapter that brilliantly expounds on the duality of man  I ve never read anything secular on the subject that I found to be more profound or meaningful  It really gave me something to think about regarding the choices we make in life  The story really reads like an allegory on our free agency on whether we choose to be our best or our worst  I can t think of anything more important or valuable  Masing masing manusia mempunyai  monster  di dalam dirinya  Dan terkadang manusia harus membayar mahal untuk menunjukan  monster  yang ada di dalam dirinya itu  Walaupun Dr  Jekyll berhasil memisahkan  malaikat  dan  monster  yang ada padanya  namun kekuatan  monster  nampaknya semakin membesar seiring melemahnya malaikat  yang pada akhirnya  monster  itulah yang berhasil menguasai dirinya  Robert Louis Stevenson dalam karyanya ini menceritakan tentang dualisme sifat manusia  seperti halnya  yin dan yang   This is a great classic that you can interpret in many different ways  The way I see it is that one person can have  two faces  and it s their decision which one they pick  Overall a great story that does not bore  Classic 4 5 Definitely more profound than the first time I read it  A quick read with a lot to think about regarding the human condition  My favorite quote   It is one thing to mortify curiosity  another to conquer it   like Beautiful language and original text  I much appreciated the writing style as well    3 None Great  well written story   Well  it is a classic  I happened upon this copy in one of those highway side  warehouse type stores  For one dollar it was getting a new home  Plus  my other copy is in storage  I adore gothic tales and this is a grand old one  Still holds up against modern masters like Susan Hill  So  indeed  I recommend it to anyone that hasn t read it  or has  or comes across a discounted version mixed in with books about how aliens and disco music can save you time in the kitchen  I passed on that one   Impresionante  exc Wow  I was gripped by this book from the very first page  It is a small book  only about 80 pages  but it has been wonderfully constructed and plotted  Its to the point and still the mystery is intact till the very end chapter  You get the whole sense of the atmosphere and the characters and feel as strong a dislike of a certain character as does everyone in the book  In a few words it describes the whole tale and highlights the basic moral flaw and tendency of all humans  Beautifully written book   While the idea itself was very confusing  the author did an excellent job at only telling you what certain characters knew and waiting until the end to reveal the whole story  so your curiosity would build and you would want to speed through the book  It was a wonderfully written book  with a very interesting and unique  for the time period it was published  story  I greatly enjoyed this book  and would recommend it to anyone  since it is a classic  However  there are parts of it that are disturbing  I have seen a lot of parodies of this story  heck I ve seen The Nutty Professor  but I decided to read this for a study of mental illness in fiction I am doing and I absolutely loved it  I found it quite scary and although I ve seen adaptations  they re so different from the original that I felt like I was reading a book I had never heard of before  The duality between Jekyll and Hyde is complex  I got confused which was which  and I was so sad when the book finished as I thought it was too short  Mervyn Peake s illustrations are also amazing  I heard people talk about this book from every age range  I got curious and decided to read it and I do not regret it one bit  I truly recommend this book to anyone who loves mystery thriller psychological books  Excelente This book is a great read  The duality of human nature explored in an undeniable physicality  The story spoke directly to my core  and indeed  both my better halves  This is literature at its best  I found it flawless  beautiful  grungy and genuine    perfect  There is a reason why this is a classic   if you haven t read this already  put aside your preconceived notions about the story and wrap yourself up in this very disturbing tale about dissecting the essence of our nature and then attempting to reconcile it  Appropriately  I finished reading this on Halloween  Similar to some of the other reviewers  this really wasn t what I was expecting  I think I was expecting a cute little fable that would be wrapped up nicely with a moral and a happy ending  It really wasn t like that   it scared the crap out of me  This is now up there along with 1984 as one of the most genuinely frightening books I ve read  Of course it s brilliant  Of course I would recommend it to every anyone  It s a classic  This is a great book  I love it  It s gripping stuff from page one  Their is nothing to not like  great story line  Split personalities very cleverly done  awesome read  Wow  Just wow  I had to read this book for a school assignment and went into it a little unsure  My expectations were absolutely blown out of the water  This is one of my new favorites   A true bogey story about man s darker side  A definite read  Deistvitel no  strannaia istoriia  Iz tekh  chto liubiat proiskhodit  v Londone   Un gran clasico de investigacion misterio suspenso  donde Stevenson nos coloca en contacto directo con uno de sus temas preferidos  La Dualidad  La moralidad del los personajes es ambigua y se debaten continuamente entre lo que es correcto moral y lo que no parece asi  La frontera entre el bien y el mal queda difuminada en manos del Dr  Jekyll que para dar rienda suelta a sus mas bajos instintos echa mano de su gran intelecto a fin de conseguir la forma de desatar esas pasiones   I don t know why I have fallen for this story  Mabye because it counts as one of the great pieces of literature or maybe because it is so different from the current ones that there is no other way than to like it   I did  The story wasn t original   not from my point of view   but anyway the writing  the characters and the plotline together have something pleasant  I enjoyed the reading and the subtile humour of RLS  Mabye I will give Treasure Island a second chance   It would be interesting to read this book without knowing the main twist  I assume most people are familiar with the story before they read which makes it a little less exciting  I thought the novel was extremely well written and very insightful  Stevenson does a great job of exploring the duel nature of man and the book made me think of individuals who struggle with addiction or emotional conditions  The last third is the best   Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde is a classic tale of the duality of man  We should all take time to read some of the classics of the past  It is a must read if you are a student of literature  Also  as a writer by reading the classics you can gain knowledge of the craft and improve your writing  Hopefully  100 years from now  people will still be reading your work David H  Donagheauthor of Monroe s Paranormal Investigationsand The Tale Spinner  For readers who are just starting to read  chapter books  this is perfect  It s tailored to be appropriate age wise so it is a condensed version featuring the basic story without any risque situations that are too advanced for young minds  they do take out some stuff   It s a great way to introduce young kids  ages 7 12  to the classics  Semi large print  think font 16   some b w illustrations  a forward introducing the story  15 chapters and a character introduction   I listend to this on the way back from visiting my fiance  The audio book that I listened to was narrated by Ian Holm   3 Dispite having known the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I still enjoyed this book  It was written in a different point of view than I expected  I expected it to be written from Dr  Jekyll s point of view and not from the point of view of his lawyer  If I had been someone who never had heard the story  I would have been excited by the twist  Great book  I would ve read it in one sitting if I had not started reading close to midnight  It s a great book  well written and it s not hard to see why this story has been adapted so many times in modern culture  such as in cartoons like the Looney Tunes and Tom   Jerry The book itself is beautiful as well  a great  fake   leather bound edition with gilded pages and a pretty ribbon to use as a bookmark  In short  a great read and it looks amazing on my bookshelf  This is totally one of my favorite books of all time  I read it first back in high school  but it s one of those books that really stuck with me  And although the story is well know   a societal cliche at this point even   it is the writing style which truly stuck with me  Stevenson had an uncanny ability to describe a scene and what it felt like to witness it  The book is dark and drenched in shadows painted by Stevenson s imagination and his abilities of description  This book is 103 pages  103    Why do I mention it twice  Because it s sooooo well written and descriptive in a very Victorian way that it makes ANY book two times or more the length seen like an embarrassment of useless data  And I just finished my first novel at 206 pages  Thank you Mr  Stevenson  for showing me that no matter how much I love a great story  you knew how to set pen to paper better than anyone  and it s told from three points of view  Uncanny    In an old fashioned style but not at all impossible to read as many find Melville s Billy Budd  Actually quite interesting and worth the time  I was anxious to find out how it ended  Item  One day at the age of 44  Stevenson went to the cellar and got himself a bottle of his favorite burgundy  opened it in the kitchen and said to his wife   What s the matter with me  What is this strangeness  Has my face changed   And so he passed of a cerebral hemorrhage  Awesome There is a reason why classics become classics  I think it is a shame to read this books already knowing the end  wSf u Tbyb tthyr tsw lt wstGrb lad  mHm mwkl  ldyh  lshkhS lmwS  lh ythyr lshmy zz  nd kl mn yrh  Hdth u qtl

time of age  it s unfortunate that the ending comes with no surprise  But even so  I could not have enjoyed it more  It s something which a number of us can relate to  The struggle against our  polar twin   For that I found myself admiring Henry s endeavors almost as much as I admired Nemo s in 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  Behind their madness lies something commendable  An exploration of the dual nature of human morality  Stevenson writes a tale relatable to even the most distinguished of individuals  Favorite quote It was on the moral side  and in my own person  that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man  I saw that  of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness  even if I could rightly be said to be either  it was only because I was radically both    Astonishing book   MARAVILLOSOMi resena   http   www tabernadelcruce es 2015 09    I have seen many adaptations of this story in movies and on TV  so it was nice to get the real story  I must say  it was much better than anything I ve seen  Much shorter  too  I finished this in one day  One thing I love about reading the classics is the imagery  Very few contemporary books have that  I don t think modern writers could get away with the quantity of  purple prose  as classical writers did  but it is definitely a higher quality  I found the true story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde to be a milder and frankly grander version of the folklore that I have let grow in my conscious  The philosophy was as thick as a London fog  Stevenson s explanation of duality and the fight between good and evil amongst one vessel was just brilliantly portrayed  And the fact that Stevenson s Hyde was a awkward dwarf like man was just cooler than the large witty brute that I had created   It s not one of my favourites and I didn t enjoy it very much to say the truth  It s about a person who has duel personalities  one of which is a cruel and barbaric kind of person named Mr  Hyde and the other is a scientist called Dr  Jekyll  I think I had read the abridged version maybe because I felt it was very short and I had read this a long time ago  so I can t remember  The ending was the part I liked and I am not being sarcastic there   Mr Stevenson  what a creative genius  This book superceded so many later similar stories and books and is still the best  Such a classic  sadly before reading this book like many I knew the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr Hyde down to watching it on TV  However I still enjoyed reading this book  it s one of those must read before you die books  I hope all know that Mr hyde is not truly evil instead is the true nature of Dr Jekyll that he has oppressed and finally sets free by you guest it mr hype   With the story being as famous as it is  the book was not quite what I expected it to be  Having said that  I loved that it doesn t focus on Jekyll himself and instead  mainly  focuses on Jekyll s friend  Mr Utterson and the fact that Hyde isn t so much a monster and more an embodiment of evil and the evil within humanity    bqry I already knew the story of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  possibly introduced to me by a Bugs Bunny cartoon  before reading the book  Seeing that it was pretty short  I was planning on just browsing through and reading the good parts  Oh how wrong I was  the book captured me into the 19th century     with its beautifully written  dark story while leaving room for interpretations on good and evil  I definitely agree this is a classic  What a fantastic story  Clearly I have heard references to this tale and felt I understood the basic premise though it was so much more compelling and disturbing than I thought it would be  And the language is beautiful   This is a good book to pick up and read  usually Mr  Utterson was in good spirits after his sunday walk with his cousin He enjoyed the sunny nature of the younger man as well as his fresh opinions  but tonight he was somber  this part was the start of chapter 3  This part of the book is very odd  chapter 17 is when you start to think  man can this book get even wireder   the answer is yes read chater 17 to get your answers  The amazingly complex plot of this book is extremely surprising considering the fact that it can actually be read in its entirety in about 2 hours or so  Robert Louis Stevenson chose to take a potentially 700 page novel and condensed it into a 100 page masterpiece that is thrilling and intriguing from the beginning of the first chapter to the last and most vital words of the piece  A complete success and a true classic  Where should I begin The authors back in 19th century knew how to tell a great story  They knew how to create a feeling of uneasiness to the reader   Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  is one of those great stories  Unfortunately  we all know the connection between Jekyll and Hyde before we start reading the story  I wish I didn t  Well  there is nothing left to tell  Great writing style  great story with multiple meanings  I read this is one night  For being from such a light hearted author  this is one of the deepest book into the struggle of man between his calling to virtue and his fallen nature  Of course  there s of a more spiritual dualist philosophy behind them than a Christian concept of good and evil  But in my opinion  the effect on the reader is the same  fear of the evil within  fear of how it can take over if we give it ground  I feel like all of the great monster  mad scientist stories of this time ended with the creators descruction by his monster  But it never gets old  This story is so great and there are so many ways to interpret the Doctors transformations  and just what Hyde means to him  I like that it was told from outside perspective because the added mysetery gave the tale a much more horrifying feeling  Definatley read  its a classic  I had never read this book nor seen a movie version of it  but of course I knew the cliche of being a Jekyll and Hyde personality  Now I know the story behind it  and it s so much more than a cliche  It s the fight between good and evil that we all carry within us and the calamitous results of trying to separate them  the unbalance that results of unleashing our evil side and the strength it takes to contain it  Brilliant  One of my all time favourite books some of the language is just beautiful The plot is forceful and gripping and the premise of the story is profound Stevenson manages to construct a real intimacy between the central characters of Jekyll Lanyon Utterson and the other chap who s name escapes me for now When Hyde is described as  stumping along eastwards at a good pace  I almost fell off my chair laughing     tqd nn jmy  ldyn mthl hdh lsh wr    nHs Hyn bHd  lSr  byn jnb

and evil  If you take the story at face value then its just a silly tale about a Dr and magic potions  However  if you have the insight into how people work  then it is easy to see that this story is just the tip of the iceburg  with so much more submerged beneath  This is a fantastic read  and I highly recommend it  beautiful writing  beautiful plot  oh     just classic and wonderful  so happy i decidied to get to know the original story  This great is a Science Fiction book with well described characters and mystery  This novel is about a scientist by the name of Dr Jekyll who by night takes on his evil self Mr Hyde  a murderous monster  Mr Hyde stay inside of Dr Jekyll until the sun goes down and thats when his evil self comes out and runs along the streets of London doing nothing but harm  I recommend this book to any advanced reader  Classic tale of good vs  evil  human nature vs  civilization  Only thing is  it s so well written  you re too busy reading a really good story rather than reading obvious  played out themes  I only wish I had read it the time it was written  b c I m sure the suspense of figuring out the relationship between hyde jeckyll made it a real thriller  Shame we all learn the story without ever reading the book  Part horror  part sci fi  part mystery  Stevenson s landmark Late Victorian age book  more novella is the paradigm for humankind s struggle within between their good and bad sides  ask Stan Lee and his Incredible Hulk creation   What s fascinating is that in some ways Dr  Jekyll is more insidious than Hyde  Dr  Jekyll makes conscious decisions while Hyde is bound by his nature  Well worth reading  What an excellent novella  It present concisely a great moral dilemma faced by one man  In what started as his truly noble path  his objectives ended up being seized by his selfishness  The final chapters are what really struck me  with the lead up being merely in my opinion a device to drive the story to the conclusion  In the end both his selfishness and noble sides were punished fairly  http   www bluestockingbookshelf com     Excellent I highly recommend      he had an approved tolerance for others  sometimes wondering  almost with envy  at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds  and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove    I let my brother go to the devil in his own way      it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of down going men    3  Esta edicion en especial es magnifica  tiene unas ilustraciones muy logradas  Lei la historia hace muchos anos y me ha encantado releerla  El Extrano Caso del Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde se encontrara siempre entre mis lecturas favoritas  4 5 There is a plot to this story  but I feel like what makes this book is more in the philosophy theology of it  It is short and yet full of depth and insight into man s sinful nature and what we are because of it  It expounds on the conflict to act properly as a member of society versus selfish urges of wickedness  I finished it wanting to discuss it and dig deeper into it s complexity  Awesome  The archetypal gothic horror   but really shines a light on the effects of drugs and alcohol on respectable people  It is amazing how it explores the nature of humang beings in a very simple way  Literally could not put it down  Such a great story  Even though I knew what was the punchline  thanks a lot author of preface    I couldn t stop reading  because it was very well written  it was fast paced  gripping  suspenseful    I liked the style   no superfluous words and storylines  It was heading right to the punchline  That s why I almost couldn t put it away  I m really glad I finally read this classic  How our language and style have changed  sadly from Jekyll to Hyde  This should be on every 100 must read classics list  Although I know the story from childhood  and probably read the Classics Illustrated version   I picked this up today and thoroughly enjoyed the novella  I ll have to go back and read more Stevenson   a captivating writer  and a great story teller  The meaning of a  Jekyl and Hyde  personality is of course well entrenched in our language  but the story is a haunting masterpiece  Spoiler alert  A fascinating  extraordinary tale  I myself have had the same thoughts as Dr Jekyll  that someone is actually sometwo  I find contradictions in myself  incoherencies  that Jekyll have found in himself as well  although of course to a much lesser extent  All in all  this book captures the mind  describing a scientific movement somehow similar as to that in Frankenstein  This is my 4th classic this summer and by far my favorite so far  It covers one of my favorite themes  the evil within everyone  which has been covered by everyone from Shakespeare to William Golding to Gene Roddenberry to Joss Whedon  Why  Because it is relevant  Great story  Glad I had a chance to read it  as my only previous experience with the story was from Ren   Stimpy  Not so long ago  I was rather disenchanted by fiction  What real substance can be gained by basking in what s not real  This novella changed my mind  Read it during the summertime and really liked it  Stevenson s prose is wonderful and the book gives important commentary on personality morality  Nice and short  too  Please read this book  if you so find my plea convincing   What a perfect little book  The only bummer is that I knew the punchline  It would be even that much better if you could really enjoy the suspense and mystery Only 100 pages long  in my old but undated      edition   it is a quick moving story  The language is surprisingly direct for 19th century  the narrative stays pretty much on plot  Even I read it in just 4 sessions  Really really good short story  Liked it from the first page to the last  Boy  This was a quick read tho  took me 2 3 hours  The only con to this classic is the length  too short would of liked a full lenght novel  But anyhow well written  like I said a quick read great for those cold winter afternoons with a hot coffee  Enjoy it as much as I did  can t go wrong 5 5 I don t want to sound cruel  but I liked the way Edward Hyde stomped that little girl and murdered that MP without a single hesitation on his part  He was a cruel  sadistic person  but at least he lived  Dr  Jekyll was so afraid of even his own shadow  if he wasn t ready to deal with the consequences and repercussions of Edward Hyde  why make the formula in the first place  This work represents an apex in the English psychological thriller  Stevenson s insights into the nature of good and evil in the human psyche  particularly in relation to Dissociative Identity Disorder  are still relevant today  Not only is this an engaging thriller  but it has more practical things to say about these psychological disorders than most professional studies  Rating  5 stars Fantastic and horrifying  I expected this book to live up to the hype  you know  as one of the best classics ever  I was not disappointed  This book was a quick read The characters were all unique and the concept was great I ve always been a fan of Robert Louis Stevenson s writing style too I guess the only thing I didn t like about the story was the slowness of some of the scenes I suppose that can t be helped considering when it was written though Well maybe it doesn t have any flaws then Oh well  One of my favourite books of all time  This is a rare novel make you think about the good and evil contained within ourselves  the gothic theme just pulls you in and doesn t spit you out until the very end  Somehow Stevenson takes you on a journey to analyse humanities capacity for good and evil  for our own sense of duality of the human mind A must read   Brilliant  beautifully written  almost poetic despite it s supenseful genre  A fabulous study in human nature  choices  addiction  science  The original is so much better than the dilution it has become in pop culture  Truly a classic in writing  character  plot  theme and genre  Worth rereading every 10 years along with  Portrait of Dorian Gray  by Osacar Wilde  Better than any writer I ve read  Stevenson captures the essence of the ever present  hour by hour  good vs evil  struggle within each of us  I have been made to learn that the doom and burden of our life is bound forever on man s shoulders  and when the attempt is made to cast it off  it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure   This book is so amazing  I hestitate to say too much for fear that I would give something away  It is quite short  and not boring at all  I should read it again in the near future because I wasn t paying the closest attention the whole time  The perspective changes relatively often  but it just helps to tell the story  I loved it and read most of it in one sitting  this book is about the cientific he was investigated and created those liquids drugs for chance personality The dual personality he drank liquids Dr jekill shy and quiet person Mr hyde frienly and nice person however behind the story there is a crime But when he investigated the crime however that Dr Jekill knew that he was guilty when he chance the personality  This time I have read Spanish version and it was quite delightful because over each page I already now what was going to happen  I have to mentionate there is some words with ending prefixes like diminutives that there are not in english version  The story is told by a lawyer who is investigating awkward incidents over the city involving Dr  Jeckyll live   Para ser practicamente un la novela corta  creo que es uno de los mejores libros de ciencia ficcion o terror suspenso  porque juega perfectamente con cada cosa  Creo que mi personaje favorito es Edward Hyde  por ciertos aspectos  que se asemejan a muchos de mis villanos favoritos en la literatura y el cine  100  recomendable este clasico de la literatura   great to read the story that we all know   an early if not the first detective story Robert Louis Stevenson podria haber escrito mas paginas para contar esta historia  porque el tema da para mucho  Pero en las menos de cien paginas que tiene  me da la sensacion de haber leido un libro muy completo  toda una obra maestra  lo cual indica que mas palabras hubieran sobrado  Toda una obra maestra  un clasico imprescindible para todo lector  Je connaissais evidemment le concept du livre  mais je ne l avais encore jamais lu  Il fallait donc que je corrige cette lacune  J ai vraiment ete enchante par cet ouvrage  malgre l absence de surprise a la fin  car bien sur le livre est base en grande partie sur cette revelation finale  Seul petit bemol   j ai ressenti quelques longueurs sur la fin   He tenido este libro en la mira durante anos ya que regularmente es citado en otras obras y tenia curiosidad por saber de que trataba  Sin duda merece la pena leerlo  es bastante ligero y muy agradable    Y el tema que aborda es fascinante  Tiene a favor muchos factores  la epoca en la cual se narra  el lugar y las caracteristicas de sus personajes  A dark and thrilling tale that does more than go bump in the night  Stevenson has created a novel that is able to make every one of it s readers turn ravenously upon their own personal Hyde  to discover his movements and try discerning his shape  I envy the man who can read this book and not seriously examine their own personal faults and dualities   I listened to this book while traveling on a road trip  I am working with addicts of all kinds and this book just fascinated me  It is a tragedy  It reminded me of people I work with  I was especially interested in the last chapter when he explains how it all happened  It is so true to what I know of the addict  Not a happy book  but at teaching book  I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did  I tried reading it last year and just couldn t get into it  one of those right book at the wrong time things I guess  It was very suspenseful  I was intrigued what would happen next even though most people already know the gist of the story  And  I liked the way it was broken up into parts   This is one book that is without a doubt in my mind  timeless  It transcends gender  society  social class  and any number of classes you would suppose to place somebody as well as time  It is relevant today if not more so than when it was written  This is Dr  Jekyll s story of his inner demons and what happened when his Mr  Hyde was let out   I have read this book in all three times  and now I am reading it a fourth time with my LAL class  The plot is obvious  but that is only because it is such a well known book  I really enjoyed it  even though at times the writing was hard to decifer  Alll in all its a very good book and everyone one should read it at least once in their lifetime   I m listening to the CDs of this great classic  I don t have the time to read the paper copy  but I have plenty of time to listen while driving  I find the old English language a bit easier to understand with someone speaking rather than reading the printed word  This is another great classic  with descriptive language and a great mysterious plot  I love that I own this book  because sometimes it just needs to be read again  It certainly stands alone in great literature  in terms of the themes of human nature it explores  The final chapter letter  which I sometimes read twice upon finishing  is wonderfully profound  Pick it up and read it if you never have   you will not be sorry  What a powerful tale of transformation  evil and corruption  It is the epitome of good short stories  the length suits the plot and the meaning  I found myself haunted  not by the horror aspects of the story  but by the questions it posed   what does it mean to transform  What is within human power  An absolutely wonderful  provoking read  Lei el libro despues de haber visto no se que tantas versiones en el cine y television  La forma en que se desarrolla la historia es unica en el libro  No creo que hayan podido reflejar eso todavia en el cine o television  Lo curioso es que me quedo una idea vaga de la impresion que me causo  Solo recuerdo el impacto mental despues de leerlo   This is one of my all time favourite novels  I often wish I could devise a potion that would allow me to separate my normal self from my evil side  with the intentions of giving my evil the chance to breathe  then I realise I don t need a potion for that   it s natural to humans  Such a poignant and relevant account if mans condition   It is easy to see why and how so many fictions arose from the underlying themes present in this text  A quick read  but not without hours of critical thought and reflection to follow  it remains to be a relevant and worthwhile read  It transcends the temporal environment with which it was written   it is immediately accessible to readers today  At first I didn t understand what was happening but then I figured it out and loved it did you know the author wrote this book in three days but then threw it out cause he thought it wasn t good but his wife who had read it told him that it was a good read  So then he proceeded to rewrite it again in another three days  Again this is a great book  This book is great  It s short and a very good read  Again  Mr  Hyde is usually portrayed in movies  cartoons  or other books as being large and scary  However  in the book  he is actually shorter and hunched over  Even though he doesn t seem as threatening  Mr  Hyde is a cold blooded killer and that what makes part of the book frightening  Undoubtedly Stevenson s masterpiece  A Victorian tale of the uncanny with a rip roaring plot  filled even more than Conan Doyle with delicious details of a gaslit  moody  foggy eccentric London  Like Haggard s SHE  but accomplished with far greater style  this book is both an adventure and a kind of myth  full of deep but unexplainable meaning  This is a classical novel about Multiple Personality Disorder in which one character is good and the other is evil  This is a psychological topic that really fascinates me so it was great to read about this Check out the rest of my review here  http   jennieelouisee blogspot co uk     I read this for the first time when I was about 12 years old and really enjoyed it  I read it again in high school  I think it was 2004  and was able to appreciate it more at that age  I would definitely consider reading it again in the future A great piece of classic gothic fiction that I would recommend to pretty much anyone  I wish I could have read this without knowing the big reveal but nevertheless I still thought that this book was amazing  Not just the story itself but the questions it posed  It really got my mind going  I only wish I knew somebody else who has recently read this so I could have a discussion about it  Definitely one of my new favorites  I read this book last year in tandom with Fight Club and I have to say the expirience was mind blowing  Maybe it was because I read both multiple identity books at once  but the unfolding tale of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde was intoxicating  I had trouble putting it down  For anyone who likes mystery with science fiction  I recommend it  I really like fantasy fictions  This book lived up to its reputation as a fantastic book  I liked the idea of separated characters  By using metaphor and simile to describe Hyde s cruelty and inhumanity gave me a big shock  The author described beating  swearing and treading in vivid ways  so it was unconventional and shocking   No importa que conozcamos la historia ni que el topico este ya de lo mas trillado  porque cuando leemos este libro por primera vez resulta tan perfecto que es como si no hubieramos oido nada del libro  Es tan sobrio  tan sutil  tan directo al grano  tan perfecto  No sobra ni falta nada  Y por mas relecturas que se hagan nunca se agota   9 10  One of my favourite classics and a quick read  Like watching an old black and white movie  the reader can truly feel the shock and repulsion of the characters as the mysteries surrounding the evil Mr Hyde are described and unfolded  It has elements of Sherlock Holmes but which is both sinister and thought provoking  Super interesting  It made me think about humanity and society  and how we all relate to each other in this vast web of humanity  and how what is acceptable is what you need to learn to survive in some ways  I also found it interesting because it helped me think more about people s character  and more specifically my own   Stevenson is just brilliant  The construction of the story and the level of intensity  emotion  and suspense in his writing is incredible  This will always be one of my favorite classics  A must read  Il romanzo per antonomasia sul tema del doppio  della lotta tra bene e male  sulla ragione e sull istinto  Perche in ognuno di noi c e una lotta tra cio che e giusto e cio che e sbagliato  tra cio che vorremmo ma non possiamo fare  Straordinario  soprattutto nell ultima parte dedicata alla confessione del dr  Jekyll  I was fascinated by this classic tale by Robert Louis Stevenon about the good Dr  Jekyll who cannot avoid the temptation to live a double life through Mr  Hyde  Indulging in this duality eventually led to him downfall  I loved reading Dr  Jekyl s letter regarding how he went wrong   there is so much truth to be found there  I knew the story but had never read the book  It s easy to see why it s held up all these years  The story is just the right length     not long enough to make the reader question its plausibility but not so short that it skips on building suspense  It is not as dramatic as movies or plays portray  but I liked that about it  The book is actually really short  I can t believe I have not read it sooner   Jekyll and Hyde  is a universal aphorism today for anyone with two sides  so the surprise element is gone  But it is still a fun read if you don t mind the pomp of Victorian English  plus I really loved how the last chapter ties everything up  If you have any preconceptions of this book based on cartoons and or other horrible Hollywood movies  please disregard them all when reading this  I thought this was an awesone book  an actually really powerful look at human nature  All sorts of good stuff you could talk about after reading this  A short  but powerful read   Quite similar to Frankenstein  which is a great book  yet very much it s own  I found this short story an astounding read It is just a good book and I find myself at loss for a better description  The writing does well in building suspense through the mystery of a third person narrative I did not read The Bottle Imp though  Relatos intrigantes que incitam o leitor a refletir  I read this book as part of my Ba Hons History degree  and really enjoyed it  Having read it to see how it fits in with the new Victorian society  I found it fascinating  It keeps you hooked  and it s nothing like the screen adaptations  The imagery is fantastic  It s only a short book so definitely worth a read  Shocking  even disturbing novelette about how far one man will go to act on the promptings of his dual nature  Dr  Jekyll discovers  as most people do  that good and evil are not mutually exclusive  Powerful  well written  excellent work of British literature First read in 2009  since then  dozens of times  If you choose to make capital out of this accident   said he   I am naturally helpless  No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene   says he   Name your figure  These are the first words of Mr  Hyde in the novella  This has been adapted a million times over but there really is no equivalent to the original story   This book is amazing  I really love the conflict between the two personas and I can t read this enough times  It is very short  I  who usually take at least a few good months to finish a book  read this novela in a day   Probably helped that I just couldn t put it down  I highly recommend reading this  Wow  I didn t expect to like this book as much as I did  Unlike most of the books that I ve read from around this time period  this one doesn t rant like crazy    cough  crime and punishment  What a fantastic book  Yes  we all know how the story goes which is testament to what a great tale this is  The way Robert L Stevenson uses words to describe his characters is just amazing  I felt there was a gentleness about his writing that I really loved  I would recommend this novella to everyone  This book is about a person that has two parts of his life going   Dr  Jekyll is really kind   and Mr  Hyde is really rude   they re the same person but very different   I liked this book   it s really famous and it should be   I like how the two parts of his  life  are and    i m not spoiling it    Tb  qr t lkthyr

SO much more enthralling  I loved to see how excited they were to  crack the code  of the book  It s a hard book to read in 7th grade  but they got totally into it  The final chapter of this book gave me chills  Why did I grow up thinking this was some sort of horror book   Completely brilliant  I love his take on how we essentially decide the fate of our own character by choosing which desires to act upon  Everyone should read this multiple times in their life  Holy       that was a good book  Wow  Best classic I have ever read  No competition  Jekyll and Hyde is incredible  It is now up there with my favourite books  Thank you  Robert Louis Stevenson  I enjoyed this short read  We ve always heard some phrase such as  He s acting like a Mr  Hyde     but I ve never read the actual book before  It taught great truths that there really is no such thing as  my public life and my private life   We are a composite of the good and bad we do  Amazing characterization of the battle of good and evil on going within each individual  Classic  This is an old classic  Stevenson reportedly destroyed his first draft of this tale because its message horrified him  Finally  he decided to rewrite what he had drafted  The theme about the duality of man is still very interesting today but sadly we are not so shocked or horrified any more  Loved this novella  I ve always wanted to read Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  but never got around to it until now  I loved Stevenson s writing style  He really did a great job with showing the reader what went on in Henry Jekyll s mind  I would definitely love to read this again sometime  It was a great book and I had fun reading it  I will make sure to read more books like this in the future The writing was excellent and the characters where fun to imagine and read about  I loved the setting  I always find books describing a sinister and foggy Uk very fascinating  I LOVE Jekyll and Hyde  it s one of my favourite classics  Even though I studied it again  in Y10 English and everyone  hates  those books  I honestly thought it was really good at the time and still to this day  I loved the mystery and the discovery and the symbolism and just everything   This novel is a brilliant demonstration of why a person can t have a double life and that one can t compartmentalize forever  if you let your demons take over they will destroy you and you won t be able to save the good side  it will die as well because once it s tainted  it s too late  Stevenson packs more intrigue  mystery  and suspense into 88 pages than most other authors manage to fit into 1 000  Even though the premise of this story is common knowledge  it was still captivating  I can only imagine how much more captivating it would be without knowing the outcome  I read this on the plane coming home from Germany  Dr  Jekyll s character struck me as being far creepier than I had expected  and that says nothing of Mr  Hyde  Nonetheless  it was a fantastic book  a surprisingly short read  and much cooler than it s secular presentation often suggests  A tragic story of a doctor who split his instinct and reason  It gives me the shivers to imagine my losing control of body and soul I like the story line in which readers have to wait in suspense till the final chapter of Dr  Jekyll s narrative that discloses everything  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde     I grew up watching the many different versions in movie form  but never read the original story  As always  the book surpasses the film  A very cool book  Recommended to anyone who enjoys a good old fashion horror story  Para analizarMe gusto este clasico con un tema de personalidades en conflicto  muchas veces las cosas no son lo que parece  los tiempos cambian y aun se siguen observando estos casos de personalidad actualmente  Recomiendo leer este libro y analizar  This is one of Robert Louis Stevenson s best books  You think you ve read it because you ve heard about it all your life  maybe you ve seen a screen or stage adaptation  but you really haven t read the book until you ve read the ending  Stay with it  the ending is worth it  This was good contrast between the facets of a human  The important point is that within the same person there is both good and evil which rises up to the surface give the chance And that this evil must be controlled if not it can consume the whole being Of that person  While I have seen many movie and tv show versions of this story I had never read it  It was really good and I think it was my favorite version  go figure  You all know the story or do you  It s really short so you should all give it a try and see if you really do know the story  I always avoided reading this book because I thought it would be a whole bunch of nonsence  but I was wrong  It was short and to the point  unbeliveable as I thought  yet by the end you couldn t not believe it  Strange but I m so glad I read it because I really enjoyed it  Obsessed with Victorian Fiction  I think I might be  but I guess it is the narrative and grim London environment   Doctor Jekyll discovered an amazing potion  one that gets rid of the most undesired characteristics  but it goes out of control  I utterly loved it to bits     A classic that doesn t read like a classic  I don t know how I have gone so long without ever reading this  Even though I knew the ending  which I would be lying if I said I didn t know it because of Alvin and the Chipmunks cartoon  it was still suspenseful and entertaining  A fine work without the reader doing anything but going for the ride  drinking up the mood and setting  letting the shadows creep and the insanity of the protagonist grow in its fever  As a fable about addiction  it is unflinching and more true than a simple retelling of facts  Perhaps the ambiguity is even more delightful than the superb prose  You never know if you can fully trust Jekyll s narrative  There are so many unanswered questions about Hyde  Yet even in its succinctness it satisfies more deeply than novels many times its length  Fabulous  Fantastic short novel  Quite a bit more readable than I expected given its age  A blast to read original source material that otherwise I was obviously familiar with only from secondary sources  The ending was a little weaker than I d have liked   so call it 4 5 of 5  What a great story   And an easy read   I was intrigued by the depiction of the doctor s addiction to evil   and getting away with it  Wonder if that s an innate human trait  Would we all enjoy showing our evil side if we knew that we would never have to pay the price  So good  If only all mystery thriller horror novels could have such excellent writing  Could not put it down  The introduction written by Vladimir Nabokov in my introduction did not do much for me   I m certainly glad I did not read it before I read the actual story   A sad sad tale  But so true to life when we let the  dark side  into our lives  we risk the chance that it takes control and the value of our true self becomes lost in the mists of Mr Hyde Robert Louis Stevenson is a classic writer and this book is well written  Okay so my ratings are usually very generous  but this novel  more like short story  truly deserved 5 stars  Was a bit rough at first but then you get used to the writer s style  It was a short and entertaining read and makes one ponder about our  other selves   I really wish I didn t already know the secret of this book  the end would have been amazing otherwise  MAN  Robert Lewis Stevenson sure has an amazing grasp on the human psyche  I love to read his work  The end has both me and my husband with dropped jaws    classic   It is such an interesting book  most of it anyway  sometimes it gets a little annoying  I hate rambling  And it has been re portrayed in just about every childhood cartoon  and movie     the best one  The Bugs Bunny Show  AWESOME  Go Mr  Hyde     a suspense thriller which has provided a bold and maturity experience throught the book  I can easly add this book to my favorite thrillers  it was quite unpredictable when it ended with zero  the narrative capability played a big roll for the very rare experience Such a unique plot  The writing may be difficult for those in well versed in the classical style  my teenage students found it difficult to get past that  but the story wouldn t have been effective if the prose wasn t written in this way  A great classical work  WOW  What a great piece of writing filled with description  mystery and suspense  This short little book is powerful which gives a glimpse into the struggles and themes of Good and Evil in a person s life  Have a go  Great READ Rating Clarification  5 Stars Al saber como era el final y el meollo de todo  pense que quizas su lectura me resultaria aburrida  pero la verdad es que me ha gustado mucho  sobre todo las reflexiones finales  acerca de la dualidad del hombre  el bien y el mal  Lectura recomendadisima   ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ  I would definitely recommend this book to other people  The plot is so interesting and amusing  If you like horror and gothic novel  then this is an awesome read  I would definitely recumbent this to other people  Awesome book  I wish it wasn t so old  because time spoiled it for me  It s so damn good that spoilers are referenced everywhere  Looney toons spoiled it for me with the damn Hyde Tweety bird  This will definitely be listed as one of my favorite read   One of the classic horror tales of all time  Right up there with the Picture of Dorian Gray and Murders in the Rue Morgue  The forerunners of our horror movies of today  Unfortunatley  these tales are much more chilling than stories of ax murderes   This is another classic that I can t believe I hadn t read until now   Darrell and I read this one together as well  We were talking about it for weeks  It really gets you thinking  and it really is somewhat suspenseful  but not in a frightening way  This is a fantastic book  It is nothing short of brilliant  the way in which it injects suspense and portrays the duality of human beings  The line between good and evil and moral and dissolute is tampered with very finely and in Dr  Jekyll s case ignorantly  This book was amazing  Although it s a very well known story I bet not many people know that after writing this Stevenson gave the manuscript to his wife to read  she didn t like it so he burnt it  Three days later he wrote it out again   Lucky for us  The very idea that using drugs to alter one s personality could be dangerous was so ahead of it s time  I think that this should be mandatory reading for anyone who works for a large pharmaceutical company or is in the power to prescribe mind altering drugs  I read this for the first time  after taking a course on Scottish author Ian Rankin last summer  I was not aware of the undertones from Stevenson in Rankin  so I am learning the Stevenson first hand  It s not the horror movie you think you remember  I loved it  I don t have much to say by way of review  especially since this is such a short story  but I will say that I may have identified with Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde a little more than I expected  So glad I finally got around to reading it  Your Fav British Literature TaleThis is a quick read  If you did not do yourself a favor in high school and read it do so now  The religious and psychological allusions are a pleasure to sift through as you turn each page  Este libro ha sido un deleite  Si no lo han leido es tiempo de hacerlo  If you have never read this book or have not read it in many years  give it a try  It is great  creepy fun   foggy London   like Dickens but  unlike in CD  ends without the fog every lifting  Of course  there is the deeper message as well   A masterpiece in exploring the nature of humanity s dichotomy    good versus evil  This short work captured imagination of the author while adding elements of psychological analysis  which was in its infancy at this time  Recommended read  what a great short story that has definitely stood the test of time  The plot build up and suspense was great  even knowing the story  I think it helps to read it all in one day as dragging it out may make it less suspenseful  A terrific read  Ever the classic writer RLS has brought us the wonderful tale of good vs  evil  How good and evil reside in all of us constantly battling each other  fighting for supremacy  As the saying goes  The one that wins is the one that you feed the most   A good one and an evil one  We have a hard time admiting it  but when it comes to face the truth  it is there barefeet  smiling back at us  I love the helpless way that this book has of showing how the human being can be doomed by his evil self  Of course  it s a classic  Since I rarely read along these lines  it was difficult to follow  And yes  it was very  very good  Victorian England was very vividly described  The contrast in social status  the horror of man s base nature  whoa  What s to say about a classic like  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   There s nothing more to say about it  what wasn t said already But I definitely enjoyed reading it  even if it was  rough  because of the old writing style  Still  a great book  With every day  and from both sides of my intelligence  the moral and the intellectual  I thus drew steadily nearer to the truth  by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck  that man is not truly one  but truly two   I loved this book  I read it quickly because I couldn t put it down  Even though it was written in the early 1900s I found it easy to read and relatable  I put it down and felt like it had described certain feeling incredibly well   La eterna lucha del bien contra el mal  algunos dicen que el bien siempre triunfa sin embargo en muchas ocasiones el mal es mas poderoso y tentador  Un excelente libro vigente en cualquier epoca altamente recomendable para adolescentes  Them being the same person was foreseen but i read it with doubt and constant guessing it shines a light trough human duality and us being so weak against our inhumanly desires I loved this book and i think its a must read classic I loved reading this classic  Interesting story that can be read on multiple planes  I liked the idea of a dual nature within each of us  and the imaginative twist on the fact that we all do war with ourselves from time to time  I absolutely loved this book  Stevenson s writing style is very pleasant to read and the story is interesting in many aspects  If you read between the lines a multitude of lessons are taught about morality  social behaviour  et cetera  It s safe to say that this is one of the most intriguing books I ve ever read  The contrast between good and evil and the intense plot makes it impossible to stop reading  With that  I ve decided to continue reading book by the author   This is one of my favorite stories  It is a fantastic allegory on the good and evil in human nature  The variation between these two natures are carefully illustrated by the characters and settings  I highly recommend this novella  This was an amazing story  Even with everyone knowing the end of the story  it s fairly exciting to see what the characters think and how the original story progresses  Definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in a novella   An interesting book to read  a book about the dark side of a man  about the monster that live in each of us  and the foolish idea to feed the best about the nature of good and evil and the duality that can exist within one person  I cannot tell you how many times I thought as I was in the thick of it   WHY haven t I read this before   A serious gem  It is in our pop culture vernacular for good reason  and so very worth the small amount of time it takes to read  IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHO PEOPLE ARE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO THEM   THIS BOOK IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED RECENTLY MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES  MR  JEKYLL ANDMR  HIDE ARE THE SAME GUY  BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT  I m glad I read this book at my current age  Had I been asked to read it in high school  I wouldn t have gotten it  I found it to be a wonderful critique of Victorian society with Jungian undertones It s a classic for a reason  Unlike most people  I wasn t made to read this in school  I chose to read this simply because my brother loved it  and he hates reading   It was every bit as good as he said it was  I finished it after sitting down to read it twice  I loved this  Some of the writing and descriptions really reminded me of Wilde s Dorian Gray  which makes sense they re from the same genre time period  Highly recommend it  especially for people with a love of the creepy and the gothic  A short and delightful gothic mystery  While the reader already knows what Dr  Jekyll s friend and lawyer does not  the story is entertainingly unveiled with the perfect touch of melodrama  The sci fi  big reveal  is almost a let down   loved this book  I think it was very interesting  the writing style easy to follow  I love the setting and the change of perspective  and also the fact that the reader gets to know the solution to the mystery step by step   klassesiehe auch meine Kommentare This is a great collection of Stevenson s shorter works  Besides Jekyll and Hyde  which is awesome in itself  this collection includes  The Beach of Falesa  and  The Ebb Tide   both of which are amazing but not as well known  This is a great classic  This story brings to life the battle each one of us has within ourselves  Dr  Jekyll calls it his  dualtiy of purpose   The struggle of good versus evil  told in that colorful language of classics  Istoriia o dvoistvennosti chelovecheskoi natury  rasskazannaia na primere uvazhaemogo v Londone doktora Genri Dzhekilla i otvratitel nogo karlika Edvarda Khaida  kotoromu Dzhekill zaveshchaet vsio svoio imushchestvo  Neozhidanno shikarno  I loved it  So so so so so good  Once you get into the language it goes by wicked fast  and every page is another mystery  I recommend this very highly   it s a classic for a reason  So  go  Read it  Read it now  I ll wait     One of my new favorite books This story was surprisingly good  I wasn t expecting it to have so much depth   You don t have the courage to kill us both    You misunderstand  Hyde  It s courage that keeps me from doing so   I really liked this book  It was so scary and so interesting at the same time  I read this for my English class and everyone disliked it  of course I kept my mouth closed  because I loved it  I would recommend this book    was the first book for the author to read   one of my friends gave it for me and really was more than awesome   like an enternal dialogue   he had written the thoughts of many others and appear them in a very beautiful story    Robert Louis Stevenson  What hasn t he done that isn t great  I ask you  Anyway  a Victorian  what if  like Dorian Gray  RLS has some very interesting concepts going on here  More of a novella than novel   it s a quick read  Un clasico imperdible  De lectura facil y muy ameno  El tema del doble esta bien planteado y la ambientacion bien lograda  Con su muy buen toque de misterio  que no hace mas que hacerlo recomendable para quien no lo haya leido  Everyone has a two sides  the evil one and the angel one in this books Dr Jekyll separate them   How can control the evil one  and keep still the angel This is a great book  and I feel great after read this  D Daebakk  Increiblemente bien contada  magnificamente bien estructurada  y con un tema apasionante  la dualidad bien mal personificadas en un hombre capaz de lo mejor y de lo peor  Magistral  sublime    me hace sufrir y me deleita  I have read this a long time ago and it s one of my favorites  til now that I pursue to read books like this  for example  stories by Edgar Allan Poe  I really like the suspense and stuff created by the atmosphere   Great story and a clear presentation of the outcome of living a double life   which we are all tempted to do  Read alongside  Frankenstein  for two alternate presentations on human nature and the cause of evil  I am no expert but I thought this book was well written and had some very interesting views on the human mind or soul  Really interesting  Plus the author got his story across well in such a short book  I love that  I read this a couple of years ago in my english class and I was so excited to read it  This typically isn t my type of story  but I ended up loving it  The eerieness and point of view of the story was very interesting   I ve read this book alot of times but i didnt read it this year in 6th grade so i decided that i would go on ahead and read it again to add to my 40 book goal and loved it again this is one of my favorite books   I had forgotten what an incredible read this was  I could not put it down once I d started reding it again  I think I m going to have to re read a bunch of the classics to get the full punch of the story  I loved this  In my opinion this is the best book ever written  I ve read it around twenty plus times  The main story has been duplicated so many times in so many ways that its obvious I m not the only person who loves this book   Good human nature vs  bad human nature  Or ego vs  id  if you prefer  Or perhaps it s frontal lobe vs  limbic system  Either way  this is the classic tale of being overcome by the darker side of one s human nature  The classic for ever by Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson  I love this book better than the Treasure Island  This book supplied a great psychological case of multiple personalities for subsequent crime fictions   This book may be perceived simply as a book of the  horror  genre as the films of this book portray  but I consider it a tragedy  It is the story of a man whose life is out of control and who is battling good and evil   Voi  care aveti nenorocul de a fi dubli  luptati cu adversarul interior  cavalerul cel rau  chiar daca va trebui sa va loviti pe voi insiva si sa va raniti cu propria voastra spada     Robert Louis Stevenson this is amazing story about how drugs can destroy your personality in just one second  it shows all the things that we are able to do under the effects of drugs that without we will not even think about it    A truly creepy book about our dark side  Hard to believe it was written when it was  Never misses beat  I loved it when I read it as a kid and got even more out of it as an adult  Highly recommended  I loved it  There is a reason that it is a classic  The reality that allowing just a little evil in our lives creates a pull that is sometimes too great to withstand is very apparent  I would recommend it  The most powerful argument for the duality of man  Not even Freud himself could convince me any better than this masterpiece  It was enlightening to discuss this piece with dr cutchins and dr Thorne Murphy   Excellent classic that I ve been meaning to read for years  So glad I took the time to finally add this to my list   Even though I knew the basic story  the suspense persisted to the end  The exploration of evil in humanity and our ability to contain it was fascinating  even enlightening  I think I ll read this one again  one of the inspirations  along with the frankenstein monster  for marvel comics  Hulk  a second writing  steven s wife threw a fit at the first one  he threw it into the fireplace  later he rewrote it  Read this book for my Victorian Lit class  I enjoyed it so much  I read it twice  Professor Danahay was actually the one who taught it and wrote the introductions and essays within  Fantastic professor   This book was mysterious and fun  and I admittedly loved how short it was   The amount of analysis that can be poured into such a small story is amazing  I love the battle of good vs  evil  Classic  This is a great

professor   This book was mysterious and fun  and I admittedly loved how short it was   The amount of analysis that can be poured into such a small story is amazing  I love the battle of good vs  evil  Classic  Part of my romp through the classic horror genre  I had not read a lot of this era  but having read several books from this era  the style was familiar  A good weekend read  I really like how the author personifies the internal struggle of good versus evil by making the two philosophies into people  Dr  Jekell being good and Mr  Hyde being evil   so everyone  i think  knows this story before they read it   it was still wonderful and very scary  Had i not known the story it would have been beyond scary  What a great read   It is amazing how one person can be two people  This is a fantastic thriller about a scientist and his horrible double  another part of himself   This is an amazing book  I was pleasantly surprised by this book  I like how the story was told  the pace of the book  and how it was written  The symbolism of Mr  Hyde was wonderful and very well done  I knew the story but it s the first time I ve read the book  It is short and very easy to read  with an addictive narrative that made it almost impossible for me to stop reading  This book is awesome  If you haven t read it you need too  A great exploration into good and evil in the human spirit  A short but very engaging and thought provoking read   You ll never know something if the details are not laid on you by the person experiencing it  Prejudice brings no good     A story with unexpected contents  Really unpredictable   The style that RLS wrote this in was not what I was expecting  A third person narrative then a first person narrative after we find out what happens  It was a very fast read   I loved this book  I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn t longer  but I suppose it s better to be left wanting more  than wearily trudging though a tediously long story    stevenson is probably in my top five as far as authors go  while technically this isn t  gothic  literature it fits the mold well enough  great story written superbly well  The ending is unbeliveable  It was so exciting that i read it in one day I think that everyone should read this book as all the books in the great illustrated collection  Utterson is worse than than the man who mettled to much and would have gotten away with it too if it wasn t for you damn kids in scooby doo  Let Hyde live for christ sake Amazing book about the dangerous of exploring one s psyche too much  There is a dark side to every man  If we relish too much in the dark side  it s hard to live in the light   An intelligent and scary story that everyone knows through stage  film and TV adaptions  The book is in fact shorter but works better for it as there is no padding  A good read  Great classic horror novel  The use of the characters to talk about the duel nature of mankind is what makes it so resonant  Great book to read alongside  The Lucifer Effect   I actually listened to this on a Playaway from the library  my new find that I m so excited about   and really enjoyed it  Very interesting study of the human conscience  It absolutely amazes me that Stevenson  before the time of modern psychology and psychotherapy  could write such a remarkable account of the implications of intrapersonal duality  Absolutely delicious  Fortunately for me  this is a short book  so I didn t have to read it at night  I loved it s themes  and the writing is  of course  fantastic  first half is decent  where it sets up the mystery of Hyde  Second half is phenomenal  talking about vices and the impulses of humans taking control over their lives  I was surprised at how short this book is  for being such a well known and quoted story  It s a powerful allegory as well as a gripping story  I highly recommend it  Loved the writing  There were so many amazing sentences  He made the words come to life and his views on life had me thinking about the book for many days after   If it were not so famous  this would be a terrific mystery  Thankfully it is still quite enjoyable as a novel  and its philosophy of man s nature is well worth a ponder  This was more interesting than I thought it would be Im thinking about reading Treasure Island I some how found a copy at my house from the late 1880 s I love old books Wonderful book and very inventive  Stevenson is a master and very underrated  Really  I ll take him over Dickens and other Victorian writers any day of the week  The story make me a bit dizzy  I need to read it like three time to know the story very well  Great story  It moves me to tear as Mr  Hyde a k a Dr  Jekyll died   Read when I was young  read again a couple of years a go and saw a whole differnt story and representation of Victorian England and how repressed it was  Classic This book teaches the sides of human beings cannot be broken  If we separate our good and evil self  it is to the point of extreme whatever we will do to this world  Un libro muy intrigante de principio a fin  sin duda su final es algo inesperado y muy sorprendenteRecomendado para aquellos novatos en lecturas de detectives  Masterly crafted  Its dark and sinister  But thought provoking  It reminds the reader that there is a monster in all of us  It is the best short story i have ever read  I thought this book was really good  It was mysterious and exciting  I thought we found out about Dr  Jekyll too early  I really liked it though  Niamh aged 12 Very quick book to read  extremely interesting story that flowed very well  Different than my previous conceptions of Jekyll Hyde from popular media certainly   One of the most astonishing stories I ve ever read  You will sometimes feel that you re reading two stories  the other one hidden  darker and more profound  Must read  Sebuah mahakarya Robert Louis Stevenson yang telah diterjemahkan ke berbagai bahasa dan diadaptasi ke lebih 40 judul film yang diproduksi di berbagai belahan dunia  This is such great book  I think it is a metaphor on addiction  Where one starts drinking durgs and at firt it is fine and fun but pretty soon the drugs take over  We all have 2 sides  A good side and a bad side How would it be if we could separate those side  Be an entirely good person     or maybe an entirely bad person   i really enjoyed the brief but critical afterward which helped me think of some parts of the story differently  i believe i ll be thinking about this one for a while   Great story  I already knew the basics of Jekyll and Hyde  but was totally engrossed anyway  I m usually not the biggest fan of Victorian fiction  but this one s economy is nonpareil  And I love the introductory essay from Nabokov in my edition  Wow  I read it for my first time in 2007 and feel I ve been seriously short changed for not having read it earlier  It is a book that makes you think  Love it  Excelente libro  por algo es un clasico  Advertencia  al ser una historia tan conocida  al leerlo hay que tratar de ignorar que uno ya conoce la trama  The best psychological thriller mystery I have ever read  A completely gripping page turner  It will ALWAYS be my favorite  My version is only 116 pages  Hollywood would have you belive that Dr Jekyll was the innocent bystander in this book  suprise suprise they got it wrong Read it and see what I mean Possible the scariest book I ve ever read  The interplay of psychology  sociology and taunt storytelling far outshine any of the second rate imitations  I liked it  it was short and to the point  I don t get the werewolf metaphor  I do however get the drug abuse metaphor  Didn t like how it ended however   This bok was crazy good I wish there was a second book  It is totally svary though so if you er not into a good horror stry then you should be careful    An insightful parable of the conflict of man  striving to conquer the body s appetites vs  resignation and self rationalization  A top classic  I love books that use a simple story to examine a deeper issue   such as the nature of good and evil in Jekyll   Hyde  Easy to see why this is a classic  I read this in college and then listened to it this year on Craftlit  Apparently  I had forgotten quite a bit of it  A really interesting piece of fiction  Amazing book This has got to be the best Classic that I have ever read  The story is thought provokeing and interesting while intrigueing aswell  I only read  the strange case of dr  jekell and mr  hyde  out of this collection  I loved it  It was an awesome commentary on human nature  Loved this book  Found it hard to put it down  the element of suspense was so strong in some chapters  Would totally recommend it to anyone   Everyone must decide whether their true self will become an angel or a demon and in the end each one will reap the consequences of this choice   shq hdh  lrwy  blrGm ny l tdhkr jmy  tfSylh w dhlk lqr ty lh mn zmn   w lkny mzlt dhkr slwbh lmmyz wlmthyr ldhy j lny Hb lrwyt    Loved it   Jekyll   Hyde is a classic story and an incredibly important shorter novel on the nature and attractiveness of sin and wickedness and its addiction        Here then  as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end   I fell in love with Stevenson s writing after the first line  it s a beautifully well written gothic novella that I will reread for sure  first audio book I listened to and so was so great  i just let myself dive in the story and loved its  twistedness   if that s even a word   You start a question  and it s like starting a stone  You sit quietly on the top of a hill  and away the stone goes  starting others     LOVED  got pretty scary towards the end  but I m glad I took the time to read it  even though I  thought  I already knew the story Definitely one of the greats  A wonderful novella that highlights important questions about good  evil  and the human condition   A very interesting story that shows the different  faces  of human beings  This is one of those classics that everyone should read  This classic  monster  story is more of a questioning of innate human nature and a look at people might do if they could get away with it  A quick  interesting  and simple read  Loved the themes of hypocrisy of society and how people are capable of both good and evil   If you ve never read the original  it is definitely worth it    Much different from how it s usually portrayed in pale imitations   A wonderful book  and it d be six times as amazing if we didn t all already know the big reveal  Stevenson really captures a core myth  Full of suspense and thrilling anticipation  this book should be read atleast once in your lifetime  Get to know your alter ego better   P It took me two times to  get into  this novel  however  once I did   I loved it  Wow  what a well written  thought provoking book   Very interesting and well done   I read this  Frankenstein  and Dracula more or less in a row in high school and this one was the best  So many underlying spiritual themes in this story  Actually  they re not even underlying  they re just there  Scary how relatable it is  Given its cultural status and continually referenced character dynamics  was surprised how enjoyable and even fresh the story seemed  oh gosh  it s about a man who got dissosiative identity disorder  Dr  Jekyll  He made an potion which can made his dark side are real  I love this book I was expecting this book to be scary and all  but I wasn t expecting it to be written so beautifully  Now I know why this is a classic  qr th mndh snwt w mzlt   shqh kthyr    Hbbt lfkr  w lshkhSyt    shqt lHbk  w lnhy    mwqn   n mn  nh mn  sbb dmny llklsykyt    It s a pity that no one can appreciate the story as written  because who doesn t know the relationship between Dr  Jekyll   Mr  Hyde  This was a great story to listen to on audiobook  Even though it s a classic and you know the basics  it still felt mysterious and scary  Clearly a classic from cover to cover  Again  a reflection on a seemingly dualist human nature  and how that would not ever be true  I found the type of English hard to read  at first  But soon I was engaged and found it to be beautiful language  Very well told story  I only read the introduction and chapters 1 3  I think the introduction is very well put  Got my attention into reading the story   Este libro es un clasico literario  es como que no te esperas lo que pasa  siempre estas en suspenso y pues la trama es muy interesante  One of the best classic books I ve read so far   I really enjoyed this book  There was a lot of twist that kept me guessing  i would recommend this to anyone that i meet   Iv wanted to read this for years  an finally got my hands on it  Its interesting to see how different it is from the movies Readings of this book since January 1st 2012 1  January 14th 2012 2

in Romanian translation  I m planning to read it in the original as well in the near future  Very good indeed  especially for such a short story written so quickly  Schools should put this on any O level English syllabus  This is one of my favorite books  It is very much a critique of Victorian society and the struggle of man between good and evil  i love this book actually although most of my friends didnt understand this story  and  yes  this is the book for my syllabus  a wonderful retelling of mans struggle against his  sinful  nature and the desperate desire to attain a purely virtuous self Such a sad tale  a fascinating read and insight to twin personalities I think everyone should read this sometime in their life  Definitely a classic  Very good read  And obviously very good motion picture material  again  and again  and again     The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  by Robert Louis Stevenson  is a short classic about the duality of man  That book is good because it is a book that is all about finding out about Mr  Hyde and you don t want to stop reading it  fkr  nfSm lshkhSyh w lzdwjyh mwjwjh  ndn kln f l wlkn bnsb mtfwth lqSh ry  h wmtfrdh wmmyzh jd wfkrth

you ask me  A really disturbing  dark story about false redemption and it s consequences  Enjoyed it as a thought provoking story  An incredible pre Freud Jung depiction og shadows and descent in drug addiction and depravity in a short novel  Definitely a literary classic  The premise is fantastic and it is one of those stories that will go on forever  A classic that is so applicable today  Much like Frankenstein  it has much to say about humanity  Short and fast  RLS draws a wonder filled illustration of the self loathing each of us have when our evil nature grows manifest   At first it gave me nightmares which is a pretty easy thing to do then I read it again and it was pretty good  I found this last night  I can t wait to start it  It s been on my mental  to read  list for the longest
