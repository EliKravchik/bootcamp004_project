this was a creepy book for me because I see so much of it happening now that I have to make myself stop being anti government and despondent  Just one big idea is the compressing of language until it is impossible to talk about anything thought provoking and then I see everybody texting and I realize that a group of letters strewn together is actually code for a whole sentence and I think Oh No  It s already happening  This book will always be a classic  no matter what generation reads it  Things in 1984 have not changed much and don t plan on changing any time soon  But the ending was difficult to understand  why does he love big brother  Why do we love oppression domination is it in our nature    There is this Iraqi saying lbzwn yHb khnG I wonder if it applies here      fy kl mkn

express his thoughts in a diary and pursues a relationship with a woman It s terrifying to think of a world in which your own children are spies for the government and can turn you in  where cameras are watching you 24 7 My mind did wander quite a bit while I was reading this book  thinking of the eerie possibilities  trying to find parallels between what I was reading and what I was observing in society  LOVED this book  I would recommend to any and everyone  So many interesting concepts   Capolavoro  niente da aggiungere  This is a classic that I ve been meaning to read for ages  so when I saw it on the Google Play Store  I grabbed it for my Galaxy Note  The year is 1984  the world is at war and Big Brother not only controls everything and everyone  but he can also see what everyone is doing  Every home and place of work has a telescreen which spits out propaganda  news  and can watch your every move In this world  there is no privacy  There s no individual thought  There s only fear and hate  Children are horrid little spies  marriages are organised  and betrayal happens all the time  It s a barren society with no colour It s also where Winston Smith s story takes place  He s in the Outer Party and works at the Ministry of Truth  He plays by the rules just like everyone else  but when he starts secretly writing in a journal his whole life changes  Now he s starting to think about things  he s starting to question why the past needs to be altered  and can actually remember instances of changes being made that he knows are false  He s also noticed Julia  When the two start seeing each other in secret  they both know they re breaking the rules and will eventually get caught  But neither one of them cares because Winston is falling in love with her  and has become obsessed with the rebellion    I kept hoping that Winston and Julia would just runaway and escape the Party  but of course they don t do that  This book is an amazing read  It s well written  hooked me in right away  has some pretty elaborate worldbuilding  and a narrator that you can really feel for  I have to admit that at one point the info got a bit much  but I soon forgot about that because of the devastating situation that followed    It s a sad story about a man who wants the world to be different but has to pretend he s compliant like everyone else  It s also a story about forbidden love and the strength of the human spirit  It s also about endurance and being pushed so far that breaking point becomes the only solution It s one of the best books I ve ever read  yet at the same time it saddened and angered me  It s depressing  and the ending tore me up inside because it s just so hopeless  But I have to admit that it s fitting  and certainly didn t go the way I expected Yeah  I loved it  This is one of those books that leaves a lasting impression on you   Kniga bil    Istoriia liudini  shcho gotuvalasia stati muchenikom  ale v ostanniu mit  zhakhlivii strakh smerti ster

ability to eradicate crime  While I m all for eradicating crime  once we step into the realm of limiting privacy for the sake of  safety   I begin to worry  Our individuality is as sacred as our lives  We cannot give up one to strengthen the other because there really is no point to doing that Orwell creates a masterful world full of characters we can all  disturbingly  relate to  Winston s most degrading act  at least in his eyes  of  view spoiler  betraying Julia by begging for her to suffer via the rats in his place is relatable even as it is atrocious  because Orwell portrays that scene so vividly that you cannot doubt that Winston had no ability to hold to his morals  which is terrifying  Usually  dystopias allow us to see through the eyes of one who beats the system  and it is depressing to realize that  given those sorts of situations  we would likely be among those who blindly follow the system  or are at the very least defeated in the end even if we did try to fight  1984 has a protagonist who loses in the end  He completely loses everything he is  not just the fight he was trying to wage against an unfair world  Winston Smith is  in the end  nothing more than a shell of a man who has no inclination to fight the system because he has been warped to the point that he agrees with the system that warped him using horrifying means   hide spoiler  This book is applicable to all ages in time because as long as there are people  there will be those who desperately desire power and will do anything to attain it  and there will also be those who will seek power with the intent to only use it for good  Unfortunately  both types of people tend to make bad decisions  though one is aware of how horrible their decisions are and the other believes they are doing what they are doing for the greater good  and that they will stop their atrocities as soon as the world is fair  which it won t be  because they are helping to make it cruel and unfair  They ll split

can I say  This book was amazing  I don t want to interpret it because hundreds of others have done so already  so I will discuss why I liked it and why you will too The prose is perfectly formed  not a word out of place  Orwell was a perfectionist of the highest order  I wonder how many drafts he went through while writing this novel  Despite the perfection  the prose is rather formulaic  It is the themes and story that were revolutionary  most contemporary dystopian novels ride off this book s back The book started off rather slow and  because the prose was so formulaic  it took me awhile to read  However  after the first few chapters it picks up and once it does you cannot put it down  without spoiling anything  the latter half of the novel is particularly engaging I think the thing I like best about this novel is the attention to detail  I have already mentioned that Orwell was a perfectionist  and it shows  Just read the appendix on Newspeak  the official language of Oceania  futuristic Britain   How many other writers would create an entire language just for a single book  If it was a fantasy series  maybe  but a standalone novel Orwell manages to paint a depressing and believable alternate world of constant war and fear  I definitely recommend it  no matter how old you are  Also  Kim il sung  founder of North Korea  clearly read this book when it came out  it has North Korea written all over it    Zm rwy  bltrykhsw knt tHb lsys  m tkrhh wdh knt l tqr  lrwyt wlqSS bshkl  m hdhh lrwy  tkhtlf   nh  Zm rwy  bltrykh Orwell s 1984 is a brilliant  although very bleak  novel which depicts a totalitarian future  All activities and thoughts are being watched by the government   Big Brother   and the truth is constantly being manipulated to the point where the society no longer has a history  The plot revolves around Winston Smith  a man who works for the Ministry of Truth by doctoring various documents and photographs in order to fit the current narrative that the government is telling citizens  Smith begins to challenge the Big Brother by committing small acts of rebellion  It starts with keeping a journal  then leads to a love affair  which leads him to want to look for ways of getting involved in a revolution First  let me say that Orwell s work is a product of its times in certain aspects   Britain had just been through two world wars which were only eighteen years apart  Orwell had also seen the rise of totalitarianism in Russia  Spain  Italy  and Germany  Yet Orwell  takes these aspects a step further into the future with the use of totalitarian sates  atomic weaponry  and the military industrial complex to create a very bleak new world  The writing and descriptions are wonderful  The book really makes you think  not only about society  but about history  happiness  love and the truth Second  I read the 1984 Commemorative Edition  this was rather interesting as it contains a rather insightful essay by Erich Fromm at the end and an interesting foreword by Walter Cronkite at the beginning  Cronkite discusses the book in relation to his experience with news and the news of the day   which is rather interesting considering the edition is about thirty years old  If you enjoy this I would strongly recommend Animal Farm by George Orwell  Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  and Amusing Ourselves To Death by Neil Postman  I would also recommend the show Futurama by the creators of the Simpsons  once you read 1984 you will see that the creators have taken many ideas from Orwell and Huxley  There are more sophisticated reviews about this book  but I just wanted to write that it has coloured my view of the world  It shows the great potential for humanity  even in the guise of the very normal Winston  as well as the great dangers of organised humanity  e g  governments   Unfortunately a lot has happened since Orwell wrote this masterpiece  and a lot of it hasn t been very good  Either politicians read this book for ideas  or the wrong people aren t reading the warnings  Or something like that I think everyone should read this book  or at least try to  It is a serious read and a little dry at times  but some reading needs persistence  Not everything should be easy to digest candy floss  Numa visao satirica e negra  uma critica tao atual do Leviata que se ergue silenciosamente pelas nossas vidas Uma

the future or not but it s just that you can t help but be overwhelmed by a man with such a vision  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  Big Brother is always watching  This book is mind blowing  Literally  Not only is it a classic in my opinion but it is a very relatable book  even though it is fictional  George Orwell wrote this in the belief that the world would someday be like a controlled dystopia someday  that the world was in a fight of control and that little hope existed to break free  If you enjoyed The Resistance soundtrack by the band Muse  then you will love this book  Muse s album was based off of this book  and if you listen carefully  you can hear the hints dropped like  the thought police  or  will they find our hiding place    I was a little unsure about reading it at first  but honestly  after everything got so crazy and unpredictable  I was hooked  If you are ready to be shaken awake from your lazy day dream type books  then this is the book to do it  I couldn t believe it played out like it did  and though some parts were interesting enough and all of it was insanely surreal  it was one of the most life altering books I have ever read  I most definitely recommend this book to everyone  whether you are a fan of fiction or not  this book is for the world  like it was meant to be   The first time I attempted this book was in the real 1984  but I gave up on it pretty quickly  The prose style just didn t grab me  So after all these years  I figured 1984 would be one of those classics I would never get around to  Of course  the book has had such a strong cultural impact  you don t have to have read it to know about the concept of Big Brother  That very concept is what finally prompted me to read the book  In this Internet Age with NSA surveillance  is Big Brother watching  Or is it just a whole bunch of little brothers trying to sell us stuff  I m more inclined to believe the latter  but I recognize the possibility of the former  In any case  it seemed high time I read the book Just as happened decades ago  I found the prose style of the first hundred or so pages boring and difficult to get through  but now I understand that Orwell did that deliberately  Winston  the protagonist  is supposed to be isolated  so there s very little dialogue to move the plot along  Things pick up with the introduction of Julia  From there on  it s as suspenseful and riveting as any other novel  For me  the best part of the book was Goldstein s section  even though it was pure narrative and had no dialogue at all  It was such a brilliant distillation of how totalitarian societies operate  The war section reminded me of an insight from Eric Hoffer s The True Believer   Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a G d  but never without belief in a devil   Hoffer and Orwell were contemporaries  and both were writing in the aftermath of World War II  I had a similar yearning for non fiction in the torture section of the book  it made me want to read some real prison memoirs to find out what it s really like  Fiction can give us a great window on reality  but I like to combine its lessons with reality itself 1984 definitely deserves its status as a classic  Everyone alive should read it at some point  But ultimately  I m not as pessimistic as Orwell  The kinds of power plays he describes most definitely exist  but I believe that the spirit of Winston is stronger  And really  since 1984 is more cautionary tale than reality  in writing this novel  I guess Orwell believed in the Winston in all of us  too  Words cannot describe this book  I am utterly speechless  The pure fear and anticipation George Orwell transferred to his readers was so tangible  I was literally shaking in my seat and jumping at surprising parts of the novel  If it goes to say anything  I m reading this book for a CLASS and I could not put it down  The story itself is unforgettable  with well developed characters and relationships and a perfect description of a dystopian world  And the worst part  IT ALL MAKES SENSE  The society s reasoning  the society s policies  everything made sense  Was it a government that ran on fear and punishment  Yes  Were the people brainwashed and ignorant to the world around them  Yes  But as I read through the story  this government has done what all wish to do  fully and completely control the population  Sure  it wasn t honorable  but in a society like that the word honorable does not exist  Every person should read this book  because it explains what would happen if we give the government too much power  I m terribly sorry if this review sounds choppy and unorganized  but I really don t have enough words to describe how amazing and eye opening this book is   A political classic and as scuh a must read  Although its heavily dated and the ideas in it are better summarized elsewhere  this is among the original sources for all literature and discussion on government control  spying and ideas about the future in general   Big Brother is Watching You   5 brilliant stars   1984  was written by George Orwell during 1947 and 1948 while he was living on the Scottish island of Jura  and suffering with tuberculosis  It was published in 1949  and met with immediate success  Orwell died in 1950  Our Group read it in conjunction with  We  by Yevgeny Zamyatin The proposer of the book felt the political content set Orwell the novelist s imagination on fire  making it one of the greatest novels of the post war period  Orwell is more of an iconoclast than an ideologue  and his driving passion is a hatred for all forms of authority  Orwell is brilliant at identifying and attacking the abuse of power  and 1984 is best seen as an extended denunciation of where this can lead  a kind of worst case scenario  Orwell s  Animal Farm  is another effective  development of this themeThe date of 1984 is not critical to Orwell s intentions  the book is an extrapolation of some of the political and cultural directions of the 1930s and 1940s  including Nazism and  in particular  Soviet communism  The book is more political satire than science fiction  and the items of futuristic technology described  telescreens and hidden microphones for example  were primarily of interest as tools of state surveillance  The uses of CCTV and internet and mobile phone surveillance in contemporary societies suggest that Orwell was not too far off the mark in this respect  The shabby living conditions and food rationing further locate the book s world as that of the 1940s  albeit an altered and extrapolated version of that world Who are the proles of today  One felt that we were all as powerless as Orwell s proles  and that contemporary political cliques held power as surely as The Party in the book  Others disagreed  pointing out that we had a vote for who was in government  and could influence government policies  Although Orwell closely follows the plot of the earlier  We  by Zamyatin  a debt which he acknowledged   he improves upon it in many ways  and develops two brilliant themes that were absent from the previously published book  These are the idea of re writing history  which is actually the occupation of the book s protagonist Winston Smith  and the idea of a gradual constriction and diminution of spoken and written language  Newspeak  in order to eliminate any form of conceptual thought inimical to the state The book is as much socio political essay as novel  and therefore inevitably raised questions of a general nature about humanity and systems of society  Are the  Sun  and the  Daily Mail  examples in practice of a kind of Newspeak  Can conceptual thought be limited by a paucity of vocabulary and grammatical sophistication  How do physicists for example develop concepts for which there was no existing vocabulary  Do different world languages govern their users  modes of thought  The appendix on Newspeak  being written as a description of a failed idea  and not in Newspeak  provides a subtle note of optimism at the end of the book by suggesting that the world described in  1984  has come to an end  Orwell had a fundamentally pessimistic view of human nature  and the portrayal of the sadistic O Brien is a chilling vision of how the ultimate use of power can be deliberately to cause suffering for others  In Nazi Germany  Soviet Russia  and many other places and times this tendency in human nature could be observed in practice in the real world   Power tends to corrupt  and absolute power corrupts absolutely  We turned to the question of whether or not Orwell s pessimism extended to disillusion with the British Labour Party in the post war period  After all  the Party in 1984   Ingsoc  in Newspeak  is  English Socialism   Was Labour s programme of nationalization and anti capitalism merely resulting in the creation of a new political clique  and failing to benefit the proletariat  One who had read Orwell s political essays of the time  had found no real evidence of disillusion of this kind  Rather Orwell hated all forms of authority  and his experiences of growing up in an English boarding school  and the low self esteem evidenced by his poverty stricken existence as an adult may have been more potent drivers of his vision than simple political preferences  In fact  Ingsoc  bears more similarities to Soviet socialism than British socialism  O Brien s invented enemy of the state  Goldstein  for example seems to be a clear equivalent of the disgraced Trotsky in Stalin s Russian     This is an extract from a review at http   www monthlybookgroup com  Our reviews are also to be found at http   monthlybookgroup blogspot co uk  khll qry ty lmt ny   Hsst bsw l

book is so dark it almost becomes unbearable  No hope for humanity can be seen  Orwell speaks through the mind of the ultimate dictator  The book is written after the Soviet great terror  the Nazi holocaust and before the Chinese Communist cultural revolution  and superseded them all  1984  Newspeak and doublethink will stay timely as long as there is authoritarian government on the planet    The only thing you can afford to think while reading Nineteen Eighty Four is that Orwell was exaggerating  or pessimistic  Because  imagine what a nightmare it would be to think that human civilization might  at any point in history  evolve in such a way as to produce such a dark  dystopian world  A world where you re being watched 24 7 so that if you produce any behavior   varying from a word uttered in your sleep to a facial expression   associated with  thought crime   you get tracked down  caught  tortured then wiped out from existence  A world where even the smallest pleasures of life are no longer possible to enjoy  What would it be like if history was constantly falsified and forged to suit the ruling party s present discourse  if two and two could make five  or four  or three   or whatever the hell the Party said they make   because the very existence of objective truth is denied  things are only what the Party thinks they are  This fictional world which Orwell created is scary in many aspects  but there is one thing in particular which it scared the daylight out of me to think could happen  the complete and perfect maturity of totalitarianism  The  Party  made all other totalitarian regimes that I ve heard of look like amateurs  They will no longer settle for shutting you up  or having you say what they want you to say  No  they won t settle for anything short of you believing  thinking and feeling according to their plan  There is basically an entire organization out there whose main purpose is to suck the life out of you and fill you with lunatic enthusiasm and patriotism instead  An entire system is designed to minimize  and preferably diminish  your existence as an individual  you are no more than a unit of a bigger entity  so even your brain should function as merely a cell in that entity s brain  The scariest part of it all is not only that they constantly succeed  it s also that they are more honest with themselves than their predecessors   One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship   O Brien tells Winston in the torture chamber  Torture chamber  Physical pain  One of the most terrifyingly heartbreaking themes in Nineteen Eighty Four  How unabashedly and plainly Orwell speaks of it and describes it  Winston Smith  our protagonist  is not a hero who withstand pain for what he believes in  he is a normal guy whose soul gets crushed by its impact  Even a hint to the possibility of the existence of such a hero is never made  Pain is unbearable and it hurts you and crushes you and drains your soul  Orwell seems to say  Generally  Nineteen Eighty Four is regarded as a  prophecy   but I personally prefer to see it as a warning against the moment when the extract of all the dictatorial experiences throughout history may be crystallized into an applicable theory  upon which is based an impenetrable regime  Therefore  the exaggeration  for me  is a magnification   for us to take an in depth look at how things work in  totalitarian  governments  This is particularly why I think this book is a must read  because we could rename it  Your Guide to Knowing How Dictatorships Are Established and Sustained   because it offers you a brilliant dissection of the ideology and the mechanisms of a mighty totalitarian regime   mind blowing Nunca un libro me habia deprimido tanto en toda mi vida  Here comes a candle to light you to bed  Here comes a chopper to chop off your head  Here comes a novel to change  for the rest of your life  how you think of governmental power I read  1984  IN 1984  At the time I had no idea just how powerful would become Orwell s writing in my life  I doubt you could argue that any other book has been more influential in American politics and government  The looming visage of Big Brother intimidates us all    and it should  because we all live with  walk under  and sleep in bed next to an all powerful government whose reach is arguably greater  and considerably more insidious  than the technotalitarian dystopia of Eric Blair s book People in modern society use terms from 1984 every day  Hell  there s an insipid  reality  television show named  Big Brother   The language  the themes  and the warnings of this novel are so interwoven in popular culture that it would be impossible to eradicate them    yet far too few people  especially younger people  have  read  1984 or understand the implications of the society it depicts Orwell s horrible future is melodramatic  yes  Governments today boil their frogs considerably more slowly and with greater finesse  couching always their machinations as what is best for everyone  They understand  as Eric  George Orwell  Blair did  that  everyone  seldom includes the individual  When that individual is subordinated to the all powerful state  we are collectively diminished even as we are individually damned   Gran re lectura  Muy recomendada  especialmente para aquellos con arraigados preceptos humanistas  Still significant  still relevant  and still a scary concept  There are parallels in today s government in the  Big Brother  approach    the common are not wise enough to know what is good for them  So government knows what is good for them  freedom is slavery  and ignorance is strength   I recommend it as a classic book that is thought provoking  engrossing  and intelligent  At the end  you as the reader need to draw you own conclusions of the main protagonist  and if what you had read is a warning  a prophecy  or just pure fiction  I was so stunned    I don t think I ll read anything longer than a short story in the coming time    This book truly is life changing  As I do like the theme of society and science  political  fiction a lot  I easily came to love this book  1984  one of George Orwell s finest books  is not as much fiction as I would like it to be  Throughout the time I was reading the book I used to have interesting discussions  with a friend of mine  about its contents and we got to ask ourselves  how far away from the truth and the present is it      how  for example  can we relate its contents to the current status of North Korea  It s already frightening to imagine Orwell s vision come true  so it must be even harder to live it From the very first moment  we re presented with a society that lives in fear  being constantly watched  closed from the outside world and basically  all controlled   I could identify with Orwell s sense of humor in the description of the political analysis of the society itself  and kept thinking about what such a society puts out there as initial signs  How did the nazis come to prominence  how did the Khmer Rouge came to happen  how did my own country  Portugal  find itself in a dictatorship that lasted for 40 years  You ll think about all of this and much more  the book is as layered as you want it to be    big brother  doublethink  newspeak  crimestop  control  fear  despair  sexual repression  crazy nationalism    This is a work that already has inspired so many others and in a time that seems so long ago  but it is still so fresh  And I really also wanted Newspeak to be better developed as a concept  only a few references appear in the book actually    Winston is a hero  Julia is not  Julia is the rebel that the system wants to create  she uses the system as much as she hates it  but she has no real intentions of battling it   Winston is the hero the system wants to know how to prevent  how to destroy  Many are the questions  few are the answers    at a certain point in the book  Winston asks himself about the whys  because he understands the hows  It s much the same for the reader  I guess At the end of the book I also kept thinking about  Big brother is watching you   I understood it in two ways  you are being controlled  1  and Big brother is looking out for you  2   that s what the Party wanted you to believe  any way  That it was working for you  not the other way around  and that it was providing you with everything you needed And everybody so does love Big Brother  I can t think of an opening chapter that does so much heavy lifting  introducing so many striking ideas  and so efficiently  ideas that have become embedded in our language  So much is there in the first ten pages  Big Brother  telescreens  Newspeak  Airstrip One  the Ministries of Truth Peace Love  Two Minutes Hate  doublethink  A whole world laid out  as befits a book where  for its lead character   the end is contained in the beginning  It s one of those novels that I wish I could read for the first time again  One of the things that I had forgotten in the intermediate years is quite how brutal it is  The final fifth   after the trap is sprung and betrayals are revealed   is unrelenting  Winston Smith is broken down in the most extended  horrific and absolute way  It is genuinely shocking  Nothing else in fiction matches it  Astonishing and powerful work  which  beyond making me think about all these awful things  also gets you right there  so you live through this heartless people by the eye of Big Brother   1984  has many similarities with  We  by Zamyatin  who has written his anyiutopia earlier with the experience of Russian communism Absolutely nedd to read book  Thrilling  unpredictable  the one you feel sorry for  Amazing Antligen har jag last George Orwells beryktade roman  1984 levde upp till alla forvantningar  och lite mer dartill  Det vackte en revolutionar Jon  Jag kunde nastan kanna mig sjalv bli arg over FRA lagen och overvakningssamhallet  i efterhand  Jag har aldrig brytt mig om de forandringar som skett  jag har aldrig besvarats av kameror  eller bevakning av dataflode  men nar jag laser om Winstons liv i Oceania blir jag radd  och lite upprord  Jag tanker verkligen inte leva i en sadan varld Det ar ett noje att lasa boken och pa efterhand fa hitta de intertexter som finns i moderna verk  som V for Vendetta  eller Equilibrium  Storebror  Storebror ser dig  Diktatorn som inte riktigt finns  men anda ser dig overallt  Det superauktoritara staten  radslan for dina egna tankar  och faktumet att du inte har ratt till dem  Hela konceptet ar tankvart  och standigt aktuellt  Aven i livet vi lever idag maste man passa sig for sina egna tankar  man maste standigt vara pa sin vakt for moraliskt forfall  om inte av radsla for statlig bestraffning  sa for konsekvenser i den sociala umgangeskretsen  Standigt stops vi in i kulturellt betingade former  steget fran kulturellt till politiskt ter sig inte vara sa stort  Kanslan som man far av Winstons liv  dar han inte vagar ta ett steg utanfor de vanliga banorna  av radsla for att bli upptackt  leder tankarna till sitt eget liv  och hur man kollar snett pa de som gor nagonting okonventionellt  Givetvis finns det grupper som kan bryta de flesta normer utan att det forefaller konstigt  men for den hederlige manniskan  medlemmen i partiet  vore det valdigt konstigt att befinna sig pa fel stalle  eller gora nagonting som star utanfor normen  Den stora skillnaden ar att bestraffning inte infinner sig  Boken kom som en spraklig semester for mig  Eftersom den foljde Dracula i ledet var det ett rent noje att lasa den  Men Newspeak  ger boken en helt ny spraklig dimension  Det anvands inte namnvart flitigt i den lopande texten  men diskussionen av fenomenet ger hela boken en lingvistisk pragel  Det skapar en diskussion om ordets makt  och vad som hander om man skulle forsoka ta bort ordets makt  Vad hander om du tar bort all formaga att uttrycka kanslor  varderingar eller orginella tankar  Det kanns som att Newspeak inte skulle fungera i praktiken  men tanken ar intressant  Genom att Orwell namner det nya spraket lite da och da uppmarksammar man den vanliga engelskan mycket mer  Genom att begrepp som Doublethink presenteras  borjar man reflektera over engelskan synonymer  och vilken funktion de har   Find this review at Scott Reads It Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two is four  To say 1984 is an amazing and powerful novel is the understatement of the century  Never have I ever read a book so powerful and meaningful  1984 is a book that transcends time because 1984 will always be pertinent  Orwell created a timeless tale about power  freedom  and social classes  No review I could ever write could do 1984 justice but I shall try 1984 is a dystopian novel complete with action  romance  and politics  I ll be honest here  Normally I don t read serious literature and I hate politics  Reading 1984 was me metaphorically  putting on my big boy pants    it showed how my reading taste matured  Enough about me  this is a review not the Scott show  The plot moves at such a brisk pace and you ll be glued to your seat  Even if you hate politics like my teenage self you will love 1984  Orwell creates political situations that will allure even the most unwilling readers  There are few dull moments in 1984  the majority of whom take place in  the book  No 1984 review could ever be complete without mentioning Oceania  Oceania is the totalitarian society in which 1984 takes place and I know where I m not going on vacation  Oceania makes Panem look like a walk in the park and it is far more horrible than I expected  No sane person could go live there without going insane because it s a living hell  Orwell really created the perfect hell hole for his masterpiece and it s mindblowing I really loved how Orwell created his own language  Newspeak  for 1984  Newspeak added an interesting feel to the novel because it further the novel s themes and motifs  I really wonder if aficionados of 1984 speak Newspeak like trekkies speak Klingon and LOTR fans speak Elvish  Orwell definitely spent a lot of time coming up with Newspeak and I do appreciate his efforts 1984 is a haunting novel that once you read it  it will stay with you forever  I won t ever be able to forget the horrifying Part III because how powerful and moving it was  1984 is a novel that will make you question yourself and society  The best kind of books make you think even after you finish and such is the case with Orwell s masterpiece  The 3rd person narration instead of hindering the pacing  it enhances it by adding more emotional depth to the book 1984 is a novel that will give you new perspectives on people  society  and law  Is Ignorance really bliss  Is lying okay if it s for the greater good  Is the needs of the many more important than the needs of the few  I can tell why 1984 is considered classic literature and I hope it continues to be read for it s important messages  Even if 1984 doesn t seem like your thing  I d still recommend giving it a shot  1984 has given me a reason to pick up Animal Farm and I hope I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed 1984  I have heard a many good things about this book while in college and after I started a book club for ESL students in my city  I decided   why not read this one   I might as well find a reason to read books besides telling myself that I m TOO busy  don t we all      I loved this book  At times it was slow but the underlying tones and ideas are what kept me going  And not just kept me going to the end  but made me want to finish it all in a weekend  The ideas of social classes in 1984 and of how to control a population really opened my eyes to different possibilities I had never thought of before  So  to all those who enjoy books  like  The Next 100 years  or any futuristic political novels  this is the one for you  What to say about 1984   hmm   its endless  I was completely captivated and terrified all at the same time  This book has a way of creeping up on you and seeping in  It is without doubt ahead of its time and completely timeless at the same time  I really felt while reading it  it could have been written yesterday  It is not an easy read by any stretch but one that you should take your time with as to completely absorb its brilliance  terrifying as it is  I agree with the masses   this book should be read by everyone  It is an important piece of literature that may always bear relevance to today and our government  I loved it  http   cronicasdeumaleitora blogspot     Let me preface my review by saying that I m not much of a political person  I vote in every major election  and I try really hard to vote in all local elections  and I ll vote in primaries if it s convenient  I m very opinionated when it comes to issues that I feel affect my rights to live my life as I wish  but that s about it  So  that being said  1984 isn t a book that normally would top my list of books I m dying to read  but I had quite a few people recommend it and it s one of those books that made me feel like an ignoramus for not having read  you know those books  where people wonder what kind of high school you went to if you never read X in English class     Once I started 1984  I could barely put it down  I was immediately drawn into the story  and found myself engrossed in wondering how this society could have gotten to the point where they allowed the government to spy on them constantly  Everything about this book was fascinating  and I kept thinking that copying this sentence or that sentence and re posting it on my Facebook status would spark some interesting discussions As a side note  I was a little surprised at the frank discussion of human sexuality in this book  especially considering that it was written in the 1940s  While it was weak compared to what would be considered acceptable nowadays  it was still more than I was expecting  However  I think it was absolutely crucial to the story and handled in a very tasteful way Overall  I absolutely loved this story  I think that everyone in America needs to read it  given our current governmental tendency to squash any right that people will even consider giving up in the name of safety  equality  or some other utopian  but unattainable  ideal   tqd n  Zm  hdhh lrwy  wsr bqh Try  kl hdhh lsnyn mdh ktbh jwrj wrwyl  lys wSfh lHl lmjtm  lwqyny bm yshbh Hwl kthyr mn lmjtm t lty  nt w ltzl mn Hkm shmwly

lets you inside the head of someone living in a truly totalitarian regime Life changing book   Club de Lectura  Libro  3 Junio 2015 Este libro es tan impresionante  Es como la mama de todos los libros distopicos que he leido en mi vida Yo normalmente me obsesiono con cosas menos serias  pero 1984 me engancho como cualquier novela teen  Sinceramente  no se que mas decir  Es imposible criticarlo  Esta lectura fue mucho mejor para mi que Rebelion en la Granja  que me la lei como hace 5 anos cuando no sabia nada de historia ni politica  La sensacion que deja un libro como estos es de desconsuelo  paranoia y rabia  practicamente entre en crisis existencial  pero valio la pena Aunque sinceramente esperaba un final menos desesperanzador  Digamos que yo todavia tengo el cerebro programado en modo Disney y me niego a no creer en los finales felices  No es que tenga un final triste  es en realidad el que me esperaba  pero yo todavia creo en la revolucion  Me lo lei en dos dias  mientras estaba en la playa y al terminarlo todas las paginas se habian caido  asi de agresiva me sentia con este libro   Hasta ahora es el mejor libro que hemos escogido en el club  por las discusion que genero se podria decir que ya le subimos el status al grupo de club de lectura a movimiento capucho   wn ll  knt fkrh ywtwby bsh     School wasn t a happy time for me  The bonds I had to my friends felt always tenuous  and it was many a lunchtime I spent holed up in the library  searching for something new  There was no Goodreads  then  The internet was new and exciting  and online communities were a thing I d not encountered  Aaah  writing this  I feel quite old I wonder how Orwell would feel  because his seminal novel  1984 was well before its time  but the year it takes its name from has long since past  It past the year I was born  in fact Moving on  My friends weren t big readers  but my mum and dad were  I devoured their book collections  and my tastes became theirs  epic fantasies  chilling sci fi  They and their books taught me to question  to think for myself  I m not surprised now to see my tastes ran in vein of politically subversive  and with that in mind  it seems inevitable I found myself one lunchtime with this book in my hands There s something special about the book you discover for yourself  My mother and father may have led me to a love of reading  but it was I who chose to keep seeking  and it was I who picked this book As a fifteen year old  1984 changed my life  It s left an indelible mark on the adult I ve become  and  while perhaps it s not healthy   paranoid  and  distrustful  come closer   it s shaped how I ve grown to view politics  and how the people who govern our world do so Armed with the knowledge of  doublethink  and  thoughtcrime   the world was a different place for me  and for the very first time  I grew to see the world outside me in more than just black and white  and to reject the absurdity of  blackwhite  1984 did not make me an activist  or a radical   I can make no such great claim  It did teach me to think for myself  to question  it reinforced the foundations my parents laid  So this isn t a review  not really  Just a chance to say how much this book means to me  and hope it will to you  too   A book which I would probably re read several times  yyyyyyyyyyh lr b dh   lrjl dh wl k nh  ysh m n  n msh hrG

maybe college  The afterword  in this edition  by Erich Fromm demonstrates just how applicable Orwell s warnings were to the era of the 1960s  and it is easy to see how applicable those could be to my own generation s experiences since the 1980s  It is also amazing to recognize just how much  pop culture  has drawn from this novel  Of course  now it almost seems that governments have been using Orwell s conceptualization of the surveillance state as a  how to guide   an idea which I must attribute to someone else on Twitter  though I cannot remember now who that was  and though I wish I had thought of it myself   At any rate  in prescient comparison with the realities of history  this novel stands well the test of time  My head  My poor poor head Forget any other dystopians because  1984  is the epitome of what a dystopian society is  Good God  I feel like I ll never be the same  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  Only when you have come to understand these terms and yet reject them completely and utterly can you possibly understand what 1984 represents  If we are to absorb the book  the world is but an illusion  society is a lie  and we are reigned  unbeknownst to us  by Big Brother  Who is Big Brother is unimportant  What truly matters is what he represents  And the sheer ideology of the Party and what it  in itself  represents  goes beyond How did Orwell manage this  I am blown away  This book is just  again  mind blowing   So damned important that we re ignoring its lessons even today  kbws kwmydy swd   mSTlH tn  ysw  m sbq mmkn tsmyh byh

Launching an era of braindead libertarians who believe roads and bridges are naturally occurring phenomena  this terrifying depiction of a totalitarian government just scarred me like no other book  At times it is too dreadful to even read  but like 2 Girls 1 Cup  you feel oddly compelled and dared  This is not a horror novel in the sense of what doesn t exist  but what does completely have the capability to exist in the 21st century  That is true terror  The thought of having no freedom to love  make love  have an opinion  and being monitored at all times is deeply unsettling  Unless you re into being watched  then this world is a dream come true  This harrowing masterpiece should be taught in schools for all as a warning to not be overcome by Big Brother or poor people minorities who start these revolutions in the first place There are a few bland spots  countless pages of exposition  and you can skip those as it is just normal  mwahaha  overlord propaganda shit  But the actual story of Winston and Julia  each half a rebel  Julia being the lower  is sad  guilt ridden  and red faced shame  If I told you to agree that your mother is a vapid whore who hustles for Walgreens coupons  and Ron Paul is master of the universe  or if there is a God to begin with  you would laugh or dismiss  But if I had a gun pointed at you  cornered in an alley with no escape or cellphone  and closed in on you a little bit more and a little bit more  all throughout history  anything is so  isn t it  Exactly Orwell s point  For my money  1984 is the greatest fiction novel of all time  It is full of interesting literary concepts like  doublethink   blended continents  and a perpetual war backdrop are just the poison paint frosting on the cake  It is really about the will of man to live and how it can be suppressed  and it pulls no punches even toward the end  It makes me want to shoot guns in the air  bite into a bacon cheeseburger  yell yeehaw and ride off on a horse into rush hour

of fiction of all time  To know it was written in the forties and it gave meaning invented the word Big Brother  doublethink  newspeak     It was great and Thank God this didn t happen   It makes you appreciate what you have   at the same time concern about modern day Big Brother and the eye in the sky to know that we are being watched every minute of everyday everywhere  propaganda is played constantly on every t v so are we being played    I know that many thing in our history is falsified comparing what is written in our history books and the worlds book  there is always discrepancies   something isn t right  We need a true change  not another party seeking power controlling the present thinks he could alter the history again to control our future    Here in Egypt  we almost had what was happening back then and our rise was by the middle class and most of the  proles  and we removed a tyranny but as it happens the brotherhood that came after it wanted to establish the same tyranny    this time I hope we wont let it happen   and we will remember that 2 2 4 not 3 not 5 not all of them     WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past  George Orwell once again creates a deeply disturbing world that is both plausible and terrifying  What s even more terrifying about the plot is that almost every aspect of 1984 is plausible  The story begins with a low ranking official named Winston  Winston is deeply dissatisfied by the state of affairs in the nation of Oceania  the novel s setting  Though most of the population is indoctrinated into the belief that the party can do no wrong  Winston easily sees through this vacuous facade  Though he hates the party  he is in no position to rebel  This is because the nation of Oceania uses a secret police called the thought police to monitor its civilian population  In the nation of Oceania  not even your thoughts are your own  As the story progresses  Winston starts to find more and more ways to rebel against the party  One thing that I really enjoy about 1984 is its ability to create characters that are extremely human  Winston is a great example of this  Winston has desires just like every other human  The human aspects of the characters in this novel make it all the more believable  I also enjoy how the book creates a setting that is dynamic and engaging  Orwell goes into very rich detail on every aspect of Oceania  Overall  this George Orwell novel is one my personal favorites  Its blending of Sci fi and political fiction gives it a perfect mix of fantasy and reality  I would recommend 1984 to anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with the dystopian genre  Herkesin okumasi gereken  muhtesem bir kitap   1984 By George Orwell is a classic dystopian novel  eerily prescient of the state of modern society  Winston Smith  the main character  tries to rebel against Big Brother  Big Brother is a symbol of Oceania s government  As the titular head of Oceania  he is always watching  No one knows if he really exists  but he keeps the people in line  Through the whole book Orwell uses surveillance and strict laws to show how intense of a society occupies Oceania  As a reader  it makes me think about how our society doesn t even scratch the surface of how bad the people of Oceania have it  and we are very fortunate for the way we live  We as a society are allowed to keep a journal to write in  If you are caught with a journal in Oceania  the consequences can be severe as death  If you are into dystopian literature or even just a timeless classic  I would strongly suggest 1984   1984  written by George Orwell is a political novel to describing a society under the rule of a dictatorship  Orwell perfectly portrays a totalitarianism and authoritarian government through the perspective of a 39 year old man  Wilson  Wilson lives in a society similar to those Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union  where there is no freedom and the government holds both physical psychological control over people  The government controls history and language  constantly monitoring people and suppressing any possible sign of rebellion 1984 emphasizes how control over the human mind or psychological manipulation is the ultimate power  which is obtained through physical control and torture  This novel  written in the 1940 s  serves with the purpose to warn people of the dangers of a government as such  Orwell uses many concepts and symbols throughout the book to reference to the real world situation at the time  like an extended metaphor  The novel plot is extremely engaging and Orwell writes in an easy to understand manner  However  the underlying meaning of his texts is what truly makes this novel fascinating  Honestly  I don t even know what to do after finishing this book except stare at the ceiling  I discovered and first read this book in 1984  at 17  I thought that was just SO clever and ironic   And I adored it  as much as one can adore a vision of a dystopian future Weirdly enough  the thing that attracted me to this book was the language  or the lack thereof  I ve always been fascinated by language  hungry for words at an early age  My favorite book as a young grade schooler was The Reader s Digest Encyclopedic Dictionary So the concept of limiting the growth of such a living  breathing  ever changing entity was quite disturbing to me  I loved how 1984 made me ponder the concept that limiting words   limiting thoughts  Hmmm   is that why we ve got the ultra conservatives barring legislators from using the word  vagina  in Congress  There s a thought I could say so much more  and perhaps will  at a later time  but for now I ll just say it is a prescient novel  especially today  when it is becoming downright frightening how much  Big Brother  is intruding  or attempting to intrude  into our most private decisions  Read it  but most of all  DISCUSS it  Using our confusing  lovely  unruly  yet unlimited LANGUAGE  When I was in high school I believed this was a totally impossible premise  now I think it could totally happen if we let Fox News or CNN control the message completely  The first political book I understood  but the tech to make this real is here now  This is definitely one of my favorite books  I read it first as a child and it is largely responsibly for my fascination with dystopian stories I have read several other reviews that find this novel to be favored by people paranoid about the government or find the ideas to no longer be relevant  and I could not disagree more strongly  I believe the totalitarianism warned of in this novel is a constant threat to our society and this book acts as a strong warning  Certainly  the themes now seem less prophetic as we have seen the end result of many of the political powers that lead to the future of Big Brother government  However  from the stance of 1953 looking forward 31 years  Orwell s point is still valid  His commentary is about direction  not destination  There are still McCarthy like figures in positions of power and the boundaries are always shifting around where we  draw the line  with things like domestic spying  Orwell makes comments on control  and if our foreign and domestic policies as of 2008 are any signal  humanity is still obsessed with control   Just as a side note  the options are not binary  I am not suggesting that Orwell was an anarchist  For the fact that this novel is still relevant makes it of the utmost interest to me  It seems to wrap commentary on human nature into commentary on politics through a largely illustrative story  1984 is at the core of what I consider literature canon that should be a part of everyone s education  1984 was required reading in high school  I was not particularly moved by the writing style  and at the time the voice of the author was what made or broke a book for me  But I remember very vividly being 17 and sitting at my ma s kitchen table  I felt physically queasy from a passage of this book  it was a torture scene between Winston and O Brein  I had to walk outside and get some air  I went to the woods and finished the novel  How could this be  Winston was supposed to win  Maybe not overthrow the party  but he was supposed to get the girl and escape somehow  He didn t  His spirit was broken  He gave up Julia under torture and brainwashing  He stopped questioning and complied  in the end  I had the wind knocked out of me  with this book  1984 has come and gone since Orwell s publication  I didn t know it at the time  but this book planted within me a seed of distrust for which I am eternally grateful  In this world  they alter their history  They manipulate language to make rebellion impossible  Are there parallels between this world and our own  I m still trying to figure that part out  but I have to thank this book for disturbing my comfortable compliant mind and making trust all the more precious  Impresionante obra de tinte politico que describe una sociedad futuristica  regimen controlador  totalitarista y que su funcion principal es controlar el pensamiento  eliminar las emociones y los lazos afectivos  que se asemeja en su estructura y lenguaje increiblemente a la politica venezolana actual  sobre todo las torturas  los cambios del lenguaje  el tratar de cambiar el pasado  la historia  y las incoherencias dichas por sus partidarios  A pesar que es una obra de ficcion sus personajes principales  el Gran Hermano  Goldstein entre otros  son basados en personas que existieron en varios gobiernos dictatoriales del pasado  La trama se basa en un hombre normal  perteneciente al partido exterior  que viene siendo la clase media  que un dia descubre que todo es una farsa y va en contra del sistema  enamorandose a escondidas y decidiendo convertirse en contrarrevolucionario  parte de  La Hermandad  dirigida por Goldstein  No se puede comentar gran cosa mas sin decir toda la trama  sin embargo es totalmente recomendablepag 326 Sir Orwell was a visionary and 1984 may have been the most visionary book   1984 is set in an extremely frightening dystopian world where violence is rampant in the minds of children and grown men dedicate themselves to changing the past through false documentation  The Thought Police is everywhere save the darkness  and telescreens watch your every move  I was mesmerized by this story  developing a near hatred of Big Brother myself  as well as a sharpened fear of the potential power of government  George Orwell has created a world with its own political conflicts and extremeties  and yet in the reality of my mind it exists  in the particular way of Big Brother  alongside our own  l kh lkbyr

and his hatred to Totalitarian regime This book content about one man life and thought toward Totalitarian regime and how is trying so hard to be free from it  from the party who rule the country he lived in  Imagine a government  where it forbid you to have sexual feelings  you are allowed to give birth but no with no intimacy  kids are being used to continue party heredity   where it will crime you for thinking  where it put a screen everywhere to monitor your action  your words  where you will be perished if you are against the party  where it always alter the past like it was alterable It was so intense to read how Winston try to seek freedom towards it  where it finally he make love with a girl who also loves him purely even when they know it is forbidden  Until the end  even until he finally captured  he never stops speak to what he believe  that one day totalitarian regime that the party fought for  would collapse  That even tough the party says they do it because they love their members  no human beings could stands lonely knowing their instinct was caged  One day they will revolt to get it back But after all  perhaps one need not to be loved  as much he needs to be understood  And I agree with it  It is the world of lies  a world where every record has been destroyed  and every book has been re written  every picture has been repainted  and every statue  street  building  has been re named  every date has been altered to the extent that you can t determine in which year you are living   nothing exist except what the party see that it s true  the past is falsified  and the irony here  is that the  ministry of truth  is the one who s responsible for this  even the language is altered and the  new speak  is used instead  you are watched through endless number of telescreens  found every where and the watchful eyes of the big brother  and if any body dares to think  he will not escape the hands of the thought police that will vanish him   un person      it s when Winston decided to stand against this totalitarian regime  when he discovered his true identity when he fell in love with Julia   the amazing piece here is that George Orwell has written this novel in 1948  but as if he is describing our media and the totalitarian regimes that controls us and try to picture itself as democratic ones  I read this book a long  long time ago  but couldn t remember it at all so I decided to reread it  I am sure my life experiences and the perspective that comes with time have turned it into a much better book than I remembered it being  I found myself rooting for Winston  praying that he would have the strength of character to stand up and be the catalyst for change in this futuristic society  but he was so trapped on every side that he seemed to have no choice but to capitulate  The scary thing to me is that I get it  I understand it  Is our society headed in such a direction  It is my opinion that we will never go that far  but it is perplexing to me how many people are willing to give up their free agency little by little  of their own free will and choice  I don t want anyone else making my decisions  thank you  Yes I will make mistakes  sometimes bad ones  but this is my life to live the way I see fit  not anyone else s  least of all some nameless guy known only as  Big Brother   There is so much in this book for all of us to learn  Right now the biggest thing I am taking away from this book is gratitude for the freedoms I have left in this country  and for my own free will  It is and should be my most highly prized possession  I m thinking that preserving our free agency is an underlying reason why God sent his Son to die for us  It s that important   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows  This book might  indeed  be more relevant today than any other book you can think of  This book  published in 1949  prospected a terrible future in which the party controlled the souls of its inhabitants and thus had full control over hatred and love  At first I thought the party s slogans were ridiculous  but somehow Orwell s explanation made sense  Yes  war might sustain peace  and yes   Freedom might be slavery and indeed  somehow ignorance is strength Somehow it taught me lots of life lessons 10 10 I would read it again   Imagine that the world we lived was divided into 3 major ruler  all totalitarian  As long as we remembered  we believed  we always been at war  with one or the other  There were no such thing as freedom  not to act  not to lived  not to loved  not to speak  not even to think  All were directed from the Party for the sake of the Party  WAR IS PEACEWar is not strugling for power  The wars were for cheap labour  and get this  Indonesia Archipelago was one of the slaves factory      But then again  the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world s economy      but  to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living   p 238 239   When people had very scarce to eat  they will had to depended to the Party  and had no time to think other things  By this term  order and peace could be achieved FREEDOM IS SLAVERYHuman being is mortal  To achieve to most highest peak of freedom of the being  which is immortality  every member of the party must become one with the Party  Think as one  Do as one   This part actually reminds me a lot of collectivism of The Borg from Star Trek Next Generation IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHTo think and do as one with the Party  every member should neutralized by DOUBLETHINK methode  which was to accept everything  they told us to believe  is true  without any doubt  without realizing any inconsistency  History was being up to dated every time  People existance was being decided on the event  All of these dogma should be accepted as the way of life  If you did not  then you ll need to be  cured  in the Ministry of Love    Just when I thought Animal Farm was amusingly disturbing  1984 exceeded it by miles  Published in 1949  after the World War II and the begining of Industrial Era  this novel was  and still is  a visionary writtings  Sit on the other side of the continuum of Utopia  1984 beseech to see the worst of ideology  and the last chapter of Part 2 was really the backbone of the whole story  In this chapter readers would see how Orwell placed his fear and given us how we could be at that place  I don t think that we could ever be there  with the internet  information highway an all  history updated is rather impossible   but the vision of that place  that kind of reign  should be known to be avoided I would like to think that this novel was a different kind of sequel to the Animal Farm  In AF  Orwell pointed how power could be slowly corrupted to benefit oneself  in this novel  it showed how to maintain that power among some minority that were  more equal than the others   Some characters also similar  like the face of public enemy  Snowball in AF equal to Goldstein in 1984 or Napoleon in AF to Big Brother in 1984  But other that that  this novel  or should I say essay  is much more brave  disturbing and visionary to me  Even as a lover of dystopian fiction  I have found George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four to be one of the most difficult book s to justify in a review because I can honestly say it s not a novel that I took pleasure in reading  Why then  does such a distressing read deserve a five star rating  A good novel invokes a reaction  I did not like the protagonist s fate but it would have been extremely unjust for Orwell to grant Winston salvation  This tyrannical vision of the future has no place for a happy ending  Big Brother s corrupt yet seemingly successful creation of society as a fabrication is supposed to leave the reader feeling uncomfortable  The party s slogan  Big Brother is Watching You  runs right down to the text s core  Ultimately  any attempt at rebellion is futile and this is what makes the Orwell s dystopian nightmare so frightening What Orwell does manage to achieve with this book is the evocation of fear  The concepts themselves  the creation of  Newspeak  and  Doublethink  place the idea of the potential humanity has for corruption in your head  After reading this book  I can see that a lot of dystopian writers  especially Margaret Atwood  have used Orwell s vision as inspiration  As bleak as his writing may be  I finished the book in four days  It is one of those texts that is fascinatingly horrid  you just get drawn into the monstrosity for George Orwell is the master of dystopian fiction  timeless   regimeless   Amazingly insightful   A must read Mandatory reading if ever there was such a thing  ironic to make such a statement about Orwell s lasting masterpiece given its subject matter that s for sure   I ve read George Orwell   1984  This was an odd book    It had far more information than the movie and it let us readers understand more of the world he live on    I Like the novel and would advice anyone to read it    Some of the ideas that the Inner Party had were pretty good but others were pretty useless  I can see several of the ideias implemented on our world to function properly but others are almost impossible  The lack of vocabulary is a thing that would never be implemented  The writing of the history is nowadays done so it can be implemented and it works The world itself it s in a never ending war involving three superstates  Two allied powers fighiting against the third  The book of Goldstein  the arch enemy of the state  states that each superstate is so strong it cannot be defeated even when faced with the combined forces of the other two powers  The allied states occasionally split with each other and new alliances are formed  Each time this happens  history is rewritten to convince the people that the new alliances were always there  using the principles of doublethink  The war itself never takes place in the territories of the three powers There is one part that is very entertaining and shows how powerful is the state against the masses    Midway through the book  the alliance breaks apart and Oceania  newly allied with Eurasia  begins a campaign against Eastasian forces  This happens during  Hate Week   a week of extreme focus on the evilness of Oceania s enemies  the purpose of which is to stir up patriotic fervour in support of the Party   Oceania and Eastasia are enemies once again  The public is quite abnormally blind to the change  and when a public orator  mid sentence  changes the name of the enemy from Eurasia to Eastasia  still speaking as if nothing had changed   the people are shocked and soon enraged as they notice all the flags and banners are wrong  they blame Goldstein and the Brotherhood  and tear them down  This is the origin of the idion   we ve always been at war with Eastasia   Orwell s book explains that the war is unwinnable  and that its only purpose is to use up human labour and the fruits of human labour so that each superstate s economy cannot support an equal  and high  standard of living for every citizen Goldstein s book hints that  in fact  there may not actually be a war Even Eurasia and Eastasia themselves may only be a fabrication by the government of Oceania  with Oceania the sole undisputed dominator of the world  On the other hand  Oceania might as well actually control only a rather small part of the world and still brainwash its citizens into believing that Oceania dominates the whole Earth or   as in the novel   that they are battling allying with  a fabricated  Eurasia Eastasia Then there is the key word of the book    Doublethink that is explained as followed  The keyword here is blackwhite  Like so many Newspeak words  this word has two mutually contradictory meanings  Applied to an opponent  it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white  in contradiction of the plain facts  Applied to a Party member  it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this  But it means also the ability to believe that black is white  and more  to know that black is white  and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary  This demands a continuous alteration of the past  made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest  and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink  Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously  and accepting both of them I would advice this book to anyone    This book relates much more than the totaliarism state but also the power of our mind and the power to change our mind  The main story of the two characters is psychological intense  It made me shiver and think of life and our feelings    they are all fabricated in our mind  1984  bqry  mdhhl    nhy  lrwy  mw lm  llGy

much that i must have read the first page several times before turning to second page  Moving on now  The first part was so melancholic set in a dystopian world   well the city of londen to be exact   where Gin is bad   chocolate tastes like dust and your kids would tell on you if you desobey the government  Our beloved protagonist WINSTON SMITH struggles in this world trying to rebel against the rules and simply make  2 2  equals four   In this part It was a stuggle for me to move forward   new terms  rules and different nerf wrecking standards which constantly left me on the edge   I can t describe how much I hated reading it or how many times I threw the damn book   at a point I thought about giving up and putting back  but I gave it a chance and I thank god i did for the second part was the best thing I have ever read in my life  I thought maybe there is hope for LOVE to bloom in this dark swamp  I enjoyed reading the story of Julia and Smith   it was the climax of this book  because suddenly the pages were less pale and the words drifted smoothly  That s when Mr Orwell intervened to set the scenarios i ve planed for the couple on fire and to remind me that this is not a love story   Now the last part of the novel is all about frustration   I felt really unconfortable as the events took an insupportable course  My heart sank   my blood rushed with irritating fury   and then there was pain   pain  pain  pain  pain and at a certain point  submission  The strange thing about that is the amount of pleasure which was induced throughout the last part   I never wanted it to end  How could you hate something yet you love it tremendously       Doublethink   Horrifying and highly  relatable to today s society  There are so many things I could say about this book  I found it extraordinary as a work of fiction  but mostly as an essay of reality  Being from a pseudo communist country  it s very troubling to see how things that sound as crazy and unrealistic can actually be very accurate  their actions and tactics  The thing about this book is that  while it may seem exaggerated to those without the experience  it really is not  The lies that at the beginning seem so easy to detect  become such a part of daily life that pointing them out is sacrilege and so everyone becomes part of the whole big lie  those who believe it and those who don t  and fear and uncertainty is always in the air Many people believe the lies mainly because they are easy to manipulate  others because they don t know any better  others are so full of anger about themselves that they WANT to believe someone else is guilty of their misery  Blaming someone else is always easy  and it works for those in charge  In communist regimens there s always got to be a culprit  usually in a land far away  so no one can catch them   because otherwise  without the strength that hatred provides  people couldn t stand the weight of the vicissitudes the regimen places over them  This book was very interesting as story  yes  But also stressful and saddening in a way only stories linked to reality can be  For me  it was very much a description of what we re living  ktb mn  rw  m qr t    s ktb ryfyw bltfSyl lHqan  One of the best books I have ever read  The themes presented in this book are as relevant today as they were when the book was first published  Being watched by the government all the time is scary in fiction but we somehow accept it in real life  When the NSA has the ability to watch AS YOU TYPE on your computer  take over control of your web cam and listen in on your phone conversations it is a clear violation of our right to privacy   yet we aren t all outraged  I had a teacher who once told the class that the cable box was outfitted with a camera and microphone so they could watch you and listen to you at home  He was lying to get us to think about it but there were more than a few of us who went home and disassembled the boxes to be sure  If the book doesn t scare you  you should be afraid of how far gone you are  Big Brother is Watching You  Nineteen Eighty four is widely considered to be a classic and rightly so  Not a lot of science fiction books manage to stay both this relevant and this readable for over half a century after their first publication  Nineteen Eighty four tells the story of Winston Smith  a middle class office drone who chafes at his pointless life of drudgery under the nightmarish InSoc regime  This regime  lead by the mysterious Big Brother  may well be the ultimate dictatorship  it manipulates the hearts and minds of its subjects with such skill that its authority is truly absolute  Winston desperately tries to free himself  even if in only the smallest way  from the yoke of Big Brother  When he falls in love for the first time in his life and joins a fledgling resistance movement  it seems that he has finally succeeded at secretly defying InSoc and Big Brother  Or has he The way Orwell has designed his dystopian dictatorship and the way he plays with perception and information is truly impressive  His fictional world is at the same time incredibly well crafted and frighteningly believable  This is one of those novels which actually fully deserve their status as a classic  and I can recommend it to both science fiction lovers and to those who don t normally like this genre  Yes  it s that good  Perhaps one of the most popular and influential English language novels in the 20th century  Nineteen Eighty Four is part of the landmark dystopian fictions in all world literature  With the ingenious creation of a haunting world comprising of  Newspeak    doublethink   and  Big Brother   it warps the utopian novel form  describing instead a frightening society where everything has gone wrong  George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four warns humanity about the doom that could befall them when the society exchanges individuality  freedom  and love for the false securities of peace  law  and order manufactured by a totalitarian and oppressive government Nineteen Eighty Four is a science fiction novel that recreates an authoritarian world divided in three massive superstates  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  which are constantly in war between each other  The former city of London  now called Airstrip One  no longer serves as a major city in the United Kingdom  but instead it is an important part of territory of Oceania  where there is an extremely totalitarian regime based on the principles of English Socialism commonly called as  Ingsoc   The dominant organization in Oceania is called the Party led by Big Brother  a charismatic character and an object of the people s admiration  although his real existence is not clear or verified  Big Brother is a personification of god in a society where religion or any form of idolatry or fanaticism has been abolished  Below Big Brother is a social pyramid stratified in three basic layers  in the apex of the social pyramid is the Inner Party  composed of the elites  which serves as the  brain  of the Party  the middle part is the Outer Party which serves as the  limbs  and are therefore the working class  while at the bottom of the hierarchy are the  Proles  or proletariat which constitutes about 85 per cent of the population The year 1984 had long passed  but four decades later  the chilling warning that George Orwell gave in his novel still echoes until now  And how could we be sure that we are not moving toward that kind of society  when the fictional dystopian world of Nineteen Eighty Four seems to be happening in our present world  surveillance cameras are everywhere  in form of CCTVs   humanity is overwhelmed by technology and thus sometimes feel alienated in their own community  and there are on going and brewing conflicts between nations that have been going on for years and are still not resolved until now  In a near despairing mood about the future of humanity  Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four gives us a cautionary tale that unless the course of history changes  human beings could lose their last flicker of their most human qualities and would be instead replaced as soulless automations that are merely part of a senseless process  presenting a haunting and startling vision of a dystopian world that has been dangerously close to our current

language of 1984 has passed into common use  like Big Brother  thought police  thought crimes  etc  George Orwell s take on the future is powerful and clairvoyant    and we are living a version of his constricted  hate filled world today  Winston Smith  Orwell s protagonist  begins the book by hiding out of sight of the telescreen and writing in a diary with pen and ink purchased at different shops so as to be more difficult to track  He is writing his thoughts about Oceania and Big Brother and the world he lives in  the gray  unemotional  fear filled world that surrounds him but does not include him  He is writing for O Brien  a man in the inner circle of the Party  someone Winston believes is also rebelling against the status quo  As Winston continues his small rebellions  Orwell illustrates how Winston is less free than he thinks he is  Winston is merely an inconsequential cog in the wheel of The Party  Orwell paints a world where Oceania is always at war and thus always asking more of its citizens by giving them less and expecting them to accept less with equanimity because it s for Oceania  the Party  and for Big Brother  Outwardly  everyone lives the same way with oily gin  gray coveralls  and cramped quarters always in vies of the telescreens where even in the parks and countryside there are microphones to capture even the whispered confidences between lovers and co conspirators  Children turn their parents in for what they say in their sleep that proves there is rebellion in their minds  Life is a gray  empty round of hate and fear and hopelessness  even among the proles who are not subject to the dictates of the Party because they are not allowed to be party members  The proles are serfs  slaves and belong to Big Brother as surely as do the party members Orwell creates Winston Smith s world with simple  straightforward language  evoking a cold world full of people looking over their shoulders and clutching their small rebellions in secret  Paranoia and disgust oozes from the pages and stays with the reader long after the book is closed  Even the passages of the Book that explains the workings of The party and how Oceania  though a bit pedantic  ring with truth While our world  this modern world  seems less gray and freer  Orwell got it right  His newspeak is our politically correct and his Big Brother is our out of control Congress and President  We don t have thought police per se  but we have a media controlled by the government that spouts the party line and an entire country of people watching and listening to pounce on the slightest misspoken word they gladly throw back in our faces for public condemnation of the miscreant  Although what we see isn t exactly like Orwell s vision  it s close enough to be frightening  knowing that wars are made and lines redrawn to give us somewhere to focus our hate when the real damage is done by the government that is supposed to support and protect us  George Orwell s 1984 is here and reading about it is frighteningly real  Reading this book was an awful experience but not all books are meant to be enjoyed  Some are just meant to grab you by your shoulders and make you suffer as the characters do  And how I have suffered  This is one of those because which has more to give with each reading  Having read it a second time I have bumped it up from four stars to five and I am sure it will have plenty more to offer if I read it once more  But that is not going to happen  I value my sanity far too much It presents several occasions for outrage and several others where you just want to shut the book and stare out the window at reality  your mind swimming with subtly connected analogies  Disbelief is replaced with silent horror as you realize the Party s reasoning and motives are sound  In fact this book wouldn t be as effective or believable if North Korea wasn t the way it was  The Party s ideologies which bases upon contradiction bleeds into its characters in a most natural way  The way each supporting character is perceived is butchered and rearranged by Orwell  O Brien who receives magnanimous goodwill turns out to be the opposite  As does old Mr Charrington  And for beloved Julie reversal occurs in the opposite direction  They all just reflect the Party s principles in the way they project themselves  This book just pushed me one step closer to becoming a person people might point to and say     read himself crazy   But even if I was looked upon as crazy  is there still a chance that I might be right as a minority of one  Is sanity statistical   Plus double good  An excellent novel The weakness   helplessness of Winston is depicted as the weakness of an individual against a well established order  although corrupt  wrong   This makes one realize meek we  human  really are So  who is this Big brother  Glodstein  or No one in general  If Goldstein is the Public enemy no  1 why would party keep him alive in history  why don t they erase him  If there won t be anyone in records against party no one will follow the path of revolution  But there s a catch in that Party needs Goldstein to be alive and plotting against them  To feed of the fear and hatred against him Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the future  This slogan of the party explains why the party is invincible  The rewriting of past over and over again leaves the leaves no distinction between truth and lies  And all this for POWER Hats off to Eric Arthur Blair for such a novel  You know what makes 1984 work better than Brave New World for me  It s the characters and their futile hope  I always thought Brave New World was the more plausible future whereas 1984 seems in many ways superseded by the amount of computer control that already exists  Winston Smith s arc is terrifying  You hope for the best and when the reality sinks in  you can t help but feel utterly crushed  I ll write more on this later  Ever imagined yourself enjoying a dystopian book  1984 will make you experience this feeling  It is the kind of books that you devour instead of reading yet it leaves you in the end with more questions than answers  Built around simple characters and an extremely complex political setting  1984 tackles mainly the theme of Power and control  2   2   5  Those who have the power can make those who don t believe in the soundness of the equation  in a world where reason  emotions and freedom have been annihilated A visionary philosophical feature that everyone should read at least once  The Book 1984  By George Orwell  is a fantasy fiction work about a dystopian civilization that leaves its citizens in the dark  which amplifies he message in which the over indulgence of power and the restriction of free will forced on citizens often can lead to a dystopian wasteland  bound to cause revolution with an oppressed society  At the time the author had written this book  it was in the middle of the boom of nationalism and patriotism in favor of capitalism as the United States had started the cold war with the USSR  who promoted socialistic values in communism  which by definition  is a governmental system of extreme power given to the government  and gives the power to regulate and control virtually everything in that nation  America was opposed to this as a nation of smaller government and based on free will and independence  which influenced many writers from both the U S  and Britan to write books to exemplify the disadvantages of government power over its citizens In the close future of 1984  a 39 year old man named Winston was a government worker in the ministry of truth in London  Oceania  a nation that is governed by the Party  with its leader Big Brother  All around the city of London  The people are constantly monitored by big brother and are never out of its eye  Winston  because of the constant monitoring and surveillance  has grown tired with the party and their stranglehold among the people of London  which is quickly tightening its grip as the party is forcing the new invented language known as  Newspeak  which eliminates any words or phrases that will signal any resistance or revolution  In fact  the party employs Winston to change past documents in history and eliminating any truth in the past  to make the party  Big Brother  and the injustice they are performing look more favorable in history  In response to his frustration  Winston commits a crime punishable by death by writing his resentful thoughts in a journal  which is committing thought crime  one of the worst crimes to commit as Big Brother limits the thoughts that you can express  and is punishable by death  He then engages in a love affair with a woman that shares the same feelings named Julia in secrecy  while being superstitious as to if another man  O Brien  is a member of a group to bring down big brother  or is one of them  As time goes on  He sees Julia as a physical necessity  regardless of danger of thoughtcrime  but must keep their thoughts and love a secret  as any expression such as love or passion must be suppressed by the party  They must keep their love in secrecy  and fight the oppression of the oppressive big brother  but their struggles can be in vain This capitalistic manifesto is very exhilarating and interesting as it provides a commentary that individuality is a needed thing in life and must not be taken away in order to keep all of the natural rights us as humans are born with  and to lose the sense of individuality is to lose ourselves into a world with no identity  I definitely agree with his messages for that reason because I strongly believe that independence is the key needed to unlock the gates of life  and if life Is not lived free  you are not living a life  you are a puppet to another  Again  since this book is written in a time when many Britons and Americans where borderline paranoid and afraid of communism finding its way into their country  so we can comfortably assume that this book tries to suggest that the possibility of a communist hold on western civilization and to warn people that they must stand with their country to save their freedom  I feel that this book as strengthened my stance on limited government influence on our citizens because it really speaks to me of the dangers of the over extension of the hand of the ruling powers that can destroy and obliterate any part of me that separates me and my peers from a faceless regime  so I call to everybody to remember to save their individuality and pride in the fact that you have freedom in this world  as life without it may be no life at all   Incredibly well crafted as a view of an alternate reality  the author leaves the reader with an intellectual depression like no other   A haunting and tragic tale of a dystopic existence under a totalitarian regime  told by one of the best political writers of our time  This is a classic that is quoted in everyday popular culture  from  Big Brother  to NewSpeak  It s a timeless work of  Fiction   and is a must have for all bookshelves  I m left pondering how Orwell would reflect on Facebook if he were here to see it www booksnakereviews blogspot com 1984 by George Orwell is a fantastic work that portrays how society could end up if we continue to be ignorant  While it is an extreme  there are already certain controlling aspects of the government that are related to this book in scary ways  Aside from the parallels drawn to the real world  it was a very enjoyable read that I would definitely recommend  Amidst all of the foreshadowing and plot twists  there were great details and vivid  intense descriptions of scenery that really connected me to the book  One of my favorite parts of this book was how Orwell implemented futuristic technology for his time  but over 50 years later  this technology is mostly possible  It s very amusing to think about how the world could have ended up if certain events had taken place  and this might be a very accurate representation of it  The vagueness of the descriptions of the rest of the world separates it from the likes of the hunger games and other books of this nature  It doesn t claim to be the only country on earth  but just a totalitarian state that may or may not be modeled throughout the rest of the world  In the end  this book deserves to be read by everyone and can offer tremendous thought provoking ideas about the world we live in today  1984 is an extremely sobering read that details the new political cult of Big Brother that arises in a post war world  Under the watchful eye of Big Brother the inhabitants of Oceania have no political or personal freedom and are constantly monitored by telescreens  hidden microphones  the Thought Police  and even their own families  People commonly disappear and are erased from all records for crimes as simple as talking in their sleep  It is against this background that the reader is introduced to Winston Smith  an Outer Party member  whose job it is to rewrite public records to ensure the complete dominance of Big Brother  Although Winston appears to be a diligent and conforming party member he harbours an intense dislike of all that Big Brother stands for  He starts his rebellion by keeping a journal where he jots down his anti semantic feelings and begins to question the plausibility of Big Brother s statements  such as Big Brother invented the aeroplane   He soon begins an affair with Julia  a promiscuous young woman who also works for the party  As the two grow closer they try to devise ways to break away from Big Brother s tyrannical reign  However  it is soon revealed that no one escapes the watchful eye of Big Brother I believe that this book becomes increasingly relevant as technology advances and as people pay less and less attention to the political motives of elected representatives  The reality that mankind will one day become entrapped in a world controlled by Big Brother is all too plausible   just look at how far the Nazi s got before the rest of the world intervened  The question of freedom and privacy and how much of either people are entitled to is a very sombre overtone in this novel  This is one of those rare books that I would recommend that everyone should read  it is eye opening to say the least   I was not sure if this book deserved a 4 or a 5  I gave it a 5 because  apart from being an amazing book  I think it is amazing how someone is able to write such a dark profecy for his own world  The future described br Orewll in this book is really sad  dusty  miserable and very gray  I wouldnt wish anyone to be in a place like that This book is very good  I would describe this book as dark  The reality created by Orwell is not what many of us would desire  But that is indeed one of the good points this book has  even if its not  real   it is very easy to believe it and follow Winston s life  One quickly gets involved with the character  The only part I didnt like was the part where Winston finally gets Goldstein s book  It was so disapointing  I expected a revolutionary book  but it was like reading a boring economics textbook  or something of that style  It was nothing like what I expected The end was also disapointing  I didnt expect them to overthrow the party  but at least to die in a more dign way  I dont know why but I thought they would either die under an explosion  or a bomb  or suicide together  Winston and Julia  Anyways  I completely understand why the Goldstein s book is so boring  I think it is another lie from the party to catch people who believe in revolution and have hope   and I understand why the ending is so sad and disapionting  if the ending wasnt like it is  the book would have lost all its power and meaning  Orwell had to finish his story leaving no hope  Finally  I enjoyed it  and I would recommend this book to you  So  as I may have said before  the book was written in 3 parts The first one is quite introductory  It shows you how the stuff works for Winston and the rest of the people  Society  the proles  telescreens  the hates  and how the dreams of revolution are not that common  nor allowed   The second part starts to show the real stuff  He finally met Julia  and they can be considered as  rebels    or criminals of thought  The third part was  to me  unexpected  In a way  I was hoping for a happy ending  The book portrays from the beginning a sad  grey world  and I was hopping some colour in the end  Even if it was not what I initially wanted  I think it was the right ending for the book  In the end it gives this weird message about how we wont control our thoughts and how we will lose our freedom  Enjoy it  Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two makes four  Yet in the city of London located in Airstrip One  formerly known as Great Britain     a province of the superstate Oceania  formerly known as the United States  Canada  and the United Kingdom     men and women are denied that freedom by a political system called English Socialism  also known as Ingsoc in the government s invented language  Newspeak  At the head of this political system is Big Brother  and Big Brother says two plus two makes five or three or  really  whatever Big Brother wants because Big Brother decides what is truth History is controlled by the Ministry of Truth  which is where the protagonist of the novel Winston Smith works rewriting newspaper articles so the historical record always supports the current party line  Those who question Big Brother or presume to insist two plus two makes four are often turned in by their neighbors and children  persecuted for  thoughtcrimes   and tortured by the Ministry of Love  While Oceania is in a state of perpetual war  the Ministry of Abundance continues to tell the starving masses that agricultural yields and production levels continue to climb higher and higher Now that I have finished this novel  I m wondering how and why I left it languishing on my to read list for so many years  It truly is the masterpiece people claim it to be and I should not have resisted reading this novel for as long as I did The intricacies of the political system Orwell creates is particularly thought provoking  and I found myself pausing the audiobook so I could ponder over a small detail Winston introduces into his narration  Although the year 1984 has long since passed  the message of this novel continues to resonate today  particularly as media outlets position themselves as supportive or critical of one political party and present the historical record in a certain light to reflect poorly on the opposing political party It is often stated that history is written by the victor  but is the record being continuously rewritten by each new regime  Is war a tool to motivate the economy  Is fear utilized by the political elite to control the masses and continue to perpetrate the need for war  Certainly  I can come up with examples to confirm the truth of all three questions in today s society showing just how applicable the message of Orwell s novel continues to be This is the second audiobook I have listed to narrated by Frank Muller  but this is the first where his narration really stood out in my mind  His ability to convey Winston s anxiety and fear with the inflection of his voice caused me to tense  to feel those same emotions that the rather stark narrative might have caused me to miss  Read twice 1970 s and last year  rwyh sysyh mHnkh    wtwSf  qlyh ldwl lstbddyh f  l mwm wn knt swdwyh l  Hd kbyr    wlkn kl mj f  lrwyh w lb D mnh tTbqh ldwl lfshyh bm fyhm  bld     nhyh

s a GREAT book that encompasses the real meaning and essence of dictatorship  brainwashing and the suffering of honest  solid people under these regimes  In short  a wonderful read  except for the Room 101 part    I have never  in my entire life as a reader  read something as disturbing as Orwell s  1984   This book made me physically and mentally uncomfortable as it showed me this world in which people have lost everything that makes us humans  autonomy  compassion  memory  individuality  rationality  One might argue that the villain in this novel would probably be Big Brother  or the Party  or O Brien  that s just not the way I see it  To me  the greatest enemy here is power  Power  as O Brien describes it in the book  means power over humans   their past and their thoughts  The exercise of power in  1984  is what crushes people s minds and what sucks humanity out of both the powerful and the powerless  In the end  it felt amazing to be disturbed by Orwell s work because it made me realise how powerful it was  and therefore how powerful dystopian literature can be  Its political and social insights  its scientific approach    Dystopians make us  readers  think about our own society and our distant  or near  future  Having said that  Winson s journey towards the loss of his humanity is one hell of a warning  You wanna know what this book is like  Just turn on the TV  or better yet  step outside your own front door   If you want a vision of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever   Orwell s tale of a totalitarian  dysfunctional world makes for a highly readable novel  I spent many late  enjoyable nights reading this book  feeling both revolted and fascinated  constantly obsessing over the events it described  To quote Newspeak  it was doubleplusgood George Orwell is a master of prose and mind games  and nowhere does it come through as brilliantly as in the latter half of 1984  I was struck by Big Brother s similarities to Mao Zedong  his  omnipotence   his ruthless brutalities  during China s Cultural Revolution   and the Communist Party s all consuming fight to monitor every individual s actions and choices  In that sense  Orwell s dated work is frighteningly prophetic  and resembled Jung Chang s nonfictional Wild Swans so much that I frequently experienced an unsettling sense of deja vu This book has justified its place on the list of great literary works  and it got me thinking deeply about totalitarianism  religion  and psychology  I expect to re read it numerous times  and I highly recommend it  kapos etsi moiazoun ta aristourgemata loipon  I read this in high school back in the neolithic era  I enjoyed it then as a distopian novel  This time I m I still enjoyed it as literature  but too much of it hit a little close to home for modern times  I hope it is still being read and discussed in high schools across the country  It s more important than ever to heed the warnings in this new age of information  This is a marvelous work  The story involves the depiction of a totalitarian society where everyone lives under a 24 7 surveillance of the thought police and the mental dilemmas of a person who despises this entire setup as a crude psychological joke  In the later parts of the book it becomes very interesting and appealing  It also carries an excellent monologue on   The theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism  which stretches for a good 20 25 pages and is mindblowing  The last part of the novel is a psychological treatise which goes on to talk about things like solipsism  make believe anything and the instinct of survival against fear  Yes this was the best part  Orwell dramatizes the entire scene slowly and gradually only to present the crescendo which says that beyond pain  beyond humiliation  beyond drudgery if there lies anything which will definitely break you down then it is FEAR  A must read for people interested in psychology  Also the monologue is so interesting that it has compelled me to read the works published on private property  machinery and wealth    Basically Gandhi and Marx  All in all excellent composition  simply a masterpiece  Ditulis 1948 sebagai ramalan utk tahun 1984  yes  but no  poinnya bukan itu  Novel ini adalah obor pemandu bagi generasi muda ditiap jaman sepanjang waktu agar mereka menyadari bahwa dilorong lorong jaman kehidupan mereka  fasisme selalu hidup  direproduksi dan olehkarenanya berubah wajah  Jangan sampai kehilangan kemanusiaan dan menjadi gandum atau babi ternakan diladang subur fasisme  Fasisme Koptik yg dipimpin Firaun telah tenggelam di Laut Merah bersama pasukannya  tapi kemudian ia bangkit kembali di lembah Jordan  kemungkinan kini ia di lembah Silikon atau bahkan gubug darurat tepi sungai yg kotor dan bahkan ditempat tersuci sekalipun  Di imperium atau bahkan di dusun dusun  So  1984 it was  When I finished this book  I had this brilliant idea of writing a long  well thought and insightful killer review  But whenever I sat down  starting to type  I just couldn t do it  Thoughts would rush through my brain  exploding like bombs  So I ll keep it simple  Please read this book  It will be a painful  horrible  somewhat disgusting experience  It will hurt  It may haunt you  It may scare you  Maybe it will come to your pillow  Maybe you will get a little paranoid for a couple of days  looking over your shoulder more often than you would usually do  But worst of all  it will make you question everything  And that is so important  Now  maybe more than ever  And you know what s even more worse  People told me  that they had this  Now maybe more than ever  thought 20 years ago  And 25 years ago  And 30 years ago  So please  read this  In it s unpleasent way  it s brilliant   The original masterpiece set in a dystopian future   The genre defining work that I doubt will be eclipsed any time soon  given the preference for angsty teenage drama that has overtaken the dystopian future genre       eugh  and an intensely philosophical read  It s one of the top 3 books I have ever read  alongside The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged   BTW I would also love to read the book  I totally loved the two chapters that we get to read alongside Winston and was extremely intrigued but I guess George Orwell never wrote it out as a separate book  shame   1984 was a truly amazing piece of literature  It highlights the psychological power language has over the human mind  It outlines one major theme with which I agree completely   Language is the only limit of thought  for we cannot think what we cannot say  Semantics aside  this theme is very universal and very true   This book is insanely disturbing  When I was a kid  I had pet rats  but I don t know if I will ever look at them quite the same way after reading 1984  George Orwell had some kind of keen insight into the idea of dictatorship and dystopia  So many facets of this made up culture reminded me of North Korea  The ending was so vague I m still wondering exactly what happened  My mind was blown by this book    in a good way   1984 would send a chill up your spine at times  Summarising in one line  Orwell makes us understand and feel what freedom really is  Este libro al igual que Un Mundo Feliz de Aldous Huxley  nos hace ver el futuro como no quisieramos imaginarlo  Es impresionante lo que un sistema puede hacer en la mente de alguien a traves del contubernio con el gobierno y la prensa  Cuando todo un engrane de mentiras o verdades a medias se orquestan y se dirigen a la sociedad y terminan causando el efecto deseado  que la gente a pesar de ver y pensar no vean en realidad  o lo mas triste  sean obligados a creer en virtud a la necesidad  Como el mismo Orwell escribio en esta obra  La cordura no depende de las estadisticas El final no me lo esperaba  Vale la pena leerlo  Cinco estrellitas  I am not a fan of deep books  I usually read light stuff for fun  However  1984 is one of the first books in a while that made me think  After finishing the last page  I had to take a time out and ponder about the nature of the human being and our society  Contrarily to all the fatalists out there  I won t say our society is like the one depicted in 1984  at least not in the west   but still it makes me think I think what I liked the most about this novel is how it breaks the mold  I ve grown accustomed to patterns in literature  But it seems 1984 isn t normal literature  There were some shocking plot twists that legitimately surprised me and that I never saw coming  especially at the end   If I reread this novel  it will be for this reason I read Animal Farm in grade 9 a few years ago and adored it  I now look forward to reading everything Orwell has written  he must be one of the best authors of all times in my opinion  A work of art  I was so immersed in the book I felt like I  myself  were Winston Smith  The strong willed and rebellious Winston Smith  doomed to be disagreed with  punished and crushed  I felt so much hate  hope and sorrow often all at once when reading this book    when being Winston  The worst part is  our society isn t so different  Sanity is seen as statistical  But remember   If there is hope  it lies in the proles    The terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses  mere feelings were of no account  while at the same time robbing you of all the power over the material world  When once you were in the grip of the party  what you felt or did not feel  what you did or refrained from doing made literally no difference  Whatever happened to you vanished  and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again  You were lifted clean out of the stream history  And yet to the people of only two generations ago  this would not have seemed all important  because they were not attempting to alter history  They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question  What mattered were individual relationships  and a completely helpless gesture  an embrace  a tear  a word spoken to a dying man  could have value in itself  The proles  it suddenly occurred to him  had remained in this condition  They were not loyal to the party or a country or an idea  they were loyal to one another  For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them as merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world  The proles had stayed human  They had not hardened inside  They had held on to primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by conscious effort  And in thinking this he remembered  without apparent relevance  how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage stalk    pg146   paranoyak olmamak elde degil  psikolojimi bozdu bu kitap   D yalniz ortada muthis bir zeka muthis bir kurgu var  gercekten kitap hakettigi yerdeymis  cok sonralardan gelen biri olarak soyluyorum  D Only a select few novels can boast of consistently placing among the literature world s greatest reads  and of those  none possess the stark realism  vivid imaging  and chilling implication of what could be that is characteristically associated with 1984  Undisputedly  Orwell s satirical masterpiece demonstrates the dangers of gov t like no other  and also directly competes with novels such as Fahrenheit 451 over the idea of censorship  The weighty words conveyed by this skillful rendering of dystopia are sure to change the way readers approach gov t  as well as the value of the past and individuality   War is peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength The motto of the Party  the sole and leading political group in the continental US  now named Oceania  is evidently an oxymoron  yet further thought reveals the twisted logic behind the Party ideals  Perpetual war  instigated as a method of burning excess resources to discourage development  in turn not only keeps the population down  but also creates a period of everlasting  peace   as both sides are far too large for any one side to ever gain a significant advantage  Freedom  more specifically freedom of the mind is quite possibly the bane of Party rule  so consequently free thought is suppressed to the point that nearly all of the populace is incapable of any deviation whatsoever  Stating that the burden of slavery entails freedom acts as a subtle warning against free thought  The elimination of all irrelevant information and overzealous censoring of remaining information cause the majority of Party members to trust everything the Party says  as there is no way to verify anything  As a result  a strong amount of trust is placed in the Party  uniting the population and consequently strengthening their power 1984 is chock full of satire  mainly of gov t policies  censorship  and whether or not to monitor citizens  The destitute world that lays in 1984 is a prime reminder of what can happen if the gov t favors power over morality  security over privacy  correctness over trust  This is the world that our protagonist  the titular common man Winston Smith goes about his daily life  Unlike other protagonists  Smith represents the common  working class man  devoid of any particular traits or skills  As a worker at the Ministry of Truth  Smith is in charge of erasing any information that contradicts the Party s standpoints  as well as editing  Despite appearing as a dedicated worker  in the confines of his mind  Winston yearns to rebel  constrained by his dismay at possibly being the last free man in Oceania  To his surprise he encounters two coworkers who appear to be rebels  one being a member of the coveted Inner Party  However he flaunts his trust  and soon Winston finds himself staring at the polished barrel of a revolver  wielded by none other than his supposed confidants Despite the passage of time  1984 remains a great read for anyone in need of more dystopian literature  yet with a unique setting and unexpected plot   1984 is set in Oceania  where The Party  led by Big Brother  wants everyone unified over one thought War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength Winston Smith  who lives in Airstrip One  does not think that is right  but he can t show it  as the everyone is under heavy surveillance  and he would be arrested for having an independent thought  aka  thoughtcrime   He works for the Ministry of Truth  and is in charge of erasing the past  and replacing it with the present  which will then become the past  and will then be replaced with a new present  a continuous cycle  Lies become truth  all to make Big Brother never look wrong  In this world  children denounce their own parents for thoughtcrime  telescreens monitor every word and movement  people are separated by their social standing  and those who know too much are capable of making Big Brother seem wrong are constantly vaporized  and their existence is erased  Winston s story is 1984   In some ways i wish he never wrote this book  its just a guide line for any modern dictatorship  But then again its a damn good read  I wrote a book report on 1984 my Junior year of high school  I read 1984 for the first time the summer after graduation  Two things about that 1  All Hail Wikipedia 2  A work of fiction that is truly capital g Great is still great even when you know where it is going  There is no beginning  no middle  no end  no suspense  no moral  no causes  no effects  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time    Kurt VonnegutThe Slaughterhouse Five quote above obviously applies more to Vonnegut s own time hopping narratives  And obviously the speculative science fiction of 1984 focuses more on these extremely common narrative attributes that Vonnegut has somehow deemed optional  Despite that the quote  the latter part anyway  rings true  What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments  So  on to 1984 and its Marvelous Moments    A suitably bleak introduction to its far off but closer than you d hope futuristic world and its quietly fed up protagonist  Winston Smith     A character s impassioned musing on his work  the systematic paring down of the dictionary known as newspeak  that is so convincing  I finished the passage almost agreeing that  yeah  maybe it would be nice to have less words to worry about    A hopeful meeting between our protagonist and a high status  like minded fellow    A particularly troubling sequence involving rats   The last Four Words 1984 is often praised mostly as a book of ideas  And rightfully so  to a point  as an exploration of nationalism  censorship  betrayal  cognitive dissonance  or lack thereof   and language  it stands tall  To do that  though  is to overlook what I believe truly compels  the doomed love story at the center of all this craziness  The pining  the secret rendezvous  all up to that final exchange  sounding remarkably close to how any normal post break up conversation could go  this is what makes 1984 great literature as opposed to a great essay  Following the two important shifts of Winston s love is just about as moving as anything  I had read this in high school and  after reading a collection of Orwell s essays  thought I would re read this now  Clearly his image of the future  from his vantage in 1948  is strongly reflective of both his experiences around the Communist Party  I think never a member but clearly a sympathizer  esp pre WWII   and of WWII  both the horrors of the Nazis  and life in Britain during the war   He was very pessimistic about the prospects of humanity  as his post war essays also show I found the book less interesting than I expected   much of it read like a tract  an exposition of Orwell s view of the near inevitability of totalitarian government  I think he would have been both amazed and horrified at what has in fact happened since   amazed at the resilience of people who refuse to be ground down  and horrified at some of the dreadful things that humans continue to do to each other  eg Rwanda  Bosnia    Clearly society and history as it unfolds is more complex than he thought Nevertheless  this is an important book that had a big impact  and continues to be highly regarded   I am glad I re read it   rwyh kthr mn ry  h w l rw  hy ltrjmh lmmtzh wlty nqlt bHrfyh kl m rd lmw lf yDHh w lt byr  nh 1984 by George Orwell is the author s prediction of how he imagined the world if it was ruled euphemistically  The story takes place in London  in a world where you are told that Freedom is Slavery  independent thinking  or  thoughtcrime   is wrong  and where history can be rewritten and redone  The entire society is ruled by  The Party  controlled by the omnipotent ruler  Big Brother   This story was written during the Cold War  and was written almost as a warning to the offenses that the Party committed  The book heavily touches on censorship  where history is completely blocked from the public and completely re written  to the point where the main character s job is to eliminate all evidence that someone ever existed in history who was mentioned in a newspaper article  The citizens are also always under constant surveillance  monitored by cameras and  telescreens  to monitor aspects of life as small as facial expressions  George Orwell uses the themes of surveillance and censorship to warn us and tell us that there a government and society ruled by deception and fear can not work  I agree with the author s ideas  and especially appreciate the way in which he wrote the story  George Orwell made the antagonist have arguments and statements so persuasive that I was unsure what to believe at some times  I agree with the author s concepts of control and how  power entirely for its  your  sake  is bad  and especially thought that his idea that history cannot and should not be deleted is something that is important and people should grasp  My advice to people who may want to read this book is to spend time on each part of the book  and not go into this book expecting it to be a short read  I thought this book was extremely well written and outstandingly thought  provoking  I recently finish this book  it was often listed as one of the best book ever written  So when I got my hands on them  I knew I had to read it  However  although I had the books in my possession for a while  only recently I have decided I got all the courage to finish reading it  The book was written with a very suffocating grim outlook and sometimes it could be demeaning to read such unpleasant book in your free time  But it was my time worth and I m glad I ve read it  Nineteen Eighty Four follows a person  Winston Smith  on his rebellion against his government and his eventual downfall  What really was difficult for me was how grim and how hateful he was against his totalitarian government  It s maddening because it s as if everyone but him remembers the past  one reminisince I share  It s a frustrating and it makes you feel helpless about your circumstances  It s suffocating because there s literally no where you can run  Orwell understood human emotions  particularly human fear  very well  I noticed he did manage to manipulate the reader s emotions and thought as well  just as much of the main character  He wrote it as a foreshadowing of communism and totalitarian  However reading about his back story made me lose respect in him  In his book he warned us about controlling thought and the Thought Police  but in his real life he captures or betrayed people he thought could have  possibly communistic thoughts   I m not sure how true that is  but if that s true then I ve have no respect for him at all  Going back to the book  I love the layers and layers of complexity of the book that only came true to me reading until the last sentence of the book  How Smith already was a dying man since the first chapter  I loved it  The character are wonderfully brought to life with complex human emotions and that s rare  Easily one of the best books I ve read and I will recommend to anyone who isn  afraid of terrifying alternative reality   Socing  psicopolizia  Due Minuti d Oblio  psicoreato  bispensiero  voltoreato  neolingua e tanto altro   geniale   Although the reviews for the book vary significantly depending on the aims of the perusing reader  1984 is a principal read  In my opinion  the author is a keen observer and analyst  a genius perhaps who belong to the few who have the ability to see the tiniest details and use them to recreate a larger picture of reality But back to the book For those aiming to be amused by a STORY  I give this THREE stars  The plot is quite simple  but not something to disappointed about  The story merely serves as valves in a complex network where injections of the author s theories and ideas can safely be done without destroying the momentum For those aiming to be amused by the CHARACTERS  you will have something  many things actually  to think about  While the Party holds an extremely strict view on Sexuality  the main characters are exactly the opposite  they have this awareness and this liberality that imperils them  Also  Orwell has done a great job in describing what it is to be human  the challenges of mortality  pain  hunger  and our intellectual and cognitive capacities and their limitations  The characters grow according to their ambitions and abilities  and they could also be altered through manipulation of their weaknesses  FIVE stars For those aiming to be amused by CONCEPTS  this book receives another FIVE stars  A few of the many interesting ideas are the following  the association between language and thinking and decision making  trimming down vocabulary ultimately limits our range of thinking   the need for a unified mind constantly at war in order to preserve the infallibility of a power  the need to manipulate standards to lessen diversity of the members of society  the need to alter history in order to control the present  and importantly  DOUBLETHINK  read the book to understand what this means  Somewhere in the last third of the book comes in the heavy discourse of Goldstein s philosophy  a book reading scene   Anyone who has a weak heart for politics must take a break before diving into the waters  It is not a warning though  for a warning generally implies that there is something dangerous ahead  Far from being perilous or something like an ordeal  Goldstein s book is a very important part  if not the most  in the novel and should not be skipped  It contains the foundation of the plot So there  I hope this looks like a decent block of gibberish  Sincerely hope you take up and enjoy the book  It is a future where everything is old or broken  where scarcity is maintained by the government and where middle class citizens are kept under tight control  Surveillance  mandatory parades  and revisionist history are the keys of the setting  The novel

spy state was  Orwellian   I think that may have been a vast understatement  The  Orwellian  future that America  and  to a greater extent  the World at large  has come under is rendered as plain as day as I pay attention to news of technological advancements  legislation again them  and the cries of Social Justice Warriors who war against freedom loving individuals seeking only the thought crimes of self expression  Say anything that remotely suggests that Zionism is a bad thing and you are labeled an anti semite  Point out the hypocrisies of feminazism and get labeled as a woman hating misogynist  There is  clearly  a balance  and 1984 should have been viewed as a warning and NOT as a training manual  Our world is clearly in shambles   wrecked and ruined by those who seek only power  The rules of the game are laid out as plain as day in this wonderful  yet frightening  tale  Many things in my own life seem like a mirror between Winston s travels  his interactions with Julia and with O Brien  Fortunately  I have not been beaten  and my will still stands triumphant  I am still free  and yet  I am still a slave   we are all still slaves to freedom    lHry  hy Hry  lqwl n 2 2 4

qT      Another end of the world book  It s been a while since I ve read this one  but I remember liking it  The thing I like about this  fad  genre is that it causes you to think about the direction our world is going  It causes you to look at current countries regimes and their repressive nature  China  and it causes you to look back into history at those types of governments  When a person gets too much control a lot of bad can happen  even if they believe their intentions are good  That s why our founding fathers created a system of checks and balances to help combat any abuse of power  When power goes unchallenged it can lead to dangerous consequences  I just finished watching the new Captain America movie  the Winter Soldier  and it s another example of how too much power is a bad idea  even if it starts with the best intentions  Come to ink of it  a lot of movies and books are trying to portray this message in different ways  Batman uses everyone s cell phones to find the Joker in Dark Knight Rises  but heroically realsies that no one should have that kind of ability  Anyway  I m a little off track  1984 was the book that started it all  and it s been a constant theme in literature and movies as of late   Hunger Games  Divergent  The Giver  Ender s Game  Etc   George Bernard Shaw said  If by age of 20  you are not a communist  you are a fool    if by age of 30 you are still a communist  you are an even bigger fool Well  i would suggest all who turn 20 to read this book  save 10 years of unnecessary  Transformation hahahaha    this was terrifying dude   It was a bright  cold day in April and the clocks were just striking thirteen From the first sentence  I knew this would be a whopper of a dystopian novel  I read this before most people  only a year after hitting the double digits  Then I read it again  And again  And again  I read it so much  that by the time I was in high school I could recite most of the novel from memory  This was my first dystopian book after the Giver  and from then on I became hooked on that genre  I read dystopian novel after dystopian novel  but to this day  none compare  Orwell s writing is genius  he has a keen understanding on how the mind works and how people would react to certain events  The plot is unique  at his time   and very suspenseful  The only  dry  part of this novel  cut it some slack  every novel has dry parts  is where Orwell inserted an essay as part of the story  The essay is very good  just not what I was expecting  You can easily skip that entire section without hurting your understanding of the novel  1984 is one of those rare books that can combine science fiction  mystery  suspense  and romance with the artistry of a master painter mixing his oil paints  You feel the hate  the pain  and the wonder of the main character  The Thought Police become your own nightmare  This book makes you fear for the one safe place every human on earth has a right to   their own mind  I have read Dickens  Shakespeare  and Huxley  I have read Mitchell  Collins  and Rowling  But nothing I have read has ever come close to this beautiful  tragic piece of literature  Freedom is Slavery  War is Peace  Ignorance is Strength  Big Brother is watching   My favourite book of all time  Picked it up one day  couldn t put it down until I was finished  Should be required reading in schools  Although it s an allegory for the totalitarian excesses of fascism and Soviet communism  not  as some have argued  a definitive takedown of socialism  it s written by a socialist  dumbass  some of the means of social control depicted by Orwell in Nineteen Eighty Four should be somewhat familiar to the 21st century citizen   from the manner in which society is kept on its toes by a constant War on Euras whoops  sorry  I meant War on Terror  to the uniformity of the  centrist  media and political class In the UK our Trident nuclear defense system is up for renewal  Next time almost everybody with a voice starts screaming  WE CAN T POSSIBLY GET RID OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS  BECAUSE   LIKE  PUTIN AND STUFF AND  LIKE   ISIS  RIGHT  AMIRIGHT   remember the three global superpowers of Nineteen Eighty Four  stockpiling nukes they never intend to use as a display of dick waving supremacy I talk about the politics of the book because Orwell is didactic as hell  this is so much of a polemic posing as a novel it might as well be written by boring as fuck ultra right ideologue Ayn Rand  However  if only Marx had thought of cloaking his rhetoric and analysis in a thrilling web of dystopic intrigue  On the other hand  if Marx had written the Goldstein s Book segment of the narrative it might ve been slightly less of a slog  Conclusion  dope as fuck   The Big Brother is watching you     No wonder this book is a classic  it is unbelievable how relevant it still is and how accurate those predictions that Orwell made back in 1940 s have been and still are today  Winston Smith is an unlikely hero who lives in a futuristic society where  The Big Brother  watches your every move and freedom of thought is the highest crime imaginable  In that world love is unorthodox  passion and desire are punishable by death  trust and friendship do not exist  and your own children can turn you in to the thought police for talking in your sleep  Winston takes a step towards a slippery path by beginning an affair with a young and beautiful coworker Julia  a thing unimaginable in the new world  But it is only a matter of time before they have to face the consequences of committing a crime of independent thought  The world of 1984 as extreme as it is is after all is not that far fetched from the one we live in   l yjdr bk ktb  t lyq w nt GDb  lsbb l wl lqrty lhdhh lrwy   n  nwnh hw  sn

Oligarchy  I m seeing it everywhere now  and reconsidering the ways our government functions   YOU  ARE  THE  DEAD  Oh my God  I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book  It completely blew my mind  It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected  Or in Newspeak  Double Plus Good  Let me preface this with an apology  If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review  I can t help it  My mind is completely fried This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings  with its richly developed culture and economics  not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak  or rather more of the anti language  whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it  The world building is so fully fleshed out and spine tinglingly terrifying that it s almost as if George travelled to such a place  escaped from it  and then just wrote it all down I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens  At the time  I remember really wanting to read 1984  although I never managed to get my hands on it  I m almost glad I didn t  Though I would not have admitted it at the time  it would have gone over my head  Or at the very least  I wouldn t have been able to appreciate it fully From the start  the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words  Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell For instance  he talks about how the act of writing itself is a type of time travel  It is communicating with the future  I write these words now  but others may not discover them for hours  weeks  or even years  For me  it is one time  For you the reader  it is an entirely different one Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers  I related to Winston so much in that way  I would have found a way to read or write The politics and psychology of this novel run deep  The society in the book has no written laws  but many acts are punishable by death  The slogan of the Party  War is Peace     is entirely convoluted  Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984  I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn t the name of the book  In the story  they don t actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth  It could very easily have been 1981  I think that makes the title more powerful  Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people  They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is  They don t have the right to keep track  Knowledge is powerful  Knowledge is necessary  But according to Big Brother  Ignorance is strength 1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition  recounting events  and explaining the society  These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters  but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled  He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing  none the less  I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book  but I was very fascinated by the culture Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person  This is not the case with this book  as it is written in third person  yet  I never failed to be encompassed in Winston s feelings  George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them  with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened  I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind  I became a member of the Thought Police  hearing everything  feeling everything and last but not least   what the Thought Police are not allowed to do  questioning everything I wasn t expecting a love story in this book  but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound  I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful  I wasn t sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not  but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche  at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons  whether it s at war with ourselves or with others  That is one thing I have never understood  why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing  One  censorship  is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world  the other  brainwashing  is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas  Both can be extremely dangerous Inside the ministry of Truth  he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence  We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love  where the brainwashing takes place  Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party A common theme occurred to me throughout the book  although it wasn t necessarily referenced consistently  The good of the many is more important than the good of the one  There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say   Of course  the many is more important than the one   but when inside Winston s head  all that I began to care about was his well being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother  I just wanted him to be at peace  Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one  I can t answer  I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world s  and maybe that s part of the problem but it s also human nature  I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people  Maybe I m naive for thinking that way  but so be it I almost don t know what to think about this book  I m not even sure my brain still works  or if it ever worked right at all  This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything  It s the strangest thing  Hmmm  Doublethink  Perhaps  Perhaps not Everything about this book is captivating  It s groundbreaking yet at the same time  purely classic  Ahead of its time  yet timeless  From Big Brother to the Thought Police  I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all Basically  I think everyone should read 1984 at some point  You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it  though  But it s all worth it in the end  It s absolutely incredible and I loved it  I don t re read many books but this will definitely be one of them  It is a hard read  but more importantly  it is a MUST read  ry    jwrj  wryl wSf fyh bdq  trj  lqym w lmsh r lnsny   mm lHzb fl ykwn hnk aml wl TmwHt w l Hbrwy  mmt     Gny    thwry  wfyh lkthyr mn drs

Through out the centuries  men have preached non thought and conformity  They were Big Brother  Through out history  a long line of men have stood  begining with Plato  continuing with Stalin  and propagated today by every man  woman  and child who believes that 2 2 5  that A is not A These men have stood for Big Brother  have stood for Ingsoc  have stood for evil  and have stood for 1984  George Orwell s masterpiece stood for all that which conflicted with those ideals  for love  for happiness  for individualism  for ego  On the surface  Orwell paints a picture more sickening  and more chilling to any person who believes that they are  that they are not a group  not a consortium  but exist in and for their own right This is not a Utopia  this is what could happen  not what has happened  It is a testament to those who will not take the easy way out  will not conform  It is instead a tribute to those who rage against the dying of the light  for those who think  and those who know that 1984 can be stopped  by those who have stopped it through out the centuries  those who will not sanctify the punishment of virtue  The hero of this book is not Winston  it is the old prole  hanging out laundry  and making the song written by a machine a thing of beauty  In the end  the proletariat must rise  for they are not the lowest class  but the highest  The party members consider themselves higher because they have force  and therefor  by their reckoning  power  But they do not  they have nothing  everything is the Party s  But they are not the party  Big Brother is the Party  In the end  the Prole s are the powerful ones  for they know the beauty of reality  and of the of the simple phrase   It is mine   The relevance of this book is amazing  It goes much beyond the intentions of Orwell himself  Every time I read it I discover something new  The insights and the relevance keep me tied up to this masterpiece  This time it occurred to me for example  while I was reading the terms O Brien dictates to Smith  that injustice and dictatorship prepare people to accept the utmost desperate measures in their resistance  One astonishing prediction in the novel is the invention of the versificator to compose songs  Isn t this what certain computer programs are doing nowadays for some modern composers   A lot is there  but the best advice to give is reread this amazing book  it renews itself continuously  6 zvezdi bikh dala    Cosa dire  commovente nella sua forza profetica  angosciante nella sua atmosfera opprimente  piu drammaticamente realista di  Il

interested  I really don t know where to start with this review  because this is one of those books you could talk about forever  so I ll just pick out a few of the bits that stood out for me   Lets start with the ending   Even though Julia and Winston s relationship was completely dysfunctional  Basically  Julia only cared about her own freedom  whereas Winston looked towards the future generations  it still kind of worked  What made the end of their relationship even more heartbreaking was that they chose not to be together   there was no feeling left   which made it even worse than the party keeping them apart   Even though Orwell s novels are almost overwhelmingly political  which can deduct from the story  I feel he is also a brilliant storyteller and I really liked his style  This is where my criticism comes in   I d love more character development  Also  because it was so political  there were some small parts I found tedious  for example the extract from Goldstein s book  did it really need to be so long    and the concept of newspeak   A nice touch in the novel was the foreshadowing of the telescreen in Winston and Julia s hideaway  Julia mentions cleaning behind the photo frame but never gets round to it  which is a forgettable and seemingly unimportant part of the book  Later on  you find out there s a telescreen behind it  I don t really know why this is relevent  I just liked it   Doublethink was such a great concept  It allows for the perfect totalitarian state  which alludes to Orwell s genius once more   Finally  I love how manipulated I felt by this book  I started off so sure that the party was despicable and immoral  However  by the end I was left questioning whether the party was actually in the wrong or whether Winston was  I also felt increasingly depressed throughout the novel   which was lovely as it reflected how inescapable the party was  and how hopeless the people of the state were  To fight oppression with the oppressor s own methods is a moral capitulation  In a sense it told him nothing that was new  but that was part of the attraction  It said what he would have said  if it had been possible to set his scattered thoughts in order    the best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you know already    This should be a textbook in all levels of education  If you haven t read this you haven t started thinking yet    It makes you ask yourself questions that matter   Apos passar a noite a pensar no que li e a processar a informacao destas 355 paginas  tenho apenas uma coisa a dizer vos  uau  1984  fala nos de uma sociedade distopica imaginada por George Orwell que nos  absorve  de uma maneira aterradora  Winston vive num mundo que e controlado por uma identidade desconhecida  o Big Brother  Para onde quer que olhe  o ser humano depara se constantemente com cartazes onde uma figura  de uma beleza austera   cujos olhos pareciam seguir tudo e todos Este e um mundo diferente do nosso  Mas sera assim tao diferente Os habitantes da Oceania estavam constantemente a ser bombardeados com informacao extremamente positiva pelo Partido  Este dizia o que as pessoas queriam ouvir  sabendo que o mundo nao era assim tao cor de rosa  Esta identidade procurava construir um mundo em que toda a gente pudesse ser controlada  manipulada  forcada a acreditar em determinados paradigmas sem perguntar  como  e  porque  Quem nao obedecesse a esta forma de pensar  sabia que a sua existencia seria apagada numa questao de tempo  Tortura  confissao  morte  Era esse o processo de  purificacao  do espirito que o Partido procurava O que mais me chocou foram as formas de manipulacao    A criacao da  Novilingua   lingua oficial cujo principal objetivo era tornar impossiveis todas as formas de pensamento

Warburg said it best   It s a great book but I pray I may be spared from reading another like it for years to come  One of the most famous books describing a future  dystopia  1984 was written to show Orwell s fear of a totalitarian state  It has the same vein of ideas and thoughts as  Brave New World   although that society is conserved via other means  and Farenheit 451  which I have to re read at some point  The book is somewhat pessimistic  although I prefer this a thousand times over a silly happy ending  Even so  this is the kind of book I suggest to everybody due to its political

classics are hardly ever suspenseful for me   Except maybe for the final parts of   Bleak House  and   A Tale of Two Cities    But this one grabbed me right by the ankles  I really coudln t put it down  read it in a tremendous speed and finished it in two days  It is truly a masterpiece  Whenever you think   Oh boy  this idea is untopable   there comes an even better thing around The only negative aspect about this book isn t itself  but its fans  People who constantly feel the urge to tell you how much alike our world is to 1984  only because we have facebook and twitter  Duh  This book isn t at all about that  it s about totalitarian regimes  Just shut up and read this magnificently crafted  intelligently designed and wonderfully written novel  Pro Tip  I suggest reading Orwell s   Animal Farm  first  which gives a great insight into how totalitarian regimes are formed and use to appear almost out of nowhere  Let it sit for a while and then head on to 1984   I thoroughly enjoyed 1984  The book focuses on the life of Winston Smith  a cog in a well oiled dystopia machine  It is set in a future  1984  ruled by  the Party   a political party that has firm control of everything within its borders from information to actions  focused more so on the former  and offers both theories and warnings about power within society that are eerily relevant today  In a society of uniformity and lacking autonomy where one is under constant surveillance and one social misstep can leave one vaporized from ever bring  Winston is a heretic  keeping an anti government diary of his thoughts and beliefs as well as acting on primal urges that would lead to his demise  Winston s life is mundane  exactly as the Party and Big Brother would like  however his thoughts are not  Winston works for the Ministry of Truth where he manipulates the media and reconstructs the past to match the future in an effort to continue the illusion that the Party is infallible  Although those around him are able to accept the constant changing of what is true despite being told the opposite moments earlier  Winston cannot seem to forget the things that he knows as true  He finds a love interest outside of his failed marriage in Julia  a much younger woman who too enjoys subverting the power of the Party  albeit in a manner that is much more superficial than Winston s deep seeded internal rebellion  The two find inevitably find themselves in the hands of the Party and learn what it is that true Power is  The book serves as a reminder of how absolute power can manifest itself in government  It is a warning  The story references other failed attempts of governments  from Nazi Germany to Monarchies of past  and how their uses of powers failed where the Party has not and will not  1984 delves into the communal psyche that needs to be cultivated in order to obtain this power and does so wonderfully The narrative of 1984 is its genius  Perhaps it in the historical references that give the reader a chance to relate to the story or how Orwell is able to make such a seemingly outlandish society seem unnerving plausible  He is able to achieve this ability to relate by carefully detailing how power has worked in both a historical and contemporary framework  He delves into the psychology of society and the castes within in a manner that is simplistic and obvious  This is the strongest aspect of the writing  the characters within this frames work lack  Other than Winston  through flashbacks to his childhood  the other characters in the book are not very well developed but at the same time  for the purpose of the novel  it is unnecessary to do so  Since the story is about a time in which individuality and free thought is penalized in the harshest way possible  the reader does not get to know the characters intimately  Instead the reader embarks on an engrossing narrative that is as relevant today as it was over 60 years ago when Orwell wrote it   1984 is a book about a person who wants to rebel against the Utopian government  An official argues with him and convinces him that the government was actually good  I think that this is a book with a deeper meaning   view spoiler  I think this because it really puts forth a message about how a government can surpress the people to the point where anyone who disagrees with it will either be killed or beaten and questioned until they start contradicting themselves and do not want to rebel anymore  One example of this is Withers  He loves Julia and hates Big Brother  After the beatings and the questionings he is starting to lie to himself  in Newspeak this is called doublethink   At one point they put him in a room full of rats  his least favorite thing in the world  and he tells them to do it to Julia  not him  This shows how a person changes into something else in the eyes of fear and will do anything  Something that I found very interesting was the concept of Newspeak  Newspeak is the language spoken in Oceana  Oceana is a super country comprised of the British Isles and the Americas  Newspeak is very similar to English  in fact  English is what Newspeak is based off of  In Newspeak one does not say good  bad  excellent  or terrible  they would say good  ungood  plusgood  and plusungood  In this way the vocabulary was reduced and this even made the people think in a more straightforward manner  In short  eventually nobody would be able to understand the concept of rebellion   hide spoiler  I think that 1984 is a very interesting book because it was written at a time where the year 1984 was in the distant future  We are now far past 1984  and the world is still not so bad as it is in 1984  the story   However  some parts of the book have come true  at least to an extent  For instance  the government  Big Brother  is not always watching us  Corporate America is  It is sort of scary to think that companies like Microsoft  Google  or Apple can basically monitor our whole lives  Enough of that  back to the book  1984 could be considered just another Utopian novel  but this one is different  Some of the main points that make it different that I would like to highlight are that it focuses on two main characters  it has a set date  and it is far more ominous and pessimistic about the future  well  it is now in the past First  the focus on just two characters  This is a very special aspect of 1984 because it lets you really look in to the lives of the average person in the story  It is written in first person which allows you to see the thoughts of on particular character  This allows you to learn what the people in this strange society are thinking  and gives you a greater understanding of the book  Also  because there is such an intent focus on so few characters  it almost forces you to feel sympathetic towards them  Feeling sympathetic for a character in a book is strange  you know it is not real  but yet you find yourself thinking about what you would do to help the characters if it was real  Also  having these feelings for characters in a book makes you not want to put the book down  and this is just one of the very many aspects that make up a good book Now for a little rant about the significance of having a set date on when a Utopian book  or any futuristic book  for that matter  is supposed to be set  Having a date allows people to think  Oh  that is only x years away from now   if the date has yet to become a date referred to as the present  or   I remember that year x y and z compare so well  That is amazing that the author could predict the future so well   This also makes the book seem extremely real  another aspect of the theoretical  good book We now come to a part of the utmost importance  the concept that in my opinion makes George Orwell such a special author  Enough with the delays and lead ins  The fact is that this book  and author  I might add  is that they are so ominous and pessimistic about things  1984 is probably the sad book regarding the future that I have ever read  For instance  it deals with the idea that the human race will lie to itself  change documents  and totally  wrongly  I might add  change the record of the past  We  humanity  have already started doing that  in a way  If we do not know something  we make something up that seems to make sense  and then promptly accept it as true I do not think that Orwell was trying to predict the future  rather  I think that he was trying to offer up a worst possible scenario for the future  In my opinion  I think that his motive for this was that he wanted people to think that this is what the world was coming to  which it was  this was just a major exaggeration  and try to shape themselves up  Nobody knows if this book made a difference in the course of history  but I will try to present you with the facts in the most straightforward way that I know how  1984 was  and still is  a book that was read by a large slew of people  This means that the idea was spread around  and those who had not read it had heard a little  or a lot  about the plot line and the basic themes of the story  This book shot a scare through most of the people who read it or heard about it  This could be taken as the fact that some people thought that Orwell was a prophet  and was predicting the future  This book was taken seriously by a very large group of people  and caused them to take action  We will never know if 1984 changed the world  but it is definitely worth thinking about  and  if it did change anything  it could not have been for the worse   qtbst mn lrwy   jbtn  wbtlkhS r y  mn ytHkm q  lmD  ytHkm f  lmstqbl     wmn ytHkm f  lHDr ytHkm f  lmD                      nHn lnsmH llmwt  b n yb thw mn

2003 or so  enjoying it even more  It s beautifully done The thing I do want to mention is what was going on in Orwell s life at the time he was trying to get the book out  It s well worth reading Orwell s essays  letters  etc   there s a Penguin edition in 4 volumes   Orwell was an amazing man   I love his personal integrity  that he so often works from first principles  his universal curiosity  his insight  his frankness  and of course his prose  I wrote a little about the conditions under which he finished 1984 here http   www fluidinfo com terry 2008 0   If you like Orwell s

governments  and a personal favorite read I think 1984 should be required reading for everyone living in the modern world  Not just because it s a great piece of fiction  which I think it is   but because it describes the aims and methods of totalitarian governments so well  1984 is one of the most terrifying books I have ever read  It prophecies present and future dystopia where the sophisticated machinations of an almighty state have crushed and enslaved the individual with no hope of release  The current U S  government  with it s increased infotainment  doublespeak  secrecy  stripping away of rights and freedoms  prison camps  use of war and terror to enforce obedience and control of the populace  etc  lurches us just that much closer to something out of this book   hdhh

un mundo distopico pueden pasar muchas cosas raras  que para otros son cosas diarias  http   www ilariapasqua net apps blog      Que puedo decir que le haga justicia a este libro Orwell fue un genio  un visionario  un maestro de la distopia  la cual se ha convertido en  mi genero favorito  Amo todo de este libro  en especial su final  el cual me dejo atonita y en un estado de estupor Orwell se centra totalmente en describir este sistema totalitario y ese detalle fue el que me enamoro de la historia  porque pienso que es un aspecto del que carecen la mayoria de distopias actuales  siempre me dejan preguntas y vacios del universo en el que se desarrollan  en este caso no  el autor hace un excelente trabajo de creacion de universo ficcional Es mi distopia favorita por mucho  los autores contemporaneos deberian seguir mas su ejemplo en vez de malgastar universos maravillosos desarrollando historias de amor mas que forzadas  1984 Always had me hooked  From the beginning to the end  the book was interesting and thoughtful  When Orwell introduced the telescreens  it truly alarmed me that someone from 1949 could have predicted flat screen monitors at a time when television technology was in its infancy  The same goes for the entire book  how could someone from an older time have predicted some if the moral complexities of today s society  Overall  the book was one that I am very glad to have read  it opened my mind to the extreme possibilities of political ideas and it exposed me to the harshest form of reason  illogical reason  This may seem as a contradiction  but that is what the book strived to portray  the act of  doublethink   which is actually used today  even if we don t know it  is the ability to be ignorant at the same time of being conscious  This theme is displayed throughout the book many times as   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  I feel that the book s conclusion was morbid  profound  and perfect  For it utterly moved me while staying true to the underlying theme of the book  This entire novel is also a political exercise in the  Allegory of the Cave  scenario  Before I spoil anything major I would just like to say that I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone  This book is brutal  The modern day parallels are even scarier  lm  tkhyl  bd w n  qr  lrwy   n tkwn qd ktbt f   m 1949    qbl  nwn

perfect utopian country brimming with wars and other misconducts  to found out when I was reading 1984  it turns out to be right  What s fascinating from this book were how authentic and intricately crafted the whole universe of Oceania  From the founding principles of INGSOC to insane social paranoia as the outcome  it was a great book of a disturbing alternate future of our world  where totalitarian were in charge  I for once feeling so grateful that I had the freedom to do what I want to do  think what I want to do  and do it as like  for instance  writing this superfluous review  Truly  I cannot imagine how to live in a world where freedom is the same as a slavery  Another thing to point out is how rich and intelligible the essay like part within this book that explains more about the principle of INGSOC  I gotta say  that part blew me away  It explains why the three dogmas  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH make sense in a distorted logics and able to preserve Oceania as a country while controlling its citizens to quench their will and thought for revolution  All went back to systematic brainwashing from earlier age to create a paranoid  obedient  and robot like society for the ruling classes and where the lower class  the proles  were treated the same as animals  The party can actually do everything as they perceived necessary  In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five  and you would have to believe it  It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later  the logic of their position demanded it  Not merely the validity of experience  but the very existence of external reality  was tacitly denied by their philosophy  The heresy of heresies was common sense  And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise  but that they might be right  For  after all  how do we know that two and two make four  Or that the force of gravity works  Or that the past is unchangeable  If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind  and if the mind itself is controllable  what then   The theme  I must say it was sort of depressing  but nonetheless  brilliantly written  From the opening act where I get to know the illustrious life in one of Oceania s city and the mind of Winston Smith  the protagonist to the second part  which I really like  is where Orwell delve further into his ideas of war  politics  economy  and social structures  Then the finally the third part  where Orwell questions their effect on society in general and a person conduct specifically  All parts flows ceaselessly and smoothly  while the story still relevant Reading 1984 is like a trip into slowly sucking quicksand of negative madness  yet brilliant from the top to the final word   This book will probably haunt me forever  one thing I know for sure is my life would never be the same after reading it  Simplemente espectacular  Me tomo un tiempo en terminar este libro ya que no es un libro tan agradable de leer  Ningun libro me habia hecho sentir tanta ansiedad  nerviosismo y terror a la misma vez  Primero que todo la prosa de Orwell es excelente me encanta como escribe este senor  era una prosa tan detallada  que transmitia emociones de cierta manera  Los conceptos envueltos en en esta novela son sinceramente aterradores  pero  con un reflejo de nuestra sociedad actualmente  Y es ahi donde pienso que esta obra es espectacular  como Orwell hace 66 anos atras pudo predecir las filosofias politicas que se estaria implantando en un futuro y peor aun como se puede manipular la verdad y hacernos creer que dicha mentiras fueron siempre veraz conocido en la novela como el   doublethink    Orwell  nos demuestra lo complicado que es el   ser humano   en esencia  pero  de igual manera lo facil que es de enganar  Hace un prediccion sobre como seriamos enganados y peor aun demostrando el poco interes que le prestamos a tales violaciones  Un libro altamente recomendado para todo el mundo  quizas  no es aquel libro de verano que se puede leer un dia soleado en playa pero es uno que toda persona debe leer     Srt  Hb l kh lkbyr     Srt  Hb l kh

protagonist of the book is a man named Winston  Right away  you can tell that there is something different about Winston  almost suspicious even  I could easily notice his fearful yet determined attitude right from the beginning  This immediately drew me into the book because I wanted to know what he seemed to be so afraid of and what was making him so determined in his actions  In the society where he lived  called Oceania  the government is everywhere and controlling everything  It is revealed right away that there seems to be no privacy for the citizens whatsoever  There are monitors in the houses that could be watching and listening to your conversations at any time  You find out there are spies for the government walking the streets  Finally  what really tips the scales as for making it obvious of the government s constant presence is the fact that there are posters absolutely everywhere of the leader  known as Big Brother  In the government  there are four departments  There is the Ministry of Peace  Ministry of Plenty  Ministry of Love  and Ministry of Truth  Winston works for the Ministry of Truth  which is basically the propaganda canter of the government  The government is simply known as  The Party  In the book it shows Winston becoming increasingly more and more frustrated with the control The Party has over everything  The Party has so much power and is so corrupt that even to think about defying it is illegal  In fact  event to think as an individual is illegal  If you are caught doing this  you are taken by the thoughtpolice  As the book goes on  Winston meets a woman named Julia and they fall in love  They act more and more as individuals and free thinkers throughout the book  They defy The Party in almost every way they can to continue their love for one another  Finally  they are caught by The Party and taken to the Ministry of Love for punishment   I found this book so interesting because it focuses on the idea of how much control a government should be allowed to gain over its people  Throughout the book I also found many connections to Stalin s rule in the Soviet Union  I found it to be trying to show how evil his government actually was by creating a fictional story  Something I really enjoyed about the book was how it used irony to prove many of its points  For example  in the book  The Party s main philosophy is  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength   I found this so interesting because in this philosophy it is taking what we consider to be some of the worst things we have in our own society and saying they are equal to what we feel are some of the greatest things in society  The philosophy is a complete contradiction of itself and is a great representation of the propaganda that The Party uses throughout the book  Winston is shown as one of the few people who sees through all of this propaganda  He sees that The Party is corrupt and evil to its own people  In the book  his love for Julia represents his will to defy the government  Julia gives him a reason to fully realize how much The Party is depriving him of in his life  Through its complete control  The Party deprives its citizens of love  privacy  independence  individuality  and even freedom of one s own mind and thoughts   When Winston and Julia are caught and taken to the Ministry of Love  you see the true and most evil part of The Party  The Ministry of Love is where the government sends people that it considers to be  rebels   In this place  Winston is tortured and scarred for months  They try to teach him to love The Party and basically give up any hope of a better life  This shows that The Party is so powerful that it almost has the power of mind control  A great quote to show this is   In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five  and you would have to believe it   This quote is saying that no matter how hard you try to defy it  no matter how much you strive for a better life  you must accept the fact that The Party is in control  and even if you know it is wrong  you must believe it to be right  After reading this I was able to draw a connection to real life and our emotions  Sometimes  even though we know that we are right  if everyone else tells us we are wrong  we start to believe it too because we feel like it is hopeless to argue   Though I will not reveal the ending of the book  I will say that the idea of government is supposed to be to protect its people  Yet in the book  in the Ministry of Love  The Party forces Winston to face his greatest fears to try to force him to succumb to their will  This book shows just how dangerous and corrupt a government can really become  a real life example  as said before  was Stalin in the Soviet Union   1984  drew heavily from that government  Orwell s ability to show us just how important our own individuality is to keeping us safe is amazing and is what made me find the book so interesting  He was able to show that are greatest tools  our greatest weapons  are our very own thoughts  With freedom of thought comes freedom of forming ideas and opinions  and with that comes the will to stand up for those opinions and beliefs  and that is the greatest power in the world  This is why The Party made sure to even try to control the mind of the individual  it is because they knew that if they did not  then they would never be able to hold power  For a short time  Winston and the woman he loved  Julia  were able to truly experience this and all of the wonders and revelations that came with it   The ending of the book had a deep impact on me  Though you will have to read it to find out  the concept is that the freedom of mind and love is a gift  If you break that gift by succumbing to the will of another  than there is no turning back  for you have forever betrayed yourself and your own opinions  This idea had a deep and moving impact on me because it showed me how important it is that I stand by my beliefs and values and never betray them  I found the entire book extremely moving and not only would I recommend that others read it  I think that it is important that others reading it  This book shows the true value of your own mind  no matter what thoughts it may hold  this book showed me that every one of them is unique to you and by standing by them it makes you forever special and powerful in your own life   A scary and magnificent novel  With these words one can summarize this piece of anti totalitarian literature The book follows the ultimate point of an outer party member s life  where he reaches towards full consciousness about the party  Big Brother  the society  and reality itself  and wishes to change it towards an unknown better The book is scary  even terrifying  since each of the proposed ideas on how to control people are already somehow in motion or were already tried and failed by regimes that came after Orwell died The idea of changing language to control thoughts is ingenious  and is actually being implemented these days to wide areas of the world  whether intentionally or just as a by product of globalization  either way it s happening  The book delves deep into why would anyone want such power  and answers it sufficiently  It also delves very deep into the metaphysical question of  what is reality  and does just exist in the individual s mind  or in the collective consciousness of humans  and thus can it be controlled if consciousness is controlled  A very big question  which the author discusses through the characters and events A highly recommended read  This should be required reading in schools  Recommended reading for anyone  though admittedly you will be looking over your shoulder for some time and noticing CCTV much more often  I just re read this because my son is reading it for school  It s always been one of my favorite books  and I was taken aback by his feeling it was so far fetched  I guess because he s young  he has that sense of invincibility  HIS generation would never let such an oppressive party rule THEM  Perish the thought  As a voting adult  it seems very plausible to me  and I can easily see the path taken to get to such dire straits  The false threats used to instill false fear  and force the public to choose the lesser of two evils   much like V for Vendetta  the whole process feels uncomfortably possible  even timely  in my opinion Winston is not a hero we can fall in love with  He s not a man we can admire  or even really root for  Of course I ve read this many times  but I think it s safe to say  even upon my first reading  I knew he was doomed  The intricate system the government uses to find  punish and then convert  bad thinkers  is chilling  and essentially  fail proof  They always win  The dissenter always loses  It s a forgone conclusion The fact that they take so much time  extend so many resources and expense to convert Winston  just to have him admit his mistake   that is the scariest part to me  They don t even require a public admission  he needs only admit the error of his ways to himself  and them  of course   The whole process serves no purpose except to show themselves they can do it  Winston doesn t matter  His beliefs don t matter  Only his disobedience does  it is one of those novel u ought to read before u die if u are zealot about reading      1984 is written in late forties by George Orwell about 20th century  in future how oligarchy is practiced and prole  common people don t have freedom to express their ideas I personally feel that he actually forecast the future in his novel with vivid imagination  in novel 3 superstates are on the edge of war  BIG BROTHER is constantly watching everyone  spying every member  they have to perform celibacy  Party member don t even have freedom to say 2 and 2 makes 4  they live in servitude  wield by Party  and if u compare our present scenario every being is constantly marching towards destruction  people living in solitude  media is feeding lie and we continuously devouring it  recent reveal of NSA espionage what to say more  every one become a warmonger  1984 was a thought provoking book about Winston  a non involved member of the  Party   It follows his realization of the destructive society that he lives in  a society created in pre war England  now known as Oceania  He begins to realize the faults in this society and as time goes on  he attempts to join the rebellion  all the while being carefully monitored by the government  This story shows how he attempts to rise through a few means and explains what he believes about this society by writing a diary  an idea that is frowned upon in his society   I loved this book a lot  At first  i felt like it was a good introduction but with too much exposition  After a while  i got used to the book style and how it focuses more on the big picture rather than the small scale of the characters  Winston is interesting to me  though he unusually understood everything as we do now in q society where everyone else was so brainwashed  It was simply peculiar that he has such extensive knowledge of how destructive his society was rather than a slightly brainwashed perspective   talk to me about this in class if you like  i canelaborate    My essential question from the previous review was  how does one s wants affect what one does to achieve something   This goes well with this book just the same simply because of the ambition of both Winston as a human being and the Party as a whole  Winston being changed at the end  IN THE MOST INFURIATING WAY DAMN IT  reflects how something as simple as torture can reveal the fault of a human when it comes to desires versus purpose   Never again will you be capable of love  or friendship  or joy of living  or laughter  or curiosity  or courage  or integrity  You will be hollow  We shall squeeze you empty  and then we shall fill you with ourselves    p 211   This quote shows what happens to Winston close to the end for attempting to think freely and reach freedom as he has been trying to throughout this entire book  but being cut short because of his desire to keep all of the freedoms that he has learned of    A world of fear and treachery and torment  a world of trampling and being trampled upon  a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless  as it refines itself  Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain      In our world  there will be no emotions except fear  rage  triumph and self abasement  Everything else we shall destroy    p 220  This party represented throughout the book shows a key importance to my question  The wants of the party are to have a perfect world or society  This is supposed to be done through destruction of the very society they are attempting to refine  Big powers are very unlikely to fall   JUST AS SEEN AT THE END OF THIS DAMN BOOK  AGH  but they are flawed  Things like perfection cannot be achieved unless there is not conflict  which would be the ambition  but destruction of society is the desire that kills their only possibility to reach perfection  It is a stupendous task to write something about this book which might seem fit  The  how  was the part which I enjoyed the most  The reasons supporting the argument about  how  our world transitioned into the 1984 dystopian one seemed so convincing  By the middle of the novel  reader starts thinking that some revolution might be coming where Winston would burgeon as a hero and a savior  But  it doesn t  The story is not about heroism but about acceptance   acceptance and endurance of a common man   Also  there are parts where O Brien tries to convince Winston of the hypocrisies existing in IngSoc  and the reader sees himself accepting them as Winston was  The fact that Room 101 contains your own biggest fear can chill you to the bone   In the end  it is proved that this novel is a love story not between Julia and Winston  but Winston and BIG BROTHER  The book is about how a person is made to fall in love with an idea which he despises     WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS

AMAZING SO READ IT NOW  This must be one of the world s most reviewed books  given its status as required reading in many schools and universities  Strangely enough I have only just read it for the first time this year  When I was at college I studied  Animal Farm  and i do remember enjoying both the reading AND the study   not something i always associate with my English texts  I feel that it is important to locate 1984 in its historical context  It was written in or around 1949 and the near and far histories of power  control  resistance  rebellion  revolution  and a variety of political and moral philosophies were fresh in the mind of the public  I would think then  as now   though  that they are little understood  And this scared Orwell  In  1984  he looks 30 something years to the future and speculates    what if   Looking to Germany and Russia in particular  I feel that he feared for the gullibility and powerlessness of the masses  the  low   AND of the apathy of the  middle  for politics and power  until it is too late   The 3 mantras dictated by the  high  by 1984 are  War is Peace    Freedom is Slavery   and  Ignorance is Strength   These make little sense   and neither does 2 2 5  but by 1984 those in power care little for sense or truth  just power itself  for its own sake  and therefore for control  The central story is a bleak but simple one  The two central characters are excruciatingly ordinary  but they at least have the sense to hate the centralised conformity required by  Big Brother   Their thought rebellion becomes a love affair and briefly sparks hope for the reader  All that is firmly destroyed  and as such sent  and continues to send  the warning into the future that war  slavery  and ignorance in all forms ought to be resisted by all people  across all walks of life and at every strata of society  1984 is the kind of book that manages to inflict the same sensations  in this case  of powerlessness  as its characters are feeling and it does so through its style and twists of the plot Amazing  Review update  Read it maybe a year ago                                                                      This has got to be the most blood curdling read of my lifetime  Filled with philosophical notions with the power to confound any individual  it is what a person can call a true dystopia in every sense  Hunger Games cowers at its feet like a puny rat  Just what am I doing  Hunger games can t even be invoked in this context    nothing absolutely nothing can stay within a 12742 km radius of this book  the other end of Earth   It would shrivel and evanescent  So powerful and thought provoking is the concept it entails that the book is bound to haunt you not only during your lifetime but generations to come  Though it has been categorized as a novel  essay would be more befitting a term  A most powerful read that scares you and sends tremors coursing through your hair down deep into the follicles  Logically solid there is not a morsel of untrue that I could find in this book  It is what can be called a dystopia in the truest of senses  To complete the picture George Orwell included a jargon of his own called Newspeak which is the quintessence of human destruction  Okay now that I ve got my bearings let me put my thoughts across in a decipherable manner  I will try as much not to spoil this but give you in as best a manner as possible a general notion of what makes this book so doubleplusgood a Newspeak term go by the literal meaning  Now a dystopia is defined as    An oppressive government     blah blah blah  In simple terms where a person is stripped off of even the smallest tendrils of hope and the conditions imposed upon him so unimaginable that ceasing to exist would be a better alternative  George Orwell thinking thus came up with this world where the Earth is divided into three regions  Eastasia  Eurasia and Oceania  The society is explained to us by a one Mr  Winston Smith who you could call a divergent  The society has in it all of the above mentioned factors but along with it this one key element   ignorance numbness unthank on the part of an individual  To kill one self would be a better alternative but in order to do that the person must be able to feel that  to realize that his society is in fact a dystopia  Each of the three nations is an oligarchy  a totalitarian government  In Oceania the party overlooking the matters of state is headed by Big Brother and the ideologies of the party utterly crazy running thus War Is PeaceFreedom Is SlaveryIgnorance Is StrengthAt first glance this seems utterly absurd and to think anyone would accept this would seem ridiculous but as you continue reading a complete paradigm shift takes place and the prospect no longer so farfetched  The book does not have much technological advancement to speak of but the people within the society are completely at the beck and call of the rulers  The word privacy no longer a perceivable term  To achieve this insane feat the measures undertaken by the party so completely preposterous and unimaginable    but    not impossible  Now if I were to tell you that to any person  one s own life is more important than anything else and that Titanic is in reality a farce and absolutely an insane proposition  most would definitely argue  As you see it is in these acts of sacrifice that we see the true face of humanity  Only once that has been expunged can we completely attain monopoly over the world   Cause with it will the world be plunged into a profound state of sheer numbness  No longer will an individual feel love or pleasure or lust  All his emotions melded into hate for the enemies of the party and undying love for the party  Big Brother  alone  Another crazy  yes crazy it is  thought is   The past is forever changing and the present controls it  Madness pure madness  But again not completely insurmountable a task   Cause after all the past is in the memories of a person and if you can control an individual s thought then would there even be need for Science The book for the most part concentrates on the politics and the economics of such a society and if executed perfectly what it would result into  The ideology introduced in this book so confounding that it will without a doubt tickle your brain and send shivers simultaneously  Scary wouldn t exactly be the right feeling   the book instills a deep rooted fear within you  The book is philosophical and to be honest I could not discern all the tiny details in the first read  Each of the sentences so intricately knit that it would most definitely take another read on my part to clearly appreciate its gore  Now that s the thing about classics  None of the sentences mean what you think they mean As you could infer from the temperament of the above prose  the book does not end on a good note  Nevertheless it is something that every individual must read just to stay wary if not for much else   Glavnyi geroi    Uinston

art of novel transcends in the presence of such mastery Vivid to a painful extent  Realistic in a horrifying way Take it seriously    Credo di aver capito tutto e di non aver capito niente SPOILER O Brien ha recitato  Ero davvero convinta che avrebbe cercato di fare qualcosa  che fingeva nel ministero dell Amore  ma immagino cercassi scuse per non essere delusa da lui Il che e esattamente quello che ho fatto per qualsiasi personaggio di questo libro  tentando di dar loro delle motivazioni comprensibili ai loro comportamenti Questo libro serve a dimostrare che la mia prof di storia ha ragione nel dire che siamo facilmente controllabili proprio a causa della fiducia e della speranza che riponiamo fino alla fine Forse sono troppo abituata a tutti i libri a carattere distopico attuali  tipo gli Hunger Games o altre saghe che non ho ancora finito ma di cui mi aspetto un certo finale  Ormai siamo tutti convinti che tutti i libri  per quante morti e torture si debbano sopportare nel processo  siano destinati ad avere un lieto fine  O quantomeno una fine che sia tale Ho aspettato per un centinaio di pagine che arrivasse il punto in cui tutto sarebbe cambiato  mentre in realta tutto quello che e successo a Winston e stato retrocedere e  purificarsi  Non so dire se 1984 mi sia piaciuto  forse perche sono una fan del Bene che vince il Male nonostrante spesso i cattivi siano i miei personaggi preferiti  ma sul serio credete che potrei idolatrare un cattivo che disintegra la possibilita di pensare e avere opinioni    so solo che e stato un duro colpo che forse potrebbe avermi insegnato una lezione che ricordero  cosa che indubbiamente ha fatto ma ancora non so se prendero una posizione in merito  se darle importanza piuttosto che rimanere nella mia posizione a cavallo tra la misantropia e la speranza innata   qSh ry  h   mn Hyth lfkr  lqwyh   w lkhyl lry     w tHk   n ldwlh lshmwlyh   w bm tHwyh hy mn mblGh twDH Hqyqh m tHwl lnZmh lfshyh f lh ltthbyt Hkmh

book was taken place in a horrible England and basically answered the question of how England would be if the people were controlled by the government  The main character  Winston Smith  is a minor member of the ruling party but hates the totalitarianism control  which later on allows him to rebel privately by having a love life with a girl named Julia  Then decides to take his rebellion with Julia to a public matter and try to form a group  although he is caught by the government and is sent to a concentration camp where they tortured him to an extent where he has lost control of every good inside him and has finally become controlled by the government  Although the book is horrifying  it does have a positive look into it  The book shows the reader how hard it is to be controlled by certain people  and in this case  a government  Nineteen Eighty Four was a great book and I enjoyed reading it  The book is for people who love history and asking the question  what if    Over time this book has become the basis of other totalitarianism books  such as  A Brave New World   and is a great and exciting book   It s been more than 20 years since I read this book  At that time I loved the bleakness but probably didn t grasp any of the political references It is still completely devastating but about as perfect a novel as you can reasonably hope for  I ll put it on my reread once per decade list along such cheery classics as the trial  the castle  a clockwork orange and crime and punishment To continue the dystopian shenanigans  next stop is watching the 1956 and 1984 film renditions and rereading brave new world  mbdy y n Gyr mtmkn fy lktb   n ktb w lktb  bshkl  m blrGm mn nny mHb llqr  wlkn tlk lrwy  tjbrny n ktb Hty wlw klmt qlyl   nhnh bHq l bqryh ltnbw y lqd rhqtny

               jrym  fkr    I read 1984 two or three times in the era of about 1965 to 1975  One of those times I read it for the purpose of writing a college essay on it  I opined that the differences between the state of Orwell s 1984 and our own were of degree and not of kind  I felt that 1984 was a great and important book  Now  a generation or two later  I have read it again  I think it is the only book I ve ever read more than twice  I still feel it is a great and important book  Anyone who hasn t read it should  1984 is the ultimate dystopia  all the more so for being so plausible In this latest reading  in my dotage  what struck me  similarities to our own times notwithstanding  were the differences between the state of 1984 and the state s  in which we live today  As O Brien pointed out to Winston  INGSOC  the party of Big Brother  is fundamentally different in its goals from the Catholic Inquisition  Nazism  and Soviet Communism  if not different in its methods  Another significant difference between INGSOC and modern America  for example  is the language  Newspeak  the burgeoning language of INGSOC is a contraction of English  a stultification  intended to stifle ideas  whereas modern English is a growing  evolving language  a language of innovation  This is certainly not to say that there are not in our society powerful ones who would control the past to control the future  who surveil the populace  whose followers are fully immersed in doublethink  Big Brother is watching you  George Orwell believed that restrictive language could limit free political thought  So it s sad that people have invented a word   Orwellian   that does exactly that  Simply apply the word to anything or anyone that you don t agree with to brand them a liar and a fascist   fascism  has also become a practically meaningless word that can be thrown at anything  This book has become such a part of the way that we talk about our society that I was convinced that I knew it without having read it  I was surprised at how nuanced the book was and what an engaging  well constructed story it contained  It is rightly considered a classic  The cover image is missing  which is unfortunate  as it is a fantastic cover  It is a small hard bound book  from the early 60s  The cover is predominantly white  with a green rectangular border  The bottom half of the rectangle is empty  but the top half is filled with the colorful  bulging letters that make up the title and the author s name   George Orwell  is two strong tones of blue in the background  while  1984  is fantastic in orange and pink  swelling past the author s name  pushing and stretching off of the cover  There is a good weight to the book  and the cover the back  and the spine are thick and shiny  All slightly laminated to add to its ruggedness  And rugged it needed to be  as it was purchased to be read by countless students  The copy I encountered was owned by the high school I attended  I was a sophomore in high school  in the late 1980s and there was a bookshelf at the side of the classroom  filled with dozens and dozens  if not hundreds  of this book  I had heard of the book  and the row of them  lined up not far from where I sat each day drew me to it  to them  One day  in the middle of the year  our teacher mentioned that we would be reading a passage from the book  the next day  during class  But it was made clear that we would not be reading the entire book   They were going to ruin it   So I grabbed one off of the shelf  and read it feverishly that afternoon in my room  in one long  overwhelming sitting  I fell in love with it that day  and still love it now  all these years later  I never returned my copy  I went and found it on the shelf downstairs  just now  when I took a pause in the middle of writing this  It is here with me now  It is stamped  Property of Town of Arlington No  T21 High School  But I know better  as T21 is now mine I know that the book is important because it examines a dystopian society  I know that  But I enjoy it primarily as a love story  It is  and always will be  one of my favorites  Creepy  Great writing  Great story  George Orwell is one of the more interesting writers I ve read in a while  He has a way of writing that  even when there isn t much going on  you are still glued to the book  I think it s because his prose is just so pleasant and flowing    msh khsr  khlS 72 jny   Dbq  Hwl ktb Hj   nh b dyn  This book changed my life forever  I read it in my senior year of high school when my teacher had a dystopian theme for the semester  that s pretty much all we read  All of a sudden I found myself questioning WHY governments do things  I started being more curious about more than just my teenage life  This book totally influenced my writing of The Adventures of Bianca Sukiyama  Really nice book  It makes you think of the present  Even though the party and it s policies are way far from what we are living now  it makes you think how politics and language and media can change the peoples thoughts Really fun reading  although it took me TOO LONG to finish because I had exams and so on  but it is great  I reread this classic work by George Orwell hoping to get more out of it now than when I was 20 when I read it for the first time  I did  and not only because I had changed  and   ahem   matured  but because our society has too  Back in the early nineties  cell phones  the internet and social media were in their infancy or not yet born  But now  with facebook  Twitter and texting  the sobering thought of having a Big Brother always watching is more reality than fiction Orwell seems to have known that one day our reality would be heavily influenced by our own perception of what is real  and not on the actual events or people involved  One need only look at the myriad websites postulating that historic events like the Moon Landing in 1969 and the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001 were part of an elaborate plan by the American government to  push  its people towards a particular political or social agenda  Now  I am not saying these events did not happen as described by the media  but the moment people start to question the authenticity of these events  you have to wonder whose point of view is  reality  Oh  and I checked with a math teacher friend of mine  and 2   2 still equals 4   for now   This made me go through  doublethink   and i can t make up my mind Certainly Worth every minute i ve spent reading it   Raccontare deliberatamente menzogne e nello stesso tempo crederci davvero  dimenticare ogni atto che nel frattempo sia divenuto sconveniente e poi  una volta che cio si renda di nuovo necessario  richiamarlo in vita dall oblio per tutto il tempo che serva  negare l esistenza di una realta oggettiva e al tempo stesso prendere atto di quella stessa realta che si nega  tutto cio e assolutamente indispensabile  Ebbene si  finalmente sono riuscito a leggere il capolavoro della distopia inglese di meta novecento Per poter apprezzare a pieno questo romanzo  bisogna capire esattamente che cos e e che cosa vuole dirci il suo autore  Perche se viene presentato come un romanzo che inneggia all amore  che e piu forte di qualunque dittatura  siamo completamente fuori strada  La storia di amore tra Winston e Julia e un puro e semplice accadimento  Qualcosa che non era previsto  ma che e comunque accaduto  senza riuscire a cambiare nulla  tanto piu che non c e alcun lieto fine Del resto  1984 non e Fahreneit 451  non e V per Vendetta 1984 dev essere letto come un romanzo distopico ed un capolavoro di scienze politiche  E  un trattato di scienze politiche travestito da romanzo  se lo si accetta  lo si puo apprezzare totalmente Che l obiettivo primario di Orwell sia stato parlare di politica e non di amore  e chiaro  tutta la prima parte e dedicata alla descrizione del regime del Socing  la seconda parte  nella quale si sviluppa la storia d amore  contiene la lettura del  libro   lunghe e lunghe pagine di questo immaginario trattato contro la dittatura  Puo sembrare ostico  ma non lo e  Orwell traduce in parole povere una lunga tradizione mittleuropea di scienza politica  Pur non essendo mai esplicitamente citata  la nota  teoria delle elites  e praticamente il nucleo fondamentale del suo discorso E  questa lucida analisi della storia politica dell uomo  animale sociale  che mostra la grandezza di Orwell  non la pura narrazione dei fatti  che pure appare molto semplice e asciutta  con un discreto narratore in terza persona ed una certa introspezione psicologica   Qui emerge l Orwell politico  fine pensatore  opinionista  con le sue idee e le sue contraddizioni  e cosi sicuro del pericolo di una conquista del mondo da parte del socialismo  che il mondo di 1984 e diviso in tre grandi stati socialisti totalitari  Ma a ben vedere di socialismo non c e nulla  piu e piu volte viene detto che a iterarsi al potere e sempre la solita vecchia oligarchia  a questo punto mi chiedo che senso ha continuare ad abbracciare la bandiera dell anticomunismo  Ma vabhe  A ognuno il suo  Rimangono poi delle idee assolutamente geniali  pericolosamente geniali  Quando Orwell descrive tutte le strategie di controllo da parte del Partito  non lo fa per il puro piacere di fare fantapolitica  Il bipensiero  ad esempio  e un intuizione assolutamente geniale  A distanza di piu di mezzo secolo  non e difficile trovare ancora tracce di questo  bipensiero  1984 e dunque  infine  un romanzo eterno  perche eterno ed universale e il suo messaggio Tutti siamo invitati a leggerlo  per non rimanere gli  ultimi uomini in Europa    lrwy  tSwr Hl  mn ljmwd wltkrr wfqd lmsh r wl Hsyss lnsny     tSwr lbshr wk nhm tHwlw

finished 1984  even though I felt that the book was definitely a hard but must read timeless classic  it might be somewhere between 4 and 5 stars only because as a novel it lacked some of the turning points in story development and sometimes was too repetitive  all those long passages about political views and society setup required me to take a break every once a while to digest the information  but I guess it is inevitable for a dystopia novel    However  after giving it some thought I decide that 1984 deserves a 5 star rating for it incredibly well built dystopia and the author s vision ideals of an totalitarian communism society at the most extreme level from the point of view of a disappointed Marxist  Orwell was a Socialist but he hated Communism in practice  It took a genius like George Orwell to write such a novel in the year of 1948  Not only it described the phases of society and revolution but it also helped to expose the nature of power  class conflict  and the ruling methods imposed by different oligarchies throughout human history  The creativity  knowledge and mental strength of Orwell were amazing with which he built up a world with all elements of totalitarianism that we might think about but underestimated their importance and effect on citizens  Propaganda  Love Sexuality  Independence Identity Individuality  Music  Loyalty  Poverty  Wealth  Technology  and Language  The politics is not easy to absorb  but I think for twenty something people you are likely to have better understanding about this world our society and take it more serious by reading 1984  It s advisable to read Animal Farm prior to 1984 since these two were written in a logical and chronological order  and I personally think that Animal Farm  an easy read with allegory  would help you a lot to digest 1984  a heavy political dystopia   It is amazing  how can a writer in 1948 could have all this imagination about things and techs that happen in the future  Yet it is very black drama about how our world could be in a very rude and cruel when it is controlled and dominated by holistic systems and administrations   I would swear that Bush could read and got a lot of his best worst ideas from this book  The Department of Homeland Security is so Orwellian it makes my spine twitch  War is Peace  Everybody  War is Peace  Estoy segura que tuve una reaccion muy extrana  Empece a llorar  y ahora si quisiera  podria seguir  Un retrato horrible de la verdad y de lo que los humanos son capaces  para bien o para mal  debido a su idiotez o a su brillantez  Lo que mas me choco sin duda fue ese final  que demuestra la desesperanza del autor referido a los hombres  De lo que estoy segura  este libro me parecio tan perfecto  porque llego en un momento indicado  Probably  everything that could have been said about this book has already been said  So I m just going to say one thing that I really disliked  I understand why  but I still dislike a lot Of course  this is one of the best books I have ever read  but it seemed to me that the society of 1984 was misogynist and homophobic  Basically because of the way Winston thinks about Julia at the begging  the desire of raping her  and how man were able to enjoy sex but woman not  in the APpendix is said   And homophobic because  in the Appendix  it s said that homosexual relationships were a perversion I understand that when this book was written  the whole society was misogynist and homophobic  But I just would like someone to have thought a future were you weren t considered less for being a woman or homosexual Still I really loved it and it might be one of my favorites books ever  This book is amazing  Read it  I love the way Orwell only really interacts with three characters  Winston  Julia and O Brien   SOME SMALL SPOILERS  This is the first book where I ve  honestly   wanted the main character to die    I appreciate that the ending isn t a  happy ending  which I feel that I ve become somewhat used to  instead it is the truth for what would happen at the time  Why should these characters get a special treatment just because Orwell chose to write about them  It wasn t until now that I realised I have been spoilt with happy endings  or even just by a satisfying one  This is not satisfying or  joy filling  but I appreciate that  Orwell really submerges into this world  the added details he writes such a Goldstein s book just amazed me  Sure they were sometimes tough to read at 11 30pm when all you wanted to know what happens next  But I feel like it s meant I  too  was submerged into this world  The appendix written is also fascinating about how the language of Newspeak works  The details just amaze me  So definitely one to read  I don t know why I put it off for so long READ  IT  NOW   so much truth and relevance that you might have to savor this book over an order of fries to feel more human than not  i read this book sophomore year of high school from a teacher i thought was quite arrogant turns out he was just a genius introducing us younglings to orwell s best piece in my opinion  I still demand no explanation from this quaint novel  and i ve thought alot about how the great gatsby and 1984 parallel  my    theories   anyways please read this if it calling out to your bones somehow  it sweetly nourished my understanding of humanity possibly different social systems and maybe it created an edge of understanding communism   utopia no dystopia yes    but it s such a reality he creates like wow  it made me realize that our reality is different from that of every other thing  obviously  but like does anyone ever think a squirel s intelligence is miniscule because it s reality is collecting and everything it does is surrounded around that  hibernation  babymaking  climbing in trees  quick movements  also if you haven t already realized the song  Live in Dreams  by Wild Nothing IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BASED OFF OF THIS BOOK I SWEAR  Now all I need is sufjan stevens to write a ballad about this  and i ll be set   Hadn t read this since high school  Much more terrifying now  since so much of it has come true   Powerful  scary in its prescience   Era parecchio tempo che non leggevo un libro che riusciva a mettermi cosi tanta ansia e angoscia addosso   Sono comunque felice di averlo letto  So gia che anche tra qualche mese ripensero a 1984 e trovero altri spunti di riflessione Lettura davvero consigliata  ma chi e che ancora non ha letto questo libro   Io non mi decidevo ad iniziarlo  ma adesso ho La fattoria degli animali che mi osserva dalla libreria e non penso che aspettero un altro anno XD Terrific Imagine a world where the word  free  has only the meaning  being empty   Imagine a world where you should think how the state says  Where 2x2 5  if the state says so  Orwell built up this completely horrifying dystopic world Winston Smith lives in Oceania  There also are two other powerful states  Euarasia and Eastasia  Though everyone lives in misery  the news constantly say there are important achievements  The documents are falsified every day  This is Winston s job  this is what he does  He isn t stupid  He hates the party with all his heart  But terrible things will happen if he even thinks the way he shouldn t  because BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  They see and hear everything you do  So he pretends  Isn t it what we do all the time  We say things they want to hear for our own sake There is also a particular language they starting to use  It makes people talk without thinking  It makes people degrade  Degrading people are easy to manipulate  Everything is about control The other thing Orwell brings up in this novel is betrayal  There are things we cannot stand  Fear makes us forget about everyone and everything we love  Not necessarily death  just fear  Once it s right in front of our face  we will betray anyone  We will say  Do it with him her  not me   THAT is what betrayal is really about 1984 is one convincing horror story with no happy end  While reading it I couldn t help myself but think about North Korea  It feels like they re taking ideas from this book If you ask me to make up a motto from 1984  it would be  Question everything and don t let anyone control you   1984 has been on my  I need to read this  list for quite some time and I kept putting it off for unknown reasons  I finally was able to check it out from the library electronically as it had a wait list the last several months  Essentially I finished this in just a couple of days and was amazed by the story and society that Orwell created It is easy to see how this story is ranked as a classic  The concepts of Big Brother  Thought Police  and the disturbing way in which society has lost all sense of individual thought was striking  Orwell painted an amazing picture of a future that is incredibly scary  Though 1984 has come and gone pieces of it can be seen in today s society  Crazy  Interesting characters and detailed picture of buildings  offices  back streets  black markets  etc  made for an entertaining read  It was difficult to read only because I felt for the plight of Winston Smith  Orwell has earned his  classic  spot with 1984  Pick it up and feel disturbed immediately  I first read 1984 in college and for years now it s been one of my closest  book friends  George Orwell the writer is also one of my  friends   He s among a handful of writers whose essays  books and poems I ve completely read I wish I d known Orwell and his wife  He wrote such comfortable things  like how to brew a cup of tea and that a writer must have a comfortable chair But 1984 points to a life without these pleasant  simple things  One of his essays says that every book must have a political base  I think of 1984 as a clear description of a world without the personal 1984 s world is a hideous contrast to our own bright  cheerful existence  His world has but one point of view to follow and a population that carefully does what it s told  They are numb  moving through 1984 with cold  unfeeling  hideously detached minds As a writer  now of popular romantic fiction  I feel that Orwell constructed a satisfying world  It really sticks to your ribs  Each scene piles up the details  like the constant snooping  2 way wall screens TV s one cannot escape  long hours  dust like food  thin clothing  screaming planes  It s a future carefully lacking all charm  love and romance  The heroine  when she s in the throes of an affair  is strangely coquettish  her lover mentally notes the suppleness of her limbs and her small waist  Later  the hero compares his ex lover s stiff  clumsy body with the woman he knew before they were tortured Altogether the hero is more finely drawn and we see this no exit world through his eyes and the narration  I do not consider this as a  genre  piece  I respect science fiction deeply and I write fantasy  but 1984 is not ephemeral  it is fine literature  1984 does what Lucretius and the early critics said that literature should do  It  moves  us as if we re struck by lightning   1984 gives me the chills as it makes me think  how was it possible that George Orwell  more than half a century ago  was able to put up a world that almost  if not similar  described the world we are in now Set in Oceania  under the tyranny of the omniscient and enigmatic Big Brother  everything was controlled and designed to make the Party the most powerful of all  The world of 1984 was divided into three powerful superstates  Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia  believed to be in a  perpetual war  and constantly forming and breaking alliances with each other  One day Oceania is in alliance with Eurasia  the other day with Eastasia   and they will always make it seem that whoever they have an alliance with has always been like that since the beginning  to the point that if history needs to be rewritten  they will  Everything was made to look as if it was the normal way of living  WAR IS PEACE 1984 was written in that time when Communism was at large  which is why it probably shows a bit of Marx in it  The war between the superstates was designed to expend human labor  all its products and everything in between  People were made to work  to eat  to drink  to breathe  to live in favor of the Party  If they show any form of disagreement or revolt  they will be tortured and brainwashed to maintain the political and economical structure of the state  Some were denied of existence  deleted in history or memory  Unperson  Telescreens were everywhere  Everyone was being watched  Every action was controlled  Every word spoken  every thought  every emotion  Even your family and children will turn you in  It was survival  If you want to live  you have to work with  them  and put up with the rules  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  Because    Big Brother is watching you  Furthermore  Oceania was divided into three classes  the upper class  Inner Party   the middle class  Outer party  and the lower class  Proles  from the word proletariat   The Inner Party is the minority of the population  the ruler of the state  Together with the Outer Party  they uphold the laws to maintain its power  Obviously  those with the resources  the knowledge  the wealth  are the ones who rule the resourceless  the proles  the uneducated working class  who will always remain the same because they will forever be  ignorant  to show resistance  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  and this strength will always be in favor of the upper class From here  I ask these questions What if we are living in a world where we think we are free even if  in truth  we are being controlled and just going with the flow  What if the language we speak now was designed to control and limit our thoughts  What if the past we know was modified  rewritten and built to further strengthen the power of our rulers  What if somebody is really watching over our every move Orwell has made a visionary masterpiece  Truly  he is the king of dystopian literature because  along with Animal Farm  1984 is probably one of the most disturbing  horrifying  psycho version of a dystopian world  It gives you goosebumps  and it haunts you  It makes you think of the past  present and future  and this novel truly deserves being included in every person s to read list  I read  1984  and I found it to be a very interesting but a very slow read  Orwell wrote it in the 1940s  He goes to great detail to show his characters personalities throughout the story  Even though he only goes into describing three character mainly through out the book  The book is honestly a huge confusion  with the characters in the book don t really know what is happening in their world either The details and confusion in this book made it a very slow read  I would recommend it to anyone that believes in conspiracies  or has interest about governments should read this book  I enjoyed the main characters relationship even though it wasn t very obvious Orwell made it to where they were all connected  Plus the secret love affair which the main character Winston has  My favorite part of this book would definitely have to be that it relates to the world  and what really is happening around you  It may be a slow read but it was very interesting to read with the creepy feeling it had left after every page  If it wouldn t had connected to the world and I probably wouldn t have kept reading it  I found the ending to be contradicting to the beginning  and very unbelievable   rwy  kthr mn ry    twq t m yHdth mn Zlm mn qbl lnZm  l skry   Holy crap  This book scared the shit out of me when I first picked it up in the 8th grade  and it recently it scared me again  Except this time it wasn t a science fiction novel  it was all too real  I read this at the height of the Bush years and I was paranoid for days  Instead of Big Brother we had the Christian Right Wing and the FCC with their moral police and monitored airwaves  Orwell is a journalist and a rebel  He knows that dictatorships is a religious sect that kills the imagination  soul by soul  The Western world hasn t got quite this close to a totaliarian system  but if the Hannity s and Glen Beck s and Rush Limbaugh s get their way a lot of liberals will be locked in their gray dwellings  forced to watch evangelists and uber nationalists forcing us to eat fear and hate on a daily diet  The reason I love  truly love this book is because Orwell doesn t just stick to the politics and preach to his readers  he gets to the meat of the story and shows that love  true love  is the first victim of a dictatorship  Brilliant  A book every so called punk rocker should read   There are not many novels that introduce political and social concepts into society at large  big brother from 1984 is a rare exception  Enough said really  Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing  This tome describes my biggest fears flawlessly and helps me understand certain thoughts that haunt me  I have an intense and irresistible desire for freedom and truth  Consequently  you could say that I m not wired for routine and enjoy taking risks   Cogito ergo resisto   I think  therefore  I resist  Subsequently I dread the Dystopia Orwell describes in his book  After reading 1984  I wasn t able to look at the real world in the same way  I can t help but contemplate how this novel may have been used as a manual by those who have been in power to kilter our world after World War II  It no longer seems to be a work of speculative fiction to me  After reading 1984  I had to pick up and devour Maddox   Alphabet of manliness   in order to man up and walk out into the real world again  This pretty much explains why I currently look like a lumber jack and am not too fond of mindless obedience  Yes  Chuck Norris is awesome  Great and overwhelming book  One may find the similarities between the society described in the book and the one we live in The book makes you think about the social order  It shows one that the self preservation instincts are at first in the human nature In conclusion  Winston Churchill once said  democracy is the worst form of government  except for all the others  Outstanding  I m still in awe  This book is simply amazing  I m still blown up by it s plot twists I read this in high school and then I would re read it every year for many years of my young adulthood  I think it is as true today as when it was written    unfortunately    lrwy  jmyl  jd      rGm  n lrwy y  lly fyh qlyl w  n shyfh bt rD twq  mstqbly llktb fy shkl wq  qSSy   ljz lnfsy w ljtm y fy lrwy  mthmr jd

  I waffled back and forth on whether this should be 4 or 5 stars  For 5 stars  the importance of the society this book describes where all actions and even thoughts are controlled cannot be understated  Clearly it is an extreme  but a country world where every moment of your life is in some way controlled by a ruling party is a danger everyone needs to be aware of  The depths of detail that Orwell goes into in describing what life is like is astonishing not to mention depressing  For 4 stars  while there is a main character  they are merely used as a tool for the author to come up with situations in order to explain the depravity of the situation or how specific aspects of the society have come about  There isn t quite enough of Winston I think to really have me vested in his future  and while he does go through a character arc it feels as though it s just a means to an end  There are times when pages are spent describing how things came to be and they seem to shove aside the development of the protagonist Clearly this is a landmark novel and should be read by all  I don t know if I would classify it as  entertaining  or  uplifting  but it is certainly memorable  1984 is the instruction manual for all of the owners of our society   systematic surrender of freedoms for the illusion of security against an unnamed   ever changing foe in a war that never ends   i was in high school when i 1st read 1984   i thought that it was incredible that all of the things going on in the book seemed 2 be lining up like the sun   moon for a total eclipse of reason   independent thought  however  that was during the relatively calm pre fear   war mongering days of president clinton   no one would listen 2 me about the undeniable   inherit foolishness involved with trading liberty for a false sense of security  today everyone just looks the other way because they want to feel  safe  or just comply with whatever the status quo is so that they can make money   survive   notice all of the young soldiers dying daily because there s no other careers for them  or civilians working for boeing building war machines because somehow they do not understand how what they do is destroying the earth  everyone seems 2 think that making money    protecting  themselves is somehow different than loving   protecting each other  people always use the words culture   community 2 describe the specific places they live   things that they do  but earth is our real community   all of our silly differences   similarities is our global culture   fhmt ldktwtry  lshtrky   n Tryq qry

masterpiece is seasoned with many profound insights  The one I found particularly striking was this   Dont you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make Thoughtcrime literally impossible  because there will be no words in which to express it   Apart from suggesting that  by controlling a people s language  you can control their thought processes  George Orwell actually demonstrated it in the novel  for one of the techniques he uses to convey our minds into the grim world he envisions is to invent words and phrases like Thoughtcrime  Facecrime  Thought Police  That he invented words when the corresponding realities didn t yet exist is testimony to his genius  and gives Nineteen Eighty Four a special place in literature  The best books   he also notes   are those that tell you what you already know   I found Nineteen Eighty Four an extremely good book by this measure because  at the time I read it  I had been conjecturing that the ideological bankruptcy of most african leaders is related to their linguistic bankruptcy   to their confinement to the shallow ends of both their vernaculars and the European languages  Orwell s theory of thought and language affirmed my conjecture The novel is extremely insightful  Indeed  when I read it  and considered that Orwell was dying as he wrote it  and recalled two other masterpieces that were written by dying people   Wuthering Heights and Brothers Karamazov   I wondered whether people in their latest hours experience some special inspiration   Heartstrings pulled This is one of the rare causes that I actually loved readings every single page of a book  Orwell has such an incredible writing writing style  it s very easy to understand yet still entertaining  He uses the perfect amount of difficult vocabulary  This book will completely brake your morals but in the most amazing way possible  Orwell has the power completely capturing his audiences  attention and he does not fail in 1984  Please even if you hate reading you have to get this book a try  It is incredibly well written and such entrancing story with an amazing underlying theme  If I could give 1984 more than five stars I definitely without a doubt would   This was the first book to ever make me feel compelled to write a review I have read many a disturbing book in my days  but nothing moved me quite to this extent  Firstly  to whomever wants to read something  for pleasure    do not read this book  This book will not bring pleasure to any sane person  It will disturb you  provoke you  and most probably haunt you for a long period after you have finished reading it  Dystopian stories are quite the trend with our generation  so I did not expect many surprises from this book  Boy  was I wrong  For one  the whole concept of Newspeak enthralled me  I am quite a sucker for a good piece of authentic philology in a novel  and have not had that itch scratched this good since Tolkien s Lord of the Rings  for God s sake  that man invented languages with dialects and regionalisms and    but this is a subject for another time   However  I have never imagined the concept of reducing a language rather than enriching it  It s so counter intuitive  so twisted  and yet so appropriate in the context of Oceania  the Party and it s never ending quest for the complete reduction of the essence of human nature  it must begin and end with the language   which decreases in nuance as the Party grows more powerful and eats away at the people s humanity and spirit until it turns them into complete mindless beasts  This is particularly emphasized by the ultimate desired form of Newspeak   the duckspeak  or the act of quacking like a duck   basically eradicating articulate human communication all together  This concept shook me to the core   more than the explicit torture scenes  The act of penetrating  spoiling  disfiguring one s very soul  trying  and succeeding  to take over their identity and the one thing that gives us most privacy   our own mind  Nothing disturbs me more than the idea of rape  and this was one of the most brutal acts of rape I have ever read   when everything that is intimate about a person is completely invaded  deformed  mocked  until they themselves no longer recognize it  forgetting who or even WHAT they really are  It culminates with the worst and saddest case of Stockholm syndrome that I have ever read about  and I thought Theon Greyjoy in A Game of Thrones was bad   Needless to say  I hoped until the end that he will be able to salvage a little piece of his spirit  a feeling  a thought of his own that would make him die still being himself  But this is just not one of those novels  and the power of the book is vastly based on that  This book convinced me that George Orwell was indeed a WRITER  in the most pure sense of the word  His work  depressing as it may be  is very eye opening and mind expanding in so many ways  1984 is definitely one of those books that changes you a little I think everyone should read this book  because we all need a reminder of how important the most basic things in life are  those that we so often take for granted   family  privacy  knowledge access  and most importantly the universe that exists within each and every one of us which we are sometimes too busy to explore or nurture  We never think of what it would be like to be robbed of that  because we can hardly imagine ourselves without it  This book is teaching humanity a very tough lesson about the dangers the hunger for power can entail   I am speechless  this book is amazing  Multiple times throughout reading it I was so surprised  I kept on trying to predict what was going to happen but the unpredictable would always happen  Please do yourself a favor and read it  1984 is easily one of my favorite books  syn dm kl wl lys llHzb  wsybd kl Hb Gyr Hb l kh lkbyr  wln ykwn hnk DHk lW lDHk ldh  ySHb nshw  lnSr  l  l dw

ntZr mn yw mnwn b    Lo lei hace casi dos meses  pero lo tengo tan fresco como si lo hubiese leido ayer  y creo que con las dos obras que he leido de Orwell me pasa  lo que significa que es su merito y no mio Este es un libro complejo  pero eso ya todos los sabemos  Mas alla del control sobre las acciones  lo que mas me impacto fue la manera de controlar incluso el pensamiento de las personas  porque de esa forma el acceso a las decisiones tomadas es mucho mas directa y sencilla  Y refleja tanto el mundo real que es casi espeluznante  Debo decir que hubo fragmentos que parecian incluso noticias de la actualidad  asi que tenia que recordar constantemente la fecha de publicacion de esta obra e intentar no desasosegarme Inculcada una doctrina sin mas opcion que adoptarla  es improbable que una persona mire su entorno en busca de otra alternativa  sobre todo si vive con la conviccion de que tal no existe Un protagonista bastante anormal  Y es anormal por el simple hecho de ser un personaje totalmente normal  cuyas habilidades no son extraordinarias ni tiene nada demasiado especial  sino que  a diferencia de la caracterizacion de hoy en dia  no se centra en lo pueril  mas bien abarca lo necesario y mas alla sin ser exagerado  desde lo que todo ser humano ve  siente y piensa  generalizando  claro esta  Lo que se espera de todo mortal  hasta lo mas profundo del ser  eso que no se toca en muchos libros por ser algo incomodo  extrano o material de censura  O sencillamente porque vende mas hacer un personaje perfecto  Aqui tenemos un personaje tan humano  con sus procesos y sufrimientos  pero tambien con la parte que lo hace unico sin punto de comparacion  No es un personaje sentimental ni dado a las relaciones  pero sabe identificar lo que siente  por que lo siente y que debe hacer en consecuencia  Y no se averguenza de ello  Reconoce sus carencias y llegados a un punto  empieza a actuar conforme a lo que cree necesitar  Es un personaje tan complejo  que resulta dificil establecer un patron con base en su modo de operar  Sucede que en este libro  armar una opinion por el modo de actuar de un personaje es quedarse en la superficie  porque todos tienen un modo establecido que debe cumplirse irremediablemente  sin embargo  los pensamientos siempre van mas alla  En este caso  tomar la decision de pensar es lo que hace que vayamos mas alla Hay  no obstante  y esto es dificil de explicar   un punto intermedio bastante perceptible en esta obra  que se queda entre el pensamiento y la accion  una minima fraccion  que hace una gran diferencia entre persona y persona  Quiza se deba a que la mayoria de las personas prefieren no pensar en absoluto y permanecer en la seguridad de la esclavitud con la que se han conformado  pero no es preciso decir que es exactamente lo que hace que conozca a Winston completamente  Es mas bien un conjunto de elementos  detalles minimos que comprenden un todo Por eso precisamente me ha gustado la manera de abordarlo de Orwell  Winston es uno del monton  familiarizado con lo que debe hacer intentando ignorar lo que una persona normal podria querer  y aun asi  da un paso que  aunque con un margen minimo de exito  lo hace diferente del resto  Es porque piensa  Porque sabe que la ignorancia es lo que limita a unos y da mas libertad a otros para mover a conveniencia  Es precisamente porque reconoce que la ignorancia es esclavitud  y sabe  de cualquier forma  que saberlo supone un riesgo casi doloroso desde el principio Es demasiado real  tanto que es imposible convencerse de lo contrario  de que no existen personas asi  que no es posible  Pero si es muy posible  Y el final ha sido el toque perfecto para el realismo de esta magnifica obra  Es como si desde el principio  por mera observacion del entorno  supiera como terminara  Porque un cambio no se da al chasquear los dedos  y en este caso es un proceso bastante lento  o imposible  que ni siquiera se da al final  Quiza por eso no me sorprendio del todo el final  pero no por eso me gusto menos  Al contrario  se me hizo doloroso confirmar mis sospechas Partiendo de aqui  podemos hacer una lista interminable  y que por cierto  Orwell menciona casi por completo  de lo que es capaz de hacer un ser humano corrupto con el fin de obtener cada vez mas poder sobre el resto del mundo  no solo apropiandose de lo que hacen  sino monitoreando lo que piensan y debilitando la mentalidad del hombre hasta convertirla en un vacio dispuesto para inculcar cualquier comportamiento  Porque aqui no se estipula pensar en algo determinado  Aqui esta prohibido pensar Y hay tanto que decir que temo irme por las ramas  si es que no lo hice ya  pero para hablar de todo lo que se incluyo en el temo que necesitaria memorizarlo o  como minimo  leerlo otro par de veces  lo cual hare sin duda ni problema  mas bien encantada  Una de las cosas que mi memoria guardara por siempre es la idea de que quiza puedan controlar algun dia nuestros pensamientos  pero estamos compuestos de algo mas que eso  algo que no resta importancia a nuestro modo de pensar  pero si que puede ser utilizado como arma en caso de que se nos arrebate esta posibilidad de tener dominio sobre nuestra mente  Porque es nuestra naturaleza  porque estamos configurados para dominar lo que somos  El problema de muchos es que delegan esa autoridad a otros  una autoridad que es inherente a cada uno y que no pertenece a nadie mas que a nosotros mismos   Hasta que no tengan consciencia de su fuerza  no se rebelaran  y hasta despues de haberse rebelado  no seran conscientes  Este es el problema     Si pueden obligarme a dejarte de amar    esa seria la verdadera traicion   Es un libro necesario para despertar la sensibilidad a la realidad del mundo  no de un pais    del mundo  Casi lo suplico mas que recomendarlo   En una epoca de engano universal  decir la verdad es un acto revolucionario     Dear George OrwellHooooooow did you write it                 Did you know that 2 2 5 was actually a thing  This 1931 poster pretty much sums it up   the text in Cyrillic roughly translates as  The arithmetic of an industrial financial counter plan plus enthusiasm of workers   It used to be plastered all over Moscow by the Communists as an encouraging slogan for fulfilling the first five year plan   the  pyatiletka    in advance  overriding basic arithmetic and  undoubtedly  reasonable estimates as well  Suffice to say  it failed dramatically  hence even resulting in a famine which took the lives of hundreds of thousands  We are all alike  We are the dead  We

rebellion is marvelous  The declaration of the essence of libido the will to power is equally marvelous  Unlike We  Orwell wasn t very ambitious on touching every aspect of totalitarianism  I don t know how many people noticed the unusually frequent presence of sensual description    which to me seems like the hidden theme of this book    but this book is way much more than a construction of dystopia  How do we think at the presence of our body and the presence of politics  How does politics  social norms  nurturing shape our mind  These are generally valid questions that to my knowledge have never been dealt with in a moral judgement free way I m glad that I shall read this now  with a question in my mind and no  or not that many  pre set moral judgements  This novel is really a though provoking one  I am not writing review  This is what I felt all across this book This book was in my  to read  list in No 1 positing for a long time but I was always postponing but now I have done it In 1948 George Orwell wrote 1984  a novel about a futuristic society where ubiquitous government surveillance is happening on its citizens Which made me think about the presence of  Closed circuit television   CCTV  in our present world  YES  BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  But in present world war is not happening as it s happened in History  I mean  in history war happened for three reasons  1 Kings and emperors wanted to extend their state and national foundries  2 And during the era of Industrial Revolution countries wanted to sell their surplus products to other nation and there emerged capitalism and their exercise of power on their nations and their game of  Machtpolitik  or Power politics where nations compete for the world s resources and it is to a nation s advantage to be manifestly able to harm others  It prioritizes national self interest over the interest of other nations or the international community  3 Wars made in the name of revolution  Like George Orwell wrote in this book   Power is not a means  it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship    This not the age of monopoly industries and centralized governments  This an age where people are neither a communist nor a liberalist  majority of us are lazy non voting citizen of the age of LPG  Liberalization  Privatization  and Globalization   We are all lost in the crowd people who rushes for their daily bread and accumulation of wealth and who lives the life of keeping apart or life of my own business  who for the sake of killing time involves in criticizing each and every government which comes in to power  just like reading  Page Three  of new paper  Hush    now a day more or less all the pages in newspaper is becoming  Page Three   they prefer to discuss the trends of Paris Hilton s inner wear than the encroachment in national frontiers At times I feel everyone are communist  a variety of different forms of communism has developed  each based on the ideas of different political theorists  The case which I said is  Pure Communism   for an example whenever there is a raise in the price of petrol  diesel  kerosene  cooking gas or regardless of working hard our manager gives us a lousy bonus  we feel it unfair and want to protest but we never do  we bury it deep inside our unconscious mind  The zest of communism is the sense of revolution or protest against the decision making process in both political and economical sphere of our life  where interest of every member of society is not given equal consideration  If you are a communist you view the world as communist    1984 was not what i was expecting  with being one of the most mention books today the phase  big brother is watching you  has away stuck with me  i didn t expect romance in this book at all and for it to be quite a big part of the book   for me it was i loved the book and how scary it was  it comes to show how easily society can be manipulated by propaganda and the media  WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH i also found a lot of similarity to George Orwell s terrifying world to that of Stalin s Russia   I have heard so many terrific things about this classic novel  it 19s not even funny  Even people who don 19t normally read have recommended this book to me with incredible enthusiasm  For me  this has always been one of those books that you hear people reference a lot but you only have a vague idea of what it 19s about But OH MY GOODNESS  I am so happy that I finally got around to reading this book Everything about this book was fantastic  Everything  the characters  the plot  the fascinating world that Orwell created  and on and on  This both had two things I really love in literature  an engaging and captivating story and components that will make you think hard and see things from a new perspective Let 19s start with the story itself  Winston is an excellent narrator for this story because he is very easy to relate to  He feels as though he is an outsider in a regimented but chaotic world where everyone else fits in  And don 19t we all feel that way sometimes  Standing on our tiptoes at the edge of a crowd  stretching and reaching for a way to make it to the middle  It 19s Winston 19s flaws and desires that make him seem so much more human than his peers  and that 19s precisely why I found I could relate to him despite the utterly different world he lives in  His relationship with Julia was executed extremely well  It was refreshingly realistic  even considering their unfortunate situation  It was not perfect in a romantic sense  but how could it be when nothing in their society was  They made do with what they had and with the circumstances they were forced to live under  just as people do in real life In a strange way  I really loved the ending of this novel  I won 19t go into detail about it  for obviously spoiler y reasons  but I will say that is isn 19t happy  But with a story like this  could there ever be a true happy ending  Of course not  not if Orwell wished to maintain any semblance of realistic and logical progression of the plot  The conclusion  while heart wrenching and not at all pleasant to read  is blatantly honest  Orwell isn 19t trying to make the reader smile  he 19s trying to send the reader a message  to teach the reader a lesson  When I say I love the ending of this novel it 19s not because of the way it happens  but rather the fact that it does happen  if that makes any sort of sense  I appreciate the honesty and frankness which with Orwell tells this story  and it is these specific qualities that I love The entire concept of this novel was extraordinarily fascinating  The fact that Orwell set this book only four decades in the future from when he wrote it says a lot about the state he thought the world was in at the time  Of course  his view is most likely exaggerated in the extreme setting of the novel  but the underlying implications still exist  Also  looking at this novel from a modern day perspective is also incredibly interesting  Many aspects of the society of 1984 are relevant today  such as the way we often choose to ignore the poverty that is plaguing much of the globe  Although it was written over half a century ago  there are nevertheless several connections to be made between Winston 19s world and ours Overall  1984 was just as amazing as everyone promised me it would be  It evoked emotion while simultaneously promoting thought  which is my favorite type of story  If you have never read anything by George Orwell  this novel is a great place to start My Rating   0   0   0   0   0  5 out of 5 smileysWould I recommend

etc one is spied on  The same thing Orwell describes in his book where the telescreen plays the role of spying  The Party  Insog The Big Brother  controls Oceania and its people  No one knows the past because it is destroyed by the authorities of The Party  Everyone believes what the Party says to the degree if one doesn t believe that  2 2 5   one will be tortured till he she admits that 2 2 5  Winston Smith hates The Party and wants to defeat IT because the Party is not fair  One day  He sees a man named O Brien and thinks that this man is on his side against the Party  Without clear evidence supports his thought Winston goes to O Brien and tells him how much he hates the Party and wants to defeats it by joining the Brotherhood  The brotherhood is a party opposite to The Party  Insog The Big Brother  which nobody knows for real of its real existence or not  Unfortunately  O Brien is 100  with The Party  Insog The Big Brother   O Brien catches Winston several days later and tortures and conditions him till Winston begins loving the Big Brother and the Party The language is so ironical in 1984  Orwell always fascinates me with his ironical language   4 5   Rehellisesti

want to be loved so much as to be understood  George Orwell  you re my hero   George Orwell s 1984 is a true gem  not because of the story line or the characters  though Winston and his suffering within the totalitarian regime of Oceana should not be discounted  The true value of 1984 is its statements on socialism  human nature  and the dangers of any kind of absolutism  A world enveloped in thought control  ruled by ignorance and suppression of non conformity  The idea that a world built out of the rejection of the  Capitalist Oligarchy  would become more corrupt and oppressive than prior says something about Orwell s perspectives on the dangers of Communism   and the damage it can cause despite seeming to be a political structure for the people  I certainly appreciate the book more as a political novel than a tale of suffering  the ideas behind the country are so eloquently crafted that they are a book of their own  Diverse and filled with much to explore and analyze  I felt like I was reading an easy to digest philosophy essay  That may sound boring  but it is quite the contrary  Totally recommend to the political philosophy nerds  Great book  Check out my review

  I hadn t read this book since I was in high school  more than 15 years ago  so I was basically coming to it totally fresh  What struck me wasn t the quality of the political ideas  but the insight into the human condition  It s difficult to delve too deeply into it without giving away important elements of the plot  but deeply examining the motivations of each character yields an unexpected degree of subtlety and considerable material for introspection Human beings are social creatures and thus we do act collectively  To read this novel only as an indictment of collectivism is to miss the more personal and powerful point on offer  which is that we each must decide how to balance our social and individualistic motivations  Sensuality and desire are inherently individualistic  but doesn t Winston also act out of a need to feel connected with his past  present and future community  And how should we feel about Julia s hedonism There is so much in this book to engage with and I would highly recommend a reread to anyone who hasn t read it since their youth   La policia del pensamiento Que pinche miedo Un gran libro  Son meras coincidencias  supongo    Winston Smith takes it on the Jaw   That is the name of a song by the band Utopia  which is written about George Orwell s masterpiece of dystopian fiction 1984 The book 1984 by George Orwell takes place in a dystopian future of London  England  London  part of Oceania  is under the rule of a totalitarian government  The year is 1984  but no one is exactly sure  Big Brother is supposedly the leader of the Party  the name of the government   The land of Oceania is under strict rule  and is always at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia   Winston Smith is the main character of the book  and works in the Ministry of Truth where he alters history as the Party sees fit  Winston is very frail and intellectual with no definable traits that would set him apart from others  Like everyone else in the nation of Oceania  Winston is constantly watched and monitored through telescreens and hidden microphones  If you have committed an act  or thought of committing an act  of rebellion against the Party the thought police would take you away  Even though the thought police are constantly watching  Winston still rebels against the party in various small ways  like owning a diary  Winston met O Brien at work  and believed they had a lot in common  O Brien is a high ranking Party member who Winston believes is mysterious  Winston also meets Julia  who he hated and thought would turn him into the thought police  Julia is a mechanic of sorts that works in the Fiction department of the Ministry of Truth  and has been in love with Winston  Julia is able to tell Winston of her feelings through a note  They begin seeing each other  Julia is also has the same feelings as Winston about the party  except she is younger and more rebellious  Julia is a good actor and can blend into the crowd  which is necessary to cover up her rebellious nature  Winston and Julia were happy for months  and even acquired a house  However  their happiness will not last  SPOILER ALERT  stop here if you don t want spoilers  One day O Brien invites Winston and Julia to his house  Winston had expected it to be something about the Brotherhood  the secret organization that opposes the Party  and he was right  O Brien had called for Winston and Julia because he suspected that they were rebels  and that the Brotherhood needed them  Winston and Julia accepted  and swore their life to the Brotherhood  Later  Winston received the book of the Brotherhood  written by Goldstein the creator of the secret organization  After a few days  Winston and Julia were reading the book when the thought police suddenly arrested them  The thought police separated Winston and Julia  They took Winston to the Ministry of Love where they tortured him for years forcing him to love Big Brother  and accept the Party s ideas  They had physically and mentally broken him down  and then built him back up the way they wanted  The torturers had gotten him to accept the party s ideas  but Winston still did not love Big Brother and he still loved Julia  So  they took him to room 101  Room 101 is where they make you face your worst fears  for Winston it was rats  The torturers put him in a cage of rats  but before they could do anything Winston told them to do it to Julia and not him  Winston was finally broken  and he was never the same  END OF SPOILERS 1984  a dystopian fiction  is a wonderful yet horrific book  I say horrific because of the very descriptive and gore filled scenes  George Orwell masterfully describes Winston s life from beginning to end  Orwell takes you through a roller coaster of emotions ranging from happiness  sadness  passion  and pity  The ending is expected  although unexpected is appropriate and will leave you satisfied  My favorite part of this book  more spoilers  is when Winston bought the glass paperweight  This showed how thoughtful and passionate Winston could be  and that his curiosity could not be tamed  I greatly enjoyed this book  and could read it for hours on end  I would also recommend 1984 to anyone who enjoys dystopian books  or would like to have insight on the scary realization of what our world could have become had World War II gone differently  There s a reason classic novels are classics With George Orwell s 1984  that truth is shown more clearly then ever  Published in 1949  many of the themes are still relevant today  making for a timeless read 1984 is divided up into three parts  You re carried through the first due to your interest in the world of 1984  In this dystopian landscape  totalitarian governments constantly monitor their citizens  Not only do they control their actions through this  but using propaganda and a clipped language of  newspeak  even peoples  thoughts can be controlled  Indeed  the government plans to irradicate any unorthodox thought completely by getting rid of any language with which a person can think about or express their discontent For the second part  the reader is kept engaged through a hidden  developing romance  This is interesting in of itself because  at least in the beginning  the romance is not so much an act of love as an aspect of rebellion against the party  As well  the reader gets to dive a little deeper into the inner workings of the world The third part  too  is riveting  That however I ll save for the very end  so those of you who haven t read the book won t be spoiled  Just know there are some major plot twists All in all  1984 was a fascinating read  It s thoughts on monitoring people and government control were certainly food for thought  and increasingly so in this modern era  I d certainly recommend it  although it should be said that two friends of mine who read it said at it was quite dull  Since that thoughtless comment I ve banished them from my friend group  tortured them  made them agree that it s a great book  murdered them  and burned down their houses  Read the book anyway  people  Both myself and big brother will be watching you Thanks  MarkRight  Onto the third part for those of you who ve already read the book  Ah  freedom at last I found part three to be both the worst and best part of the book  Worst because of the rather tragic end and disregard of much of what we thought we knew  best because it was so well done  The slow breakdown of Winston until his eventual complete submission was infuriating to watch  Yet  at the same time  it felt as though it belonged  The party remains almost indestructible  and the world remains bleak  which I think Orwell perhaps wanted to do  He wanted to leave the world a warning Again  it was a great book  Double thanks to you for reading this far  Mark Excellent book  quite quick to read  Very well written  And realistic too  At some point  I had to interrupt my reading for a few minutes because I started to feel unwell  The society described in the novel is scary  and I couldn t help imagining a couple of countries today being very similar to it  I also loved the fact that the writer invented a modern form of English in his story  The appendix even explains the  rather simplistic  vocabulary and grammar  Just read it already  rhyb     Hlw  jd kmn lzm  y Hd yqr h hyHs

favoriete boeken  Orwell zijn literaire stijl is buitengewoon  Hij schrijft zeer helder  maakt gebruik van prachtige metaforen en tovert gebeurtenissen om tot suggestieve en plastische beelden  Dit is echter het puntje van de ijsberg  Het onderwerp van 1984  dat overigens geschreven is in 1949  is nog steeds een actueel en ijzingwekkend thema  Een totalitair regime  gebaseerd op de Nazi s en de USSR  overheerst London  Iedereen die opstand biedt  wordt de kop ingedrukt  Gevaporiseerd  Winston Smith werkt voor de Partij  maar is allesbehalve voorstander van dit soort despotisme  Via slinkse manieren probeert hij verzet te bieden  maar als lezer wordt het je al snel duidelijk dat zijn acties gedoemd zijn om te mislukken  Orwell geeft zijn hoofdpersonage ook flashbacks  wat mij bijzonder intrigeert  Als onoplettende lezer zou je denken dat Winston krankzinnig wordt vanaf deel drie  wanneer ze hem martelen en psychologisch folteren   maar het is mijn mening dat er vanaf het begin al iets aan de hand is met Winston  De beginzin luidt namelijk   het was een heldere  koude dag in april  en de klokken sloegen dertien   Op pagina 99 echter vind ik de volgende zin terug   Toch had hij  voorzover hij zich kon herinneren  NOOIT kerkklokken horen luiden   Dit suggereert dat Winston al bij de start van het boek kenmerken van krankzinnigheid of hallucinaties vertoont  wat een heel andere insteek geeft op de gebeurtenissen  Hiernaast biedt het einde twee verschillende interpretaties  Winston blijft leven  maar is geautomatiseerd tot een voorstander van de Partij  of Winston wordt geelimineerd door de Partij  Hoe dan ook  dit boek laat een sterke indruk achter  Impressionant   Ya es hora que lo lea  esta pendiente desde agosto del 2010         Hoy no he podido leer nada       quede tan impresionada con las ultimas 100 hojas que de solo recordarlas siento una sensacion de angustia horrible que me impide retomar otros libros mas  amistosos     y lo peor es pensar que cosas asi sucedieron y siguen sucediendo   Es un relato descarnada y temo que veridico de la condicion humana   Cuando pase un poco la impresion  en un par de dias hare la resena    Algunas ideas sueltas  Ninguna novela de terror ha hecho temblar y leer tan compulsivamente como esta  Queria dejar el libro a cada momento pero me atraia morbosamente   hasta que la angustia y la sensacion de miedo se hicieron insoportables en la ultima pagina  Al cerrarlo me invadio una sensacion de descanso  de gratitud por no experimentar una vida como esa   pero el espanto subsistio   Y pensar que me pase un semestre estudiando un tema a fin  el Terror en los regimen totalitario de la Rusia Sovietica  especialmente las Grandes Purgas  con una aseptica vision de laboratorio y al leer 1984  de pronto todo ese conocimiento se me metio en las venas  al casi vivir la historia de Wiston Smith en carne propia  de identificarme con el La narracion es magnifica  pues logra certeramente comunicarte y conectarte con los personajes de esta aterradora manera Realmente un libro NOTABLE  que nadie debe dejar de leer aunque espante  A pasar de ser espeluznante De que por momentos te ahoga y te deja sin

alternative reality was painted beautifully  I ve a feeling it won t be to everyone s taste in book group but think it will be a really good discussion as a result  This is exactly the kind of book I joined book clubs for   I really should have read it sooner but am glad I finally got around to it      Brilliant  The one story you would never want to end The fervent wishing that the outcomes would be as you would wish them to be with so little disregards to how unrealistic your wishes are This book is nothing short of a prophecy  a prophecy about how we have let life get sucked out of life itself I would have loved to dig deeper and talk in details but the one amazing thing about this book is that each bit of detail that you would mistakenly divulge would be a spoiler  So  to make it short A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT READ   Nesta sombria alegoria  passada no futuro que seria o ano de 1984  os cidadaos estao submetidos a autoridade omnipresente do Big Brother e do seu partido  sendo proibidos de manifestar a sua individualidade e liberdade de pensamento  Trata se de uma excelente metafora sobre os totalitarismos que proliferaram ao longo do seculo XX e que causaram os maiores atentados contra a liberdade pessoal e colectiva  THIS IS  BY FAR  THE MOST DISTURBING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ Beginning from the first sentence  Orwell has introduced me to Winston Smith s world I have never before imagined would exist  It is in this book that I ever knew that man is capable of creating such evil to the point of erasing the thing that makes it human  It is in this book that I have learned that selfishness is capable of forgetting one s feelings towards one another like love  To think that love is a powerful feeling  We can t also deny the fact that probably  just probably  in a decade  in 50 years  a century  all of this would soon be a reality  We never know  that it s probably in the works by now  Ok so I still have a lot of thoughts towards this book but I can t seem to put it all in words  All in all  from the first sentence to the last  George Orwell created a world  created an atmosphere in my head and unlike all the books that I ve read before  this one made the words come out of the pages because everything seemed so real  Just    I don t know  This work is a masterpiece  ugly sobs  Probably Orwell wrote this novel for a future that he didn t want to exist    It is a message more than a novel  and may some of it became real in these days  the best books are those that tell you what you know already  Winston perceiving while reading  the book  after  a revolution in your country this book will be more celebrated than befor because you knew already what is going to be said in this book and you just need one to express your feelings as Orwell did   in every country we see Winston   we see Julia   the telescreen   the speakwrite    the big brother and we see the proles      if there was a hope   it lay in the proles    although it is right but we should fear the proles as well when the power and the influence of the regime is so high that the proles them selves fear it as we saw in the story of the chinless man and the skull face man we see the big brother   Big brother is the guise  in which the party choose to exhibit itself to the world  His function is to act as a focusing point for love  fear and reverence  emotions which are morally easily  felt toward an individual than toward an organisation   Applying this to Egypt   we could see that the organization is the Military Council and the individual   the Big Brother   is SisiFrom darker point of view   what if The telescreen is our smart phones cameras   what if The Speakwrite is Google now or Siri   maybe Evernote or Facebook is The memory hole   of course we know that google take all our secrets and our private life  maybe thay made an engine to predict what we are going to think based on our previous serches   isn t that make Google the real Thought Police   what about that The Big Brother is the US and it is watching us now    and our countries leaders is little  Big Brothers  or inner party members  On that topic Orwell says     the invention of print  however  made it easier to manipulate public opinion  and the film and the radio carried the process further   With the development of television   and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument  private life came to an end   every citizen or at least every citizen important to be worth watching could be kept for 24 hour a day under the eyes of the police and on the sound of a official propaganda  with all of other channels of communication closed   the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state   but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects   now exist for the first time  Quotes  If you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face    forever  No one ever sizes power with the intention of relinquishing it  power is not a means  it is an end   one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution   one makes a the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship     Who controls the past controls the future   who controls the present controls the past   nothing in the world was so bad as  physical pain     in the face of pain there are no heroes    no heroes   For long periods the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always comes a moment when the lose either their belief in themselves or their capecity to govern efficiently or both   They are  then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on this side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice  As soon as they have reached the objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude   and themselves become the high  presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and them  and the struggles begins over again   Of the three groups only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving that aims   it would be an exaggeration to say the throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind     In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to the state of war   it does not matter whether the war is actually happening   and   since no decisive victory is possible   it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly  all that is needed this is that a state of war should exist     Any country which remained industrially backward  was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its more advanced rivals   The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because its not an organization the ordinary sense   nothing hold it together except an idea which is indestructible   The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the government of Oceania itself just to keep people frightened   The tales about Goldstein and his underground army  were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in   The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold meThere lie they  and here lie weUnder the spreading chestnut treeI always loved how  in the book  pop prolefeed songs are manufactured by computers  no human creativity is needed  I involuntarily recall this tidbit whenever I listen to the newest radio hit these days  I originally read Nineteen Eighty Four  the original title  though understandably usually shortened to 1984  in Greek a few years back  10 days or so ago I felt a need to return to it in English and did so in audio book format  read by Simon Prebble They say that Brave New World describes our world much better than 1984 does  that the blissful ignorance is much more prominent in our society than 1984 s  boot stamping the human face   I ve always held at heart that our own dystopia in the making is the neat blend of the two  the blissfully ignorant sex  drugs and genetically determined human strata  go hand in hand with a government that is in love with power and has merely chosen this more subdued but no less effective way to prolong its ever lasting dominion In this world  wars never end  the enemy is unbeatable and ever present  Bombs go off randomly every now and again just to allow your mind to come in terms with this fact  Telescreens follow the population everywhere  Nowadays people even take little telescreens with them and have feelings of withdrawal if they are ever separated from them  Those who control the present control the past  and those who do so  do it very  very well  So well  in fact  that public opinion can be swayed one way or another in a matter of weeks or even days    so little do people actually remember  so easily do they forget  Relativism is used as the end all be all argument to support that might is right following sickening twists of logic  that there is no nature  out there   thus truth is dictated by the government and the government only  A similar argument hides behind the saying  who wants to ban fascist groups is against freedom of speech and a fascist themselves   The encouragement of doublethink  of which the above is but an example  ultimately has people holding two contradicting beliefs at the same time   I m not a racist  but everybody knows that our race is more advanced  or  war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength   In a similar vain  the government body that is responsible for hitting people and quenching peaceful protests is named  Ministry of Citizen Protection  and the one which makes sure that everyone starves is called  Ministry of Development   releasing false figures to mask the facts and manipulate the masses  They are allowed to do so  there are no real laws  since the judiciary body is also controlled by the government  What about the proles where the hope for revolution lies  They re either too busy surviving to actually think for themselves or they re blindly consuming the  prolefeed  the party is providing them with  including of course their own propaganda     oh  sorry about that  I got carried away there and started describing our own living  breathing 2012 This is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 20th century and is one of absolute favourites  It stands as a beaming symbol of the totalitarian societies of the past and of political oppression  violence  propaganda  hunger for power etc  Orwell s vision was so ironically vivid  realistic and reverberated with so many that his name has even come through this book to stand for a whole arrangement of things that smack of real world totalitarianism  Even if he did write it for a different world than what exists more than half a century later  it s evident that when it comes to human societies  old loves die hard  whether it is totalitarian socialism communism or hardcore neo liberal capitalism  it makes little difference  The essence  displays Orwell masterfully  remains the same  Reading 1984  especially for a second time  I got the same feeling Winston  the protagonist  gets from reading a certain book in the book itself  that he had always known about these things and that he was grateful that he had found someone who could articulate them for him Parts of 1984 are extreme  I ll admit  Part Three is a punch in the gut every time  I just wanted to lie in a fetal position in the corner of my room after first reading it  It is that hopeless  that horrible  I can t believe that states like Oceania et al  could be set up and maintain themselves on force  pain and hatred alone  call it conscience  call it a belief that people are basically good  I just can t see such a place existing  It s too evil to exist  That said  I can t think of a way that such a regime  if already having been set up properly  could fall  either  Not to mention that in many ways  our own world and reality is full of unnecessary evil  Who s to say if it s within the bounds of possibility for the next logical step in this progression of evil and imbalance to be taken This nightmarish inevitability hidden within  the terror of the idea that if someone really wanted to create IngSoc and Oceania  he could  is what plays with my mind and I believe with every reader s mind  We might  like Winston  think that such a world is just a work of dystopian fantasy  if we look around us carefully  we just might realise that the absoluteness of the pain  the torture and the future being described as  a boot stamping on a human face forever  might not be such absurd ideas after all The owner of the boot is creating his shoelaces made of hatred and fear as we speak  What if we could create our own artificial shortage of shoelaces  Skraemmende aktuel   Brilliant   creepy  dark  engaging and very thought provoking  I have never been moved by a novel as much as this one   My all time favourite novel  I ve lost count how many times I ve read this  and judging from my book lists  it s well overdue another reread   I know it s grim and depressing  that doesn t stop me from reading it or from going to watch it in the theatre  5 times  3 different productions  and watching the film  Little background story for you  I first heard about this book when I was about 12 years old  The high school I attended had a seperate section of books which the Sixth Formers could take out  This was in that section  I asked my school librarian if I could borrow it and she said I was too young and wouldn t understand it  I thought  BITCH  Who the hell is she to dictate to me what I can and cannot read    So  I saved up my weekly pocket money  which was about PS2 PS3  and when I had enough I went to the bookstore in town after school and purchased a copy  I read this novel over the course of that weekend  taking notes to relay to the school librarian  On Monday morning  I told the librarian that I had bought and read  1984  and gave her my notes  She looked at them and said  Oh  you did understand it   I then asked her if I d proven myself to be able to take out the Sixth Form books  I now wanted to read  Brave New World   and she said I was too young and wouldn t understand them  From that day on  I started using the public libraries a hell of a lot more  and if I had any problems taking out books  my mother would insist that I was allowed to read what I wanted  UPDATE  Re read this novel as it had been a good few years since I last picked it up  There s a reason why this is my all time favourite novel  it has everything I want in a work of literature  not to mention it s bloody terrifying   Okay  this book quite literally terrified me  I mean I was upset for the peeps in Hunger Games and the like  but holy hell this book hit me like a ton of bricks  Now it should be noted that I never mentioned Hunger Games at all  Why would I  Nope  never did I ever type such a thing  Winston isn t particularly memorable  but perhaps that s kind of the point  He is just another drone from sector 7B  whoops  wrong reference  I mean a worker for the Party  an outer Party member  if you will  Who goes to painstaking lengths to appear like a grey conformist blob with no discernible personality other than he thinks he s crazy for going against the grain The world of Oceania is really the main character and what a main character it is  Hypocritical  all knowing  self aware  vindictive  hate filled  power hungry  desolate and destructive  It tears at the very essence of humanity with ease and with the precision of a freaking surgeon  It was horrifying  The prose is usual  or I d imagine it s usual  but this is only my second helping  Orwell  Sort of matter of fact  Like a lecturer telling you a cautionary tale  The ideas presented  whilst seeming to be a sort of mockery  has grains of truth to them and lead to disastrous consequences  The world of 1984 is not only terrifying because of it s deeds  but for what they stand for and what they hope to achieve  and succeed   It s terrifying in an existential way  in a way that is hopeless and crushing  A true essential Dystopian  Now I m going to cut this review out here  before the Thought Police can get me   https   enchantingpages wordpress com    Thought provoking The main character  Winston Smith  lives in a totalitarian society in which there s no privacy and every movement  even every facial gesture  is controlled with telescreens  TV   camera  and microphones  Whenever a citizen expresses discontent towards the government  embodied by the mysterious figure of Big Brother   he gets arrested and  vaporized   he gets killed and all records of his life are erased  so it is as if he never existed   Anyway  this character thinks that the system is wrong and at the beginning of the book he starts writing a diary expressing his discrepancies with Big Brother  He knows that if someone finds the diary  he ll be vaporized The story of this character is interesting  However  what I find really interesting is the setting itself  Right from the beginning  you get to know the slogans of the party  The first time I read them  I tried to figure their meaning out unsuccessfully  but they got explained later  At some point of the story  Winston gets a book where the whole system he s living in is explained  When he starts reading it  the book changes its style completely and suddenly  you find yourself in front of a very interesting and profound essay about politics  and I m serious  There are many things and definitions that got my attention  the concept of doublethink  the mutability of the past  the names of the ministries  the new official language    This last one is pretty interesting  At the time Winston s story takes place  his society is in the process of changing the official language from English to Newspeak  Newspeak is a language based on English  but utterly different  Its purpose is to limit the options of its speakers in a way that they can t think against Big Brother  For example  one of the peculiarities of Newspeak is that the vocabulary is utterly reduced  so you have less options to express your thoughts  In addition to this  every word has only one meaning  In the end  you get a language in which you can say sentences which are correct syntactically but are absurdities  An example of this would be the sentence  all mans are equal   mans   men   This sentence in Newspeak   while being syntactically correct   it is as absurd as saying  all men are redhaired   because  equal  in Newspeak means equal in size  height  weight and many other things  not only  equal in rights   in fact  such a term cannot be formulated in Newspeak   There are many more details about it that you can find in the appendix of the book  As soon as the first reference to Newspeak appeared on the story  I read the entire appendix and I enjoyed it very much As a final note  I must say that this book is really dark and some people might find it a bit disturbing  The book  specially towards the end  gets a bit violent and savage  There are also some sexual scenes that could be argued as necessary for the story  but they could have been hinted in a subtler way  And finally  in my opinion  1984 should be thought provoking  so take it only if that s what you want  p 10   O Big Brother nao e o mesmo sem a Teresa    4 9 5 A book that sets the tone for all similar books to follow  A truly chilling tale of how the future is slowly panning out  The only fault is with the title as 2024 may be nearer the time when its tale will come true  We are all sleep walking into a world were privacy is no longer a guarantee against control from others   Even better from the future    Book Review  1984 by George Orwell  Read at your own risk  Spoliers might appear   War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strenght  It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen                      For whom  it suddenly occurred to him to wonder  was h writing this diary  For the future  for the unborn  His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page  and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink  For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him  How could you communicate with the future  It was of its nature impossible  Either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him  or it would be different from it  and his predicament would be meaningless   Thouthcrime does not entail death  thougthcrime is death   Altering the Past  As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages  he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the Times and pushed them into pneumatic tube  Then  with a movement which was as nearly as possible  uncounsious  he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made  and dropped them into  the memory hole to be devoured by the flames  What happen in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led  he did not know in detail  but he did know in general terms  As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the Times had been assembled and collated  that number would be reprinted  the original copy destroyed  and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead  This process of continous alteration was applied not only to newspapers  but to books  periodicals  pamphlets  posters  leaflets  films  sound tracks  cartoon  photographs  to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance  Day by Day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date  In thi way every prediction  made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct   Don t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make thought crime literally impossible  because there will be no words in which to express it  Every concept that can ever be  needed will be expressed by exactly one word  with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meaning rubbed  out and forgotten   Has it occurred to you Winston  that by year 2050 at the very latest  not a single human being will be alive who  could understand such a conversation as we are having now  The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons  one of which is subsidiary and so  so to speak  precautionary The subsidiary reason is that the Party member  like the proletarian  tolerates present day conditions partly because he has no standard of comparison  He must be cut off from the past  just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestor and that the average level of  material comfort is constantly rising   Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously  and accepting Both of them   Dark  depressing  this is how I will describe this great work of Eric Blair aka George Orwell  This is one of the best and on on the top of the list among the dystopian novel that had been written and published  Many are still amaze on how Orwell Orwell describe in details on how liberty  freedom were totally wipe out in this fictional novel  The masses exist to serve state aka Big Brother  Opposition were not totally wipe out and anyone caught thinking or in the act of rebellion will dealt by the State  For how can they revolt when all the means to revolt were totally wipe out the government and all the  infrastructure of the society were use not to benefit the masses but to enslave them and spy on them  Privacy has no place in the society  Where independent though and thinking are not allowed and all must have the same thinking  The masses  only exist at the pleasure and whim of the Big Brother  Truly this book will really make you cry and pity the main character Winston Smith who tried to rebelled against the Big Brother but he was not successful and the worst he was tortured and brainwash and he finally submitted and love Big Brother in the end of the story  You been people  let us not allowed our  freedom and liberty to be taken from us   Christopher Cruz  February 16  2014   SENI GORUYORUZ  Remember how Joey and Rachel from FRIENDS hid the books Little Women and The Shining in their fridge  I m going to do that to this book    Apart from the fact that I really loved the way the author wrote an imaginative world not far long  and its story line  I was really scared at how much he could be right about our future  The intolerance and justification of  proper living  may wreck havoc on humanity and to believe that it might happen in our future really freaked me out  It maybe one of the most mind blowing and scariest book I ve ever read  I never understood the popularity behind this book  But now I got it  We need to wake up and take it as a warning   ry    bkl m n  lklm    lwl b D lkhT lTfyf  lt  l lm  drk  knt mn lktb m mn lmtrjm  m  nh mn twhmty     ln

l llh   Few books make you think beyond the horizon  A book which will surely let us know difference between utopian and dystopian society  Psychological thriller to some extent   I decided to read 1984 at the very beginning of the summer  When I finally got it  it was the fastest book I read this summer  I loved the main character  Winston  and how he broke the harsh rules of his society even when monitored onscreen almost 24 7  It almost made it seem like a spy or undercover operation  with the punishment for failure was your own brain  literally and or figuratively   Maybe I m just someone who would like this type of book regardless  but I have to say that 1984 sends a huge message to our current world and our own ever changing society  Sure some of it might have gone too far and was a bit unrealistic  but I think that Orwell went over the top on purpose  He wanted to show society as a living  breathing thing with infinite power  The ruling class  called the Party  controls every aspect of truth telling  This is demonstrated by Winston s work rewriting records and articles to twist the past in favor of the Party  History is manipulated closely so no one can gather evidence about the Party s hypocritical actions  This ability to accept two different contradicting ideas is what is known as  doublethink   The people are expected to accept the illogical  facts  when the truth is obvious  The concept of doublethink is as crazy as it gets  However  society will change and who knows what will happen in the future  Even though 1984 is past  Orwell s vision of a nightmarish world keep 1984 one of the best books ever read  Even though you might not like the story  keep in mind that you have the ability to voice your own opinions  In the future  the ones in power might say that 2 2 5 and you WILL accept it  After having read Animal Farm it was clear Orwell was disappointed with the way Communism had eventuated in Russia  1984  to me  is Animal Farm projected into the future where Orwell discusses what life would be like if this form of Communism Socialism had taken over the world  As expected  he paints a bleak future The book begins by throwing the reader into Winston Smith s life in 1984 London where the Party has created a dystopia  Orwell takes the reader through Smith s thoughts  feelings  emotions and actions as he attempts to avoid the Thought Police while keeping his sanity  Big Brother is watching As a read the book is well paced throughout except for small patches in Part Two where things slow down a lot  Nevertheless after Part Two things really pick up and the book becomes very brutal  rewarding the reader for having gotten through the difficult parts of the book  The plot of 1984 has you questioning whether this kind of dystopia is possible and whether Winston is making the right decisions  There are many elements of 1984 that have been seen in dictatorships today  however other areas are too unfeasible  The idea that all proles will never make a noise  especially when rockets are landing amongst them is not very realistic  Nevertheless the plot is entertaining and thought provoking Smith is made to be a very sympathetic character to the reader due to the situation he is put in  However for me personally  whenever he has problems they can usually be traced back to his own bad decisions  This does not take away from the plot though  it is an understandable character flaw Still  with these small issues 1984 is a great book to read and  as long as it is not taken too seriously  will be very entertaining   The meaning of some books is over interpreted and over determined  1984 by George Orwell is one such book  What new can be said about the book that has not been said already  I have two takeaways First  the book peels off layer by layer the deep paradox of modernity  On one hand  we aspire for a world of individuality  liberty and self affirmation  On the other  the modern institutions like state  capitalism  socialism  nation etc  make the individual look insignificant  It is as if the individual does have free will so long as he wills the pre determined choices for him  Winston  the protagonist in the book  has a mutiny in his heart and mind  But in the face of overwhelming harsh reality outside  the mutiny loses all steam and hope  Second is the profound questions  do we really know our own selves  Are our feelings  emotions  love  hate and culture our own or is it all shaped outside of us  Is our individual nature original or second handed  The book does not answer these questions  But it leaves you with them to meditate on  The most horrifyingly tragic part of the book was when the  Party  makes Winston and Julia  two lovers  give up on each other  It is not the adversity that breaks a person down  we all encounter some in one form or another  But it is rather the idea that the world can be so harsh that it will take away your power to deal with the adversity on your own terms  That it will deny you even a dignified struggle to redemption  And when that happens life loses all meaning  desires and dreams lose their motivating sheen  resentment and outrage seem futile constructs in a world without a hope of justice  And that is how party break down the rebels  It corrodes the most intimate and most sacred part of one s self  I happened to read this book at a time when A Dalit student in Hyderabad University  Rohith Vemula  committed suicide  His extraordinarily profound and moving suicide note touches the very themes that 1984 is about  Rohith s letter was calmly indignant at a world which denies individuality  at Indian society which dehumanizes the marginalized and dispossessed  at moral vocabulary which is more an illusion than a concrete reality  and at humanity caught up in petty power struggles  forgetting stars  nature and idealism Both 1984 and Rohith s letter are deeply discomforting  They challenge our easy and lazy ideas about life  They leave you with few answers and great questions  If the purpose of writing is to evoke thinking rather than give instructions  both these writings score full marks  Read this 15 years ago  Depressed the hell out of me  Fantastic book  but not something I d pick up for a second time  Devon LaufferMrs  CarteauxEnglish One Honors Period C19 September2014SPOILERS1984 Book Analysis George Orwell s critically acclaimed book 1984 is a master piece about a future 90 percent of the world are like mindless sheep  believing whatever they re told  If any sign of intelligence is spotted  the person is  removed   The protagonist  Winston  is trying to survive in this world full of dictators  1984 is full of ideas about human nature  the human mind  and the meaning of life  However  the main theme is  this is what the future will look like if humans don t change their ways   1984 is a great novel with its ideas and story  but is incredibly grim  dark  and it definitely doesn t a happy ending   Every day  Winston goes to work and revises history to make Big Brother  a dictator who is actual the upper class  seem genius and compassionate  There  he falls in love with Julia  another worker  Love is strictly forbidden  unless it is a love of Big Brother  In order to get married  Winston and Julia join a secret organization called the Brotherhood  which is devoted to killing Big Brother  After receiving a book with all of the Brotherhood s ideals  Winston and Julia are caught  As it turns out  the Brotherhood is just a way to catch people that are against Big Brother  Over the course of time  Winston and Julia are tortured and tortured until  through mental warfare  they are both brainwashed into loving Big Brother  In fact  Winston s last thought was  But it was alright  everything was alright  the struggle was finished  He had won the victory over himself  He loved Big Brother    Orwell 298    1984 is easily a classic like George Orwell s Animal Farm  but like Animal Farm  it doesn t sugar coat anything  It continuously shows the bad side of human nature and how future like this might have happened  though it is incredibly unlikely  1984 is ultimately a great mind bending book with a large touch of reality   This is one of those books that everyone has read and is spoken a lot about  One of the main reasons why I liked this book was that it was very thought provoking  I would say more than the story  I loved the way Orwell has tried to put across a nice social message  It was very disturbing  no doubt  At some point  I was really thinking whether I should skip the torture part  But I still continued because of the way it was written  I had hoped against all hopes that something good or miraculous might happen at the end  But the ending came in as a shock  The last line shook me completely  This is about a government  much worse than any  Very scary and totally unimaginable   Power is not a means  it is an end  being the motive  Sometimes while reading I forgot that this was fictitious because of the way in which he goes into details  He completely justifies why such a party came into existence or why they are the way they are  Even their slogans make lot of sense when you understand what they mean  I usually don t like books which preach or talk about politics or society but this book really impressed me   This is probably the most disturbing and depressing book I have read so far My Favs   War is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength   Who controls the past  controls the future  who controls the present controls the past  History has stopped  Nothing exists except through human consciousness  Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing  Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence  and as difficult to attain MUST READ Updated  I watched the movie recently and it was even more disturbing to actually see all the torture  But it stuck to the book completely  A very nice adaptation of the book  Brilliant commentary on the fragility of privacy in the shadow of a massive political movement  Many of the issues in the story are entirely too relevant in America today  That a political party might exist unapologetically solely for the perpetuation of its own power is a concept that is playing out even now  though today it is still cloaked in the guise of being for the benefit of the people   Individual rights must be protected at all costs   for who among us has the individual influence to stand against Big Brother  This book beautifully portrays a dystopian world and shows the thirst for power that party has  And the most beautiful part  if you want to control the reality  control the past and thoughts of people  Then reality only exists in their own mind  not outside This book is worth reading over and over again  THINK  it is not illegal yet  WOW  WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW  I am stunned that I have never picked this up before  I read Animal Farm a long time ago and it still remains to be one of my favourite books of all time  and a book that really taught me something about society  Now  Animal Farm will always be a little better in my eyes  but 1984 blew me away I m not going to get into spoilers or anything of the sort  but 1984 really got me thinking  and I love when a book can do that  I found myself questioning my own society  and the similarities between my real life society and this dystopian society  The sad part of it was  I didn t see too many differences  While our society may not be as out loud about the tricks and trades the government has over us  it is still there George Orwell got me thinking and shocked me at every page turn  Easily a 5 5 stars here  no question  anlatmakla  yorumlamakla olmaz alin okuyun  yok boyle bi kitap    I first read this back in the early 1970s for a college history class called  Science Fiction as Social Criticism   and liked it a lot  It gained renewed interest in 1984  but I don t remember reading it again at that time  Now 66 years after it was written and 27 years since 1984  it s quite fascinating reading in the context of current world events  If you ve never read it  try it  And if you read it a long time ago  read it again   Let me tell you a story  we had three different English teachers when I was in year 11  because they kept leaving  This was the last book assigned to us by the second of those teachers  One day  after we were finally finished with Empire Of The Sun  which was unanimously hated   our teacher took us into the storage room so we could pick a book WE wanted to study  The instant we saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  opinion was once again unanimous  But our teacher thought that was too young for our age group and decided she d pick a book herself  obviously not realising that 16 year olds are MUCH more likely to do their homework if it s a book they WANT TO READ IN THE FIRST PLACE  But I digress  This was the book our teacher chose for us She chose it because it was her favourite  and her replacement considered it a favourite as well  My class was one of those ones where no matter what book was picked  everyone except for one person hated it  I was that one  every time  Lord of the Flies  Macbeth  Hamlet  even the one Geoffrey Robertson book we studied the next year   I enjoyed them all   Not that I ever finished Lord of the Flies and I suspect I won t like it as much when I do finally re read it   Nineteen Eighty four is no exception It s been years now since I read it and I can t remember specific details  but it has stuck with me for five years  It was my first ever dystopia  and I d never read anything even remotely like it  which is probably part of the reason I loved it so much  Despite all my gushing  this is not a hopeful book  or a happy one  The characters are not likeable  It doesn t have a happy ending  But once it s in your head it will never leave  and the longer it sits there the more you realise how brilliant it is  YA dystopias have nothing on Orwell  To this day I have never been more shocked by an ending than I was by this one  the last four small  unbelievably hard hitting words left me overcome by a kind of crawling  frigid horror of the kind that you usually only feel after waking up in the small hours after a nightmare This is not the best book I ve ever read  or my most favourite  But I can only thank that teacher for assigning this book because I wouldn t have read it otherwise and I would have never had the chance to be blown away by this  I think this may be the book that renewed my faith in reading  as pretentious as that sounds   I must have read only mediocre books in my early teen years  because I remember not reading as much then as I did when I was small  or as much as I do now   It s tremendously relevant even today in terms of government  war and censorship   eerily so  or disappointingly  when you consider that obviously nothing much has changed in 66 years   and will remain very very important for a long time   A chilling book  Far more terrifying than some of the horror books out there I have often wondered what goes on in some of the countries under totalitarian governments  This book gave me an answer  It is very readable even though it can be very depressing at times  It is a book which does not celebrate the human spirit  but rather defines its boundaries  One of those books that are incredibly important to read and yet very difficult to get through  in this case because it is so discouraging  Much has been said and written about Orwell s prescience  and the immeasurable cultural influence he has had  to the degree that  Orwellian  has become a common adjective  The world Orwell creates is richly imagined enough that reading the book offers a taste of what it must have felt like under the watchful eye of Big Brother As I read I realized why this was never assigned in any of my English classes through high school and two college degrees in literature  Of course the great value of this book isn t literary  it s cultural and political  And the most alarming part of Orwell s  prophetic vision  isn t that we have little or no privacy today  true as it may be   but that privacy hasn t been taken from is  it has been voluntarily surrendered  Contemporary culture rushes forward and flings privacy on the altar of external validation  whether on reality television  blogs  twitter  or  most ubiquitously  Facebook  of which I am a relatively active participant   We sign up to have every purchase tracked by companies  whether online or through  perks  programs  There is much convenience in these programs  as companies cater marketing to our personal needs and desires  They get better at predicting what we will want to purchase and to make those things more readily available to us  Invasive email and phone screening by the NSA probably helps efforts to track down terrorists and other criminals  But of course every time we yield another corner of our privacy we lose something that is difficult if not impossible to reclaim 1984 is as thought provoking as any book I ve read this year  It is now evident to me why 1984 is a literary classic  It is not for memorable characters  or for beautiful language  or because of a mass appeal  1984 is not  as I wrongfully predicted  about a crazy hypothetical omnipotent police state  nor about a lone revolutionary  1984 is about what it is to be human  It is about belonging to society  It is about the meaninglessness and helplessness and mundaninity of life  Throughout the ending of this  I could not help but recalling the ending of The Stranger  Nothing  nothing mattered  and I knew why  So did he  Throughout the whole absurd life I d lived  a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future  across years that were still to come  and as it passed  this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time  in years no more real than the ones I was living  What did other people s deaths or a mother s love matter to me   we re all elected by the same fate   For everything to be consummated  for me to feel less alone  I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate  I loved the philosophy behind 1984  but I cannot excuse Orwell s mid novel essay  in which he re hashes and spells out every single idea presented within the novel so far  It is dull  redundant  and completely brakes the established cadence of the novel plusgood lol This was my first speculative fiction novel  I am in a state of shock at how enjoyable this book was and didn t know what to expect at first  The first quarter of the book had my mind blown so many times at how eerie the whole thing was  And how much of it could be so true it s scary  How an idea could get under your skin and inside your mind  This book was so good in so many ways  However it did get to a point of extreme boredom somewhere in the middle where Winston read  the book  and I remembered flipping the pages to see how much of this long repetitive explanation of what The Party was doing was left  Other than about 10 or 20 pages of this  I absolutely loved this book  It sets out to define  in the crudest way  that every man is for himself and no emotion or feeling in the world could betray his very basic instinct to survive  And how it s even possible to brainwash the non believers  If you think about it  you could even relate to some of the fundamental principles of the book to what is happening around you    I would recommend this book  Still my all time favorite book  The theme of the novel will never become out dated  I m just so glad to finally have my own copy   What can I say  I love this book  It s one of my favourites  n lHrb  dh m qyst bm yyr lHrwb lqdym   hy mjrd khd  wdjl  bl hy  shbh blm rk lty

could rate this book 1 or two stars  I hope that this book will never become a reality  I think I would definitely be in Ministry of Love  The way George Orwell wrote this book was in depth  I was clenching my teeth when Smith was suffering  It felt like i could feel everything he was going through  I don t think he betrayed Julia  I don t believe he meant it  even if he says in the book  And he never loved the Big Brother  I think  for me  they did not break his spirit  I will recommend this book to every ignorant person I know in my life  This book will be one of those books which will show how grateful we should be that no one can really control your mind and emotions  They can t get inside of you   ApokalypsisGia dall incipit  quando il protagonista Wiston Smith  rientrando nei suoi modestissimi appartamenti  viene accolto dal lezzo stantio di cavoli bolliti e di stuoini logori  il lettore riesce a percepire l atmosfera claustrofobica e catastrofica che lo accompagnera fino all epilogo Quella che Orwell ci descrive e un apocalisse in scala di grigi  un paradosso che rasenta il bluff  l apogeo della corruzione umana  ci descrive una Londra irriconoscibile  uggiosa e pessimista  che aborrisce la vita in quanto tale  dilaniata da una societa gerarchica senza scampo La democrazia e le liberta sono ormai concetti astratti  superati  che perdono il loro stesso significato con la scomparsa dei termini con cui vengono descritte  Infatti la  neolingua  non prevede tutto questo  controllando la lingua si restringe al massimo la sfera d azione del pensiero  ogni concetto sara definito da una sola parola  tutti i significati ausiliari verranno tralasciati  dimenticati  sgretolati  perche futili  fuorvianti  pericolosi  Si potra mai pensare a qualcosa come la liberta  quando il concetto stesso di liberta verra abolito Ma Londra non e che un granello di polvere nel deserto di sentimenti che sembra essere diventato il mondo del 1984  Un epoca che sembra ridicola definire ai giorni nostri  un epoca in cui l ortodossia  o il non aver bisogno di pensare  regna sovrana  dove chi e troppo intelligente scompare  vaporizzato  dove i fatti e la storia vengono disintegrati  nell indifferenza generale che costituisce il tacito assenso al regime  Un epoca dove il mondo oggi conosciuto e scomparso  inghiottito nel gorgo dell ambizione umana  racchiuso in tre superstati in perenne guerra fra loro  Oceania  Eurasia ed Estasia Follia e saggezza si scambiano di posto e si confondono nella logica del  bipensiero   dove chiunque puo sostenere tutto e il contrario di tutto  in un macabro gioco psichedelico  dove il nemico di un momento diviene l alleato del giorno dopo  dove ci si puo dimenticare in un attimo di aver tenuto fra le dita la prova di essere costantemente immersi nella piu grande commedia che la mente umana potra mai generare Il Socing non e solo un partito  E  il Partito  incarnato in un uomo baffuto che abbozza un sorriso sotto i folti baffi neri  con un aria serena e decisa  Il Grande Fratello  Ti sta guardando  ti sta sorridendo  Oppure no Il Socing descritto da Orwell e invincibile  manipola e plasma i suoi seguaci  anche se involontari  a sua immagine e somiglianza  E  una forza che entra nella testa  qualcosa che martella il cervello  inculcandovi la paura di esprimere opinioni personali  persuadendo chiunque a negare l evidenza  a diffidare dei propri sensi  Se il Partito proclamava che 2 2 era uguale a 5  allora tutti avrebbero dovuto crederci  Perche no  Se la realta ci viene proiettata attraverso la nostra mente  chi ci assicura che la nostra mente sia sotto controllo   Chi ci assicura che non siamo totalmente folli  E  in questa realta fatiscente d ideali dove si muove il protagonista Wiston Smith   l ultimo uomo sulla terra   l unico che sembra volere e potere conservare una parvenza di umanita in una realta che sembra aver perso tutto quello che la rende tale  Niente di speciale questo Wiston  non particolarmente intelligente  ne particolarmente prestante  con un passato dimenticato e da dimenticare  Pero ha voglia di vivere  Ha voglia di pensare  lottando contro i dettami del Socing  ha voglia di ribellarsi  inseguendo una vana utopia  ha voglia di amare e non solo al fine esclusivo di riprodursi  Ma neppure lui riuscira a disertare  non riuscira ad uscire dal cono d ombra creato dal Grande Fratello  che ha i suoi occhi nei teleschermi che osservano la popolazione 24 ore su 24 e il suo braccio nella terribile psicopolizia  nel Ministero dell Amore  davanti a uno specchio  vedendo il suo corpo scheletrico  la pelle grigia e lo sguardo spento  Wiston Smith capira il paradosso della follia che diventa autodisciplina  capira che l ultimo uomo sulla terra  l ultimo degno di essere chiamato tale  non e altro che una larva rachitica senza futuro  senza vie di fuga  Un verme che per combattere un regime inumano ha messo in palio la propria dignita  insieme alla propria vita e a quella di persone innocenti  Puo questo essere ancora chiamato uomo Non puo sfuggire al Grande Fratello  se non attraverso la morte  Ma anche in quell ultimo istante  lui conseguira la sua vittoria  Si  perche finalmente Wiston lo imparera ad amare  1984 si inserisce a pieno titolo nella corrente di romanzi europei che compaiono a cavallo del primo e del secondo dopoguerra  caratterizzati da un pessimismo radicato  conseguenza di una crisi di valori proprieta degli intellettuali borghesi nel positivismo e in tutte le correnti derivanti  come il comunismo  Questa corrente letteraria prende il nome di  dystopia   antiutopia  e annovera fra i suoi  seguaci   oltre ad Orwell  altre rispettabilissime personalita come Ray Bradbury  Orwell  al fine di combattere lo stalinismo e qualsiasi altra forma di totalitarismo  scrisse dapprima la celeberrima Animal Farm e poi 1984  titolo ottenuto invertendo le ultime due cifre dell anno in cui l autore incomincio la stesura del romanzo  il 1948  Questo baluardo del filone Cyberpunk  costituisce un accusa chiara ed innegabile nei confronti della pretesa marxista leninista di piegare la popolazione e la realta per un fine superiore  ufficialmente la felicita del proletariato e ufficiosamente l obbedienza al partito comunista stesso  Non e difficile  infatti  identificare la descrizione del Grande Fratello con il volto di Stalin  oppure quella dell eversivo Goldstein con tratti somatici di Trotskij  il nemico numero uno dello stalinismo Fondamentale risulta l intreccio fra realta romanzata e teorie politiche  incarnate nella figura del protagonista Wiston Smith  il cui nome  Wiston  deriva da Wiston Churchill e  Smith  e il cognome inglese piu comune   il cui lavoro e quello di mutare perennemente la storia passata  non solo per celare errori e contraddizioni del Partito  ma anche per preservare la volubilita dell uomo medio che non possiede alcun mezzo di ribellione se non la propria coscienza  facilmente discutibile 1984 e per eccellenza la meraviglia di Orwell  baluardo dell utopia negativa  il cui principio centrale e la mutabilita del passato  dogma necessario per fissare la stabilita del regime e che si incarna perfettamente nell agghiacciante e altrettanto indiscutibile verita condensata in uno slogan del Partito  Chi controlla il passato  controlla il futuro Chi controlla il presente  controlla il passato Un vero capolavoro  A defining book of political  societal  and human commentary  George Orwell s 1984 depicts a harrowing future in which undying statism and utter totalitarianism pervades totally throughout the population  The novel pledges its inner workings unto situationally self aware narration from the main characters  who act as Orwell s conduits  etching out the already well detailed and masterfully crafted world in which the story is set  and expresses through skillful design of the rebarbative political boot it all exists under The concepts dealt with on the political side are that of socialism  indirectly Stalinism   namely in the form of the ever present ideology originally based on socialism  but also that of extreme nationalism and jingoism  where the population is geared towards a ceaseless hatred for all but their collective selves  The conspicuous and glaring being totalitarianism  to which almost every theme  notion and concept is built and expended upon to create this marvelous macrocosm  All of these political ideologies and themes are portrayed and crafted expertly throughout the entirety of the book  succeeding in the fear instilling picture of the future in which it was striving for  leaving the reader totally engorged in the downcast portrait  As well as this  it doesn t sacrifice political  philosophical  or ideological accuracy or realism for banalities in exchange to achieve this  While touching on the philosophical side  such as people and society  this is in a minor form  and ultimately pales in size or relevancy to the political  Notably  one reference is made  but is attributed to the overall political side  This  however  is not a hindrance to the plot  rather  it could be argued it is unnecessary given the context Ubiquitously forlorn and destitute of happiness and colour  it is poignant  unremitting in its depressing bleakness  commendable  impeccable design for the setting  anything dissenting would have ultimately undermined the underlying tones and themes of the book  The imagery used is splendid as well  effortlessly venting the paralytic and constricting feelings of paranoia that the characters feel under such circumstances to the reader  The incessant use of propaganda pieces and the repetitive use of the party s motto further drive in the claustrophobic feelings prevalent in the book among the characters  especially that of the main  The story never fails and never falters to ultimately consign the reader to the feelings or situational circumstances that the characters find themselves in In all  1984 is a masterwork of the political and social framework of a predicted society  and  under what Orwell saw  as a possible future for mankind if the political parties have their unregulated way  albeit exaggerated  but not impossible  The story and philosophical ideals behind it are thought provoking and intellectually edifying to say the least  and it goes without saying that 1984 truly deserves to be hailed as one of the genre defining novels of its time  lrwy u lnbw      dh  rdta  n tstshrfa Swr  lmstqbli   tkhyl Hidhan

ai mis autant de temps avant de m y attaquer  Il est certain que mes cours me gardaient bien occupee cote lecture et puis lorsque j avais le temps et le desir de lire quelque chose  pour mon plaisir j avais toujours une pile de livres a lire sur le cote du lit  La question est  pourquoi ne faisait il pas partie de cette sculpture abstraite que formait l amoncelement de livres negliges dans ma chambre  Je crois que sa reputation m intimidait  je m attendais peut etre a une lecture difficile et epuisante et qu en raison de toute la non fiction que je devais consommer  j etais davantage portee a attraper un livre divertissant et leger plutot qu un roman cite par divers groupes de militants et d academiciens  Je me suis trompee  le livre est tres accessible que ce soit dans le fond ou dans la forme  malgre qu il y ait beaucoup de choses qui puissent etre tirees de ce livre  C est un livre qui vous fera definitivement reflechir  plus1984 from George Orwell was on my to be read list for at least a decade  Now that I read it  I wonder why I took so much time to start  Sure my class kept me busy with reading  and when I had time and desire to read something for fun  I always had a pile of books to read on the side of my bed  The question is  why wasn t it part of this abstract sculpture that was the accumulation of neglected books in my bedroom  I think I was intimidated by its reputation  maybe I was expecting a difficult and tiring read and because of all the non fiction that I had to consume  I was brought to pick an entertaining and light book instead of a novel quote by militants and scholars  I was wrong  the book is really accessible as well in style than in substance  though there s a lot to get from the book  This novel will definitely make you think  more 1984 puts every dystopian to shame  I don t think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing  and yet  such are the originality  the suspense and the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down  A must read  Outstanding  It s astonishing how you can relate to it and how the writer perfectly predicted the future  1984 is one of the must read classics  It takes place in a reverse utopia  where everything the opposite of what we think is good  Everyone has been swayed to the one central belief that their country is perfect  At times this book makes you want to go ahhhhh      The main character is Winston  is his job to falsify anthing that would make the people realize how bad the situation is in the world definetly one my best reads yet winston has a job at the ministery truth  his job is to get articles and documents out of a pnuematic tube and he takes the documents and changes them to agree with an idea that the goverment was always right and everyone believed that and would forget that the facts had been changed this was called  double think  in newspeak in old speak it is called  countrolled reality   He had a lover named julia there love was sacred  a jem in a storm of hatred  Their love is beautiful amazing strong and dangerous  They are a tiny bit of an old democratic age in a new world of hatred  their love was soon put to a stop when their hiding place in an old shop was discovered by the thought police and they were put in the ministry of peace Big Brother used winstons greatest fear against him and in the end he betrayed julia and julia betrayed him  The concept endless war was to keep the supplies and goods to keep people in poverty and keep them angry  keep them blind  society in nine teen eighty four was to keep people blind and keep them away from the fact that the goverment was corupt and evil  to not have a world like 1984 one must give their people privacy and allow them to think differently and become unique  until next time  kayden lewis A masterpiece in political fiction  a classic that should be read by everybody  regardless of the reader s political leanings  The book was created soon after the end of WWII  and it clearly reflects the political climate existing in Europe at the time  However the passionate and unforgettable cry by the author for individual freedom and social justice  so beautifully expressed in his book  are as relevant and as applicable today as they were over 60 years ago  We should never forget that the liberal   socialist democratic practises and institutions have been  if put in a wider historical   geopolitical context  the exception rather than the rule  and they are not a definite one way street  just as an example  think about Weimer s democracy in Germany  which gave way so easily to Nazism   Democracy is fragile  and one of the main lessons of this book is that we should be always wary of giving any entity too much power or control   just look as an example at the Big Brother activities by the NSA in post 9 11 America  tramping so shamelessly on individual rights and international laws and treaties in the USA and especially abroad  What I also found very fascinating in the book is the analysis of the distinguishing features of the tyrannical society  in order to exert control over the lives of the citizen  you have to check and stop freedom of thought and scientific progress  the war on science currently waged by some powerful political circles in the USA comes to mind   and you have to inspire fear  hatred and nationalism  History  even very recent one  confirms that it is by exploiting the  Love of Your Country  message that you can get the  proles  to support whatever action  including invasions of other countries  you deem convenient at the time Recent history is full of examples of modern  politically efficient totalitarian regimes presenting at least some of the distinguishing features highlighted by the author in his book  the years of Terror in Jacobin Revolutionary France are possibly the first example of modern totalitarian regime  followed by the Nazi State  where Goebbels exploited with real genius the technical possibilities offered by the new mass media such as radio and movies   and of course by Stalinism  as implemented in Russia but also in Eastern Europe and so visible now in North Korea   But in the advanced democracies dangers are also present   this book is a reminder that individual freedom is something to be treasured and defended against abuse and against the ideologies of Nationalism  fear and hatred that can always be exploited to erode these rights   Book is about a totalitarian government which has offered its inhabitants dystopia  This book also analyse the humans which is the most interesting part of this piece of art  Everything in this book satisfied my intellect until the end which is the most horrible part of it  The last thing doesn t satisfy my intellect or maybe I am too stubborn to accept a thing so dark you would rather die than to get introduced to that side Someone explained the book to be  Most Influential Book of all time   I completely agree with the statement although I don t accept last part  because maybe this is the book which started the paranoia of people against their governments  Review of 1984  Big Brother is watching you  This is not just a novel  it is a book that describes the essence of every dictatorship in the history  and just like the Ingsoc slogans every oppressive ruler is self contradictory  WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH 1984 is the climax of Orwell s brilliance  with its disturbing portrait of a dystopian future  which fell under the mercy of a power hungry party that tries to control everything even the minds of the public I read this book mainly because of its theme  it can be related to the situation of my country which is ruled by a vicious dictator  of course not as extreme as telescreens and the Thought police  but in some level it is similar to Oceania  But I think in every place in the world there are people like the  Party  who will break any law  shatter any ethical principle  and do anything they can in the pursuit of power  because just like Orwell puts it  Power is not a means  it is an end  Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows More than anything  1984 is a social commentary and an ominous foretelling of the future done exactly right  It is the story of a man named Winston who  in the end  makes little to no difference in the eyes of the government because he is just one measley person of the lower class with a mediocre life  In this way  Orwell makes a story that matters for a little while  but in the end  dissipates under the eyes of Big Brother  which could make one wonder  Is Winston like everyone else  Surely he is not the only dissidant to be extinguished  I know that the dystopian genre is very popular in books nowadays  but I have never really gotten into it very much  However  I feel that 1984 is not just A dystopian novel  rather  it is THE dystopian novel  which means that is absolutely essential as well as the inspriation for a lot of other smaller dystopian books that follow  What is not to love about this book  after all  It gives a creepily sterilized feeling to a world that is purged of all forms of individuality  It makes a strong commentary about totalitarian governments as a whole  but the fictional world presented does not lose character  All in all  I think that this book is very close to being a perfect book  although to call it absolutely perfect would make me uneasy  that s such a strong statement   WAR IS

distributed  while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste  But in practice such a society could not long remain stable  For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike  the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves  and when once they had done this  they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function  and they would sweep it away  In the long run  a hierarchical society was only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance   I read this book and think   I have an ethical duty to fight against fascism  and for democracy and freedom   It scares me to think that there are people in the world    rich  powerful people    reading this book and thinking   We must protect our interests by paying attention to Orwell s insight    it is not safe to educate the poor  and the poor must be kept in poverty  or we will have to share power as well as wealth   For a long time I thought that the ruling elite just didn t care that people were suffering    and ignorant narcissism does drive much of the system  But not all of it  some of it is on purpose  with conscious intent  and this is a mindboggling concept to me  I m not understanding what it must feel like to live inside that worldview  to consciously choose to make others suffer in order to amass power over others  I want to think that this is a fairy tale  a paranoid fantasy with no more reality than ogres or vampires  But they do exist  I ve actually seen them and met them and had conversations with them  I ve also spent most of my life thinking that these people can be saved  that they just need enough love and education  and then they will see the error of their ways and come over to the light  I think this stubborn delusion goes back to my childhood relationship with my father  I believed that he was raping me because I had failed in my duty to bring him to Jesus and save his soul  It was my fault  for not being good enough  for not praying hard enough  for not being a convincing enough missionary  for not being lovable enough    because surely  if I was lovable enough and smart enough  would I be able to save his soul  and thus save all the people he was hurting  What was wrong with me that I couldn t realize this simple and clear vocational calling Now I m starting to think    maybe its not my fault  Maybe there is something wrong with them  the men at the top of the pyramid that rape and oppress  Maybe loving them and educating them is not sufficient  Maybe we need to come up with a more practical set of deterrents  Maybe they need to be firmly yet politely escorted to those prisons they keep building  fshykh  Ci sarebbe da fare un tema su un libro di tale importanza storica e letteraria Mi limito a dire che letto ancora adesso e calzante  anzi e terribilmente inquietante per le somiglianze con la societa attuale Poi l iconico  Big Brother  e spaventoso  sicuramente uno degli elementi piu riusciti del libro e della fantascienza in generale  Few novels grab a society by storm and sink roots into the social fabric well past its prime  1984 by George Orwell did just that  with obvious aftershocks still visible  including the television show  Big Brother    Room 101   and multiple film versions   The work immediately grabbed me  which I admit is not the normal reaction I garner from other readers  However  I feel the book is worth the effort of pushing forward  The novel focuses on Winston Smith and his doubts within a totalitarian socialist regime known as Oceania  which comprises England  North America  and other territories  as it wages war against two other super powers  Smith questions the blend between reality and fiction as a writer constantly reshaping the past  Orwell himself focuses on the inevitable corruption of the same socialism he was a proponent of earlier in life  Without a doubt  the most powerful dystopian novel  1984 brings one on a psychological thriller of the repercussions of a man over stepping the bounds of a totalitarian regime  With cultural echoes continuing to the present  I feel that 1984 is a harrowing warning of what a government  or even a singular person  with too much power is capable of  Obviously a classic  Chilling when looked at in the context of today s geopolitical reality  The

and treats a future society Because he is socialist  we can feel too strong touch totally I have a great expectations about this book     I could not same book as publisher  no problem                                                                        July 17 1984  this is Review Winston Smith is a citizen  or should I say a comrade  of the country  Oceania  Oceania is a communist country where Big Brother rules  Big Brother always watches over his citizens  These citizens  comrades  are not allowed to call anybody with any title except comrade  There are telescreens  which are the like CCTV s and TV s  all over the places  They watch people what they do  People of Oceania are not allow to record  or write ant part of history  I f someone does  he will disappear in a night  and no one will ever remember him  not even that he existed  However  it s different from Winston because he has a private room in his apartment  which is older than him  and telescreens cannot see him while he is in there  He starts writing diary  which the date starts at April 4th  1984 At the work  all the workers have to go into the 2 MINUTE HATE  In there the telescreen will show them about some person  or people  talking about the freedom and the importance of Capitalism  Then  someone in the crowd of workers will curse those people from telescreen  and everybody starts cursing them altogether  Winston realizes that this is stupid and worthless of doing  but he doesn t stop cursing because he knows that if he does then someone will notice  and turn him in the government                                                                        July 31  Even though 24hours ago Big Brother announced that they are going to lower the chocolate ration from 30grams to 20grams  they just announced that they are going to increase the chocolate ration to 20grams  People believe it  and cheer it  Nothing was better than before  Everything is getting worse and worse  but the government shows the stupid fake written graphs through the tele screen  and applauds the Big Brother Now he s back to the cafeteria at his work  The nasty food with strange evil taste disgusts Winston  but greasy coffee is worse  In this crowded and noisy cafeteria  Winston notices a girl who s been following him  Winston s now scared because she might be a though police  and he might be get caught  Syme noticed Winston keep looking at the girl  and tells him that he should ask her to go out with him Winston was writing on his diary about one night  when there was nobody else but him and a woman on a street  Of course this is a crime  but she told him that he can buy her only for 2 dollars  He wanted to do it because he had never had sex before  and he thought it was a shame  Then Winston thought about her ex wife Katherine who he was married at the night of temptation  She had no desire of sex even though that s why they got married  Every night Winston tried to lay on with her she would refuse  Well actually she didn t want to do it nor did she want to do it  That s why he never could have had sex with her  Finally  the government split them up Winston went to the bed with the woman he found on the street  He turned the lamp on  and she was at least 50 years old  He did her anyway On his diary he criticizes about the capitalism  How they have sex all the time  They party all the time  Especially how they live a horrible life  He knew of course most of them must be lie  but he couldn t tell  I m really not sure where to begin with my thoughts on 1984  I know I loved it to the extent that it s very nearly on the verge of booting Neil Gaiman s American Gods out of my Top 5 Books of All Time list  I know I m sad I hadn t read it long before now  and I know I don t want to go into too great of detail for fear of spoiling it for anyone that hasn t read it It s difficult to call the book perfect because there are definitely times when it drags and it feels like Orwell is trying harder to share his thoughts and philosophies on a mishmash of government systems than he is to tell a story  but at the same time all of those thoughts are incredibly apropos as much today as they were over 50 years ago when the book was first published  The longevity of this relevance makes the pause in storytelling seem necessary to forgive  The world he creates is so real and so filled with allusion that it s unparalleled to anything I ve ever read with a similar purpose Since the ending is one of the best I ve ever read  I m scared to talk in too great of detail because I d hate to give anything away at all  I ll just say I think it s a book everyone should read  Maybe once Laura reads it I ll go into more detail  George Orwell s classic was incredibly visionary  It is hardly fathomable that this book was written in 1948  Things that we take for granted today   cameras everywhere we go  phones being tapped  bodies being scanned for weapons remotely   all of these things were described in graphic detail in Orwell s book Now that we have the Internet and people spying on other people w  webcams and people purposely setting up their own webcams to let others  anonymously  watch them  you can see how this culture can develop into the Orwellian future described in  1984   If you ve heard such phrases as  Big Brother    Newspeak   and  thought crime  and wondered where these phrases came from  they came from this incredible  vivid and disturbing book Winston Smith  the main character of the book is a vibrant  thinking man hiding within the plain mindless behavior he has to go through each day to not be considered a thought criminal  Everything is politically correct  children defy their parents  and are encouraged by the government to do so  and everyone pays constant allegiance to  Big Brother    the government that watches everyone and knows what everyone is doing at all times   watching you shower  watching you having sex  watching you eat  watching you go to the bathroom and ultimately watching you die  This is a must read for everyone  This book doesn t need an introduction but for those who don t know  this is pretty much one of the most important novels of the present days  I like to read about military history  science fiction  and post apocalyptic  1984 was one of the best of those genres I have read in a long time Winston was the main character  He works for the Ministry of Truth  Since he s living in a totalitarian government  his job is to rewrite the history of the state  As the book progresses he starts to question the way of life living under Big Brother  But he has to be careful because the government has tv s that can receive  as well as transmit The setting is the year 1984  After World War II  three superstates were formed  The US annexed Great Britain and became Oceania  which is the largest of the superstates  The Soviet Union invaded the rest of Europe and formed Eurasia  The third superstate is Eastasia  which is made up of China  Japan  Korea  and Indochina  Throughout the book  the superstates are constantly at war with each other  execpt each state is so powerful  that none of them can be defeated The author George Orwell was sure that after World War II  Great Britain would turn into a dictatorship  So basically  this story is like his diary  telling his opinions on  the world of tomorrow    Hacer la resena de este libro va a ser realmente dificil  siendo mi libro favorito Las cosas distopicas me emocionan Este libro habla de las prisiones que nos imponen desde que nacimos  De las ataduras que no nos podemos sacar  De como la gente con poder no nos quiere dejar pensar Imaginate en un mundo donde casi no hay nada para comer  hay camaras en tu casa  y tienes que modificar los libros y periodicos para contarle mentiras a la gente contra tu voluntad  No puedes pensar lo que quieras  porque el gobierno te encarcelara  No puedes amar a nadie  ni tener sentimientos  Esto  es lo que se vive en 1984Winston Smith  el protagonista  se parece en cierta forma a mi  Abre los ojos y deja de hacer lo que la sociedad espera y te ordena  Es un rebelde de pensamiento  Quiere ser libre  pensar tranquilamente  Porque sabe que no lo es  porque sabe que metaforicamente  esta en una prision  y literalmente en cierta forma tambien Todo en el libro es macabro y friamente calculado Este libro me ha hecho llorar de pena y alegria  me ha hecho ponerme en el lugar del desdichado Winston  Me he sentido en Oceania  No exagero al calificar este libro como obra maestra  o el mejor libro que me he leido  y eso es decir mucho Obra preciosa  desesperanzadora  triste y llena de esperanza a la vez Exquisitez para los sentidos Me arrepiento de haberla leido  porque creo ahora nunca leere algo mejor  Tienen que leerlo  This book is pure art The principles in this book left me reeling and on more than one occasion I had to put it down  stare at a wall and contemplate life It s not what I was expecting at all  to be perfectly honest I don t know what I was expecting but it s far more intense then I could have hoped for  This isn t light reading  It took me longer than usual to finish this one  not because I found it boring  on the contrary it was mentally stimulating  so much so that I had to take breaks to process what I d read At first it seems like another dystopian future novel    Oh how wrong I was  I literally believed it would be a simple overthrow the evil government and get the girl novel so I was shocked at the end I promise no spoilers but this book is far more than I originally thought it would be  If I m honest I didn t particularly like Winston to begin with  what startled me was that even though I was sure I didn t like him I was able to relate to him and sympathise his situation  which is not what I intended at all  I also thought I didn t like the Party  Big Brother and the whole idea of Oceania s social structure  I was again shocked that their twisted policies actually made sickening sense  This book is something I believe everyone should read  not just because it is a fantastic book but simply because it contains ideals that we can all learn from   Truly a masterpiece  I can t envisage a dystopian novel that could be better than this What if you were impelled to live in a society where every act of yours is watched  Even your face can t afford to betray your feelings   Thought Police  is there to scrutinize each your facial expression every moment  and you are evaporated on the basis of a crime that was not even committed  was merely thought  Your children are trained to conduct espionage in their own home  and parents are brainwashed so much as to feel pride in it  A society where only one kind of love exists  love towards  Big Brother   A society where two plus two may be anything  I can t imagine a more horrible society than this    a scary and complex dystopian world It is one of those books that everyone should read at least once  I recommend it to everyone  dlyl lHkwmt lmstbdh f  lt ml m  lsh wbtHdth n shy t  n lqhr  w  n ldhl wlhwn  tHdth  n l kh lkbyr ldh  yrqbn jmy    n lst bd f  zmn lHryh   n tzyyf l qwl

a print out into a database  and i remember thinking  I am Winston Smith  even though that s not what he did for a living   In order to read this masterpiece  you need to appreciate the history behind it  In 1917  civil war broke out in Russia and eventually the Bolsheviks gained power  By 1921  their Communist party was established  though its leader  Lenin  died  leaving two candidates  Trotsky and Stalin  Stalin was the underdog  only the General Secretary  but by 1926 he removed all former members of the government  his position as secretary allowed him to move his friends to influential positions   created trials to dismiss men with power and exiled Trotsky  who would later be described as a  Capitalist spy  in history books  Stalin soon found himself in a position of power and the secret police and the cult of his image allowed him full control  which also spread a feeling of fear and uncertainty throughout the USSR  No one knew who to trust  no one knew what to do  Some people were tortured beyond pain imaginable and begged for the end to come  others were sent to concentration camps in Siberia  forced to work under harsh winter conditions and then left to die  At times  a person had committed no crime but was arrested nonetheless in order to fulfill a certain quota  Because of this  Stalin is responsible for 60 million deaths  To illustrate this point  there is an anecdote in which Stalin meets with a leader of an African nation and this leader asks   How many people did you have to kill in order to establish your rule   Stalin tells him and this leader is astonished because it s more than the number of people who live in his country However  before 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell and the secrets of the USSR were exposed  no one was aware of the chilling and inhumane acts that were committed  For instance  in 1980  when a book entitled Archipelago Gulag was published  describing the violence present within the nation and its concentration camps  there was much skepticism  After all  many socialists from Western European countries viewed the USSR as a country with the ideal government  Not much had changed since 1949 when Orwell  frustrated by his socialist acquaintances who dreamt of living in the USSR  wrote 1984 as a response  It was a perfectly haunting   and very real   description of the Communist states back then  and still is now Reviewed for A Drop of Romeo George Orwell in his signature style builds a society around things we take for granted in our everyday life  Things like our perception of reality  He rightly establishes that reality is but a figment of our mind and it is altered everyday by the largest hegemonic powers of the world today  He underscores our responsibility to open our eyes and break the culture of internalization of morally bankrupt ideas  My favorite passage was    The birds sang  the proles sang  the Party did not sing  All round the world  in London and in New York  in Africa and in Brazil  in the mysterious  forbidden lands beyond the frontiers  in the streets of Paris and Berlin  in the endless Russian plains  in the bazaars of China and Japan  stood the same unconquerable figure  made monstrous by work and childbirth  toiling from birth to death and still singing  Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come  You were the dead  Theirs was the future  But you could share in the future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive their body  and passed on the secret doctrine that two and two make four   Finalmente mi sono deciso a seguire Winston Smith all interno di questo incubo che non lascia scampo all uomo  immaginato quasi 70 anni fa da Orwell  Il Grande Fratello osserva tutto  e dentro ogni casa  stabilisce cosa devi pensare e dire  riscrive il passato a proprio piacimento e fa scomparire chiunque abbia un dubbio o un accenno di dissenso contro il Partito    1984  oltre a entrare di diritto nella mia top5  e il posto dove andare a guardare quando osserviamo il mondo e pensiamo che le cose peggio di cosi non potrebbero andare   This book is so captivating and intriguing  It is quite eery how this novel was meant to predict a distopian society for 1984  and how our society today has a shocking number of similarities with the corrupt system of government in 1984   Originally Posted at Majoring in Literature Tragedy  he perceived  belonged to the ancient time  to a time when there were still privacy  love  and friendship     His  mother  had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable  Such things  he saw  could not happen today   Part One  Chapter III Almost everybody knows that chilling phrase   Big Brother is watching you   At some uncertain age  we all inevitably grasp the significance of those words  even if we have never read the book which gave birth to it  What s more  the phrase seems even more apt today than it was when the book was first published  Though the year 1984 has long passed us by  Orwell s novel is still hugely relevant to its readers  I d long been familiar with the phrase  Big Brother is watching you   I understood it  I used it in conversation  I thought it expressed something about the digital age in which we were living  the age of cameras in supermarkets and personalised advertisements in the mail  What I didn t fully grasp was  of course  its origins  This led me to seek out Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four  to try and get to grips with why the words  Big Brother  send such a chill through the spine   In Orwell s novel  set in England in  yes  you ve guessed it  1984  the country is controlled by The Party  Also known as Ingsoc  or English Socialists   the Party monitors their citizens constantly  observing the way they work  act  and even think  Of course  the implications of this scenario are disturbing enough  But what s more  the Party s ministries are giant propaganda machines  constantly re writing history in order to ensure that the Party appears all knowing  The main character of the novel  Winston Smith  works in one such ministry  He spends his days re writing newspaper articles and speeches  manipulating truth and history for the benefit of Ingsoc  As with most dystopian novels  the plot centres around Winston s dissent against the party  and eventually his desire to be a part of the shadowy Brotherhood  which is determined to destroy the Party  Winston first has an illicit affair with another Ministry worker  called Julia  She  too  dreams of bringing down the system  She works in the fiction department of the Ministry  where she is a mechanic responsible for repairing the machines which write books  Which made me think about  If on a Winter s Night a Traveller   where book writing and book reading machines are also a reality  It was just one of the disturbing scenarios which inform this book  view spoiler  So far  so good  The plot feels familiar to me  something I have read and seen in countless books and films  But then it takes a strange turn  I won t say more  lest I spoil the ending  but it is not the happy  life affirming conclusion we have come to expect from our dystopic books  It is bleak and dark  and I found it disturbing even as I found myself liking it    hide spoiler  When this book was first released in 1949  many people were quick to draw parallels with Stalinist Russia  The Thought Police  the propaganda  the moustachioed image of Big Brother  it certainly doesn t take a whole lot of imagination to make the link  I m sure that many of the book s initial readers were only too happy to look no further than a denunciation of socialism  But there is a clear criticism of European and American practices as much as of Russian  And Orwell s examination is still very pertinent today  when we are daily bombarded with so many different versions of truth on the internet  or consider  for instance  a recent ruling in a European court that ordered Google to delete links to some personal information about an individual  which led to the company being flooded by requests from criminals to remove information of their past crimes   This particular quote is quite telling   Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards  Part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance   Part Three  Chapter IX   Naturally  the reader wonders what has happened to Ingsoc  does someone eventually overthrow it  Or does the Party s dream of total and everlasting power eventuate   view spoiler  Orwell certainly concludes the novel in a way that seems to suggest that  at least for the moment  the Party is all powerful  Strangely  though  at the end of the book is an appendix with an essay about Newspeak  the  language  Ingsoc has invented to stamp out  thoughtcrime   The reader is invited to turn to this appendix at an earlier point in the book  but I decided to leave it until last  Interestingly  the article adopts a scholarly tone  speaking about Newspeak in the past tense  analysing it as though it is a part of history  in a manner similar to the conclusion of Margaret Atwood s The Handmaid s Tale  To me  this suggested that at some point  the Party was overthrown  or perhaps changed form  In either case  the fact that the article is written in regular English certainly implies that Newspeak failed  Possibly the Party failed as well Of course  in the end we can t be sure what happens  Rather than ending the book on a positive note  Orwell leaves us with a bleak ending which reminds readers how serious his vision of the future could be    hide spoiler  I m going to finish this review with a passage I found particularly disturbing  Winston is told to imagine the future as  a boot stamping down on a human face   In our world there will be no emotions except fear  rage  triumph  and self abasement  Everything else we shall destroy   everything     There will be no loyalty  except loyalty towards the Party  There will be no love  except the love of Big Brother    There will be no art  no literature  no science    There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness  There will be no curiosity  no enjoyment of the process of life     If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever   Part Three  Chapter III  Rating  4 5 Stars Apart from the very real fear of accidentally stumbling across the reality TV show while channel surfing  of course  My heart started pounding for the start  the thought of being constantly watched still terrifying to me  even if its borderline our current reality  This book is so well written I was hooked with the first sentence  This book embodies the creepiness of having you re entire life controlled  From the disturbing telescreens to the horror of two mintues of hate  you will be transferred into a world where fear and hope are entangled into one  A place where public hanging are a popular event with children and even your own thoughts aren t safe  Where war is literally a laughing matter and ongoing  History is unreliable snd changing always to the party s liking  Papers altered for the sake of Big Brother to seem all knowing  all wise and always right  Doublethink  A world filled with contrary  conflicting and potentially thoughts that could get you labled a thought crimnal and killed  Once killed for this crime  or one such like it  despite the lack of laws might I add  you are erased and your existence never happened  Facecrime  thoughtcrime  you were told to be a mindless droid  and to love it  If that s not horrifying enough for you  and you so happen to be a lover of words  well Newspeak and all the tall of how its created will horrify you  This brilliantly written story will horrify you and the ending will leave you sadden   Hyn nrGm  l  lstslm wlkhnw  rGm  n lkn   tqd  n

seated in the back of my high school trigonometry class  Inconsolable  I gazed over the last five words   completely devastated   and sobbed uncontrollably In the ten or more times I have reread it since  I was no less shocked and shattered by the book s conclusion  Ostensibly a cautionary tale about a midlevel bureaucrat assigned to help reduce the number of words in the dictionary   1984  is the tragic story of Winston Smith  a freethinking  middle aged man  who through glimmers of a childhood memories and clandestine visits to  prole  neighborhoods  newspeak for poor   radically tries to reconcile life in a totalitarian nanny state With the omnipresent hum of the tele screen always present  Winston is the perfect party patsy  saluting the authorities and seething with anger at the daily  two minutes hate  that secretly leave our hero wondering who is the Emmanuel M  Goldstein  the object of the government s loathing When despite medical problems too gruesome to recount and enough secret spies to fill a Le Carre novel  Winston Smith conjures up enough optimism to pursue a romantic relationship with Julia   1984  takes on a frightening turn  A devoted  or maybe not   member of the Junior Anti Sex League  whose signature emblem is the form fitting sash that hugs seductively around her waistline  Julia is perhaps not the refuge Winston seeks  Or is she Without destroying the truly devastating ending  I would wholeheartedly recommend 1984 to anyone who is interested in politics  language  romance and government Yes  you may be left devastated by the book s last five words  but you will certainly be left with more to think about than drying your tears    Regina McMenamin  A classic masterpiece by Orwell  A must read for anyone who is anyone   1984 takes place in the land of Oceania  London  England  in the year 1984  Author George Orwell  writing the novel in 1949  perceived that in 1984 England could be a similar to the world of Oceania  where privacy no longer exists  the rich  or the Party  rule everything  the citizens starve and must conform to contradictory concepts such as Newspeak and Doublethink  and most importantly  Big Brother is always watching  The protagonist  Winston  bored with his life  secretly hating the Party  rebels both physically and mentally  and discovers the true wicked core principles of his society  struggling to maintain his sanity while Oceania s government works endlessly to make him  and every other citizen of Oceania  lose it  The novel is written in third person limited point of view  giving the novel a level of detachment  which reflects the detached relationships of Oceania s citizens  and Orwell writes concise and direct  mimicking the bleak lives of Oceania s citizens  His descriptions emphasize the dull atmosphere of their world  and he characterizes the characters by taking us into their thoughts  giving them symbolic significance  making important characters appear later in the novel  displaying much of their dialogue  and emphasizing their lack of intimacy with each other and how the Party affects them individually as well as as a whole  The novel includes themes concerning the human need for connection  expression  and privacy  mental sanity  and the possible effects of totalitarianism and English Socialism  that are displayed through the characters  actions and their final situations  The novel has a high level of literary merit  for it thoroughly presents what a society of totalitarianism could lead to  and it uses literary techniques to embed important messages in readers  minds that can apply to the future   I thoroughly enjoyed George Orwell s haunting novel  1984  Orwell perfectly executed the purpose of this tale  The complete control of a totalitarian government is enough to shock any reader  Orwell s grim tone is evident through out the book  His language is solemn to match the heavy content of the novel  Although this is not a  enjoyable  read  it is though provoking and intriguing  Orwell skillfully crafted one of every free citizens  greatest fear  the complete loss of identity  In this world every lower class citizen is identical and they are rule by the few higher political member of The Party  Nobody is free  There are telescreens in every room that monitor behavior  a mandatory  Physical Jerk  in the morning  and a planned out life that is identical to everyone else  It was illegal to keep past notes or photographs so The Party can convince the citizens of anything they want to be true  There was an instance in the book when during a rally the Party switches its enemy half way through  The speaker must change his speech and everyone takes this in stride  They are even embraced for having the wrong signs  Orwell depicts a country that is everyone worst nightmare  This is enough to shock anyone into rejection a communist or totalitarian regime  I don t think I ve ever given a rating of 5 to any book before I ll gladly do for this one just for this quote alone   Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   This book is amazing  I could not help but compare it to Brave New World by Alduos Huxley and I was so amazed by the way Orwell changed the point of view of the main character throughout the whole book  The ending was really surprising though  I guess to add one more review to the twenty five thousand of those will hardly change a thing except statistically but anyway    He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past  I used to live in this sort of dystopia since my birth till 1984 Now it is all right but The Ministry of Peace still keeps crying for war and atrocity  mdh   hl  tHdth  n lrwy  k ml  dby f tklm  n lHbk

for this Saturday s great books conference  we pre read books for that and I was assigned Brave New World to pre read  I can say this is far and away the better book Since I cannot make the conference I am about to write my observations  so spoiler alert  Nothing is illegal since there are no longer any lawsWinston has the idea to write in a diary to communicate with the future Daily there is two minutes of hate which is impossible not to participate in and Emmanuel goldstien is on the screen Women seem to swallow the slogans more OBrien says we shall meet in the place where ther is no darkness  but he actually means in tougher interrogation conditions DICTIONARY IS TO CUT WORDS DOWN     eventually thoughtcrime will be impossible because there will be no words to express it Orthodoxy means unconsciousness A lunatic might be a minority of one The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears  p71  That sums it up Goodthinkful if you are lucky you don t probe and youre naturally orthodox What is the importance of the poem about the church bells that keeps being repeated  He finally gets manifesto and says the best books are the ones that tell you what you wlready know  P 178  Unfortunately it wasn t the real story  there is no room for Winston in the party First and simplest stage in discipline is crimestop p 188 stopping short at the threshold of any dangerous thought The mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc no present statement can ever have been wrong Human equality has to be subverted for Big Brother to be all powerful and you cant just act like you believe  you have to believe  1984  by George Orwell might just be my favorite novel ever  It takes place in Great Britain  after a post atomic war  with a government that has total control over it s people  even their thoughts  The main character Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth in rewriting history  he is a part of the  Outer Party  who make up 13  of the population and are equivalent to our middle class  The reason I loved this book so much  as how oddly similar the world portrayed in this book and how our modern world our headed today  This book was really an eye opener and has left me with many questions that are impossible to answer  I would recommend this book to anyone  and guarantee you will love it  This is considered a literary masterpiece and rightly so The setting is the year 1984  A tyrannical dictatorship is in control of Great Britain  and the ordinary citizens of the country are being brainwashed into being party drones  Those who resist are dealt with mercilessly  We follow an ordinary man called Winston Smith  Ordinary  except for the fact that he has not fallen under the spell of the regime  and plans to remain free from their doctrines Because of the fact that the plot involves one man s struggle against oppression  it s an immensely human story  Through his eyes  we feel the horror he feels  the sadness for the loss of human liberty  and the yearning to break through it all and live a free and happier life  In short  George Orwell takes the reader directly to this fictional London in 1984 Orwell introduces moments of dark humour  such as the continual appearance of Winston s next door neighbour  a bumbling  middle aged fool who is one of the   sheep   who lives to breathe the party s cheap slogans  and attends scout club table tennis playing sessions for his exercise But there are also other occurances that keep the story constantly interesting  such as people being   erased   from existence  and Winston s job at the records office  where his daily duties include falsifying records to meet the party requirements The main course of the plot though is of course what happens to Winston  and I was gripped and excited at his inevitable and gloomy plight The overriding message of the book is of course one of freedom  something that we must value and hold on to  and let no one take that away from us  This book is a stark warning against the evils of dictatorship and oppression  and that warning comes across loud and clear thanks to Orwell s fantastic clinical and to the point writing style  The father of all dystopian novels  1984 earned its place not only as a classic  but as a source of several phrases that have become a part of the English vernacular  While there are literally thousands of reviews  essays  papers  etc  that center around the political and social themes and lessons of the novel  I want to point out something from 1984 that truly stood out to me  Orwell has an amazing grasp of human psychology  While most people focus on the fact that the government  or Big Brother  controls the lives of its citizens  what amazed me about this book was how Big Brother controlled the citizenry  A scene from the book that always stood out to me was when there was a rally in support of the war being fought  In the middle of the rally  the presenter is given a message stating that the nation that they had been fighting was now their ally and that their former ally was now their enemy  The speaker changes what he was saying without skipping a beat  but he couldn t change the words on the posters and banners that were hanging there  Rather than questioning why things had suddenly changed  the citizens gathered for the rally looked at the posters and banners and decided that it was some sort of devious trick by their new enemy and began tearing them down  One has to wonder how a large group of people could be so completely brainwashed as to accept a lie that was proven wrong right in front of them  Orwell does a masterful job of showing exactly how it can be done  and it is truly a frightening and captivating reading If you have never read 1984  I consider it a  must read   If you have read it  read it again  So much within its pages will stick with you for a long time  Slow beginning  but good ending  open for interpretation  Read spring 1997

jdyd  I think what makes George Orwell novels very popular is that everybody can relate to it to some extend  And when it comes to totalitarian dictatorships  the connection becomes quite astonishing  prompting you to think that this book is nothing but a prophecy of your very own society   In the beginning I thought that the book was a depiction of the failed communist Russia just like animal farm  I mean it was obvious  big brother was Stalin and Goldstein must be Trotsky  But later I realized that wasn t the case  because the year was supposed to be 1984 among other clues  I have come to understand that this was Orwell s extrapolation of the state of affairs when he wrote the novel at 1949  Evidently  that prediction didn t turn out to be literally true and the world wasn t divided into 3 superstates  instead 2 rivaling camps with capitalism triumphing later on  What is important however is that the book essence proved to be true  In today s world notions such as  doubelthink  thought crime and newspeak are present with different names  even in the most liberal of societies  take the united states so called war on terrorism as example   On a personal level  I connected very well with the story  initially I thought of myself as an underground revolutionary thinker in a draconian society  just like Winston Smith  Later on  I found that I m better represented by the proles  I would better describe myself as an ideologically confused workman  lost in the mist of suffering with no clear objectives for change or liberation  Yet  I m glad that I m not a party member  After all Smith kept reiterating that the hope lies on the proles   Orwell would have made an excellent god  An amazing book whose resonance can be better appreciated in the modern times  hdhh lrwy  tHwl

and talked about it than read it  for it is a dreadfully dull book didactic  repetitious and all but motionless Isaac Asimov I have to agree  However  the way in which the book presents Stalinism  torture  language  and most of all an insight into the human condition  was the hook which caught me  This book left me wanting more  and thinking  the marks of great literature  Eric Blair wrapped his warning against big government up in an understandable Dystopian society  and everyone should unwrap it for themselves  In the novel George Orwell created a dystopian 1984 which is away from what that year turned out to be  But currently we are living in that future with no privacy as everything about you is known through the internet wether you like it or not  Big Brother as an icon is also becoming more and more realistic as media  specifically Egyptian  now demonise yesterday s heroes  The Revolutionaries  while they stand with yesterday s demons  They tend to change their opinions just to stay alive and increase their wealth and the public believe what they are told even when they no it is not logical  That brings me to another thing which people suffer from which is that they demonise you if you have an opinion other than their own even if they know you are right because what you are saying is logical which reminds me of thoughtcrime  In my opinion this great book is one of the best ever written although a change of title to  2014  would be more realistic perhaps  Brilliant  authors of science fiction novels always try to take controversial  politically issues and trends of the present and exaggerate to create a possible future for the reader to believe in but I ve never seen such a better novel  a society without basic civil liberties and a government with complete and unchallenged control  how possibly this novel can fit for any time for many nations  histories till this moment  this is just beyond perfection   1984  jwrj  wrwyl  Tlm knt  D  mshrw

on the takeover of individual lives by the all powerful  all watchful State   Es  sin duda alguna  mi libro preferido  Tanto la forma de escribir de Orwell  como la manera en la que va hilando la historia me parecen geniales  como cada cosa tiene su lugar y su sentido al final de la novela  y detalles que habias pasado completamente por alto son fundamentales despues La trama de la novela me parece excelente  la sociedad que recrea el autor me resulta terrorifica a la par que  alcanzable   en el sentido de que no me pareceria una locura llegar algun dia a algo parecido  aunque sea abominable   Tanto el control de la informacion como el  doble pensar  contribuyen a que no exista una memoria colectiva y puedan ser enganados facilmente  Me da la sensacion que no es mas que una version exagerada de nuestra propia realidad    y eso que fue escrito en 1948  Mas en http   coleccionandomarcapaginasatthi    Wow  Wow  Wow  I can t think of the last time a book left my jaw hanging open  I m not sure how I missed this in school  but what a piece of literature  Rather unexperienced in the genre of dystopian literature  I floored from the outset and plan to follow this rabbit trail with We  Zamyatin  I won t attempt anything about plot  plenty is already out there   Instead  I ll speak to Orwell s gift of an alternate reality so succinctly and beautifully crafted with literary ease  Orwell allows just enough light and shadow in 1984 for the reader to be swept up in Oceania as a reality  yet permitting questions and doubts about where true north lies  With masterful balance throughout  from description  to dialogue  thought and memory  Orwell shows a craft for storytelling that is hard matched  Writers tend to have a gift for person  place or plot  sometimes in pairs  but all three is something of a unicorn  In 1984  one realizes unicorns do indeed exist  5 stars for the audio experience Blackstone AudioRead by Simon Prebble I m in the state of self denial

reading this ideas and words I cannt call it a novel it s not a story It s much more    Every brain need this book to be stored in it specially in this world that we live in THANK YOU mister George  Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside your skull I first read 1984 in 1984  I would have been 14 or 15  but I remember it vividly  The smell of boiled cabbages in Winston s apartment building  hiding from the telescreen to write in his diary  Julia s sash  Winston and Julia watching a woman hang up clothes  and Room 101  I wanted to re read it to see if it would have a different effect on me and if my memories of it were accurate  I was surprised at how much of it I remembered  Reading it knowing the main twists and turns of the plot actually made me more aware of the foreshadowing in the book and made it that much more meaningful  There are a few parts that lag a bit and a few things that seemed somewhat contrived in order to teach the reader  But overall  I thought the writing was fantastic and the ideas the book threw at you were incredibly interesting  I was pulled into the story very quickly  which is always great The book is a psychological rollercoaster and it is an intense and amazing ride  LA GUERRE C EST LA PAIXLA LIBERTE C EST L ESCLAVAGEL IGNORANCE C EST LA FORCEOn ne devrait pas limiter le nombre d etoiles qu on peut attribuer  J ai pris tout mon temps avec ce livre  mais helas  toute bonne chose a une fin  Smith Winston  m a entraine dans ses tourmentes  ses souvenirs  ses doutes et ses certitudes  le ministere de l amour  la torture  la reeducation  l enfer quoi  1984 est un livte ecrit par un genie et un visionaire  c est un classique  qui traite des differents systemes politiques  qui expose des verites auquelles on n aurait pas songe  un veritable casse tete  Ce n est la que ma premiere impression car on ne peut le lire qu une seule fois  1984  ecrit en 1948 et ses idees nous honteront peut etre pour l eternite   Ils ne se revolteront que lorsqu ils seront devenus conscients    et ils ne pourront devenir conscients qu apres s etre revoltes  Sometimes I read classics and wonder what all the fuss is about  Not this time  I loved this book  I loved Orwell s writing  His scathing descriptions of people  society and flawed thinking sometimes made me laugh in the midst of very unlaughable scenarios and I would find myself reading them aloud to friends so they could appreciate it Those moments aside however  the story and the concepts are mind blowing and creepy  especially since some of the concepts are definitely reflected in today s society and politics     Un mundo de miedo  de racion y de tormento  un mundo de pisotear y ser pisoteado  un mundo que se hara cada dia mas despiadado   Si usted no ha leido este libro  no deje de perder el tiempo y pongase a eso  Genial  Eso y mucho  muchisimo mas  Este libro fue mucho con demasiado  No voy a decir que es uno de esos libros todo lindos de mucha alegria  pero es un libro que te hace pensar tanto que imagino que tu cerebro termina sudando como lo hizo el mio Sin dudas  es aplaudible la forma en que Orwell creo un mundo tan absolutamente distinto a partir de uno conocido y  luego de mostrarnos las colosales diferencias  nos demuestra las multiple similitudes  La verdadera critica del poder  de la segregacion de clases y todo lo que se relacione con ello El Partido logro hacer algo que  si no lo lees  puedes parecer casi imposible  crear una psicosis colectiva  hacer que todos percibieran la realidad de una manera distinta  suprimir el sentido comun y las ganas de pensar  Uno de esos libros de los cuales uno siempre escucha hablar y decir maravillas y que  cuando por fin experimentas de que se trata  to  eso le queda corto  Orwell is a master  This book is not something you read lightly   it is such a cautionary tale and I m mad at the entertainment industry for taking his concept of Big Brother and making a mediocre show out of it  What he has in mind is not something you make fun of  Big Brother is not a person but a concept  a multitude of eyes and minds constantly controlling you  observing and censuring your every move  every thought  From external control the concept slowly but surely upgrades to internal control that is subconscious in time  Isn t this terrifying  1984 is a superb and chilling portrayal of a totalitarian world  Everything  and I mean everything  is controlled by the government  There are cogs in place in this bureaucracy for every human instinct   love  freedom  friendship  They grind you down until you go mad and embrace the tyranny wholeheartedly  There is no escape from the all seeing eye of the government  If you believe for a moment that you are free  you are deceiving yourself  Children are used to spy on and betray parents  They are terrifying little monsters that are brainwashed form infancy to be completely loyal to the big idea of the state  No actual independent thought passes their minds since they are drunk on the power they now wield over parents and adults who used to control their behaviour or command them  Ugh    no please It was such a horror to read this book and to imagine being stuck in such a system  Of course  today s world is almost as crazy as the one described here  Don t believe me  Just watch a few good and reputable documentaries regarding the big industries   whether it is the sugar content in our food  the drugs you take  the censorship of the media  or anything else and you ll see that freedom of speech  the right to know if what you re eating may harm your health  is a damn fragile thing and under constant pressure from the big money  Deceptions abound  just think of the latest big case   the Volkswagen scandal  Thankfully  while our world may hush things up  eventually things come to light  even if it is too late for some people  In 1984 there is no escape and people who know the truth choose to embrace their privileges and leave the rest of humanity in the dust  So much for altruism and humanitarian impulses   History in particular is subject to continuous re explanations in 1984  not that people haven t tried with the Holocaust and Evolution in our societies  The suffering of Roma during the Nazi occupation of Europe was almost forgotten and only now we get to hear some of the horrendous accounts  1984 explains in details why history is important  why facts and literacy matter  We follow the life of one bureaucrat in charge of editing history   in particular newspapers from the past  What eventually happens to him is just heartbreaking  Read it when you re in the mood for the book  It demands some nerves of steel  SPOILER ALERT  D Review of 1984  1984 by George Orwell  is a story that shows how much the world can become cruel if one dominates the whole country  with unbearable consequence and betrayals slammed to whom wonder too deeply into the society  This book may be fiction but in someway it still has the open chance that in future this book may become a reality  While reading this book  it kept of reminding me of Adolf Hitlers actions  once the most famous totalitarian utopia of domination across nearly the entire Europe  Only this time  in the novel it was a complete totalitarian country  Total grasp on love  desire  and privacy  Torture for the questioning people and prize to the ones who follow blindly  George Orwell did the perfect job to make readers clench their hearts and be relieved living under a society that provides the least freedom for themselves  Though out the story I could sort many different messages Orwell was trying to continuously slam the readers   The danger of control and dominations that can easily become the destruction of our own self awareness and ideology eventually to the whole humanity  He slowly introduces the plot of the story and drags readers to become the protagonist  immediately hammering how wrong the situation was in the book and unlocking hints of the message  Rebellions always tend to happen if people cannot bare the system  This book may explain why there were no rebellions during the dominations of the Natzi As said earlier my favorite parts were when the author astonishingly describes many ways to mind wash and if necessary  break a person in all ways possible  The protagonist named Winston  had attributes to question and defy his daily life out of the eyes of big brother  This book will explain why and how a rebellious man can transform into a loyal subject of Big Brother  Readers will try to resist the situation given and submit before the story line until they finally admit that the reality that we are living in is a blessed situation  Here are some of the quotes that explain this book  The 3 slogans mentioned multiple times in the book will defy what you have learned till today  is crushed once you read this   WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  2   2   5 You may scratch your head if you see this  Of corse the answer is 4  Read and understand how pain can miserably betray your very own self   Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past  Introducing the ultimate way to control the whole power  Look twice and realise the importance of learning history  After reading this book  I give this a 5 out of 5  Any young adult   who wants to know what will happen if one becomes dominate  how the desire of power make this world cruel would be recommended to read this book  Noting that there are minor physical and mental tortures contained  First read this in  the actual year  1984  Required reading at my high school  It is gloomy and depressing but I never forgot it  and as I got older  I could see so many freakish similarities to our current way of life  I remember thinking  No way  when reading about Big Brother and the telescreens  wall screens that interacted with you and watched every move you made   Um  has anyone noticed that with everything from security cameras on the street  everyone with cameras on their phones  the Patriot Act  Xbox Live  Comcast  hulu  Netflix  etc  keeping track of everything we purchase  watch  how we spend our time  etc   WE HAVE NO PRIVACY  Shoot  even our grocery stores keep track of every single thing we buy  Facebook keeps track of every keystroke and sells it to other companies so they can market their wares to us  Not to be an alarmist but to an extent we are living it  people      This is a definite must read for everyone  And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed if all records told the same tale then the lie passed into history and became truth   Who controls the past  ran the Party slogan   controls the future  who controls the present controls the past     George Orwell  1984  Chapter 3 I don t even know how to describe this book  It is the kind of book which has the power to rip your heart out of your chest while your mind tries to deny what has just happened     I still have a hard time accepting the end of this book  George Orwell managed to portray the totalitarian regime in such a realistic way that when I reached the end of the book I could not and did not want to accept the conclusion  It was too harsh for my poor little soul   and   well  this is exactly what this book is about   Orwell s book addresses problems like the definition of human nature  of hope  of death  power and more than anything else  freedom   He also emphasizes the importance of words in expressing our thoughts and how language can affect our way of thinking  It s an overwhelmingly good book    It s that kind of book you can read a thousand times  even though you never re read books  because there s so much meaning in every single well chosen word and so many things to discover on every single little page P S  You know a book is really depressing when you would have been extremely happy if the main characters would ve just died P S S  This review doesn t even cover 1  of that book SO GO READ IT IT S AMAZING TRUST ME P S S S I AM REALLY SERIOUS mr b  n fhmthskhyf  lw lm tfhmlyst rwy      h  srd w tmthyl lrw

no sistema de ensino  O ministerio decide o que o jovem deve ou nao deve ler  Esta e talvez uma das razoes para o generalizado desinteresse pela literatura Apos ter lido  1984   abri uma excecao a minha filosofia  Ler esta obra revela se importante  Com  1984   George Orwell nao se limita meramente a narrar uma historia ficcional  Lanca um desafio ao leitor  fazendo o questionar a sua propria realidade   E esta caracteristica que provavelmente o distingue dos demais  E este facto que o torna universal   Em  1984   escreve com uma prosa limpida  clara e humana  No entanto  nao se esmera pela descricao iconica  pela insurgencia de imagens  Na verdade  o texto  ensaista  e o forte do escritor Ao contrario de outros contadores de historias  o britanico gosta de focar se na enumeracao dos factos e dos argumentos a favor e contra a sua tese   O tema do romance e o totalitarismo e todas as suas consequencias quando aplicado numa sociedade  Mas reduzi lo a isto pode assasinar o proposito para o qual foi escrito  No fundo  o ponto preponderante da obra tende a ser a sua componente racional  Esta engloba uma amalgama de assuntos que vao desde o confronto dos varios ideiais politicos a critica exacerbada do comunismo   A razao pela qual apoio a leitura obrigatoria desta obra incontornavel da literatura e apenas uma  Ao le la  e acima de tudo ao compreende la  o jovem

watching you  reminds me of the reality show full of tasks and rewards that turns ordinary folks into instant celebrities coming out of the house way back in the day It took me awhile to get into it  I m really grateful I got hold of the audiobook This is such a classic it s really good and I love how it somewhat reflects what s happening nowadays or so we don t really know unaware of  no power to us being such a drone   it scares me  truly very enlightening  WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me These two statements were the phrases that stung me as I closed the book after finishing it in two days  Quite honestly  I was not very certain as to what I should have be feeling  A mixture of wanderlust  inspiration  disgust  happiness  laughter and even horror engulfed my mind over the course of the novel   The metaphysical and political aspects of the book are it s strong points however highlighting it s horrifying yet prodigious mechanical utopian ideals  The attention to details in this dystopian novel clearly presents itself through the author s the construction of language  culture   modern war   economy and structure  Totalitarian belief through established systems is not only captured through the established protocol such as the  telescreen   but also the imposition of power through psychologicaly degrading means  Considering these factors  this book is absolutely brilliant  It definitely deserves the reputation it is given    1984  is a dystopian novel written by George Orwell in 1948  and follows Winston Smith  a man who lives in the country of  Airstrip One   the bombed out and destabilized remains of Britain under the control of Oceania  one of the three world superpowers that controls its citizens through propaganda and threats of execution for opposing them  Smith despises Oceania  which uses the symbol of a man called  Big Brother  as warning to its complete watch over the population s actions  and wanders through his life aimlessly until meeting Julia  a woman who reveals to him that she is a member of the resistance to Big Brother and Oceania  and recruits him to their fight  The plot is interesting due to an almost complete lack of conflict  with only Winston s tirades against Big Brother and the omnipotent security watching every citizen as the major actions  and strives to show an oppressive society from a civilian point of view   1984  is a mix of the influences of the political climate at the time and dystopian themes  providing a look into the tension between all nations after World War II has ended and the Cold War has begun after  and how it is expressed in the novel  Like  Animal Farm   Orwell s book is his take on the political situation at the time of writing and his views of the world itself   1984  is written in a stunted  daydreaming  and half focused style  with obscure metaphors and references to the history leading up to the events of it  providing a mix of first and third person as the world is examined through Winston s eyes  Events are frequently interrupted by reflections of Smith s memories  violent scenarios he plays through his head  and his opinions on Big Brother and Oceania  showing how emotionally arrested he and all other characters are in the oppressive society of the book  The history in the book s universe is extremely deep and well written  with an almost complete compilation of the events leading to Smith s situation and the forming of Big Brother hidden inside the text  After the first third of the book  however  the plot falters with a flat middle that has almost no major events  and only regains its footing during the final parts  which provides an unflinching look into the effects of propaganda and brainwashing on people  and leaves the story off with a bleak ending on the reality of society  war  and people   1984  laid ground for all future dystopian works  and remains an excellent literary work to this day  showcasing both excellent writing and setting that puts the reader into city of London and under the rule of Big Brother with complete believability   Potential  vague spoilers Originally published in the 1940s  I think 1984 highlights some of the political feelings of that time period  and especially how emerging technologies could be misused in the future  Even in the present day  the book  set in a  future  30 years ago  is still politically relevant  maybe more so now because of the rate of technological expansion and the plethora of new smart technologies coming on to the market and being made commercially available  We basically live our lives online at the moment  with tumblr and facebook and twitter and youtube  to name a few of the popular social medias  It isn t a stretch to think that these technologies  along with computers and smart phones  could eventually be turned back around to control us  instead of being used to document our lives  These technologies are becoming so ingrained in our day to day lives that it wouldn t be impossible for some overreaching political party or leader to attempt to turn that on the general population  And so  a book from sixty years ago  set thirty years in the past  is still hugely relevant today The world in which Winston Smith lives in is terrifying  and relevant  All dystopian futures have a hold in the present climate  and 1984 is no different  We can imagine ourselves in Oceania  after some terrible events  We sympathise with Winston s predicament  and his beliefs and values  We root for him  we want him to win  Winston isn t an overly special character  there isn t anything about him to endear him to us  He isn t young  he isn t attractive  he isn t strong  he isn t weak  he doesn t find strength  he doesn t  save the world   he isn t anything like the popular heroes and heroines of today s dystopian novels  think the popular trope of YA heroines  like Katniss or Tris  who lead big  life changing adventures to bring down their societies   Maybe the fact that he is unsuccessful is what is important about 1984  He tries  and he fails  and ultimately  he could be any one of us  and he is interchangeable  he could be any of his comrades  and likely is  The writing is engaging  the society is amazingly complex  and the plot line draws you in  and the twist hooks you  if you weren t already hooked  You may be disappointed in the ending  you may not  but regardless  the ending is important  And let s face it  stories aren t always supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy  Bad things happen in life  bad things can certainly happen in awful  dystopian futures  And maybe Winston is an underrated character  with nothing special about him  but characters don t have to be strong and amazing to be great literary characters  I m a little sad at the moment actually  because I never read books like this in high school  so I never analysed a book like this at school  and 1984 would be a great book to study  1984 is definitely a book that everybody should  at least try to  read   I personally like to think of 1984 as a love story   a tragic  hopeless  pitiful love story between a man who dimly remembers a better time and a girl who could have never envisioned another  Doomed to fail  doomed for death  and indeed  doomed to have their very humanity stripped away  these two are sentenced to damnation for the crime of being who they know they are   human beings The book  for those who have not yet enjoyed it  is not a difficult read  The plot moves swiftly  leading the reader through the contrasts of daily life as a member of the Party  the wilderness where he has his tryst with Julia  the apparent  and short lived   freedom  of their rented room  and it s agonizing  disturbing conclusion   If you want a vision of the future   Orwell writes   imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever   While many have used varied and assorted descriptions for this work  most all of them accurate in various ways  it s a love story  A sad and depressing love story  a love story which takes place in the worst of times  without hope or sanity  where there is no happy ending and the ultimate fate they fear is guaranteed  You will close the book knowing there must be thousands of such love stories  all ending the same way  and you will wonder why man is the monster he truly is  Gece olmasaydi gunduz diye bir kavram olur muydu  Karsilastirabileceginiz bir gecmis ve bir referans noktaniz yoksa bugunu nasil

Parti  Tout individu doit veritablement aimer le pere supreme du Parti BIG BROTHER  chose que Winston Smith n a pas pu l accepter Winston croise Julia lors des deux minutes de la haine  un rituel

hoewel pas een jaar of drie geleden voor het eerst gelezen  Vreemd eigenlijk  want Animal Farm vond ik ook al geweldig en toen was ik zestien of zo  Ik denk dat het kwam omdat Big Brother zo n bekende term is geworden  dat ik het idee had het verhaal inmiddels wel te kennen  Toen ik dit boek las was ik met een grote groep vrienden op vakantie en desondanks kon ik echt niet wachten om steeds weer een paar bladzijden te lezen tussen de tripjes  maaltijden en stapavonden door  Dat had ik lang niet gehad  Wat een schitterend en knap boek  tot in de puntjes doordacht met bijvoorbeeld het hele nieuwe woordenboek achterin  Aanrader voor als je 1984 nog niet hebt gelezen  lees meteen erna Mao van Jung Chang  dan zie je hoe profetisch dit boek was en hoe dicht Mao is gekomen bij de verwezenlijking van Orwells schrikbeeld  itu perumpaalum ennntu nnnprkllinnn vttttttil pttikkppttaat puttkmaak irunttu  aannnaal aarvellinnn  ANIMAL FARM  eerrpttuttiy aarvttaal itai pttikk neernttu

utopia     it s a book that you can t put down  till you finish it    loved every piece of it and all the details are cleverly written    the final chapters were very intense but I wasn t satisfied with the ending  I was so naive that I expected a happier one   George Orwell was very pessimistic and I can t agree more    Avevo lasciato questo libro a meta qualche mese fa  l altro giorno  pero  ho deciso di riprenderlo e nel giro di pochi giorni l ho finito  L avevo lasciato dopo diversi capitoli perche  in quel periodo  non avevo voglia di ambientazioni inquietanti e spaventose  Adesso  pero  sono contenta di averlo finito   1984  e il ritratto di una societa soggiogata  priva d identita  controllata in ogni momento da telecamere e dallo sguardo glaciale del Grande Fratello  non quella merda condotta dalla Marcuzzi  un Grande Fratello serio   Orwell  scrivendo questo libro  si immaginava un 1984 fantascientifico e irrealistico  ma non poi cosi lontano dalla realta morale della societa dell 84 e di oggi  Almeno  io l ho intesa cosi  Una societa condizionata dai pensieri degli altri  dove ogni persona deve essere uguale alle altre e dove chi tenta di distinguersi viene riportato bruscamente a una realta composta da persone prive di identita propria  Non e forse   metaforicamente   cio che accade nella nostra societa  oggi  Involontariamente  tutti noi siamo Winston e Grande Fratello  Un libro da brividi che fa riflettere tanto   I read 1984 with a score of other classics before my literature exam  and found it to be one of my most favorites 1984 is the magnum opus  the holy grail  of the dystopian novel  Like with Animal Farm  which 1984 has many parallels with  George Orwell wrote the novel to make a political statement  and if you know the history behind it  the characters are apparently caricatures of real life figures The plot built slowly and the writing was relatively simple  with descriptive prose scattered throughout for emphasis  but the world building and characters were undoubtedly captivating  1984 tells of a world where independent thought  love  literature  and other beautiful things  are punishable by law  Big brother is always watching  Anyone who goes against him disappears  Traitors lurk around every corner and no one is good   not even the protagonists They are  however  products of their society  and reading about them going against everything they ve ever known  dread pervasive and perpetual  is fascinating  This isn t a story with a big  bombastic revolution  the way modern dystopia like The Hunger Games and Divergent are  but for all its subtleties  it s still very powerful  l bqry    jwrj  wrwyl  bhrny fy mzr   lHywnt Ht  nh rbm tkwn rwyt  lmfDl    qr th  kthr mn mr  w fy kl mr  tkhrj bjdyd lm tstbynh b

my khwndm      By lack of understanding  they remained sane  I decided to pick a brainfood for once  It is hard for us to get an overview of the society we live in when we are too close from it or worse  caged by it  George Orwell will help us get a different perspective and change our ways of thinking  1984 entails a modernized society where WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH London in 1984 was embraced by totalitarianism  where the ruler is a dictator  Who the dictator is   Big Brother  Does Big brother exists like I exist   You do not exist Winston Smith is a member of the party  He is aware of the flaws of his society  Big Brother was rejoiced by his Comrades  what they call their fellow party member   Big Brother was only seen in posters  a mere representation of the inner party  the face of dictatorship but instead of being hated  he was praised  The society is downright twisted that you will mutter why  Their best weapon is not a nuclear bomb or a gun that they can pin into someone who rebels  They found a way on how to cultivate someone s mind  Collective thinking  brain washing  People are brainwashed  histories are changed  statistics on the news are invented  tragedies has twisted facts  pretty much the same things we see on TV nowadays  Winston Smith found a partner  a confidant who also hates the party to guts  Her name is Julia  Julia was born after the revolution  She was taught that sexual intercourse should be plain  not passion driven  it is only a duty to their party  sole purpose  re population  But to Julia  sex is a political act Thought Crime Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows The psychological manipulation is brutal that they even believed 2 2 5  They have no freedom that even the things that are kept inside their head are bound as crime  A comrade has to believe to everything the party say  usually it is easy but to Winston Smith  The pattern is broken 1984 will boost the relativism in your mind  It is a timely book to read  You can relate the modernized society from Newspeak  a language where less is more  Doublethink  a new way of thinking like everything is an Irony or Metaphor  I gave into this  I have to agree to other reviews  the vibe is realistically creepy  That you can even relate some of his so called dystopian fiction to modern day reality   Nineteen Eighty Four  The most terrifying dystopia of them all Also posted at Fantasy Literature Along with Yevgeny Zamyatin s We  1924  and Aldous Huxley s Brave New World  1932   George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four  1949  is the one of the most powerful and important dystopian novels every written  and unquestionably a work of science fiction thanks to its depiction of a future totalitarian regime that controls every aspect of its citizen s mental and physical existence  It s hard to imagine any educated person in the English speaking world who hasn t heard the terms Big Brother  doublethink  thoughtcrime  and Newspeak  even if they re not sure exactly what they mean  It s also likely that many readers were exposed to the book in high school English or Humanities classes  which is a good time to read any important book  I d say this book has probably had a greater social and political impact than any other work of speculative fiction  Who  after reading it  could possibly see any merit whatsoever in a totalitarian government  even if it governs ostensibly for the good of its citizens  In terms of relevance to today s world  although the Communist regime of the Soviet Union officially dissolved in 1991  a victim of its own incompetent centrally planned economic policies and a draining nuclear arms race with the US  there are still totalitarian regimes that control  brainwash  and starve their citizens  devoting all their resources to their military  and thumbing their nose at the rest of the world  That s right  I m talking about that country that may or may not have launched a cyber attack on a major US film studio  and that routinely denies reality and keeps its citizens locked in its ideological clutches without mercy or humor  So the dystopian warning of Nineteen Eighty Four remains alive and well The story revolves around a minor party bureaucrat named Winston Smith  who spends his dreary days at the Ministry of Truth  in charge of propaganda  continuously revising and redacting historical documents to conform to the ever changing realities that the Party presents to the public  Whenever an undesirable people has been  vaporized  by the party  their very existence is expunged from all historical records  It takes a certain amount of skill to rewrite events to fit  reality   but he has some talent for it  One of the key events that he must reintroduce to the past is that Oceania  one of the three superstates that have carved up the world after a global conflict  has changed its enemy from Eurasia to Eastasia  and all related documents must now reflect this  Moreover  thanks to the principle of  doublethink   loyal citizens are able to believe two contradictory things simultaneously without being disturbed  So anytime the Party announces a new enemy  and that the former enemy is now an ally   this new reality immediately trumps all previous information seamlessly  Then bureacrats like Winston revise the historical documents to reflect this  The other Ministries are the Ministry of Peace  which carries on Oceania s perpetual war with Eastasia and Eurasia   the Ministry of Plenty  which handles the rationing and shortages of food and supplies   and the Ministry of Love  a spy organization that identifies and eliminates any potential dissidents   The three principles that are written on the ministries  exteriors are WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  Again  thanks to  doublethink   these tenets make perfect sense to the Inner Party  the small elite who dictate policy   the Outer Party  a slightly larger group of bureacrats that execute policy   and the Proles  the remaining 85  who are kept in abject poverty and ignorance to prevent any disobedience or questioning  Again  is this not a perfect description of what we see in North Korea today The story progresses as Winston meets Julia  another party member working at the Ministry of Truth  and they begin an clandestine love affair  with both discovering a secret hatred of the oppressive Party  Later they are approached a member of the Inner Party  O Obrien who indicates he s a member of the underground group called the Brotherhood  dedicated to the downfall of the Party  He reveals the inner workings of the Party s propaganda machine and asks Winston and Julia to cooperate  Then the Thought Police get involved   I won t reveal what happens next  but being a dystopian warning to readers  I think you can guess that it doesn t end Happily Ever After  And if you ever thought that the idea of Big Brother was a bit far fetched  and that a populace could never be completely brainwashed by propaganda  then you haven t paid proper attention to our Dear Leader in Pyongyang   n Twl lrwyh

 thm tuqr  mn jdyd       Very interesting example of despotic society  Big brother is always watching  hence big brother ideal and reality  If the past doesn t agree with current  change the past and change the narrative  We have seem something like this currently and recently over and over  Who said this   I didn t set the red line  the world did   when we all remember who made big statements   RED line if Assad uses chemical weapons   Red line in Chief  Mister Twister    Those who control the past  control the future and those who control the future  control the present    1984  Control is the key word in this novel  but also in reality of such society of  everyone is or should be equal   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   Brilliant quote about proles  the lower element of society who are more concerned about petty items than their livelihood or their past  present or future  A Party slogan  proles and animals are free  from this novel is one of the major points that resonate with anyone who is consciously thinking about reality of this fiction  Depending how you measure freedom of course  Everything is relevant and all depends on how you measure freedoms  As this book portrays  but not too fore fetched  for those of us who have actually lived in society designed to break the human spirit  your individual thinking  it is how you make people perceive their reality  their past  present and their freedom  Perception is reality  so if you alter perception  you just changed the reality  I couldn t help by compare this book to  Brave New World  by Aldous Huxley  The differences are significant  but the underlining fact is the same  that you trade your individual perception of reality for actual freedom   Brave New World  is different in the sense that it portrays a society where everyone is conditioned to be happy  to enjoy what they have  what they do and how they do it  so there is no need for excessive measures and  tortures   but at the same time  it also portrays the reality of the human will to always think for him her self  One of the reasons the forced social justice  for  people s own good   for the  good of the society   could never work  The individual human spirit to have a free will  to love  to hate  to feel and to think  Perfect example is  Brave New World  in fiction  but fiction resembles reality  In  1984  it is a lot easier to see that the social justice of forced  torturous  education    conditioning  and police state  is the actual reality of any social justice forced society  Sure  one might say that it is a fiction  a fairy tale  a myth  but in actuality  except for a few items that technically didn t yet exist in the time of this book  the myth is the theory of  everyone is equal  society  Man are not created equally  not in the sense of having the same things  same life  same skills  same talent and same needs  Even if you pretend that everyone can and should be equal  those who pretend and force it  know perfectly well that they are not and never want to be themselves  As George Orwell phrased in his novel  Animal Farm    All animals are equal  but some are more equal than others   Ignorance is strength    1984  Brilliant   There is a great explanation on why and how it is so  Perfect example that the poor  even though promised everything and always given nothing  don t ever change their situation  no matter what some tell them and promise them  they just change their master  Lenin and Soviets through and after revolution proclaimed  Who was nothing  will be something   Something what  When you pretend that you will change your situation by relinquishing power to a group of those who work for  your better good   you better be sure that those whom are working in your favor have someone  some many  watching over them  because the spirit of humans not wanting to be  equal  is the same spirit of those who pretend that they can be  by taking more for themselves and making everyone else miserable   aka social justice   aka  1984  and all the societies which are  were and will be based on that  everyone equal  principle This is one great book  Dark  but great   I loved this book but  like every novel  it was not perfect  However  it is hard to criticize such a well known and appreciated book without coming off as seemingly ignorant or unread  so I won t attempt to delve into the flaws of George Orwell s  1984   I will say that it is a book that in my opinion  everyone should read   The novel describes life under a predicted totalitarian regime  where no actions go unnoticed  and privacy no longer exists  Through the eyes of protagonist Winston Smith  Orwell creates an incredibly realistic sense of oppression  which at times left me feeling frustrated and helpless  Each biting description adds to the novel s harsh setting of post  revolution  London  Yet within this bland  strict reality  our protagonist finds passion  a passion which is arguably the driving force for the last two sections of the book  In other reviews  readers have argued that the characters are flat and lack any real depth  but I think that our inability to read too much into each character is intentional  adding to the mystery and solitude each citizen of Oceania feels  All details aside  the book is a classic  and definitely a favorite of mine   The best books  are those that tell you what you know already    I stared at the screen of my computer and deliberated my star rating for a long time  I was caught between four stars and five  but I knew I had to choose one or the other  I decided that 1984 by George Orwell deserved five stars because of the complexity of the idea  how applicable it was to today  and how much it stretched my imagination  This was one of those books that I had to read in absolute silence or I wouldn t understand a single word I read  Once I was totally submerged in reading  I found that my mind was boggled by the different ideas presented in 1984  the idea that stuck out the most to me was the use of language  I believe that the theme of 1984 could be  whoever has control of language has the most power  In the story the government  also known as the Party  had one hundred percent control of the media and written language  The people believed everything the Party said  even if it was a complete lie or contradictory to something they had previously been told  We see the control of language in our lives today just as Orwell predicted  Media shapes our perspective by blowing things out of proportion and exaggerating  but people believe all of the stories anyway  I can only hope that our society never conforms to the use of language as a weapon of the government   ert  ert i z lieri cignia  romelic  bolo dros camikit xavs  An absolutely amazing book  It s one of those stories where you want to finish to know what happened  but not finish so you can keep reading it  Orwell wrote this book in 1949  If I was around and read it then  I wouldn t have appreciated it as much as I do now  because the warning he gives his readers are truer  One of my new favorites for sure  I have heard alot of great stuf about this book  a  must read and I must say  I am so NOT disappointed  I can t believe it s written in 1949 because you really can t tell It s a fictional world  maybe not so fictional if you think about it   Some elements in it is scarying similar to what could happen and has happened to places around the world  It s a world I would be terrified to live in  and the most scary thing is how well he describes it and as said you really wouldn t know it was written that long ago if you hadn t done your homework    It s about Winston Smith and his structured life in England 1984  but in this 1984 England belonged to one of the three big worldstates  Oceania  Where the government  The Party  rules through different ministries with an ironhand  And Bigbrother is the face of Oceania under whom everyone should obey Brainwaching is stadard and every day Winston and the others are taught that War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorence is Strenght But Winston has doubts  doubts that there is a better world  a world where freedom is natural  and he has memories that such a world has once maybe existed  but the party and Ministry is constantly shouting out words from the tv monitors that London has always looked like this and other things they wanted the people to believe Winston finds a kindred spirit and thats s when everything starts  I really loved this book  the best grade for is if it gets you this impressed and makes you think and that s exactly what 1984 brings  and lots of it  Oh dios  Probablemente uno de los libros que mas he recomendado  asusta bastante el hecho que la sociedad esta cada dia mas cerca de parecerse al escenario de esta historia  es excelente sin duda alguna   I first read 1984 when I was in 8th grade in my spare time as extra credit for language arts  not that I needed it   I was  that  kid haha   I read it again in high school thinking maybe I didn t properly grasp the ideas because I wasn t worldly enough yet   And I found that while I did in fact understand it as a 13 year old  I got so much more out of it the second time  Each subsequent time I ve read 1984  I ve had the same feeling  The message is the same  but I always seem to have a different experience each time I read it  For this reason and many  maaaaany others  this is one of my favorite books      It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen So begins George Orwell s dystopian novel  first published in 1949  The World is divided into three super states  Oceania  the USA  Commonwealth and part of Southern Africa   Eurasia  mainland Europe   the Middle East   and Eastasia  China  Japan and other Far East  Oceania is ruled by Big Brother  and society is split into three social classes  the Upper Party  the elite ruling minority  make up 2  of the population  the Outer Party  c13  of the population  mostly work in the four Ministries that control Oceania  and the Proles  proletariat   c85  of the population  the uneducated who live in poor conditions  Living conditions are generally poor  and every action  every word  every deed is monitored Winston  a member of The Outer Party from London  principle city of Airstrip One  and a conscientious and skilled worker in the Ministry of Truth  spends his day altering old newspaper reports so that they reflect the current Party line  In Oceania  the past can be changed  wars can be unfought  people can be wiped from trace  and memory  completely   a fate common for those guilty of thought common But Winston can t forget the past  nor does he want to  He hates Big Brother  He embarks on an affair with a similarly minded co worker  Julia  and together they seek to join the mysterious underground movement  The Brotherhood  But the Thought Police catch up with them  and so through Winston s eyes we see the real truth behind the Party Written in the post war period  there is much wiithin Nineteen Eighty Four that places it firmly in that era  the three states of Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia corresponding to the emerging post war  superpowers  of the USA  the Soviet Union and China  while the Party s adoption of muscular blond youths in it s propaganda raises the spectre of the Third Reich There are three key points arising from Nineteen Eighty Four when it is read today  Firstly  the actual story is short and scarcely told  and even then it could have done with some editing  The long sections repeated from the Book issue allegedly by the Brotherhood are more than a little boring  and as the protagonist Winston says  they tell us little we don t already know But the story is secondary for this novel  The description of life in a dystopian society was  and is  so captivating  so imfluential  that almost 70 years on  many phrases and ideas from the novel are commonly used in everyday language  from the Thought Police to Room 101  Even the Party s leader has given his name to a reality TV show But more than that  what is so frightening about this novel  is how some things we today are used to is common place in the fictional Oceania  When the Party reports that it has increased the chocolate ration 24 hours after actually reducing it  Winston ponders on how people could possibly swallow such an obvious lie  But when we think of how spin doctors are today employed to twist stories in much the same way  we begin to see how the Party could maintain control  Meanwhile  it was amusing to read  of Winston   He seemed to see a vision of London  vast and ruinous  the city of a million dustbins   on the same day that UK Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles suggested builders should include areas for the storage of wheelie bins  And then  how many in the UK play the National Lottery  In Oceania  the proles also had a lottery  which   with its weekly payout of enormous prizes  was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention  It was probable that there was some millions of proles thinking the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive  Where the lottery was concerned  even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory  There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems  forecasts and lucky amulets   There is  I think  some relevance for that statement in the modern world My favourtie moment in the book  though  has to be the altercation between a pub customer  demanding a pint  and and the barman  reminding the customer that beer was served only in litres and half litres  Now there s a battle that s still being fought  The past was erased  the erasure was forgotten  the lie became truth   Orwell  que tinha  a tese de seu romance encapsulada no coracao  desde 1944  escreveu grande parte de Mil Novecentos e Oitenta e Quatro na ilha de Jura  na Escocia  entre 1947 e 1948  enquantos sofria de um quadro critico de tuberculose 1    Ele enviou o texto final do livro para os editores Secker e Warburg em 4 de dezembro de 1948  e o livro foi publicado em 8 de junho de 1949 Em 1989  Mil Novecentos e Oitenta Quatro ja havia sido traduzido para mais de 65 idiomas  mais do que qualquer outro romance de um unico autor  O titulo  os termos  o idioma  Novilingua  presentes no romance  assim como o sobrenome do autor viraram sinonimo para a perda de privacidade pessoal para a politica de seguranca nacional de um determinado Estado  O adjetivo  Orwelliano  tem muitas conotacoes  Pode se referir a acao totalitaria  assim como as tentativas de um governo em controlar ou manipular a informacao com o proposito de controlar  apaziguar ou ate subjugar a populacao   Orwelliano  tambem pode se referir a fala retorcida que diz o oposto do que realmente significa ou  mais especificamente  a propaganda governamental que da nomes errados as coisas  no romance  o  Ministerio da Paz  lida com a guerra e o  Ministerio do Amor  tortura as pessoas  Desde a publicacao do romance  o termo  orwelliano  tem  de fato  tornado se uma especie de bordao para qualquer tipo de excesso ou desonestidade governamental e  portanto  tem multiplos significados e aplicacoes  A frase Big Brother is Watching You   O Grande Irmao esta te observando   conota especificamente a vigilancia invasiva frequente  Undeniably a masterpiece  I was so disappointed in the ending  but Orwell s forewarning argument comes across very well with it  The writing is brilliant along with the concepts which are easily relatable to present day  I think the two things I really liked about this novel were  1 Winston s stubbornness throughout two thirds of the story and all of the examples of human thought he gives as to why it s still sane if you re a minority of one  I especially loved his description of  ancestral memory   or things humanity does just because they re inherent to do  2 I am glad Orwell included the excerpts of THE BOOK so that we could read along with Winston these forbidden truths that again are easily compared with and criticize today s government  however capitalist  There are a lot of things that I could specifically relate to  like the pointlessness of some types of labor  I didn t really like Julia s character at all  Winston and she are both rebels but in very different ways  hers being a more teenage runaway rebellion while Winston s is a matter of life and death  Their relationship and how they tried to get along irked me  but it added onto the  negative utopia  theme  The torture scenes aren t for the weak hearted  The novel is scary  but it also reaches deeper and asks very important questions about you as a citizen of this world  I would recommend to anyone  George Orwell s cautionary tale of a totalitarian state thwarting one man s quest to get laid  A drab but nightmarish world dominated by  the Party   and their revered leader  Big Brother  who still legitimizes the Party s rule even though he is long dead  if he existed at all  Sort of like Reagan On the bright side  every apartment comes equipped with a largescreen interactive TV  The drawback being that the programming consists mostly of mass hangings and exercise programs  And if the TV catches you saying something nasty about Big Brother  policemen come and torture you As with most monolithic  oppressive regimes  the Party finds it easier to beat and terrorize people into pretending everything s great than it is to actually make them happy and provide for their basic needs  Only the Party takes it one step further  using simulated drowning  burying people alive and confrontations with rats to foment personal psychological breakdowns so people no longer pretend to love the Party  but do so genuinely  if only as a by product of extreme duress  This is what happens to the protagonist  Winston Smith  oh yeah  spoiler alert  Which begs the question  is this a happy ending  Is being successfully brainwashed into happiness the same as actually being happy  As far as the Party s concerned  the answer is yes  But for those of us who ve never had a cage of rats hooked up to our face or otherwise experienced a Come to Jesus moment  it can t help but feel like Winston Smith s love of Big Brother and the Party comes as a form of death  I was assigned to read this for my senior summer reading project  Never a fan of Animal Farm and a bad habit of procastinating  I finally started to read it with a little less then two weeks of school left  I had a game plan to read one part in two days  However  I didn t mind the rush  Itt was quite easy to make my deadline  I absolutely loved this book  The society in 1984 is scary  There is no privacy whats so ever  Every move you make is constantly scrutinized due to the face that one is constantly watched by telescreens that are everywhere  The idea is freaky and so interesting  If the people in the society aren t brainwashed  then they are putting on a show evey minute of their lives  To show that you are against the way you are living even in the slightest way  you will be punished  Although Winston isn t necessary the most likeable character  I couldn t help but to be drawn into him  And I loved watching his almost robotic exterior change and grow emotion when he writes in the diary and is with Julia  This book has plenty of twists that left me confused and quite angry       SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON    And the ending   wow  Throuhout the novel I was waiting for a rebellion  but nothing happens  and with this society   nothing will ever happen  When I read the last two lines of the novel  my heart completely sunk  Winston was brainwashed  He belives he is  cured  and loves The Party and Big Brother  When I read that  I can t say I was surprised  I saw it coming  but the naive side of me liked to believe there was a chance  But when I finished the novel  I couldn t stop thinking about it  That s how you know it is a great book    jwrj  wrwyl wHd mn lktb   yly bykhlwk t ysh  Hdth lrwy  wtfSylh mw bs dhhny kl Hwsk bttDkhm  wbt ysh

estamos constantemente a ser observados e julgados  Ah espera la    Esta e uma satira politica genial e nao podia ser outra coisa vinda de George Orwell  autor de A Quinta dos Animais   Big brother is watching you  Para aqueles que nunca leram o livro  talvez conhecam a famosa frase do programa Big Brother  que ironicamente  e um programa que foi baseado neste livro e em que o conceito geral e  aprisionar  pessoas num ambiente completamente controlado e vigiado  com uma figura autoritaria  Big Brother  Apesar de acreditar veemente que dar ideias a really shows nao era  de forma alguma  a intencao de Orwell ao escrever este livro  a verdade e que este e um conceito aplicavel ainda agora  no mundo em que vivemos e  infelizmente  cada vez mais Esta e uma obra intemporal  de um caracter politicamente filosofico  se e que tal coisa existe e que recomendo a todos aqueles que gostam de reflectir um bocado sobre a sociedade em que vivemos  So much to be ANGRY about  If you ever conquer your nagging self hatred  there is a whole world of untamed FURY waiting to be discovered  People  rich ones  conceited ones  selfish ones  hateful ones  abusive ones  thick ones  everyone is a potential GEYSER of rage Fortunately  your self hatred is strong for now  otherwise you would have to confront the wankers in suits who snubbed the homeless outside the bank  leaving downtrodden debtors to fit the bill  or the woman who strutted with self regarding arrogance along the pavement  or the smirking busker who strummed crap indie covers outside the library who was probably a middle class cock named Tim up from his country estate to slum it in a well appointed Blackford flat while at uni before taking a managerial role in his father s corporation  or the single mother whose only purpose in life was to push her spawn around by saying their names over and over in a shrill English accent until they erupted in bus consuming screams  or the old men who stumbled out pubs and staggered to the betting shop  forever trapped in cycles of mindless gambling and alcohol consumption as though art  music  books didn t exist and the world was one bronchitic catarrhy wheeze cough  or the billboards for unfunny comedies with wax faced gurning hasbeen multi zillionaires  or the people who walked through life blissfully unaware of the contempt and indifference with which they were treated by the corporations that took their money to butcher penguins and pauperise small businesses and abuse starving children in third world sweatshops so everything looked nice in the display window  or the perpetually corrupt chav baiting governments that took backhanders from devil fucking corporations that ruled the world by exploiting and bending the law to make their wallets fatter  dishing out lies whenever convenient to flatter the stakeholders  greed  or the impudent people from all walks of life so bound up in their own petty needs and wants they would never think to lift a finger to help anyone  or who begrudged giving the tiniest morsel to charity because the self pleasure impulse was so strong it inconvenienced them to have to dig into their pockets  or the people who filled themselves up with soulless entertainment like commercial pop music and defended their right to pollute the world with their tastes at the expense of suppressing all art with proper value with the capacity to move people in deep heart shattering ways through hard wrought artistry  not cheap sentiment  or an interminably dreary future of call centre dystopias where everyone is programmed to deliver peerless customer service and hawk tat for bonuses  or a world akin to ancient Egypt where the cat is venerated over all humans and more deserving of our attention than genocide  famine  war  drought  ecological disasters  and so on  or a world where INDIFFERENCE and GREED were so rampant there wasn t even a good reason to drag one s weary carcass out of bed in the morning to face it all again So many things to get ANGRY about  How do you even begin to cope with all that    This book is marvelous  but unfortunately reminds so much of reality  it says about the politics and the behavior of people  Many people say that this book is about communism but if you read it carefully you will see that it resembles present very well  This book is trying to say that any totality regime  including communism is unnatural  It s unbelievable how can a party of people control everything in the world from books  music  TV to minds and thoughts of people Winston Smith is a facilitator rather than a major figure in 1984  He describes the system and shows how it works in Oceania  and what happens to a man when he stands against the party and is dedicated  If you like happy endings for sure you should avoid this novel on the other hand it would be a pity Party slogans e  g   He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   and especially  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength   completely describes the world today  Society determines how a person thinks and how should live   Man eventually begins to believe that the more times repeated lie becomes the truth  Influenced by the constant pressure  a person stops believing their own memories   nor common sense  In this book it is clear to see the class stratification of society and the impact of industrialization on living of individual  Orwell except social  class and political issues also tries to solve the language issue   namely that the language will determine the thinking   Narrowing the vocabulary we reduce our ability to express and think in a manner which is against the party  1984 is an excellent book that forces the reader to think about the world in which we live and how we allow entities to influence us   I recommend this novel to everyone   E mais um ensaio do que um romance  Como romance nao e grande coisa  Como ensaio e brilhante na visao utopica daquilo a que pode chegar a sociedade e da leitura que faz em torno disso Acho o obrigatorio para se compreender a politica e a sociedade actual e sobretudo para que nunca se caia nisto    ja faltou mais  1984 is a doubleplusgood book  To help you fully understand the principles of newspeak before you read 1984 look in the appendix which should have a couple pages explaining newspeak  I liked 1984 because it was a true dystopian  not like other books where everything gets resolved by the will of one character  1984 explains what an ultimate fascist state would be like  This book shows that blind loyalty isn t a good thing  The characters have the ability to accept the things the party tells them as truth  no matter what  The book itself is right on the edge of satire but contains enough truth to frighten modern day citizens  I would recommend this book to people who enjoy dystopias  I re read the book  re listened actually in a very recommendable version I found here  https   www youtube com watch v 1NayX     and can only say this one is nothing short of brilliant    1984 is one of those books that when you pick up  you cannot put down  It was weird since I haven t had many moments like that since not many things actually captivate me  This is a novel written by George Orwell decades ago that still manages to be relevant today   The story takes place in Oceania where everything is controlled by the government who calls themselves Big Brother  Big Brother is always watching you and always keeping you in check  No one is allowed to have their own opinion  and in doing so you will be called in for thought crime  They manipulate kids to work for them and they manage to keep everyone scared  They rewrite history at will to make it seem like they were the good guys throughout history  They try to simplify the dictionary as the generations pass to keep people ignorant  It s a bleak and depressing world that must be absolute hell to live in  The main character is Winston Smith who works for Big Brother  He s a lowly individual who rewrites the history books as Big Brother sees fit  He has a burning hatred toward them but he can t do anything about it  Without spoiling anything  he finds a girl who shares some of his views and he falls in love  That s as far as I can go without spoiling the rest of the story  The ending will probably surprise you as it s quite sad  This is one of the few books that will easily stand against the test of time  Even though the book was written decades ago  it s even more relevant now than ever before  I loved this book and I think it should be a book that everyone reads at least once  I will not review this novel  Although extremely thought provoking  I would need to write a dissertation to properly review this wonderful scary novel  I would say a must read  even still today  for any political thinker  sci fi liver  historian  and or plane reading enthusiast  Loved it  I m absolutely ashamed I hadn t read this earlier in life   I ve read this book many times over the years and have loved it each time  Highly recommended   thought provoking   creepy   futuristic   and always leaves me thinking   is this where we are headed as a society   Me costo un mundo poder terminar este libro  y no porque fuera lento  ni malo  de hecho es solo porque soy tan estupida como para ignorar el libro solo porque me hablan por las redes sociales  1984  es uno de los mejores libros que pude haber leido hasta ahora    George Orwell tuvo una idea tan genial y fantastica  que al poder leerla al fin solo hizo que mi me te explotara  Muchas cosas en este libro  son tan ciertas   como es que los seres humanos hemos dejado de ser humanos  Y piensenlo bien   Como es que este hombre pudo pensar tanto en lo que podria ocurrirle a nuestra humanidad en un futuro  Se con mucha claridad que no es literalmente todo lo que esta en el libro cierto y comparativo al dia de hoy  Pero si se ponen a pensar un poco  a comparar la mas minima cosa  fijarse en frases    Esta totalmente transparente que muchas cosas ocurren hoy en dia Este libro merece definitivamente 5 estrellas y espero seguir leyendo mas libros de este mismo autor  AMAZING want to reread b khwd ndyshyd khh bhtryn khtb an st khh dnsth hy adm r brysh nql my khnd                                                     ghy adm r b

absolute classic  It is basically a dystopian novel where the main character  Winston Smith  lives in  It is set in 1984  obviously   and the world s countries are divided into three superstates with each having their own totalitarian government and their own doctrine  Through this novel  Winston faces hideous truths behind this all knowing  all loving Big Brother and his Party  From the moment you are born in this world  you are subjected to endless propaganda and watched carefully to see if you show any signs of straying from the chosen path  which is following Big Brother   If for any instance a person thinks about anything bad about Big Brother  such as his downfall  they disappear  with their history removed from every record  In this world  he who controls the past controls the future  he who controls the present controls the past  The novel is written with such amazing craftsmanship  and so it wasn t surprising that I was instantly drawn into this meticulously woven story  Absolutely would recommend to everyone  this is a book everyone must read before they die    WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH n  T  lrwyh khms njmt fqd Zlmt wrwyl w swyt bh khryn kn

been throwing around the term  Big Brother  as long as I can remember  but I ve wondered for years how accurate the usage actually was I read 1984 on audiobook  and I have to admit it felt like cheating  The main issue is there were so many ideas worth remembering that I may be forced to by a hardcopy so I can flip through it highlighting memorable passages Most often people mention Big Brother in the context of surveillence  which is really short sighted compared to what Orwell was saying  It s not about the cameras  the cameras are actually a moot point  The government could take you at any time  essentially on a whim  or a suspicion  Cameras were merely a reminder that they could watch you if they felt like it  that they could back up their suspicions if necessary There s a bitter relevance to much of the text  because to me it basically an essay on the nature of bullies  and what happens when they re allowed to run any government for too long A friend of mine read the book around the same time  and was upset at how bleak the ending was  since the villain of the story essentially wins  The beauty of Orwell s conclusion is that it doesn t allow you to feel smug  All of the protagonists high ideas are bashed into the ground ruthlessly and he s left broken You have to create your own counter argument to Obrien s belief that Big Brother is the correct lifestyle My main counter argument is that no matter how bright a despot is  they can not all pick equally powerful successors  All evil men die  and their replacements are often weaker  derivative versions of their appointer  No state of oppression is indefinite by sheer virtue of man s mortality That s the beauty of the novel  it demands that you think about what it s saying  it provokes and does nothing to soothe the blow  it doesn t supply answers to its questions  it builds you up  knocks you down  and leaves you to pick yourself up again If you ever throw around the term  Big Brother   or are at all concerned about tyranny both at home and abroad  you owe it to yourself to read  1984   mn  fDl lrwyt lsysy  lt  tbyn lHkm ldykttwr  w n kn ymkn n tSnf f  bb lr b yD  k d  jwrj  wrwyl ynh  rwyth

distopica em que todos os detalhes da vida de cada individuo eram controlados  Assim  e nos facil admitir que o tema central da historia e a falta de liberdade e as inumeras consequencias que isso tem nas pessoas Gostei bastante da personagem principal  Winston  e da sua perspicacia e resignacao quanto aos lemas apregoados pelo Partido  Achei muito interessante o facto de ele manter sempre a sua memoria a funcionar a cem por cento para que as alteracoes que o Partido realizasse no passado nao alterassem tambem as suas recordacoes  A historia manteve me constantemente interessada  nao pela existencia de misterios que se resolviam no desenrolar das paginas  como nos meus adorados policiais  mas porque eu queria desesperadamente descobrir se Winston teria a coragem de tomar uma atitude ou se seria  infelizmente  apanhado  Detestei  no entanto  a sua atitude no final  Por fim  posso dizer que gostei muito deste livro e que estou contente por ter tomado a iniciativa de o ler  Reconheco que foi necessaria muita imaginacao  afinal  ele criou uma mapa mundi propositadamente para a historia  e confesso tambem que determinados excertos me deixaram com medo que isto pudesse verdadeiramente acontecer  Nao e impossivel Aconselho a leitura desta obra a todo o tipo de leitores  mesmo os que nao gostam muito de ler   Definitely a book I will need to revisit at some point in the future  So glad I never had the ending spoiled  and was reading this for the first time completely ignorant to what was going to happen   Magnifico  Brutal  Impresionante  Gris y duro  pero merece la pena su lectura This was my second time reading this book  having read it maybe 15 years ago  Even the first time  it struck me as a great endictment of totalitarianism  but then I was just out of high school and did not understand the historical context it was written in  I decided to re read it because North Korea was in the news  and if the dystopic horror show depicted in the book has ever been brought into being  it s in North Korea  I have to say  wow  It s been a long time since I ve read something that moved me like this book did  It is for books like this that my ratings usually top out at 4 5  I can leave room for the books that are masterpieces Of course that s not the only reason this book is relevant to today s world  This book represents a possible end game to modern society  How can we ever get to a sustainable world  Well  this is one way  keeping population down  keeping production down  and stagnating the society in an inescapable rut I recommend this book to all who have not read it  and especially to those who might ot have read it for some time  A little more knowledge and experience make this an even more eye opening read  I found myself re reading  and falling back in love with  George Orwell s dystopian classic  Nineteen Eighty Four  The first time I read this  I was fifteen or so  in high school  My English lit teacher had told the class about Orwell s eerie prediction of the future of human civilisation  ruled by a totalitarian government and completely surveilled in every aspect  This  naturally  intrigued me and I had to read it  Whilst it s important to remember that Nineteen Eighty Four is a very political story  a depressing  no nonsense truth of how the human mind can be manipulated and controlled beyond even one s own willpower  it s also important to remember that  like all great books  it s a tragic love story that frustrates and saddens and elates you  All at once If you haven t read it yet  what the hell are you waiting for  Books that make you think all the way through them are probably the best kind  1984  BB  Winston  O Brien   their world did exactly that  Fascinating  from beginning to end   From listlessness   grey to quasi  eutopia to torture  everything was exactly as it should be    Nulla vi apparteneva  se non quei pochi centimetri cubi che avevate dentro il cranio   1984 e un libro che va digerito  Non e una lettura d evasione e non e neanche un libro piacevole nel senso comune del termine  Non conosce un lieto fine  non conosce momenti di vera gioia e anche la speranza non viene mai sola  ma sempre accompagnata dal terrore e dalla certezza di un futuro dal quale non si puo sfuggire Ogni desiderio  ogni pensiero libero  ogni parola  persino ogni legge fisica e annullata  cancellata da quello che il Partito ha deciso  Perfino quando si usa la parola bipensiero e necessario ricorrere al bipensiero  Nel farne uso  infatti  si ammette di manipolare la realta  ma con un novello colpo di bipensiero si cancella questa consapevolezza  e cosi via  all infinito  con la menzogna in costante posizione di vantaggio rispetto alla verita   1984 trascina in un mondo impossibile  ma probabile  Un mondo dal quale non si puo che rimanere spaventati  terrorizzati  esterrefatti mentre si leggono con sguardo incredulo pagine di un qualcosa che non vorremo mai che avvenisse George Orwell era uno scrittore di sinistra di forte ispirazione marxista  Le sue speranze verso la rivoluzione e il regime comunista cadono in frantumi non solo con il comunismo sovietico  ma anche dopo la sua esperienza nella guerra civile spagnola  riguardo alla quale scrive Homage to Catalonia   Ogni riga di lavoro serio che ho scritto dal 1936 a questa parte e stata scritta  direttamente o indirettamente  contro il totalitarismo e a favore del socialismo democratico  per come la vedo io   E  il 1949  Eric Arthur Blair   George Orwell   pubblica 1984 e  dopo qualche settimana  muore  Chissa perche  mi viene in mente una foto dove lui sorride affianco alla scritta  BBC   Orwell non ha mai potuto vedere quali emozioni il suo capolavoro ha dato  quali sono state le reazioni dei lettori  non ha mai potuto ridere davanti all errore di stampa che per anni ha tormentato il suo romanzo  Orwell e morto qualche settimana dopo aver scritto 1984 ma  probabilmente  gia sapeva che sarebbe diventato una Bibbia per molte persone  Non mi voglio dilungare ancora  perche potrei aprire il documento che ho in una cartelletta dispersa nel mio computer e copia incollare qui quelle trenta pagine di analisi  di parallelismi  di accenni storici  di confronto con altre teorie del controllo che mi sono costate mesi di lavoro  Ma non lo faro perche  come ho detto prima  1984 e un libro che va digerito  E non si e mai sentito di nessuno capace di digerire con l intestino che sta dentro la pancia di un altra persona  rwy  mdhshh n lslT  lyst wsyl  bl Gy  flmr l yqym Hkm stbddy lHmy  lthwr   wnm ysh l lthwr

ago when I learned that Muse  which happens to be my favorite band of all time  also based their 5th album on this book and you can really see each song exploiting a different side of the book  It really helped me understand the book which is of a extremely interesting complexity This is the kind of books that stays in people s minds and change their way to see and analyze our society  At least that s what it did to me   When I was first suggested to read this book I was told that 1984 was a good read  no pun intended   a  page turner   heck even a classic  but no one told me that the book was as good as I could imagine  Winston  a simple yet passionate man finds himself in the wrong time period  he is stuck within a time of gloom and doom and cannot seem to have a single moment of privacy  The Party has taken early 20th century totalitarianism to new depths  with each person subjected to 24 hour surveillance and where people s very thoughts are controlled to ensure purity of the oligarchical system in place  The mastermind of all such surveillance is only known as  Big Brother  Winston goes through the problems that any other man would go through  like love  love for the one they call Julia  Julia is a beautiful young woman  much in contrast with Winston physically  but equally sickened by the excesses of her rulers  Such related sickening of the rulers and the oligarchy allows for both Julia and Winston to fall in love  Eventually  Winston and Julia confess to a man by the name  O Brien  whom they believe to be a member of the Brotherhood  an underground organisation aimed at bringing down the Party   their hatred of the Party  O Brien welcomes them into the Brotherhood with an array of questions and arranges for Winston to be given a copy of  the book   the underground s treasonous volume written by their leader  Emmanuel Goldstein  former ally of Big Brother turned enemy  Winston gets the book at a war rally and takes it to the secure room where he reads it with Julia napping by his side  The two are disturbed by a noise behind a painting in the room and discover a tele screen  They are dragged away and separated  Winston finds himself deep inside the Ministry of Love  a kind of prison with no windows  where he sits for days alone  Finally  O Brien comes  Initially Winston believes that O Brien has also been caught  but he soon realises that O Brien is there to torture him and break his spirit  The Party had been aware of Winston s  crimes  all along  in fact  O Brien has been watching Winston for the past seven years Finally  O Brien takes Winston to Room 101  the most dreaded room of all in the Ministry of Love  the place where prisoners meet their greatest fear  Winston s greatest fear is rats  O Brien places over Winston s head a mask made of wire mesh and threatens to open the door to release rats on Winston s face  When Winston screams   Do it to Julia   he relinquishes his last vestige of humanity  Winston is a changed man  He sits in the Chestnut Tree Cafe  watching the tele screens and agonising over the results of daily battles on the front lines  He has seen Julia again  She  too  is changed  seeming older and less attractive  She admits that she also betrayed him  In the end  there is no doubt  Winston now loves Big Brother  A truly wonderful and tasteful book  The gloom and doom might seem unappealing at first  but that is what makes the book such a deep and emotional venture  5 5 After so long in print I don t think I need to sit here and spout the marvels of this masterpiece  we all know it s virtues  and if you do not  read this book  It s storytelling style is different than the modern reader is used to  and Orwell can dryly ramble indefinately  However  the dystopian world that Orwell creates is eerie in it s familiarity and with the state of the world and the state of the US now it is rather prophetic  Here is also an interesting link that shows how our world is Orwellian today  Enjoy http   www studentsfororwell org  This book is doubleplus good Orwell s 1984 is a masterpiece  As a piece of fiction  pure and simple  it is expertly written  The characters are memorable  the dialogue is engaging  and the writing is alternately visceral  exciting  and beautiful  But of course  1984 is something more than a novel  It is  to use Orwell s phrase  propaganda  Ideas abound in this relatively slim volume  In fact  the amount of thought that Orwell manages to condense into one scenario is breathtaking  I want to use this review to try and subdivide some of them  Politics   The most obvious theme in Orwell s book is dystopia  Dystopias and utopias have been used since the very beginning of Western political thought to explore what governments should and shouldn t do  and what would be the most perfect  or horrible  sort of state  Logically  there may only be one perfect form of something  and an infinite number of imperfect forms  But ideas as to what constitutes the most and least desirable societies vary immensely  This is Orwell s take on the latter The danger  for Orwell  is collectivism  the complete and total denial of the individual in favor of the collective  the Party   This is wedded to a self conscious drive for power  Indeed  however evil is the government in 1984  it s at least not hypocritical  That is  it makes it very clear that it wishes to stay in power infinitely  and have an infinite amount of power  This lust for endless power would naturally tend towards collectivism  since individuals are limited by their lifespans  strengths  intellects  etc  This is the why  but the how is also important  Which brings me to    Epistemology   Metaphysics   There are several strictly philosophical questions running through the course of this book  For example  what is reality  Winston is a realist  he holds that things are real whether or not they are observed  In other words  Winston believes that reality is in no way dependent on consciousness  O Brien  on behalf of the party  is an idealist  which means that he believes that reality is completely dependent on consciousness  In other words  truth is merely very strong belief Another  related issue is the existence of the past  Now  this is a question I ve grappled with  There are two sides of it  One can ask   did the past exist   But clearly this is the same as asking  is there a past   and unless you wish to posit that you have  this very moment  been created  fully fledged with habits and memories  then I don t think we can seriously question the past No  the question is  does the past exist   And the answer  it seems to me  is no  Records and memories exist  We can observe the present and infer things  rightly or wrongly  about the past  But the past is not currently existing  which is why we differentiate it from the present  This drives Winston  and perhaps Orwell  bonkers The upshot of this is  of course  that the Party can control reality  according to its theory of reality  if it controls human consciousness  The Party can also control the past if it controls the present  And he who controls the past controls the future  Human Nature   I ve heard a lot of crap written on both sides about the existence or non existence of  human nature   I think this is partly because the term is poorly chosen  We never speak of  Dog Nature  or  Ant Nature   But as soon as talk comes to human behavior  Human Nature pops up  And thinkers  when trying to either prove or disprove it  seem to think of  human nature  like some Platonic ideal  or some law tablet in a strange language that s buried in each one of our brains As far as I can see  the real question often boils down to  what is the degree of flexibility in human behavior   Or alternately   is there a limit to what humans can adapt to   The problem is that  behavior  is vague  and is dependent on circumstances  For example  we normally think of ants as automatons with little behavioral flexibility  But if a group of ants were put into a room full of strong smelling chemicals  I bet they wouldn t act the way they normally do  To pick an example closer to home  cannibalism is taboo in the vast majority of the world  yet when people are in starvation conditions  cannibalism is reverted to So clearly answering the question is tricky  because even if a good description of average human behavior can be formulated by observing extant human populations  who s to say whether new types of behavior could arise with novel circumstances  The circumstances that exist in 1984 have never existed  so I m not sure it can be said with certainty whether humans can be so  de humanized   However  I believe there s good reason to think that it s unlikely I ll stop these reflections here  The novel is just so rich  you could spend a lifetime discussing it   Other issues I m curious about  but not up to tackling  are the relationship of thought to language  and the part that Christianity plays in Orwell s descriptions of guilt  power  and the Party   Suffice to say  if you haven t read it  read it  And if you have read it  think about it   And perhaps you might pretend  afterwards  that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn t really mean it  But that isn t true  At the time when it happens you do mean it  You think there s no other way of saving yourself and you re quite ready to save yourself that way  You want it to happen to the other person  You don t give a damn what they suffer  All you care about is yourself  This is the saddest story I have ever read  and honestly the most terrifying  A good horror story is constructed on the premise that the scary aspect of the story is either  A  Probable or possible in the physical world of the reader  OR  B  So horrid that the reader wishes to never be in the physical world of the character  even if that world may seem far fetched and impossible  1984 contains both of these elements occupying the same time and space  A quote from Braveheart comes to mind   They can take my life  but they will never take my freedom   Except they took his freedom  his mind  and destroyed the most important human attribute  love  The worst part is that in the end  he didn t even know it  There is nothing to feel good about  and a lot to feel bad about after reading this  But Orwell has done it sooo well  The writing is very good  the characters are honest and full  and the story is amazing   Best book what I ve ever read    lHrb hy lslmlHry  hy l bwdy

quote     at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required   22  and      the children  are disappointed because they couldn t go see the hanging   23   This imagery is used to make the reader feel resentment towards the society depicted within 1984 as well as allowing us to better picture ourselves in the character s shoes Orwell uniquely writes this book to give a reader a perfect image in their head of the setting and emotions of the main characters by using carefully picked wordings that convey powerful emotions  This can be seen in the quote    the songs  the banners  the processions  the hiking  the drilling with dummy rifles  the yelling of slogans  the worship of Big Brother it was all a sort of glorious game to them   24   Another example is given in the quote  we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness   24   Orwell uses this type of language in order to involve the reader in the plot of the book    WARNING  SPOILERS Although George Orwell s 1984 is by no means a lengthy or an aged novel  it is still one of the most thought provoking and timeless works of literature ever written  Winston  the protagonist  faces a grueling life in dystopian England  where  war is peace  freedom is slavery  and ignorance is strength   Such paradoxes are common in Air Strip One  as England is called in Orwell s world  as the Ministry of Peace deals with war  the Ministry of Truth with censorship  the Ministry of Plenty with scarcity  and the Ministry of Love with punishment and torture  Winston  an outer party member  works with the Ministry of Truth  where he feels conflicted with the information that he is exposed to  and what the government tells him is real  In the end  his personal conflicts and his urges to rebel against the oppressive society that he is part of lands him in the Ministry of Truth  where Winston first learns of the true nature of the party and before allowing himself to be brainwashed after brutal torturing  O Brien  the man who was in charge of Winston s re education  explains    The Nazis and the Communists  pretended   that they had seized power  to get to a  a paradise where human beings would be free and equal  We are not like that   Power is not a means  it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power   The novel also gives a bleak solipsist and nihilistic view of the world that really questions one s existence in the world  I  for one  found myself questioning the validity of what we perceive every day as truth  to cite Plato s Allegory of the Cave  I had to take a minute to decide whether my life was indeed what I had always thought it was  or just a series of shadows cast inside a figurative cave by forces beyond my control  Um dos melhores livros que ja li  e certamente minha distopia favorita Orwell consegue nos fazer refletir sobre o poder da midia e a manipulacao das massas pelo governo  O livro faz pensar sobre nossa propria realidade que  embora  ainda   distante do mundo descrito pelo autor  apresenta algumas de suas caracteristicas  mesmo que atenuadas  O duplipensar e algo que se ve muito nos dias de hoje  Orwell fala de um mundo aonde o medo e entendido como seguranca e a nocao de liberdade e deturpada  Uma dica e ler tambem Admiravel Mundo Novo  E interessantissimo comparar a forma como Orwell e Huxley enxergam o futuro  I was certain that I had read 1984 at some point growing up  but as I started reading  I realized I had not  We have just become so accustomed to some of the phrases in the book  and the concept of  big brother   that I felt like I was reading it all over again  I m kind of glad I waited  Distopian novels are of interest to me  but I think I understand and appreciate this in a different way as an adult than I would have in high school  Fascinating and haunting read  My brain is definitely in overdrive  and the importance of learning and growing is even fresher after a good dose of 1984   I had been wanting to read this book for a long time before finally  whilst visiting an independent book shop  I stumbled upon it and bought it The story struck me from the beginning and I was immediately immersed into a world I could quite well believe  It wasn t exactly what I had envisioned it to be  it was better and surpassed my expectations hugely Considering Orwell wrote this 45 years before I think he did well to envision such a future  What jumps at me from the read is  How far away are we from being governed in a similar way  Is what we read on the internet  hear and see in the media actually the truth or are we kept in the dark on a host of matters which concern us all  rwy  yjtm  fyh rqy lslwb w Hsn llG  w mt   lthr  b yd  jd  n lmll w mHtwh mhm jd nqdr nqwl

I was blown away by how relevant this book still is today  I read it because it was on my list of  How have I never read this book   There are many many more on that list  but this one was near the top  Following Winston Smith through his journey in a world where everything is seen and heard by Big Brother was harrowing to say the least  The build up of his hatred for the government in which he works is natural and easy to understand  In fact  I found that it was slightly difficult to get into the book  not because of the writing or a lack of interesting plot  but because it was so disturbing that it brought me down to think of living like that  Books tend to be an escape for me  so to read something that is so vividly imprisoning was not so easy  Once I pushed through and accepted the world in which Winston lived I was hooked  You can t help but celebrate his little victories against the omnipresent eye and hope against all odds that things will change  I think that the real power of this book comes from the ending which will stay with you forever  This is one of many reasons that this book is a classic  If it is also on your  How have I never read this book   list  then bump it up to the top  It is not a difficult read in terms of the writing style  only in so much that you know that there is far too much truth in this fiction  Pues no se que decir de este libro que no se haya dicho ya  solo se que a partir de ahora Orwell se consagra como uno de mis escritores favoritos aunque su manera de narrar no sea precisamente  exquisita   El final ampliamente discutido de esta novela  que muchos toman por ensayo   me parecio el final perfecto  Si  es cierto que un regimen totalitario de esa escala es simplemente insostenible en la vida real y estaria destinado al fracaso desde su inicio  Pero hay que tener en cuenta que el Orwell que concibio esta obra fue un Orwell que habia perdido a su esposa a causa de la tuberculosis y que se encontraba postrado por la misma enfermedad  esa intensa sensacion de desamparo que lo abatia en los ultimos anos de su vida fue lo que lo llevo a escribir a un Winston   spoilers   subyugado por los ideales del partido y entregado totalmente a su amor por el Gran Hermano  Solo por eso puedo decir que ame el tono inevitablemente tragico y cinico de esta obra  En un tiempo de engano universal  decir la verdad es un acto revolucionario    1984  is the  Metropolis  or  2001 A Space Odissey  of literature  It s the timeless Sci Fi novel that showed the world the true meaning of the advancements in technology  It s the book that inspired countless distopian visions of the future  many of which are currently mass produced  throughout history not only in literature but also in film  Brazil  and videogames  Bioshock Infinite   This book takes place in a time where technology and the government completely dominate mankind  Privacy and freedom of speech have long been forgotten due to the rise of a symbol called Big Brother that has been said to be watching everyone at every time  History has been altered in order to convince people throughout time that the type of government that exists at that time has saved them from war with other countries  We follow the character Winston Smith on this world not really understanding what s going on around him  He is one of the few that hasn t been brainwashed into believing all of those things Big Brother has caused people to believe  Without spoiling anything  thinking in such way during those times will certainly create some consequences not only for him but for all of his surroundings and his soon to be found loved ones  George Orwell s vision of the future is to me the only distopian vision I am frightened by  His narrative and description of every single aspect of this world has completely riveted me and disturbed my views on the advancements of technology  Without  The Orwellian Nightmare   books such as   A Clockwork Orange  or even   The Hunger Games   Many books have tried to capture the coldness and frightful distopian future that we have been presented but as said above it is a concept that has become completely mass produced and even become part of a way of selling  This is the absolute distopian novel and possibly the second best aged novel is history  besides The Great Gatspy    1984 gets a 5 5   Under Big Brother s omniscient eyes  Winston Smith tried to ignite his only freedom  the freedom to believe in  obvious  truths  but by the novel s end  at the cafe Winston was unsure what two plus two would make  a sign that O Brien had successfully reintegrated a  lost soul  and Winston had become like his friends and neighbors  unable to question and thus unable to revolt  What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O Brien performed  but after these tortures  Winston s total capitulation3 4mind  body  and soul3 4to Big Brother  When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question  then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine Oceania SocietyWinston  by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana s present position  such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe  had helped the regime s guardians  who like O Brien believed  who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   mold the citizens  minds  But Oceana  like other totalitarian regimes  also turned to the indispensable tool  fear  to chisel its citizens  minds and hearts to its agenda s shape and form  To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause  it would when necessary create fathom enemies  either Eurasia or Eastasia  even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies  or rather  like Oceana  no ideologies  Under 1984 s dystopian sky  Winston must bow  not only because of Big Brother s overwhelming power and presence  but also because of Winston s inability to form any ideologies  Even though he wanted to think freely  he lacked the training and thus the analytical mind to counter O Brien s offenses  In the end  his mind followed the path of least resistance George OrwellOrwell s 1984 is a dark apocalypse of sub human society where homo sapiens had replaced machines to operate an efficient hierarchy  an apocalypse which any people would usher wherever and whenever they ceased to question  intuitively obvious truths   I ve read this book ages ago and its effect on me was nothing short of an electric shock  As amazing as this book is  I don t think I will ever pick it up again  it hit too close to home  The book was written in the forties  predicting what would happen in 1984  Well  I went to school in USSR in the eighties and let me tell you  Orwell got it spot on  The bits that shook me up the most were parts about the Children League  which was the exact mirror or the Soviet  Pioneer  scheme  I guess that was because it was something that I had experienced on a personal level  I was one of those kids marching around waving flags and signing slogans  At school were were always told a story of a little boy named Pavlik Morozov  who was meant to be our hero and role model  His achievement   He reported his father to the communist authorities for hiding grain from the collective farm in his house in order to feed his family  We were never told what happened to the father  presumably a bullet in the head  and the rest of the family  presumably starved to death   This exactly parallels the actions of the children of Winston s next door neighbors  The restrictions on food  where getting anything other than the tasteless government stamped essentials was also an everyday thing  This also applied to little bits of contraband and black market stuff occasionally obtained and treasured  Been there  done that  Then there was Julia who was a member of the Anti sex league  This also really rang true  since from a very young age we were always filled with an idea that sex was one of the perversions of capitalism  actual sex education didn t come into it and should be avoided at all times  Thinking back at all those things was always a bit odd and mostly arb  until they clicked into place after reading 1984  Before that I never even realized that I  as in me   was actually a little cog in the giant machine that is totalitarianism  It was quite an eye opener  I was most impressed with the ending of the book  Far  far too many books are utterly spoiled by a happy ending  This book was not  All I can say is that I had nightmares about rats for weeks afterwards  Undoubtedly  one of the most powerful books ever written   l ly lm ktb hdh lryfyw  nd lnth mbshr  mn lrwyh bsbb nh knt mn wy l lktb lty qr th fy msyrty m  lktb wh n ktb lryfyw b d

Hyth lmkn llZlm    wmhy l wzr  lHb  Amazing book  a great story that gives you a complete and open minded view of what is the world and how power shifts so slightly and the challenge of defending your own rights is much harder than you really think   With the latest revelations of NSA intelligence gathering techniques  a friend of mine suggested that I pick up this book  What shocked me was the accuracy with which Orwell predicted government intrusion into daily life    in 1948    Orwell imagines people sitting in front of screens every day that monitor their daily activity  He sees the ability to track and listen in on people on the move as another tool in the pocket of the government  Through our smartphones and computers  the government today has intruded into almost every aspect of our lives There are some further parallels can be drawn as well  Orwell saw one factor in the political decline as the loss of  external reality   namely that reality is objective and observable  Such a concrete philosophical notion of reality has been replaced by the current postmodern subjective reality where 2 2  can  equal 5  if that s what I think it equals  In today s society where there is no sin or goodness but in what you determine to be such  there is but one small step towards an Orwellian society  If the locus of what determines reality shifts from the person to the state  And perhaps much of this has already happened behind our backs  Because most of us have lost our notions of objective external reality through the public education system of our nation And then there s the issue of history  In an age where we re moving more and more towards reliance on cloud based electronic mediums  erasure of history is truly only a keystroke away  Oral traditions and histories have been exchanged for written ones  Written ones have been exchanged for electronic ones  And the end result is that most in our society knows less about history than ever  Contrary to Emerson and other writers and thinkers who have seen history  and living in light of history  as weak or sub human  Orwell sees history in its rightful primacy  If we don t understand the past  we can t possibly understand the present  The richness of history leads us to the greatness of religion  the beauty of art  and the heights of science  Ignoring history leads only to self destruction  enslavement  and loss of beauty I would suggest pairing this read with Huxley s equally dystopian  A Brave New World  for maximum effect  Readers should be advised that there are several depictions of sex and torture in some sections of this book  The literary and historical significance of the work  however  makes it worth reading for the discerning adult Let me close this review by saying that this book doesn t leave me as doom and gloom as I suppose it has left many other readers  While I believe that man is capable of great evil like that portrayed in the book  I believe that things are not meant to be the way they are  In spite of our notions of a subjective reality  the effects of self serving politicians  poverty  famine  war  greed and so on strike us all as wrong because they really are fundamentally wrong  We long for wrongs to be made right and for an objective  external reality that we can hang on to  And nothing can take that feeling out of us  Even if someone could use our deepest fears against us  we still cannot repress that testimony  And it is because I know that the world is broken  as Orwell warns   I know it can be fixed  The extent of my experience with Dystopian futures would be The Hunger Games  The Maze Runner  Divergent and brief passages here and there  The brutal honesty of 1984 s setting shocked me  and its world s completeness made it real enough to be terrifying  more terrifying than any horror book I ve ever read as a matter of fact  Never has a book scared me so much  1984 is the most disturbing and provoking book I have ever read  Why was it terrifying  Its themes  for the most part  As a free thinker  turning each page of 1984 made me feel like I was taking a step back against a wall and slowly being cornered  Themes like control and dominance  freedom  of thought and otherwise   politics  the importance of the past  what reality is  and being told what to think when to think it and how  It s all been written before  but I can t help but feel that George Orwell made them as terrifying as possible  For an extra dimension to it  put in context the fact that this book was written by a man who d served in the Home Guard in Great Britain and had worked for the BBC during WWII  No sugarcoating whatsoever was found in this book  the main character Winston was shown as a real jerk at times  a really complete image of how humanity is and how we will only continue to be  Another brutal truth that blew me away as I read through this book  Speaking of characters  the psychological development they each face in this book was fantastic  Maybe that s another scary part  the idea that maybe if placed in the situations that Winston was placed in  torture  totalitarian regimes  all powerful leaders  I too would change and lose myself  Maybe I d lose reality  If you re looking for action or cool futuristic weapons and fights however  this is not the book for you  Looking for a cute love story between characters  None of that either  I m still completely shaken by this book so maybe my review makes no sense whatsoever  But that shock is actually why 1984 gets five stars   This is one my favorite books of all time  Period  The book provides a good non fictional look at fascism and is often compared to A Brave New World  While I believe Orwell s 1984 was meant to parallel Eastern European Nationalistic States  more generally Soviet and and Nazi doctrines  I believe New World to take an alternate Western Democratic doctrine  Both books deal their subjects an environment of subversion  subjugation and oppression  That s essentially it  However what is most amazing about both of these books  and to some extent Fahrenheit 451  which is often compared with the other two   is the way in which many of the underlying tones are just as relevant as the day the books were published Throughout both books  1984  New World  the authors detail the systems and functions of their created authoritarian states  The funny thing is  as I read  I found similar characteristics within my own culture  US   in all aspects  politically  economically  socially   Many people will argue that 451 stands shoulder to shoulder with these two books  I feel that their almost outlandish concepts are what separate them from 451  And it is these concepts that also remarkably ring so clear with the past and the present By the way I feel like 451 is a poor man s New World  even though I love Bradbury  Take that with a grain of salt because I read 451 years back  1984  Dzhordzh Oruell  Klassicheskaia antiutopiia

of everything he does  thinks  and feels  and almost unknowing  readers are drawn to experience the same emotions Winston feels himself  Anger  love  hate  fear  sadness  even the uncertainty of insanity    the reader will find themselves deeply connected to the main character by the turn of the last page  This is one of the few books I have read in a long time that has been able to evoke such feeling out of me  SPOILER ALERT From the moment Winston is arrested to the time he is released towards the end of the novel  I could not help but feel the out most sympathy for him  As he was beaten  the words evoked a strong image of pain in my mind  When he was interrogated and being  treated  I could clearly picture his anger  confusion  and frustration at the fact that he was seeing four fingers and not five  By the end of his torture  I almost hoped for them to kill him just so he would feel relief  for what life could he possibly live afterward  which is obviously answered   By the end  I was saddened and almost disappointed that they had disillusioned to the extent of actually loving Big Brother   Unless I completely misunderstood the ending of the book  In any case  this book was one of the best utopian dystopian novels I have read and I highly recommend it   I don t think I ve had such polar responses from a single book before  Romantic  hopeful but also cold and depressing  So many cyberpunk novels revel in ideas such as freedom loss  dehumanization and constant surveillance  in a way that almost makes them seem cool  On some level they make you want to live in that world  to be part of the revolution  Because in so many cyberpunk novels this revolution is portrayed  no matter how distantly  to be eventually possible 1984 is not one of these novels  Perhaps because it really was the first of its kind  Some consider 1984 not to be cyberpunk  but to me it is  and blatantly so  Dehumanization  utter totalitarian control and oppressive technology  In fact I do not think even once  futuristic  for 1948  technology is ever used in a positive way  Always to oppress  to suppress individualism  to survey  to control  or to brainwash This book gives you a beautiful  romantic sense of hope and love  then utterly rips it out of you  The ending of 1984 is so depressing and frustrating that it makes me dislike it  but at the same time I know it s the intention  At any rate  this book left a big mark on me  and I will definitely read it again in the future What really surprised me about this novel is that before the tragic final chapters  there is a really beautiful and quite modern romance  Perhaps  for shear emotional masturbation  I ll read the first half by itself  stopping before the point where all hope is taken away  There s so much to like in this book that I m bumping its rating up to 5 stars  It seems like every other page contains something that s relevant to our time  During my last reading  I felt that the observations on the role of the media are particularly poignant nowadays  I also found Julia more interesting this time around  I d always thought her character was not very well developed  but she s a rebel in a very different way from Winston  She is much more self centered and her rebellion basically consists of just circumventing rules that inconvenience her  which is why Winston cleverly describes her as  only a rebel from the waist downwards   She is young and resigned to the status quo  probably because she doesn t know any better  Winston s idea of a rebellion is more romantic  whereas Julia s is more realistic  immediate and practical  rwy  1984 ytHdth fyh jwrj  wryl  n l lm lftrDy lmtkhyl ldhy stDHy  lyh lHy  b d 30 sn   w  kthr   w mstHdthh l nZm  lshmwly  ldkttwry  flsh wb qr th btrjm  lmrkz

horror story and a political treatise  The long socialist at the novel s core is integral to Orwell s meaning  Orwell warns against the dangers of authoritarianism  Orwell s dystopian state offers a devastating view of a society where one is unable to say what one thinks  one must slavishly believe in a single party and a single ideology  and language has been degraded to such a state that it only serves the ends of officialdom  The silent masses are the backdrop to his work  The  proles  play no part in society other than to do the work of the governing class  They are subjugated to the capitalist system 1984 is brilliantly written  with a searing conscience  Orwell s 1984 is rightly a modern classic of both literature and the social sciences  Orwell combines a thriller narrative with a core political message to demonstrate his brilliance as a thinker and his masterfulness as a literary artist  George Orwell s  1984  is such a powerful read  and a fascinating look into the world where one is under control of the State through the  Big Brother   Orwell tried to depict a totalitarian state  where the truth didn t exist as such  but was merely what the  Big Brother  said it was  Freedom was only total obedience to the Party  and love an alien concept  unless it was love for the Party  The story is told from the point of view of Winston Smith  a functionary of the Ministry of Truth whose work involved the  correction  of all records each time the  Big Brother  decided that the truth had changed  The Party slogan said that  Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   and they applied it constantly by  bringing up to date  the past so as to make it coincide with whatever the Party wanted   este o premonitie cu

many of the countries nowadays are going through such agony  where some dictatorial powers are controlling everything that the citizens cant really defeat them  A frightened  harmful  dark book but

few are able to question it  When they try  they vanish without a trace  Winston doesn t start off as a sympathetic character  I found him to be a little pathetic  however this was very much so due to the situation in which he was placed  Oceania in 1984 is a terrifying place  The slightest slip of the tongue  the slightest mis thought  the slightest movement and you re plucked out of existence This is the world that Winston Smith faces and tries to fight  And fight he does  He engages in a love affair with a woman who is  according to the Party  off limits  He begins writing in a diary in defiance  He attempts to find counter parts to his plight  to oppose everything the Party is and the Party stands for  The Party controls everything  The Party rules by fear  and ingrains fear into the learning doctrine of the citizens  If you fear Big Brother enough  you will survive  Maybe This book absolutely terrifies me  The entire concept is close to unbelievable  and yet how far is it from the truth  How many different ways do people have of spying on us twenty four hours a day  seven days a week  This terrifies me 1984 is completely devastating  The result of Winston s capture  imprisonment  and torture saddens me  All of his resolve vanishes  His thoughts  ideas  feelings  and emotions are made to completely evaporate  All of this is done by a man he trusted  a man he believed was fighting against the Party with him  Most devastating of all  Winston is forced to betray his love  while simultaneously being forced to love everything he hates 1984 is a hugely emotional ride  It is intense  devastating  and heart breaking  Shakespeare couldn t even conceive of a tragedy as calamitous as the one George Orwell spun so exquisitely    wbryn   kyf yw kd nsn

to hit y all with some of my favorite quotes from the book   If you loved someone  you loved him  and when you had nothing else to give  you still gave him love   If they could make me stop loving you   that would be the real betrayal       If you can f e e l that staying human is worthwhile  even when it can t have any result whatever  you ve beaten them    Facts at any rate  could not be kept hidden  They could be tracked down by inquiry  they could be squeezed out of you by torture  But if the object was not to stay alive  but to stay human  what difference did it ultimately make    This is what we have to do unflinchingly  But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again    The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense  Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible    We are the dead  Our only true life is in the future  We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone   Like w h a a a a t Kill  em boi  hit  em with that truth  In all seriousness though  this book is amazing  lettura estremamente interessante  la parte sul bipensiero non mi e stata chiarissima fin da subito ma poi viene ben ampliato  che dire    un mondo terrificante in cui  fiducia   liberta   amore  sono parole vuote e senza significato  la conoscenza e il nostro pensiero ci permettono di valutare il mondo e di capirlo  nel mondo di Winston tutto cio non puo accadere    loro non hanno concezione del loro io ne del mondo  vengono mantenuti in uno stato di prigionia totale e privi anche del minimo tratto che caratterizza l essere umano    ovvero la coscienza e lo spirito  I prolet nella loro igoranza e nella loro completa accettazione del Grande Fratello sono piu felici di Winston pur essendo molto piu poveri e malati  il finale mi ha scioccato     view spoiler  Nella mia insana voglia di lieto fine ero convinta che l animo umano avrebbe prevalso  che nonostante le torture e gli abusi Winston avrebbe reagito e si sarebbe sottratto al giogo del Grande Fratello  quando ho capito che cosi non era sono rimasta esterrefatta  poi pensandoci ho capito che era l unico finale possibile per lui  Era sostanzialmente un inetto e anche un codardo  Aveva paura del Grande Fratello e le torture hanno definitivamente distrutto il suo spirito  La perfidia delle torture purtroppo per lui non erano volte ad una sua confessione  ma solo alla distruzione totale del suo pensiero  E il loro successo e stato totale   hide spoiler   o final  O On a scale of 1 to 10  how depressing can one novel be      The answer is 1984  This is one amazing piece of literature I utterly loved it  very depressing but very beautiful  It s beauty doesn t lie in what is written as much as it does in what it means to you   the best books are the ones that tell you what you already know  As an Egyptian revolutionist this novel makes me wonder what would I do in such situations  my first thought was  I ll never cave in     I shall rot in the cells of the ministry of love until I die of natural causes or from all the beating   but then I realised Winston thought the same thing at first  later he actually yelled for them to take the love of his life instead of him  After that stage I really hated myself because I believed I would be broken at some point and won t be able to continue  Then there were more several stages until I reached the final one and probably the most realistic     maybe I ll never know until I m there  but I am not going to let anything short of room 101 break me   Truth is what YOU believe is true  not what you re told is true  Um classico e os classicos sao sempre bons Uma obra tambem de clarividencia  impressionante  Orwell s 1984 is perhaps the most celebrated dystopian book of all time  I consider it to be certainly praise worthy  Orwell concocts a tale that cleverly forces his readers to examine and question many elements of their everyday lives  Although somewhat extreme  he highlights activities that existed to a degree in even 1948  Each page is intellectually stimulating and could be analyzed for hours  This is a magnificent book  My favorite part is definitely the ending  Never have I read a more thought provoking conclusion    brz mfy hdhh lrwy  rtbT tfSyl mnh bm n yshh lywm  tqdys lslT      lhws blsyTr   l  l lm     khtlT

Minipax   who deal with war  unfairness when it comes to resources based on where and into who you are born via the Ministry of Plenty  Miniplenty   who deal with rationing and starvation torture mind control mind erasure via the Ministry of Love  Miniluv   who deal with torture  and finally politics  falsification of the past via the Ministry of Truth  Minitrue   who deal with propaganda  So much in this book has become a part of our life today  It kind of embodies the whole  Big Brother is watching you  mentality  1984 is much more of a political work than a science fiction work and it is one

BBC s the big read  Essential reading  George Orwell1984New York  New American Library  1949328 pp   9 99978 0 451 52493 5 George Orwell does an amazing job of crafting a credible and disturbing world in his classic 1984  The novel follows a man named Winston  who lives in airstrip one better known as Great Britain  as he progresses from a petty crime to outright rebellion  with his secret lover  Julia  In this world the malevolent government known as the party rules with an iron fist with no respect for privacy  Winston s journey through this strange world captivates the reader on the very first page  with its unique ideas that are grounded in reality  One of these concepts is doublethink which  is the process of forgetting the past making a false statement replace that and then forgetting the act of doublethink  This may seem as though it is an impossible  but George Orwell makes it believable through the propaganda of the party  Another unique addition is the setting of the novel  In it there are three superpowers stuck forever in a military standstill  the three being Oceania Eastasia and Eurasia  The world adds an interesting side plot to the novel with the progression of the war being reflected various news reports that Winston witnesses   Another great addition is Winston s development as a character  In the first few pages he is a coward  the thought of rebellion barely even starting in his mind  but at the middle he has changed drastically   Don t want to spoil it  Julia  the love interest helps him evolve and adds a level of emotion to the novel  Their forbidden love is sure to please the ladies  I guess   However 1984 isn t without faults  At some points it just becomes too much  with twenty or so pages of text that don t even have to deal with the plot  However this will please some and just be an annoyance to others so it shouldn t deter someone who is interested  I strongly suggest anyone who feels even remotely interested by this to read 1984  It is an interesting  believable novel whose disturbing world and unique ideas are more important now than ever   This changed the way that I looked at ideologies and changed the way I looked at leadership  Cynical  scathing  and not without its flaws  this is still a stark  haunting glimpse at what could be  Chilling  The closing lines still come to me sometimes and remind me of depths that I can only imagine  Just finnished reading this book  the world created by Orwell is utterly inmersing and engaging  you can almost hear the sounds  the voices and even the smell of many of the things descripted in this book  I loved it  every bit of it  all the narrative was flawless  It makes you think  it made me realize that many of the things happening in the novel are a living reality in my country  obviously to a lesser degree  but still the intention is there  specially everything about the freedom of speech and opinions  This novel is a very worth reading  somehow  for me  the protagonist exhibits a certain absurdism like Mersault  L etranger  Camus   or it is just me   Overall Id certainly revisit this distopyan world on a future re read        clap  clap  clap  OUTSTANDING BOOK This review will not be consistent  Because really   after reading this book who can write a decent  review  I can t believe I haven t read this book before  yet I am happy I waited till now to read it    I am using doublethink already  s I am scared  I want to throw myself from the highest rooftop Bravo  bravoIsn t communism just like Capitalism but on a different  more narrow level I hate people I am off to read Pat the Bunny  so maybe  just maybe  I can cheer up again Bravo  bravo examined purely on literary merits one might fairly say that 1984 falls short  with  one would argue  a less developed than hoped for love story  but in terms of total impact on world culture  referenced by 17 years olds in Topeka and in Wuhan  Bratislava and Rio  1984 of course rises to the level of  top 100  work and  canonical literature   moving  striking  powerful  politically informed  and politically informing Orwell s world  seen as a critique of Soviet Stalinism  may reflect English sensibilities  but of course in our CCTV  internet web connected society   city of London ring of steel  society  what is of course noticeable is how much actually did happen immediate post war privation of blockaded UK noted I featured this book in a book challenge here https   www youtube com watch v i1M2x    A very good book  and George Orwell is often described as the pioneer of the dystopian genre  It became quite hard to follow at parts  especially considering I hadn t bothered to read the appendix  but once I had read the appendix it became easier to follow and I began to appreciate the complexity of the plot  A lot of people dislike the ending however  because there is no clear resolution but that in itself is a common feature of the dystopian genre  so if you don t like it  don t read dystopian  Other than that  a very good read  Questo classico piu che una semplice lettura e un esperienza  Anni fa  mi e capitato di partecipare ad un seminario di danza Butoh  danza espressiva giapponese che alterna movimenti lentissimi a convulsioni frenetiche   se non avete mai visto uno spettacolo ve lo consiglio  la forza narrativa e devastante   la lettura di 1984 ha aperto i rubinetti di canali emotivi inesplorati come il butoh  Crederete che sia pazza  un po forse  ma mi piace sperimentare cose nuove  _   Nel seminario di butoh abbiamo camminato lentamente in linea retta verso le nostre emozioni e  anche se non mi crederete perche bisogna provare per comprenderla a pieno  un groviglio di sentimenti sono esplosi ed emersi  1984 ha avuto la stessa forza  camminare in linea retta attraverso le paure del genere umano  Ed e stato un lento scivolare  approfondisco qui    http   silviadaveri autorialblog blog     1984  tells a story unlike one I have ever read  It tells a tale of the future  in a way that is frightening  The main character Winston lives a government approved life by doing everything the government says he should do  He must worship the things the government says he should  Big Brother  and can t even think for himself  Among many other  slaves  of the government  he decides to rebel and runs into others walking on the same path as he performs these acts against the government  He starts with tiny actions with his new found partner Julia  but runs into trouble once his acts get more intense Orwell spends majority of the book focusing on how the government is watching the citizens around the town  There are telescreens  where people watch every move someone does  If something is done against the government s rules  the person disappears and everyone forgets about them  Orwell creates a sense of terror when it is realized how much the government really can do   1984   to me  was a well written book  Although a little tough to read at times  due to the newspeak and advanced vocabulary  this book is easy to follow and understand  Orwell did a great job creating an attachment between the reader and characters  The only part of the book that I wish was left out was the additional book inside the book  it seemed to drag the book down  I would recommend this to anyone interested in government abuse of power    bqry    Dystopian prophesy  On par with Foucault s panopticon  Love it  Never thought I d fall in love with this book  as I m not much of a sci fi fan  I love everything about this book  it s so intense and an amazing story  I think this is one of the books that everyone should read before they die  Extraordinary book    I just saw that  1984  has been enlisted as one of the top 100 books one must read and I totally agree  From the first page till the end  Orwell s imaginary world captivates you  takes you to a different place and shows you a different side of life  Orwell has a fascinating imagination and a deep understanding of the human behavior and thought  How he ever thought of and vividly described such a world doesn t ceases to amaze me  The situation in which the people are living in  the blind loyalty and brainwashed attitude they have towards their government and the party  made me relate it to the situation in North Korea  It is amazing how a book written decades ago can apply to situations in the present day  I highly praise both the book and its prolific author and I will pay my gratitude by recommending this book to all fellow readers  It truly is a book worth reading     l kh lkbyr yshhdk _____________________________lHqyq  hdhh rwy   Zym  bHyth tftqr l n t lq  lyh  w trj h   hdh n knt mrj  jyd fy l ss lkn  ndy b D mn lmlHZt lty  lqt fy lbl  thn

very unique man  The thing I didn t like was Julia god damn it Julia  at first I like her i really like her because she was like Winston  they both where rebels they didn t like big brother  but then again who doesn t like big brother The thing that really made me hate Julia was the fact that she just throw Winston in front of a bus just for her safety And the person who really confused me was O Brian  I thought he was in Winston side but I guess he Was just a Spy Even though the begging is very boring It gets really good in section 2    Insan  ardinda tek bir iz bile  bir kagit parcasina karalanmis tek bir adsiz sozcuk bile birakamadiktan sonra  gelecege nasil seslenebilirdi  Okudugum kitap 49 baskiydi  cok okunan bir kitap oldugu burdan anlasiliyor sanirim  Buyuk biraderi dusununce aklima illuminati geldi  Her tek gozu ona yoranlarin sayisi hayli fazla  Iktidar  guc  bunlari korumak icin yapilanlar  Belki de orwell en uc noktayi gosterdi bu kitabinda genel olarak guzeldi  sikmadi  We have moved a lot  14 times to 4 different states  and sometimes I worry about my son getting confused when it comes to schoolwork  So this year after hearing about Common Core and how it would help put everyone on a level playing field  I was eager to begin and sat down one day to find out more information  and hopefully have my son prepared  Boy  was I in for a shock  Needless to say  I have since joined many groups in an effort to stop CC and have even started preparing to homeschool both my kids  a subject my husband   I are agreeing to disagree on   But through all of this  I kept thinking of a book that I had read in high school  It was 1984  And to reread it today and seeing the similarities and how much of it is true today is downright eerie  I admit I was blissfully unaware of the political machine  thinking that the powers in Washington were there to try and make a better life for us  Well  I am awake now and ready to stand up for myself and my family  I highly recommend this book  especially if you have some concerns abut what is happening in the world today   Hands down one of the best novels in the English language  The idea has been done since  maybe even before but never to this degree  Never has the bleakness and oppression of such a world been narrated thus But it is not the world that Orwell creates and shows that scares the most     in fact i found it hard to be a part of Winston s world because I just could not imagine such a thing would be possible     the thing that scares you the most is that another smaller  different version of Orwell s Party may be ruling your country  your continents and your world  The corporations you work for  you endorse may be exercising similar control over you  The news you hear and read may be tailored and above all THE WARS  THE WARS WE FIGHT MAY BE A TOOL TO EXPAND EXCESS PRODUCE   The most frightening and most depressing book I ve ever read but I love it  Great and powerful book  Very much impressed  I d recommend this book all my fellow journalists  Must read   1984  is one of the defining works of fiction from the 20th Century  Written by George Orwell  the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair  in 1949  it has become the work referenced in other literature  film  and music for a future government which controls all of its citizens  and uses them to maintain its own position of power  Of course  it was not the first novel to present this idea  but it is perhaps one that presents the future that is the most bleak and without hope  Other authors have created sterile futures built on technological advancements that have drained humanity from its citizens  Instead  Orwell s future has technology held in check or even regressing  while political power and control are the forces that imprison humanity in his future  It is easy to read fascism and communism into the government of  Big Brother   but one can see elements from  1984  in any type of government  they simply are more obvious in a totalitarian one  This novel has been recognized many times by readers  In 1952 it ranked 17th on the Astounding Analog All Time Poll  and in 1956 it tied for 9th on the same poll  In 1975 it tied for 41st on the Locus Poll for All Time novels  in 1975 it was 34th on the Locus Poll for All Time SF Novels  and in 1998 it was 21st on the Locus Poll for SF Novels from before 1990  The most fitting recognition though  must be the Prometheus Hall of Fame award which it won in 1984   This book tears through the depths of totalitarianism in the most jaw dropping way  George Orwell was a sightseer for the dangers of power  and puts it in the perspective of a man of the working class  The experiences which are told can be viewed from a global standpoint and will change the most close minded person s perspective  Orwell exemplifies individuality and free will showing how it can be taken away from populations  This book overall gives insight to major issues from the perspective of a man and his condemned relationship with a woman he at first despises  BEST BOOK EVER  mdhsh    mdhhl    ry      mstfzW    bqry                        loved this book   this is by far my favorite book   the idea of totalitarianism or a dystopian world only sparks revolution and failure  The idea of trying to control people is absurd and useless because there will always be those that will go unsatisfied and disagree  I liked George Orwell s portrayal of the inner party and the outer party It reminded me much of the colonialism in which the people of the outer party were forced to learn and grow up learning the thoughts and ideas of the inner party   much like what Europeans did to Africa or what the Spanish did to the Aztecs  mayans and incas   hdhh lrwy  kdt tsbb ly

is safe from censorship  Your most innate human instincts can betray you  resulting in your death or worse  your total annihilation from existence  memory and history One of the unexpected pleasures of this book is the forbidden yet fateful love between Winston and Julia  their trysts in the unspoiled English countryside some of the most wonderful in modern literature  given the austere setting of the world they live in One of the saddest parts was the cruel destruction of their treasured conch It is sobering to think how many people currently live in societies that are not too far off from Oceania in 1984  If North Koreans had knowledge of or access to this novel  I wonder if they d see themselves and their wrecked  strangulated and mutilated society within Upon finishing this dystopian masterpiece  all I could think about was how I will never view caged rats the same again  Sharp and merciless  1984 is an important read for everyone  with much to think about in terms of surveillance  control and society  This is my second time reading this   the first was many years ago  long before I got into journalism or activism   and in reading it I found myself most struck by the oppression that people in Oceania do to themselves and each other  with minimal effort from the state  1984 might be an exaggerated case  but there is more of it in today s society than we would care to admit   Classic Orwell  His indescribable stories always seem to captivate me  He pulls at the heartstrings in the most unemotional way all to prove a governmental point  i e  totalitarianism is bad  I d recommend this book to anyone who hates totalitarianism and loves a book with a complex plot line and great ending   1984George Orwell is a freaking genius  I have no idea how someone could ever create a dystopian world with such precision  meticulous details  with an underlying ideology that is utter madness and yet logical and convincing   This is basically what was written on the back of the book   He invented a whole new language  Newspeak  which is English vocabulary that is narrowed down  and some of the Newspeak vocabulary that he invented is even in use today   Doublethink    thoughtcrime    blackwhite   And the logic behind Newspeak is that without the correct words  people cannot think unorthodox things  orthodox is a recurring word in 1984   and thus they cannot commit anything wrong  That s at least what I got on surface  but I m pretty sure there s something even deeper  1984 is a book that has to be reread to be fully understood  That is why I say George Orwell is a genius I am most fascinated with the idea of Doublethink   having two contradicting thoughts  but yet you believe in the false idea while being conscious of what is correct  and burying the correct version somewhere where it can t be found  and then forgetting that you even buried it  That is the ultimate act of deception   if you can deceive yourself to believe in the flaxen then you can convince everyone else  Ultimately  that is one of the many aims of the Party too   to control reality  that is to say  the reality in people s minds  Using O Brien s example  if I can convince myself that I am levitating  and it can convince others that I am levitating  then I am levitating   there is no external reality  Pure genius  pure madness  pure logic  I m as awed by O Brien s intellect as Winston Smith  the main character   and sometimes I m also wondering whether what I m seeing is logic  or it s him twisting the truth around and I m being played around by him  I really don t know Of course there are a great many other ideas presented in this books   things that the Party does that is not the aim  but to achieve one ultimate goal  which is for you to find out  But be sure not to skip the back section on Newspeak vocabulary  or the Brotherhood manual  if you are really interested in the workings of the world We see the workings of the world through the life and experiences of Winston Smith  and then these bits and pieces come together to have a clearer picture in the brotherhood manual   someone whose job is to alter past records so that they fit the present truth   Once again  doublethink   changing the past  forgetting what the past has been  and then believing in the changed past   Like all main characters  he is unique   his thoughts are not fully controlled  and he has great intellect  and he is one of the few  or the only one  who is aware that something is wrong with the world  and as a result of being in the minority  he doubts his sanity  Initially  he is simply mentally against the Party  but he tries to control his thoughts so that he can escape the Thoughtpolice  And then O Brien came in to invite him to the  resistance   His intelligence is remarkable  and I honestly don t know whether he is a better representation of George orwell s genius or O Brien  So it s really sad when  view spoiler  in the end  he submits to the party  and reduced to a pathetic state  both physically and mentally  simply drinking everyday and not thinking and HE LOVES BIG BROTHER   hide spoiler   Suffice to say that the Party is infallible  O Brien is infallible  Aside  I still don t understand how O Brien can read Winston s thoughts with such uncanny accuracy during the torture 1984 has the best world building I have ever seen  something that s very lacking in dystopian YA novels nowadays  I am wholly impressed by George Orwell  and surprisingly I don t remember having the same feeling when I read Animal Farm when I was eleven  I m going to reread his books again 1984   pure genius  lmdh qmt bnshr ktbk tHt tSnyf rwyt lkhyl  kyf llkhyl ldh  ttHdth  nh  n ykwn lwq  ldh  yHdth khrj byt  kl ywm  khyl  m tnbw   m mdh  mn  yn stnr

book you discover for yourself  Neither mom nor dad have read this one  As a fifteen year old  1984 changed my life  It taught me to think and to question   I guess this is not exactly a review  I just wanted to say how much this book means to me  I don t know why I had prejudices against this book  Maybe it s because so many literature teachers want to use it in their teaching  Or maybe because I thought that it would be too masculine in a bad sense of the word  I had absolutely no ground for my preconceptions and they were completly smashed very early in the book  Orwell s book is engaging and at the same time very thoughtful  He is so right in man ways about the modern society even if he sets his book in a totalitarian state  He is on the other hand also influenced by his own time and it is impressive and interesting how he can write this book so early on after the second world war  I think Hannah Arendt would say that Orwell manages to portray a totalitarian state in a very authentic manner  The only thing I can imagine she would object to i the possibility of three co existing states  Anyway  I don t want to give away the ending  but I still want to say that Orwell has done a very good job when it comes to following the mind and development of the main character as a reader  The reader comes extraordinarily close to Winston even though the book is written in third person  shy mthyr kyf n lktb tmkn mn khlq  lm akhr wdwl  kml  bnZm shtrky shmwly bsh  qd l ytSwrh lb D lktb tTrq lltfSyl mm yj lk t ysh lqS  km lw knt nt wynstwn    km lw knt nt bTl lrwy  w blSH    DHyth hnnSH blktb  Outstanding Orwell made a credible and clever dystopian society that could actually work  based on several real life exemples from fascists and communists countries  Then he  improved  it to be even more viciously efficient He invented some terms which marked history like Big Brother  Doublethink and Newspeak 1984 was a warning against the twisted functioning of that kind of society  It seems like a complex matter  yet Orwell made it easy to read and accessible to everyone The characters are maybe not that interesting  but they are here to make us see their world through their fate and make one more point about the privacy level they live in  Before starting the book I was worried  because it is a  classic  I was afraid it would be just a big rant and not a real novel  that the pace would be too slow  the writting too boring or too hard to read  But it was not  Even as an unexperienced reader  it was very enjoyable The writting was actually very  pure   Simple sentences describe simple things  You don t have a whole paragraph about irrelevant stuff  descriptions are kept to the minimum you need  it sticks to the point  Even when it s getting more philosophical  ideas are expressed simply enough to make it accessible to everyone The only rough part I found was a group of 20 30 pages  when the main character reads a book describing the society  filled with very dense informations  Those informations were necessary but it wasn t brought in a pleasant way Still  it s very worth 5 starts  even if only for the mindblowing reflections of the author  I have yet to see another well thought out dystopia which made its point so clear and close to our lives  while still being a real novel  Good writing evokes sensation  mn  jml w Sdq m qr t

were spent in the throes of reading horse books and the Babysitters  Club series  In junior high I was too young for it  then there was a period of high school and after high school when I felt rebellious against books you were  supposed to read   However  I am glad that I finally read 1984 as part of my book club  There are so many levels that it is a book you need to discuss with other people who have read it at the same time you did  not a discussion in a  hey  I kind of remember this one part  but a true discussion What is so interesting about this book  as I previously mentioned  are the levels  For my parents  generation and all of those people who were adults during the Cold War  the fear of the surveillance is so prevalent  The idea that people know what you do at all times is very troublesome to that generation  However  with Facebook  Twitter  and even Goodreads  today s youth is not afraid of putting themselves out there  My friends who teach English mentioned that their students had no problems with the Party s surveillance or even the U S  government s surveillance on them  it s a way to stay safe  Even I don t have a huge problem with it  What I did take away was the malleability of truth and memory  It was frightening to me how memories and reality were so easily altered  As a psychology teacher  I know about the malleability of memory  To see it on such a grand scale and the acceptance of new truths as forever truths is disturbing  The concept of  Ignorance is Strength  was hard for me to swallow  more so than the other tenants of the Party  I cannot imagine how crazy I would feel if I knew things to be fact  as Winston did  but everyone else denied these  truths  ever existed  Orwell s genius is the nesting of themes to grate upon all ideals and personality  If it s war  if it s ignorance  if it s freedom  there are ways to hit nerves in most people to  hopefully  prevent these kinds of states  Well done  Mr  Orwell  I m sorry it has taken me so long to get here  Never has a book affected me so deeply  Small shudders flit through whenever I think about 1984  This is the darkest book I ve ever read  and I do not kid you when I say that it actually gave me a terrible headache that did no go away even after a long sleep  I m not going to debate how this terrific society might come to be  or if it will ever come to be  but I hope that if it does  I m no longer around  1984 rmnyst dr twSyf ayndhy bshr  ayndh y khh b khmy dhkhwt w tyz hwshy khwd mytwnym pyrmwnmn bbynm  wrwl khntrl bshr bh dst systm h w Hkhwmt h r chnn bh Zrft w tyz byny

permanente mirada del Gran Hermano  una especie de figura totalitaria y  se presume  jamas existio  pero funciona bajo la logica de una especie de Dios omnipotente  que no es mas que un grupo de gente que quiere el poder El libro  mas alla de invocar y hacer recordar al mundo entreguerras y a aquellas figuras carismaticas de los bloques sovieticos  esboza que el seguir tus ideales propios e incluso pensar en ir en contra de los pensamientos del Gran Hermano significa la muerte inmediata  Pero esta muerte  como lo expone el personaje principal del libro  va mas alla de lo fisico y lo terrenal  ya que supone ser una defuncion de tus pensamientos  de lo que crees  de tus recuerdos  de lo que crees estar seguro  de un todo   Okumakta gec kaldigima hayiflandigim eserlerden biri  Sadece urkutucu

reason this book is considered required reading for polisci majors  If you can get past the relentlessly depressing tone you will find great wisdom as well as a compelling narration that makes you keep turning the pages in spite of the fact you know things will not end well There are torture scenes that are very difficult to read  and near the end the novel breaks down into an almost ludicrous amount of cruelty perpetuated by the state If you want to truly understand words you probably use frequently  doublespeak  Orwellian  and ingsoc  you ll want to check this one out  Imagine a world where your every move is noted   A world where your every deed is watched   A world where your every word is heard   A world where even your thoughts are known   A world where history is malleable   A world where anybody can turn you in  at any moment   BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING  I m not sure if this review has any spoilers or not to be honest This book was awesome  Everyone said it was awesome and they were all right  That ending though   How depressing  As I was reading I noticed I was running out of pages but the ending in my mind wasn t unfolding so I began to figure out what the ending might possibly be but I never dreamed he would do what he did  There s a lot of subtext in the book that really makes you think about the meanings and reasons for what s happening and what s being said  I d recommend this book to everyone   l l m myWz hdhh lrwy  nh rwy  mstqbly  lnZr  wnh Sbt ywm ktbt lmstqbl   flqd stT  jwrj wrwyl fy  m 1949 n yktb  m 1984 w n yshkl l lm  l  nh thlth qw  kl qw

timp am citit cartea mi am amintit trei lucruri  1  experimentul Pitesti 2  putinii ani petrecuti in comunism 3   legenda Marelui Inchizitor  a lui Dostoievski De asemenea am o mare admiratie pentru viziunea profetica a lui Orwell Una dintre putinele carti care m a cam speriat     Esta clasificada como ficcion distopica  aunque yo casi que cambiaria la distopia por una ucronia  Vale  os preguntareis de que estoy hablando  Las distopias suelen suceder en un futuro  normalmente bajo un Estado autoritario  pero como bien he dicho  las distopias suelen ocurrir en un futuro  y tal y como el titulo del libro nos hace ver  la historia transcurre en el ano 1984  y eso es pasado  Aunque si lo miramos desde el punto de vista del escritor  para el si es un futuro  porque fue escrito en 1948 La ucronia  se usa tambien en la literatura  pero  se caracteriza por el cambio de un punto en el pasado  que ahora hace que todo sea completamente diferente a como es en realidad  o como deberia haber sido  Resumiendo  para el autor es una distopia  para mi  ahora que han pasado muchos anos  lo considero una ucronia Bueno  ya vale de tecnicismos  que os aburro  Aqui habeis venido a saber que me ha parecido el libro  y no hace falta que os lo diga cuando en el apartado  Resenas  veais que le doy el asterisco Es imprescindible  y aunque sea un libro con connotaciones politicas  creo que no tienes por que evitarlo  No hay mas que verme a mi  que odio la politica y sin embargo  lo pongo como imprescindible Pero quiza eso sea porque la politica se ve desde los ojos de los que la  sufren   ves como manipulan las informaciones para que el Gran Hermano siempre lleve la razon y sus predicciones sean no solo acertadas  si no que mas optimistas de lo que habia predicho  Ves como castigan a todo aquel que ose pensar diferente  pensar que quizas haya gente que estan contra el sistema  un castigo duro y amargo  en una sociedad donde el amor no esta permitido como tal y donde no te puedes fiar ni de tus propios hijos  Controlados todo el dia por una pantalla que les dice lo que tienen que hacer y cuando  la sociedad vive con el miedo de que un solo gesto pueda hacer intuir que esten tramando algo Novela un tanto cruda  donde Winston  un hombre que perdio a su familia nadie sabe como y que ahora esta perdiendo su fe en el Gran Hermano  conoce tras mucho desconfiar a Julia  una chica morena que esta afiliada a la liga Anti Sex  pero que realmente  aparenta ser lo que no es  Todo cambia en sus vidas cuando Julia le entrega disimuladamente a Winston un papelito  Pero Winston no teme por eso  si no por algo que esconde en su casa por lo que podrian incluso llegar a matarlo  A partir de ahi se forma lo que menos me gusta en las distopias  una relacion amorosa  The  old book  1984 is Gorge Orwell s imaginative future  Note that this book was published in 1950  Orwell was thinking solely on what might happen 30 years into the future  Orwell might have been able to see the much different future if he didn t neglect his lung infection  That s too bad as he was a brilliant man  I realize that I jump the gun by reading this before high school The man charter Winston is living in this dis utopian future where everyone has a job  where they live in England  Big Brother is our main head honcho if you would  Big Brother is our  leader in this dis utopia   There are the principles of INGSOC  which state things like  doublethink  Doublethink is a way to say don t think if you would  This happens because this dis utopian future there is no crime  expect for one  thought crime  Thought crime is where a person thinks out of the box  and when they re caught  the die  They die in a way that says  they never existed I enjoyed this book fully  Now with a deep understanding of why this book is required to be read in high school  I look forward to rereading this when I go into college  I recommend this book after you read Orwell s Animal Farm  You really have to be able to think deeply  and thoughtfully when you re reading this  If you can t think in deeper ways everything just goes over your head and you just see the shallow surface of the iceberg of deeper meaning that is 1984  Orwell s now classic novel about a world in the grip of insanity  He wrote this in 1948  from which he derived the title  and was trying to illustrate a potential future in light of the hysteria  fear  and fascism of his day  The world has been carved up by three superpowers who constantly battle supposedly for the last scraps of contested land  but ultimately because constant warfare is the essence of their very existence  Orwell illustrates the mindset that people must adopt in order to survive in this hostile  suspicious world  and through this shows that the human mind and will are much more pliable and flimsy than anyone would like to think  Perhaps more for that reason than anything this book is considered the definitive  dystopia  as it shows people deprived of their humanity  and pushed to the point of willingly surrendering it  This books should still be a standard in American classrooms  if only for the way it portray gross semantic distortions  for political purposes   Notably  Smith says   How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes  Two and two are four   And he is told in response   Sometimes  Winston  Sometimes they are five  Sometimes they are three  Sometimes they are all of them at once  You must try harder  It is not easy to become sane    Cuando cerre este libro lo unico que salio de mis labios fue un  Waw   Me encanto profundamente  es un libro que te hace ponerte a pensar del sistema que estamos viviendo porque  Es tan diferente al que narra el libro  Personalmente creo que no  Es un libro de esos que todos debemos tener en nuestra estanteria  Recomendado notoriamente  Fin del Comunicado  so glad i read this in highschool  it enabled me to recognize fiction as life when bush cheney came to power  Since I had to write a review on a book for my English class  I decided to write about 1984 1984 is a fascinating science fiction classic written by George Orwell in the first half of the 20th century  The story is set in future   Orwell s characters live in athe newfangled world of the year 1984  which brings a completely different way of living for people around the planet  The plot focuses on a main character  Winston Smith  who happens to live in society where Big Brother  representing an absolute authority  has the power to observe every single person in the new country  Oceania  Winston is unable to do anything about the unfair situations that surround people  until he meets rebellious Julia who is ready to struggle for humanity  They cannot trust anybody   very little is needed for them to get killed or imprisoned   and no rule can be broken The characters are very well developed and the story holds the reader s attention  The more I was reading it  the more I could not wait to see what would happen next  Every now and then  a dramatic change occurs in this thrilling novel  At the same time  it is shocking  intriguing and even depressing It is definitely worth reading this astonishing book  and it is highly unlikely that you will get bored with it  In fact  a lot can be learnt from it   you might change the way you think about things such as power and trust  It is a rather serious story  but still remains understandable and stunning  I would recommend this masterpiece to everyone  It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen   One of the best opening sentences to what is arguably the greatest of all dystopian novels  Set in a world where the Ministry of Truth rewrites history so that it does not contradict the government s current view  the Ministry of Plenty deals with the shortages of life s essentials  the Ministry of Peace controls the war and the Ministry of Love tortures and executes dissidents  In a world where even though two and two make four  the population are expected to believe the government if they say two and two make five or three or they can expect a trip to the Ministry of Love where they are  vaporised   Not just executed  the victim is then removed from history by the staff at the Ministry of Truth Winston Smith is one such man with a knack of adjusting Big Brother s speeches so that there are no discrepancies in the records with the policy of the time  The problem is that Smith has embarked upon an endeavour that will lead to his own vaporisation  he has started to keep a diary  Smith believes that there is an underground movement   The Brotherhood   intent upon revolution and overthrowing Big Brother that he is determined to join Orwell s masterpiece of the horrors of a totalitarian state is one of the best examples of a book that fits the description of essential reading  This is the book that people are most likely to claim to have read when they have not so as not to appear an outcast   In fact somebody claiming to have read Nineteen Eighty Four is more likely to be lying   These people obviously do not appreciate that Big Brother is watching them or are not worried that   The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world   ktb ySdmk bmqdr jhlk b nk jhl blwq  wsT khyly k bkdhb  lm rf  lys mjrd ktb    hw nbw  l ynqT   nh lwHy   this book absolutely crushed my soul  10 10  2 2 5  A man s worst enemy is himself  A man s hardest fight is against himself  The hardest enemy a man must forgive is himself  How does one accept and forgive what is brutal  cruel  harmful  deadly  and a painful  merciless  wicked abomination of humanity  Man stands on the edge of a cliff weeping in agony  wondering whether to end it or not while the monster behind him  inside of him  laughs at him  Maybe 1984 wasn t making this point  but this is what I got from it  It wasn t only a fantastic book about politics  society  and wickedness beyond the mind  but it could be applied to what is inside of a man too  Big Brother is a man s torment and suffering  the things man loves to hate that will always catch up with him one day and he will either learn to accept them things and forgive them  or they will torture him to his death in some unimaginable way  Winston s only escape was when he finally learned to love Big Brother  as man s only escape from suffering is acceptance of it  even if it kills him in the end  Truly wonderful  Quote Orwell   A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness  a desire to kill  to torture  to smash faces in with a sledge hammer  seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current  turning one even against one s will into a grimacing  screaming lunatic   He had stopped because he was frightened  A bowed  grey coloured  skeleton like thing was coming towards him  Its actual appearance was frightening  and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself   Two gin scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose  But it was all right  everything was all right  the struggle was finished  He had won victory over himself  He loved Big Brother  Literary perfection From the moment I picked this book up I could not put it down  I did not find it depressing  as others had described it to me before I picked it up  In fact I found it enlightening  and inspiring and I feel I learned a lot about myself from reading it  George Orwell was a very talented author  His style of writing is easy to read and to picture  and yet at the same time it is poetic  sentences rhyme and are colourful  creating vivid images  I have rarely read anything so pleasurable and that has stuck so solidly in my mind  Orwell often refers to smells in his text  very clever considering our sense of smell is connected directly to our emotions centre and thus whilst reading it  I am driven to feel strongly towards what he writes  He also keeps dialogue to a minimum  economising on words brilliantly  to create a hard  cold and aloof feel  which radiates throughout the entire book  perfect for the overall atmosphere orwell was aiming for  Fantastic  and one of my favourite books of all time  I recommend this to anyone to read   My favorite book of all time  The Mother of all Anti Big Government Books  This will go down as an Eternal Classic   He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past  Before I knew that I would study it for school  I bought this with the intent to read it  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  as it is one of the most talked about dystopian novel of all time  I enjoyed the storyline and overall plot of this book  but had one problem  I felt as if Winston didn t even love Julia  Julia approached him saying  I love you   but Winston never really said it back  or acted like it  Although they had sex many times and risked it all  I still felt as if Winston didn t love her  Other than that  I throughly enjoyed 1984  I enjoyed Orwell s writing style  the themes present  anti totalitarianism  oppression and war   One thing I enjoyed the most was the ending  the breaking down of Winston s soul was raw and hard to read  and the last line   He loved Big Brother  really hit home that the people had no freedom in their own life  A Brilliantly written masterpiece  this book made me lose hope  for a while  It ends somewhat like  one flew over the cuckoo s nest  but not without first giving the reader a broader perspective upon society from bird s eye vantage point  qry ty lhdhh lrwy  knt qbl  yd lfTr bqlyl

powerhouse  A definite monster under the bed for your brain  The best part  the book was published in 1949  sweet dreams This book really is incredible  It s not a rainbows and sunshine type of novel  so if you plan on reading it  prepare for something that s a bit dark and depressing  Having said that  it has become one of my all time favourite novels and will definitely stay with me forever  A dystopian novel about Oceania  a society ruled by the oligarchical dictatorship of the Party  Life in the Oceanian province of Airstrip One is a world of perpetual war  pervasive government surveillance  and incessant public mind control  accomplished with a political system euphemistically named English Socialism  Ingsoc   which is administrated by a privileged Inner Party elite  Yet they too are subordinated to the totalitarian cult of personality of Big Brother  the deified Party leader who rules with a philosophy that decries individuality and reason as thoughtcrimes  thus the people of Oceania are subordinated to a supposed collective greater good  The protagonist  Winston Smith  is a member of the Outer Party who works for the Ministry of Truth  Minitrue   which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism  His job is to re write past newspaper articles so that the historical record is congruent with the current party ideology  Because of the childhood trauma of the destruction of his family    the disappearances of his parents and sister    Winston Smith secretly hates the Party  and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother As literary political fiction and as dystopian science fiction  Nineteen Eighty Four is a classic novel in content  plot  and style  Many of its terms and concepts  such as Big Brother  doublethink  thoughtcrime  Newspeak  and memory hole  have become contemporary vernacular since its publication in 1949  Moreover  Nineteen Eighty Four popularised the adjective Orwellian  which refers to official deception  secret surveillance  and manipulation of the past in service to a totalitarian or manipulative political agenda  Preview   Admittedly  it has been a few years since I last read George Orwell s grim prediction for the future  1984   This was one of those rare gems that was both entertaining enough to have read within a 24 stretch and meaningful enough to have left an indelible mark upon my mind  Our hero  Winston  lives in a totalitarian state run by Big Brother  Wherever he goes  he is monitored by television screens and by his peers  The worst crime anyone can commit is to have a thought against the party  yes  even thoughts are punishable offenses  A seed of mistrust for the government enters Winston as he realizes that the government is altering history and lying to he and his fellows  Love for another  Julia  cements his hatred for the party  and together the pair seeks out entrance into a secret society  the Brotherhood  which aims to overthrow the party One unlucky misstep leads to capture and imprisonment in the brainwashing facility  the Ministry of Love  Months of torture all lead up to Winston s entry into the dreaded Room 101 where he must face his most horrifying fear  Will Winston continue to oppose the party or will the events that unfold inside of Room 101 cause him to accept the party and its vision for society  This is one novel that everyone should have under their literary belts You may like this book if    you enjoy reading dystopian novels  you are interested in politics  history  sociology or the like  you are class conscious  you are a Marxist or Conflict Theorist  you are intrigued by the logic of contradiction  you enjoy dark novels  you like thinking  what if   you are puzzled by the odd Apple Macintosh commercialYou may not like this book if    you have no interest in a book with many layers of meaning  it is difficult for you to imagine such a dark future  you approve of totalitarianism  you believe that love conquers all  you are afraid of rats qS  r b blnsb  ly   nZm Hkm bytHkm Hty fy fkrk wykdhb Hty tSbH lkdhb  Hqyq lmhm n tb h mshbhyn ltb  y jm   mnGlq  mSdq  ly kdhyb yrwjh qdthm Hty lw shfw  ksh b nyhm kl shy

extra credit for my school  but I was soon perusing it out of my own interest  Orwell is such a phenomenal writer and throughout the first two parts of this novel  I was absorbed into the storyline   view spoiler  Then  in the third part  I was beyond crestfallen due to how it ended  In fact  I was angry at how it ended because even though I knew that it was a dystopia and Orwell would end 1984 on a hopeless note  I didn t realize just how much the final page would affect me  After finishing the book  I wanted to throw it against the wall and hate Orwell for  ruining  such an amazing book  After a lot of thinking  though  I finally decided that I reacted exactly how he would have expected and wanted me to   hide spoiler   The afterward by Erich Fromm was insightful and informative  after reading this book  one should read it because his commentary shines a perspective light on contemporary society  even with it being written decades ago In conclusion  I highly recommend this novel for anyone interested in Science Fiction and thought provoking books  Plot  BrillaintWriting  FlawlessExecution  Impeccable 1984 kthr mn mjrd rwy  tlms lwq  bshkl Gryb wtSlH lkl lzmn  Tlm hnk

for you  This amazing read tell the tale of a oppressive society that is structured through unknowingly ironic figures  For example the name of the controlling government is Big Brother whom watches you at all times through cameras known as telescreens  This oppressive government is similar to the how the Catholic church used to abuse religion and persuade people into conforming through aggressive yet tactical methods  Everyone in the society is so oblivious to being oppressed that they actually believe they are living happy lives  but not Winston  the protagonist of the novel  He has become tired of the pointless monotony  which is extremely dangerous since you are constantly being supervised  This story is eye opening because it has a vast amount of similarities to the world that us Americans live in today   Amiude relacionada entre as maiores obras da literatura universal  o livro  1984  foi concebido pelo escritor de origem indiana George Orwell no ano de 1949  Desde sua publicacao  a obra vem suscitando intensas reflexoes cientificas acerca dos vinculos porventura estabelecidos entre Linguistica  Ciencia Politica e Direito  A razao para esse debate se funda tanto no fato de que o governo totalitario retratado pelo autor utilizou se de mecanismos linguisticos com o objetivo de eliminar a liberdade de expressao de seus cidadaos e inviabilizar o avanco social por meio de revolucoes politicas  quanto em funcao de que o fenomeno juridico se traduz em instrumento de controle social propriamente dito Deveras  consoante se extrai da linha de inteleccao tecida pelo filologo norte americano Noam Chomsky  todo ser humano possui predisposicao genetica para desenvolver alguma tecnica de comunicacao interpessoal e os idiomas constituem o mecanismo que determinada comunidade humana encontra para concretizar na realidade fenomenica essa aptidao inata  Trata se  em verdade  da explicacao cientifica para a verdade crista contida na estoria biblica da  Torre de Babel   Do mesmo modo  torna se evidente  a partir desse raciocinio  a possibilidade de inexistencia de exata correspondencia entre vocabulos dicionarizados em determinado idioma em contraste com o lexico adotado por outra lingua  Exemplo dessa assertiva consiste na situacao  sui generis  protagonizada pelo vocabulo portugues  saudade   o qual  conquanto carregue intensa carga emotiva a ponto de merecer atencao especial na poesia  nao possui traducao literal em nenhum outro idioma falado no globo terrestre  Cuida se de apenas um dos problemas sobre os quais se debruca a Semiotica  ciencia vocacionada a esclarecer os sentidos e as ligacoes estabelecidas entre o tripe signo  denotativo da mensagem veiculada  locutor  correspondente ao transmissor do signo  e interlocutor  representativo do receptor do ato de comunicacao A deficiencia linguistica caracteristica da  Novafala   idioma imposto coativamente pelo chefe politico  Big Brother  aos cidadaos do Estado de Oceania  mostra se em rota de colisao com a concretizacao de um dos postulados basicos adotados pela Ciencia Politica em materia de Democracia  a liberdade efetiva de conviccao e de expressao  Isso porque o lexico da  Novafala  foi maliciosamente manipulado com o fim de minar a fecundidade intelectual necessaria para a elaboracao de qualquer proposta de mudanca politica  seja paliativa ou mesmo de cunho revolucionario  Ilustracao fidedigna da gravidade da situacao linguistica dos habitantes de Oceania repousa no fato de que o novel idioma nao admitia o emprego da palavra  livre  no sentido atribuido a expressao  liberdade politica   isso para nao mencionar que o vocabulo  pensamento  foi extirpado do lexico do pais Se e verdade que  contra provas  nao se erguem argumentos  revela se necessario mencionar alguns exemplos historicos no que concerne a relevancia da capacidade comunicativa de um idioma para a implementacao de avancos politicos  Em 1848  um jovem de 20 anos chamado Karl Marx escreveu  juntamente com seu amigo Friedrich Engels  uma obra emblematica na trajetoria do pensamento politico universal  Manifesto do Partido Comunista  Sob a bandeira traduzida pela expressao  Operarios de todo o mundo  uni vos    o marxismo influenciou sobremaneira o pensamento politico antanho  tendo sido determinante na formacao da ideologia que motivou a eclosao da Comuna de Paris em 1871  Semelhante panorama se apresenta no que concerne a obra intitulada  Mein Kampf   de autoria de Adolf Hitler e publicada em 1925  O escrito  que revelou ideias anti semitas  racionalistas e nacional socialistas  fez as vezes de  manual  para os movimentos politicos liderados pelo ditador Alem disso  cumpre registrar que a linguagem estabelece relacoes umbilicais com o Direito  o qual pode ser entendido como ciencia social incumbida de estudar as normas juridicas como instrumento de controle social  O fundamento da tese ora esposada repousa no fato de que o Direito  seja por meio de leis escritas  seja por intermedio de costumes estabelecidos  manifesta se sempre por meio do fenomeno da linguagem  Assim sendo  a deficiencia estrutural imposta pelo  Big Brother  ao instituir a  Novafala  prejudicaria tanto o processo legislativo em si quanto a propria interpretacao da lei  E que  ao elaborar uma lei injusta  o legislador poderia externar o pretexto de que o idioma inviabilizaria a correta e efetiva regulamentacao da vida social  Por outro quadrante  o operador do Direito  ao proceder a uma odiosa interpretacao do texto juridico  certamente se justificaria dizendo que tanto o texto nao tem aptidao para expressar coerentemente a realidade  quanto ele proprio  como interlocutor  nao teria capacidade para apreender o real sentido da norma juridica ou mesmo complementar o sentido  o alcance e a finalidade da norma mediante o emprego de outros recursos de interpretacao juridica Seja como for  verdade e que a analise da obra  1984  paralela ao estudo da Semiotica e do Direito parece descortinar vinculos intimamente estabelecidos e logicamente encadeados entre o livro e as duas ciencias sociais  E que  se o Direito e manifestacao do poder e da linguagem  por um lado  e a Semiotica e linguagem  por outro quadrante  entao a linguagem pode e deve ser entendida tambem como poder  Contudo  mais do que o singelo poder de convencer  influenciar e entreter  ela traduz o poder de impor determinado designio em detrimento da vontade alheia  promovendo emocoes e transformacoes politicas e dando consistencia a propria saude do sistema juridico  Comecei a ler  1984  ainda adolescente  e  considerei  na altura  que a visao do futuro era muito pessimista pelo que  voluntariamente  nao o acabei de ler  Como nao gosto de deixar nada por acabar  retomei a leitura recentemente  Considerando que foi escrito antes de 1950  o autor foi um visionario  fiquei arrepiada da forma como descreve os acontecimentos do regime totalitario  A luta pelo poder  a invasao da mente e corpo das pessoas  A vigilancia apertada atraves da  teletela   a manipulacao de ideias  apagar o passado   alterar a comunicacao com um novo idioma  Novilingua     Uma obra genial e ainda atual  numa escrita clara e perfeita  para ser lida com calma  Orwell was undoubtedly ahead of his time when he wrote this book  so many similarities to today and what what may yet come  Everyone should read this book  The everyday American is now so much like the Proles and the Party and the Inner circle so much like our Government and  Ruling Class   and yes if there is any hope it is in the Proles if only they would wake up from placidity and put the necessary change into motion before we truly do find ourselves in an even more uncanny parallel to Orwell s 1984  bir yandan simdiye kadar okumadigim icin pisman olurken sanirim george orwell in yine harikalar yarattigi bu kitabini da okumak icin en iyi zamandi  bir basucu eseri daha buyuk birader ve 2 2   We generally believe that since we are Americans  we have the luxury of freedoms  Freedom of speech  expression  thought  etc  in George Orwells  1984  that is not the case  Orwell details a dystopia eerily similar to the society we live in today  Take for example the  thought police   Much like present day National Security Agency  NSA   the thought police worked on behalf of their totalitarian government  to collect the information of citizens  Obviously  the thought police dealt with how people thought  looking for clues of anyone suspected of being a threat to the government and their agenda  Punishment is to the highest degree possible  death or 25 years of forced labor  The government of Oceania consists of four major ministries  equal to today s  cabinet  that is a part of the executive branch  The ministry of truth  love  peace  and plenty all handle the governments affairs  while the head of government  big brother  is watching the show unfold  In addition to this force  is  the spies  which is Oceania s secret police  radicalized by the parties principles  On top of all this senseless power  one is obligated to have a TV in the corner of their house  that way  big brother  can see your every move  who s in your house at any time  and see that you re obeying  One must take into account the factors that come with this book and when it was written  As a writer  one is fully aware that through satire and other techniques  the author can express themselves through their work  It is apparent that George Orwell did just that  amidst the global crisis that just followed and was still yet to come  Orwell lived through a time period plagued by war and conflict  He  like most  knew that humanity was on the edge  We had just gone through World War One and two  Vietnam followed  so did assassinations  and other conflicts that would test humanity in some of the darkest hours we have been in  Orwell was aware that soon the discussion of  trading freedom for security  was going to rise  In 1984  most people are satisfied with their security although they re forbidden from truly being free  In a sense  they ve enjoyed peace of mind at the expense of truly not living  With any regime similar to this one  there is bound to be opposition to the leadership because people are left saying  what more do I have to lose   An example would be Emanuel Goldstein  a former prominent member of the party who in the book is considered to be  enemy of the people  for betraying the party  going to jail and escaping  and condemning counter revolutionary activities  His faction called  the brotherhood  actively engage in activities to seek sabotaging the party and its leadership  He considers himself and the brotherhood  freedom fighters  and this inspires Winston to follow in his foot steps  In today s world  he would be the equivalent to Edward Snowden  former NSA official gone rogue after exposing the governments secret  and illegal collection of phone data program  Winston Smith  is your ordinary nobody bureaucrat working on behalf of the ministry of truth  in the records department  He s the guy in the movies who s the nobody least expected to do something crazy like fight a strong leadership  although he does just that  But do his ends justify the means  And was he over ambitious This book is illustrates a dystopia  It illustrates the consequences of letting power get in the wrong hands  It also illustrates the disastrous and oppressive society one could possibly live in  if one does not engage in fighting for themselves and their people  Orwell wrote this book as a warning sign  demonstrating how far governments are willing to go to achieve their agenda  even if it at the expense of many  Orwell wrote this book to warn us  to make us question our own leadership  to make us think  what if   to make us open our eyes  and not willfully and blindly let things occur without the consent of the people  I personally recommend this to anyone who is passionate about their freedoms  and to anyone who would like to see the dangers of not partaking in politics and letting things go on by without questioning  what if there s a better way to do this   This book is for those who are comprehend that in order to see the future  we must understand and learn from the past   Opiniao tambem disponivel no blog Escrito e publicado alguns anos apos o fim da Segunda Guerra Mundial  George Orwell  pseudonimo de Eric Arthur Blair  apresentou  atraves da ficcao  um arrebatador ensaio sobre os regimes totalitarios  Neste livro  o argumento em si  embora importante  fica necessariamente em segundo plano  Nao esta repleto de accao nem e uma intriga de suspense  tal e o seu caracter politico  mas e precisamente neste tipo de caracter que reside a importancia de 1984 O autor conseguiu  de forma extensiva mas nada cansativa  focar cada um dos sintomas dos sistemas totalitarios  particularmente na primeira das tres partes em que o livro e dividido  a censura  a manipulacao da informacao e do pensamento  a exaltacao nacional  a inseguranca e a desconfianca em relacao aos outros  a repressao sexual  com o unico de fim de reproduzir a especie humana   a tortura   Por outro lado  Orwell criou tambem um conceito interessante na narrativa  o da novilingua  Segundo o Partido e o Big Brother  nada mais e do que uma versao da lingua aperfeicoada  reduzida e definitiva  Esta esconde  contudo  uma clara metafora a ausencia da liberdade de expressao e ao controlo do pensamento E ainda relevante destacar a relacao que faz entre os sistemas de classes e a guerra Este e sem duvida um daqueles livros que merece toda a atencao que tem  uma vez que  mais do que o interesse pelas personagens ou pela historia  e um livro que desafia o leitor a parar um bocado para pensar e questionar  ate porque como a certa altura e mencionado   the best books are those that tell you what you already know   mas cujas ideias nao sabemos sistematizar  Judul  1984Penulis  George OrwellPenerbit  BentangDimensi  viii   392 hlm  20 8 cm  cetakan II februari 2014ISBN  978 602 291 003 9Winston Smith seorang karyawan Partai di Departemen Catatan tiba tiba saja melakukan hal tak biasa  Ia mencoba menuliskan catatan harian pada sebuah buku  Tindakannya itu bisa terkena disiplin berat bila tertangkap oleh polisi pikiran  teleskrin  dan mikrofon tersembunyi  Saat memulai tulisannya pun  Winston gamang akan tahun yang sedang dijalaninya saat itu  Ia mengira ngira bahwa itu adalah tahun 1984  Sangat sulit bagi siapa pun di masa itu untuk mengingat waktu  kronologis suatu peristiwa  atau kenangan masa silam  Sebab semua telah dikendalikan oleh partai  Tidak ada kebebasan  Semua tingkah lakumu dipantau oleh teleskrin  kata katamu disadap oleh mikrofon tersembunyi  dan sedikit saja ada keengganan mematuhi aturan partai  yang bisa diindikasikan dari mimik wajah serta kalimat yang kauucapkan  maka polisi pikiran akan menangkapmu tengah malam  saat kau tertidur  Lalu bersiaplah untuk diuapkan  Yaa    kamu akan ditiadakan  segala jejakmu akan dihapuskan hingga tak ada yang merasa pernah mengingat eksistensimu  Semua media dikuasai dan menjadi alat propaganda  Berkali kali masa silam diedit sesuai keinginan partai atau Bung Besar Sepanjang hidupnya  Winston berusaha menaati peraturan dengan baik hingga hari itu  hari di mana ia membeli buku harian dan hari di mana ia menerima pesan singkat dari seorang gadis bernama Julia yang mengaku mencintainya  Perlahan  antipati terhadap kediktatoran partai yang lama bersemayam di hati dan pikirannya menjelma menjadi tindakan pelanggaran  Ia dan Julia menabrak batas batas namun tetap melaksanakan tugasnya dengan baik  Mereka menganggap itu adalah sebuah pemberontakan terhadap partai  Namun ternyata polisi pikiran berada di mana mana  termasuk di kalangan kaum proletar yang miskin  Mereka pun tertangkap dan menjalani hukuman di kamar 101 dan berakhir dengan pertobatan pikiran Membaca novel ini tanpa tahu konteksnya menurut saya tetap menarik  sebab terasa seperti cerita fantasi  Terbayang adegan film divergent  escape  hingga hungry games  Lalu saat saya membaca tentang pengarangnya  bahwa ini adalah novel terakhir yang ditulisnya sebelum meninggal di tahun 1950  di mana saat itu perang tengah dahsyat  Saya teringat bom atom di Nagasaki dan Hiroshima  serta rezim Nazi dan uni soviet  kekacauan di mana mana  Maka novel ini semakin bertambah nilainya bila ditempatkan dalam konteks masa itu  Bukankah pengarang begitu berani menggambarkan keadaan sebuah negara dengan kediktatoran terhadap warganya serta tokoh tokoh yang sangat apa adanya  juga waktu yang sebenarnya merupakan masa depan saat novel ini dicetak  Bayangan masa depan tahun 1984 di tahun 1950  Tentu saja berbeda bila kita mengira novel ini relevan sepanjang masa  Mungkin ada pula anggapan novel ini tidak lagi up to date  Kembali  kalau menempatkan konteksnya  novel ini menurut saya hebat  Penulisnya benar benar cerdas memikirkan sejauh itu tentang konsep negara di masa depan  Segala sesuatu kabur menjadi kabut  Masa silam dihapus  penghapusannya dilupakan  dusta menjadi kebenaran    Hlm  92 Mengerikan juga membayangkan begitu kuasanya partai mengendalikan sejarah dalam seluruh aspek media  Bahkan ditegaskan dalam novel ini  satu koran times bisa ditulis ulang sebanyak 12 kali  dengan alasan penyesuaian  Hingga bahasa pun dikerucutkan menjadi lebih sedikit  partai menginginkan keseragaman total  tak ada seni  tak ada sastra  semua dirangkum dalam bahasa kaku bernama Newspeak      Akhirnya  kelak mereka akan melihat Anda seperti apa adanya Anda  lalu mereka akan mencabik cabik Anda    Hlm  333 Kalimat itu menunjukkan perlawanan seorang warga yang dalam novel ini diwakili oleh Winston terhadap rezim partainya  Menyiratkan kemuakan akan semua dusta yang dijejalkan  Satu satunya kepastian ialah bahwa ajal tidak pernah datang pada saat yang terduga dan diharap    Hlm  345 Ditutup dengan ending yang cukup tragis  Meski ada sedikit typo  tapi saya suka dengan gaya bahasa Orwell yang mudah dipahami  meski yang disampaikan sesungguhnya amat berat Saya apresiasi 5 dari 5 bintang Meta morfillah A dystopian classic  This is another one of those books that I revisit every few years  If I had three words to describe it they would be   dark   gritty  and  terrifying   Orwell s very description of a future London envelopes the entire book and permeates every cranny  I can almost taste the oily gin that Winston throws back  I can SEE the proletariate prostitutes making their living  I feel the monotony of Winston s work and the paranoia that comes with living in such a society  This book allows you into Winston s skin  It gets under YOUR skin  Wonderful  The book seems interesting  I give this book 5 stars  I can t believe that I waited so long to read 1984  Very good read that has great significance even for our future  If no dates were ever mentioned  I could see thinking that this book was written during the present day and for our future  There was a point in the book  most readers know the point  when I knew what Winston Smith s fate was  but I can also see how being human in an in human world could lead you astray  Feelings and emotions can do that  There were points where I wanted to reach into the story and slap him  The great detail in everything from the raw lust to the torture really plays on all the emotions  The Orwellian society portrayed in this book is  of course  an extreme example  but it also leads the reader to a sort of enlightenment about what the future could hold  It s left up to us  the reader  to interpret it how we see fit  but many situations that occurred in this story play themselves out every day in various parts around the world  I though it was a very well written book that is even better for the free thinking and open minded   George Orwell creates a dystopian world where in a little before 1984 BIG BROTHER shall rule  Of course  no one has ever seen him  but he exists in all minds of the party  One who controls the past controls the future  Winston disagrees with the government environment  If only he could rebel  How do you rebel without being noticed when you are watched 24 7 at your own home  You can t even trust your own children  in fear they will turn you into the government  People disappear and are never seen again  Winston must find a way to rebel and fast  If you want a vision of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever  I give this book five stars because it is the best  It has political meanings and more  It is one of those books that mean something different to each and every person  Although 1984 has passed by years ago  doesn t mean it is not a really amazing book with possible predictions of the future  For those of you who have read George Orwell  this is another book about politics with a twist of imagination  There only three chapters in this whole book  but that doesn t mean they are short and sweet  They are about hundred pages each  I couldn t put this book down  A story of love  hate  and action  Sounds like a fairytale  but it s not for me to judge  Read it and you will fall in love with this work of art  Orwell  assolutamente geniale  E  riuscito a creare una distopia perfetta  che se calata nella realt odierna  la rappresenta in tutti i suoi aspetti  Assolutamente geniale  Colgo l occasione per citare una delle frasi a mio parere pi caratteristiche di tutto il libro O Brien  E tu  ti consideri forse un uomo Winston  S O Brien  Se tu sei un uomo  Winston  tu sei l ultimo uomo  La tua specie  estinta  noi ne siamo gli eredi  Ti rendi conto che sei solo  Tu sei fuori della storia  tu non esisti  I wanted to read this book when I was in my early teens but didn t have the patience at the time  I put it off for years  I am so glad that I read it now that I am older and have had time to develop an interest in social political issues  This book has a profound way of illustrating the blind spots of our own culture  Especially important in the context of recent leaks about the NSA spying  etc  There are so many parallels between the world painted in this book and the world we find ourselves in now  The details of oppression may be different but the ability to control peoples  thoughts through the media is the same  This book serves almost as a vaccine shot into the social organism  Highly recommended    Inequality was the price of civilization  Isn t it true that all men are not same based on their native talents or socioeconomic status  The ever alluring daydream or idea  for optimists only  of  an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood  without laws and without brute labor  has been haunting the human imagination for thousands of years   However  thanks to our governing bodies and ruling classes  our earthly paradise still seems to be forbidden to us  And the paradisiacal hope has been ever eluding us  owing to Napalm rains and missile storms  vengeful visits of Little Boy and Fat Man  and age old lustful imperialism and perverse colonialism    Have we lost the hope of our paradise forever  How does one man assert his power over another   By making him suffer  Because  Obedience alone is not enough and Power has the pressing urge to control and command over the people   us  Imagine a system which is built on hatred rather than frivolous things like values  love  and other mindless things  and which has no room for any humane emotions except for fear  rage  self abasement  and imbecile triumph of their ruling class  party over their distant and probably nonexistent enemies  Here  in this so called system  when your eyes well up with tears and before you shed a tear  your glass would be filled with a fresh serving of liquor  as if that is going to help   And if you think something uncommon or against the BIG BROTHER i e  the brute face of the ruling class  whom everyone is supposed to revere and unconsciously love  you are likely to visit the windowless multistory building  and   if found guilty  infernal ROOM 101 which is the end point of the filthy lives    of OCEANIA  the system of HATRED   UNCONSCIOUSNESS   Orthodoxy means not thinking  not needing to think  Orthodoxy is unconsciousness   The BIG BROTHER might have only one face  ALWAYS WATCHING YOU   but he has a million pair of hands and minds which continuously work on manipulating the present and erasing the past  a million pair of boots marching all over the country and kicking aberrant innocents  The desire to be alone  leaving out the long gone past and unimaginable future  is tantalizing when one has to suppress his feelings  harden his emotions  and do what everyone else does    And especially when one believes that  Things had once been different   It is the not cruelty and insecurity of the Modern Life  which drives one to the cliff  but simply its bareness  its dinginess  its listlessness  And Pushing an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing    The greater the understanding  the greater the delusion  the more intelligent  the less sane  In the locked loneliness of People  or as in NewSpeak  Official Language of Oceania   Comrades  they pay the price for their happiness  which they are forced to believe to be in  with their FREEDOM and THOUGHTS  which they would otherwise think  if not for ThoughtPolice and ThoughtCrime  Science has been disposed as some frivolous idea  The fields are cultivated with horse ploughs while books are written by machinery  The idea of Individualism and eccentricity has disappeared even from the books  People are being robbed of their basic right to think what they want  and love who they want  thereby forcing them to live in Love Lost and Sex Gone Sour State  Even a secret affair is a political crime and it is hard to escape the ever watching eyes of BIG BROTHER  People unconsciously succumb to the brute force of the Power  dutifully cheer over the trampling on their invisible enemies  so that they can avoid the boots of BIG BROTHER trampling over them  And thus  living in a state of uncertain future  unclear past  and unconscious present  If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face    forever Who can we turn into  at times like this  Can the almighty save us  Can the Spirit of man free us  But  from whom  There are no enemies in Oceania  All are comrades who live in such abundant happiness and unmistakable harmony    only thing they  sometimes  worry about is the lack of supply of cigarettes  shaving razors  and stupid saccharine tablets   We do not merely destroy our enemies  we change them  Such is the life of the comrades of Oceania  full of lies  slogging through dreary jobs  saving cigarette and razors  darning a worn out sock  fighting for a place in the tube  and always living in a state of war with adjacent countries  but not trying to push beyond the limit of annihilation  Because war is not a necessity but a mere show off of whose manhood is bigger  When the power is busy waging War and triumphing over the defeats of unfortunate and weaker countries  comrades continue to live in a sedated state of happiness  with inexplicable hate for those who raise against the system or even think    Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious  If you like this book  it is likely that you like this book  Brave New World   Winston Smith just broke the law  He wrote in a diary  which is punishable by 25 years in a forced labor camp  or even by death  But wait  There is no law  no legalities by which the people in Oceania are controlled by  There are only punishments  vaporizations of random people  who are considered risks to the system of  the Party   By writing in a diary  Winston was thinking too much  Thought was the Party s number one enemy  the most difficult thing to control  If Winston were caught  by a loyal party member or the ever watching telescreen  the Thought Police would come in his sleep and take him to the Ministry of Love  which maintained law and order  the dreaded place of torture and punishment for any felons of thought crime  The irony of this system is prevalent throughout the entire novel  Even more distinctive  however  are the detailed complexities with which Orwell creates this horrific and nightmarish world  His intuitiveness is impressing  but his creativity is mind blowing  He creates a society n which word domination seems not only plausible but inescapable  Orwell insists that controlling the world is simply controlling the inhabitants of the world  Not physically  but mentally  The Party  led by an intangible idea personified by the tangible face of Big Brother  controls the minds of the citizens  The people love Big Brother  they love the Party  If they don t  they can be made to by mixtures of physical and psychological torture  1984 follows Winston Smith  yet undaunted by the threats of torture  who decides to write in a diary  The story proceeds from there with a psychological plot that chronicles Winston s growing understanding of the world he lives in  As Winston continues to grasp the monstrous complexities of his society  so will the reader   This book is not to be read for entertainment  for none will be found within these pages  but for enlightenment  Orwell gives the reader an invaluable glimpse into the effects of such a terrible society  but mainly a glimpse into the deep psychological methods necessary to control the minds of an entire human race  This is a very valuable glimpse that should be taken by any readers who dare to tap into the terrible imagination that drives this literary classic  Tres bon livre  une mise en garde d une autre epoque envers les dangers de la perte de notre langue  L une des meilleures demonstrations litteraires que notre capacite de penser provient absolument de notre capacite de mettre nos idees en mots  A relire d ici quelques annees  Never have i come across a more complete and comprehensive description of a dystopian world that George has described in 1984  I started the book being skeptic of it being just another dystopian novel  But by the middle of the book  i realized there s more to this masterpiece than just a random society  As the story progresses  it transcends the realm of novels to being a description of believable  inevitable view of a world all the while presenting intriguing arguments about life  death  love  freedom etc  In short  you won t find any of the fancy gadgets  cool powers and superhumans in this science fiction  Instead  you ll find description of a society so engrossing that ll haunt you for time to come  And note that it was published way back in 1948  so you can marvel at how great a foreseer George was   tqd n mw lf fylm kwylybrywm t thr bh ly Hd b yd    This is a famous book but until reading it I knew nothing about it other than the phrase  Big Brother is watching you   I was surprised by the direction it took in the end It made me think about how we currently embrace and support an invasive world society  Big Brother doesn t have to impose it on us  The other thing that struck me was how ignorant the masses are  and I include myself in that group  It s impossible for an individual to know even a fraction of the sum of human knowledge  So we are all slaves  in a way  to the sources of information to which we listen  sources as ignorant of the whole as we are ourselves  Our desires to conform and rebel are affected  maybe even controlled  by that information  It s tempting to view rebellion against the status quo as an assertion of individualism  More often than not  it s just a different manifestation of how controlled one is by the status quo 1984 is a book long on exposition  It s a book about ideas  Its most annoying flaw is its reliance on the manic pixie dream girl trope to drive what plot it does have  But still highly recommended  No book has ever haunted me like this one did  Thought provoking  Quite possibly one of the most important books of the 20th Century  and quite astonishingly relevant even from the point of view of a time far past the date of Orwell s projected future  No matter whether one agrees or disagrees  whether one thinks this is possible or impossible  making the mind of a reader work is what makes this a great read  The concept of shrinking the English language as to make Thought Crime impossible was an interesting idea This isn t the kind of book you read for fun  Everything Orwell predicted in 1949  when 1984 was written  has come about  Eerie and fascinating   Una distopia extraordinaria  un mundo no muy lejano  una sociedad no muy distinta  De lejos una joya de la literatura  Gracias senor Orwell    Always a sucker for happy endings  The entirety of 1984 can be summed up with one sentence  the Party line of Ingsoc  English Socialism   which reads   Who controls the past       controls the future  who controls the present controls the past    p 34 This novel is a chilling commentary on what the future could be if the world continues in the direction it has been heading for centuries  It warns of the dangers of conformity  ignorance  and government interference in everyday life  Winston Smith  a thin and unhealthy member of the Party  goes about his day rewriting history to tow the Party line and rebelling in small ways as to retain some sense of individuality  He lives his life in fear of being taken in by the Thought Police  who punish all expressions in any way different from what Ingsoc s current position is  Standard English is slowly being subverted by Newspeak  which replaces current words with unambiguous bastardizations that inhibit free thought  Ignorance is prized and the world is constantly in a state of war As one of the Party members whose job is to rewrite history to match current Party statements  Winston knows exactly how lies become truth and truth is forgotten  He spends the length of 1984 looking for truth hidden behind the lies and finding it harder and harder to even pretend to conform  joined by his lover  Julia  who encourages him to rebel even further and enjoy life to the fullest   a crime punishable by death  Smith interviews people all around him  attempts to search his own memories through his diary  and goes so far as to read the most forbidden book in the land  This is the final act that lands Winston in the custody of the Thought Police and spells his doom  betrayed by the one person he hoped would lead him to the answers he sought Even though the year 1984 is long past  there are a frightening number of parallels in modern life and the novel is still very relevant and intriguing  There were many points in the book where things become disjointed and difficult to read  but it is purposeful and well worth reading until the end  The last four words made me cry  lqr  lthny 25 03 2014bdwn t lyq 5 stars  What a fantastic book that I hope its reality would never come to fruition  Thought provoking  creepy as hell  because of its sheer likelihood   it deserves a place under the name of  Must read classics   Cannot stop raving about it  Even now I m still in shock HAHA  Ever since the rise of YA dystopian post apocalyptic literature  I ve had a desire to look to the novels that came before the popularity to see where the influences could have possibly stemmed from  I started with Ender s Game  moved on to The Giver series  and now have come to 1984  This is not a book that you can just set aside and forget  not that the same could be said of the former novels  But this one takes government of the people  government of the society  government of the individual   and send it to room 101  Take  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength  and think that one out  That was in the first 4 pages  alone  I kept thinking   Anyone wanting socialism in our country needs to read this book and look at our history  heck  our present  look at the economy of Greece   But even that level of thinking is hallowed out and deconstructed within this book  It goes beyond that  It starts and ends with Big Brother s slogans within the individual  This is not a feel good novel  I am surprised remembering friends tell me that he she read this in high school  I cannot imagine reading this without learning about philosophy and governments  many things happening in this society have definitely happened in history and probably at present  and deconstruction  There are also some pretty adult situations  nothing too graphic  that make me question whether this should be taught in high school  This is a thinking novel  which I understand the role of a high school teacher wanting students to think  but it s the maturity level that I question at high school level   It is a novel that haunts  It is a novel that questions  What thoughts are my own    Am I really an individual    What is truth   and  How can I possibly stay true to myself   I have read this several times in my life and it has to be considered as one of the greatest pieces of literature this world has ever known   George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty four is a Master of horror  Julia and Winston s love story in the era of Big Brother in Oceania is enough to realize how dear our freedom means to us  A twisted tale of everywhere Winston goes  even his own home  the Party watches him through telescreens  everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party s seemingly omniscient leader  a figure known only as Big Brother  The Party controls everything in Oceania  even the people s history and language  Currently  the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak  which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it  Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal  Such thoughtcrime is  in fact  the worst of all crimes  What rulers will do for power in the futuristic society seems spine chilling and oddly poignant in today s world of ISIS  Burma  Syria and North Korea   ySwr jwrj wrwyl fy hdh l ml l dby l Zym mjtm

yqr  thm yqr  1984 was an interesting read for me  I loved how the plot unveiled  and how Winston was able to fall in love with Julia  and then big brother  Obviously  the ending was strange for me  but i think that is what makes the book so striking  Big Brother is present in every chapter of the book and it watch Winston learn to love and accept him in the end  Like Winston I was skeptical about Big Brother in the beginning of the novel  Apart from the overall character development that Winston  I really enjoyed reading about all the strange things that big brother was doing  Changing history  the meaning of words was something that I had never thought about  It was so strange to read about a government that could constantly manipulate events of the past and make them seem real so effortlessly  The people seemed to hopeless  I remember being shocked that people were glad the chocolate ration went up one month  when it actually went down  People were so in love with Big Brother that they believed that 35 was greater than 40  Overall the book is incredibly insightful  Big Brother is the most haunting thing I have ever read about  and even though I know that this is just a book  It seems so real  I think this novel has changed the way I view people with power  I loved reading this novel  and when I distanced myself from the text and took time to think about the text  I loved it even more   It was interesting to go back and read a book that I haven t read since high school and was  at the time  forced upon me  I found out that I didn t actually remember this book at all  This is a dystopian book  or as they say in the afterword   negative utopia   I m really fond of this genre right now and it s even more facsinating when you re reading about a time that has already passed  but that was the future when the book was written  I found the language  Newspeak  interesting  The way the so called government is so power hungry that they are even taking away the freedom of words and language  I found this book almost like zombies meet Fahrenheit451  The way the people follow everything they are told and are so mindless to the world around them and how history has been completely altered and books are destroyed or at least re written     SPOILER   Orwell s book is different than other dystopian novels in the way he ends his story  though  While  we re used to seeing some sort of victory or at least a rise up against the government  this book ended in defeat  The whole time you re waiting for a turn or some sort of hero  But  it ends worse than it began   This book was recommended to me because I had previously enjoyed novels featuring dystopian societies  I was reluctant to start reading at first and found it quite difficult to become involved in the story   this  I think was due to not reading a book for leisure in quite some time  not to the book itself   however once I got going  I genuinely could not stop  It is written in such an articulate way  that I started to feel what the characters felt  which I think  is how a book should make you feel  So overall  a brilliant read And also  the person who recommended it to me was super cool  so that may have also contributed  I wavered between giving this book four and five stars  because the ending was not quite what I expected  After reading the afterword in this particular edition and reflecting upon the themes of the book  however  I realized it was indeed worth every bit of praise as a classic that it receives  Far from being a cliche to give this book such a label  I can think of few works of fiction that deserve it more  I already almost want to reread it  which is not something I say often about novels  even those held in such high regard  I would also be a phony bookworm if I didn t talk about its sheer influence on every bit of negative utopian or dystopian literature that came afterward  This is now possibly one of my favorite novels  better than Animal Farm  and a worthy addition to my collection  If you ve been waiting for far too long to read it  as I was until recently  then wait no longer  Termine el libro y lo unico que puedo decir es  No se supone que fuera un instructivo Se los juro pagina por pagina es como ver lo que esta pasando en estos dias en Mexico y en todo el mundo  Ojala no terminen las cosas como en 1984  What could I possibly add that has not been praised about this book Only that its the grandest of the grandest literature Sir George Orwell could only be a genius  The very essence of human society hangs on the thin thread to find a meaning for existence  What if such a meaning was taken from you   what if lies and truth were shuffled so often that they were indistinguishable  What if past could be written and overwritten again and again  Orwell describe such a perfect oligarchy  where not only to commit a crime but also to think of a crime is impossible  He shows how permanent peace is obtained through a state of permanent war how ignorance is strength and freedom is slavery  This is the story of a rebel  Winston who believes things can change  By the end of the book he has lost the ability to think and believe  He is in a state where nothing matters to him and he matters to none  He ends up loving everything he once stood against  A true piece of art this book is a though stirrer and a must read   lrwy  lknz rwy

whimsically from that first reading almost a decade ago I recently came across a post on reddit where someone quoted some newspeak  and I felt the desire to pick up the book again I won t try to write a huge essay on the book  I m sure I did one back in school heh  The book was great  even still to this day  I don t feel like it s dated at all  and that this future dystopia could still be something

comes to what is considered a  Classic   However this book picked me up and ran with me all the way to the end  i could not put it down  I was spending my nights with my head buried in it to see what would happen to Winston The only time I felt anything was a bit laborious was reading the Goldstien part as I felt I had picked most of that up myself from how the party was run but then with what happens after I realised it was a necessity to read that propaganda A brilliant book that I can t recommend enough and I will definitely not be so hesitant about a  Classic  book in the future  I have no words to describe this book  I read it with terror  Terror that within it lies truth about our existence  Terror that a human mind can actually think of all these monstrous ways in which to inflict pain  not only in the physical level  but also on the inside  in the subconscious level  I can only hope that the spirit of the man will overpower the need for power  and that the world will always aim for freedom  How foolish  Nineteen Eighty Four is  in my opinion  one of the best books ever written  The story is well known  a communist government ruling over the super continent Oceania  Big Brother is the totalitarian leader  A member of the Outer Party  Winston Smith  begins to question the system  This book is mind blowing  it s wonderful  And I preferred it to Animal Farm  Animal Farm is a masterpiece  but I prefer this  I even liked the fifty pages of theory  This book is brilliant  it s so captivating  Everyone must read this   1984 was one of those books that was way too good to put down but when you got to the end  just made you pull your hair out  What I liked about this book was that it had to do with a civilization that is controlled completely by its government and everyone but a few people are immune to it  Winston was one of those people who did not believe everything Big Brother told them  I liked how he found things out and slowly but surely put the pieces together to find the bigger picture  What I disliked about the book was how despite everything Winston went through  it ended with him loving Big Brother  The whole point of the story was how much Winston hated Big Brother and didn t want anything to do with it  but because he was tortured to the point where he would do anything to save himself  he ended up loving Big Brother  The part that I absolutely loved also was when he ends up betraying Julia  They were supposedly in love with each other and would do anything for each other but in the end  they ended up giving each other up which I did not expect  1984 had me feeling many emotions throughout the story like excited  surprised  mad and sad  I love the way the author wrote this novel because there are so many turning points that you did not expect and it just keeps you constantly surprised  Overall  the book is amazing  What can anyone say about this book that hasn t been said by other  more articulate people over the past six decades  It is  quite simply  scary  Granted  other characters may well have gone through ordeals that rival Winston Smith s  Torture is hardly new  Deprivation has been making the rounds for centuries  But then you could say that about any concept or idea  It s how you put them together and see them through to their logical conclusion that matters  and this work sees Orwell at the height of his powers I m sure you ve all heard about how prescient the book is  how such concepts as eternal war as a way of keeping people distracted from their own wretchedness  total surveillance and other such things are all predicted here with chilling accuracy  so I shan t spend too much time repeating that  Why reinvent the wheel The sheer level of detail in this book is astounding  Orwell uses plain and simple language and puts the reader right there in Airstrip One  The stench of overcooked cabbage  the bitter chill  the shortages  everything about the austerity years is writ large and even though we ve not had a situation like that in the West for years now  this book at least gives us all a taste of what it must have been like If any part of this book is really hard going  it s the  excerpts  from The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism  It steers the reader away from Winston  Julia  o Brien and co and straight into a very dry analysis of what might be the history of Oceania  Although that secret history might well have been fabricated  hooray for unreliable narrators  it does at least put it all in some kind of context  Stick with it The last part of the story is particularly quotable  It s almost impossible to review 1984 without spouting one of the old favourites   we are the dead    a boot stamping on a human face    for ever   Winston s exchanges with o Brien in Room 101 make for particularly compelling reading and I defy anyone to try not to read it through in one sitting If any one piece of fiction should be made required reading at every school on the planet  it s this book  mn rw  lrwyt ll  qryth f Hyty  l  lTlqGyrt ly mfhym ktyr msh qdr Sdq nh tkbt f lzmn dh f lmmkn ltrykh by yd nfsh bjdhy tbdw Zhry khyly  w lkn fy ryy nh

m not a big fan of taking one concept to an extreme and making that the main premise of a story  However  Orwell did that in a magnificent way Those who talk write about the conspiracy theory all the time make me sick  and using it in a book only for the sake of using it kills the book and makes it cheesy  But the way Orwell used that was perfect  He forecasted the future in 1948 and came with the prophetic  nightmarish vision of the year 1984  creating a negative utopia The story takes place in a world where there are only three countries that are in constant state of war to ensure that the resources of the world are constantly consumed  in order for the standards of living for the masses never increase  rendering them oblivious The country the story takes place in is governed by a party that convicts for thoughts  that monitors every single movement of its citizens  putting them under the mercy of the thought police  A party that makes no distinction between the thought and the deed  A party that sees nothing but degradation of the masses This party is based on the firm idea that  The Party  is power  and individuals are mere cells that  alone  are of no importance or significance  and their weariness is the vigour of the organism  A party with the slogan  Freedom is slavery   The freedom of individuals that is  Because every human being is bound and doomed to die  which is the greatest failure  However  merging oneself with the party so that they ARE the party  will make them infallible  all omnipotent and immortal The book discusses many philosophical ideas and uses the foundation of some philosophical doctrines  such as solipsism It also discusses the idea that  Nothing exists beyond human consciousness  in one of the main principals of this party by the idea that The Party thinks that power is not in controlling the material world  That it believes that sheer and absolute power is in controlling the mind  And by controlling the mind  everything can be restrained and managed  including weather  diseases  laws of nature  and every single thing in our material world  For that the material world is nothing but an external reality that lies in and subjective to our brains This book is just brilliant  It s unorthodox and beautiful at the same time It also just happened that I watched the movie  V For Vendetta  when I was half away through this book  For some reason  I have a feeling that the original comic  the movie was based on  was inspired by this original WOW I WROTE AN EFFING BOOK       Genuinely nightmarish  So prescient in its depiction of a surveillance society  so accurate in its description of the way socialism was fundamentally flawed  so true in the manner of crushing the individual  The fact that my Room 101 would be similar to Winston Smith s made it all the more terrifying  War is peace  Slavery is freedom  We are the Dead  One of the best books I have ever read  So intense  so involving  so real    I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reading and thinks is brave enough except the bitter truth  Like Orwell said himself  The best books are the ones that tell you something you already knew   This book was no surprise for me  because I have read about dictatorship before  but no other book has been this honest with me before  I totally loved it  Nothing I would have done differently  I was terrified  I cannot trust anyone anymore like I did before this book  Careful  Big Brother is watching you     shkran lka  wrwyl l nka ktbt hdhh lriwy  ltiy t riyn wtSf wq n bmtyzin  image   umqun dwn

1984 during which the society of Oceania operates under a totalitarian government  Oceania lives under perpetual war  constant surveillance  and most importantly  mind manipulation through propaganda  Individuals live in fear of the  though police   and their possible disappearance should they not act obediently or comply with the demands of Big Brother  The protagonist  Winston Smith works in a division of the government  The Ministry of Truth  His job entails falsifying records in order to correspond with the ideology of The Party  However  Winston has long hated The Party s oppressive force and dreams of taking down Big Brother  Although I was skeptical that this book would merely illustrate the delusional mind of a conspiratorialist  my reluctance vanished as I dove farther into the book  George Orwell provides a rather philosophical tone that simultaneously lets the reader explore the dystopian setting of the novel and subtly pinpoints methods of oppression used by the government as well as the philosophical ideologies of The Party  I was impressed with Orwell s writing style and pessimistic perspective of the government and society  Overall  I found his viewpoint to be intriguing  though at times his ideas did seem farfetched  I would definitely recommend this book for its illustration of an oppressed society and the will power of one individual against the government   Rok 1984 to lektura obowiazkowa dla kazdego czytelnika gazet i telewidza  Pranie mozgu i manipulacja  jakim jestesmy poddawani w  demokratycznej  rzeczywistosci jest faktem  natomiast

individual Orwell masterfully describes the worst possible dystopia   mass thought control  The novel is divided into 3 distinct parts  In the first one  the main protagonist Winston Smith  an ordinary outer Party member  commits a  crimethink    he questions the reality presented by the Party  desperately yearns to know the truth about the past and hopes that change is possible  He also goes as far as committing outward acts of disobedience  he starts a journal  falls in love and becomes a member of the  Brotherhood   a so called underground dissident movement  In Part II of the novel  Winston  predictably  gets arrested and goes through interrogation and torture  the final goal of which is complete suppression of any independent thought and total brainwashing  In Part II  he wishes for death and expects to be publicly executed  However  sometimes death is not the worst end  In Part III  we see Winston as a shell of a man  completely emptied of any will  rational thought or human emotion  He is a picture of hopelessness  a person so thoroughly crushed by the system that the only way he can function is by getting drunk every day  He exists in a perpetual state of stupor  I think Orwell s portrayal of this horrific  what if  world is genius  It is a standing warning to always beware of any system that discourages freedom of thought speech  rewrites history or tells people how to think  A must read for everyone  La creciente decepcion para con la naturaleza del poder y lo sistematico y efectivo del rompimiento del espiritu humano que se experimenta al leer este libro provoca escalofrios  Toda la vida he sabido que este libro es un consabido clasico de las distopias  sin embargo  razono  es un clasico por una razon especifica  y esa razon es que a pesar de que muchas de las cosas que son mencionadas son  obsoletas   por tratarse de una novela de principios del siglo pasado   el tema primordial que lidera la historia no es para nada obsoleto  Al contrario  la validez del argumento es tan real que asusta  Finalmente  segun afirma Orwell  el ser humano  sus suenos y su espiritu son victimas del poder creado por el mismo  Y es inevitable pertenecer a ese sistema que nos controla poco a poco  Las convicciones son efimeras  el sueno de libertad una mentira  la guerra la unica forma de controlar a la poblacion Teniendo en cuenta la situacion que transcurre actualmente en varios paises  y que desgraciadamente seguira transcurriendo  esta novela parece un retrato de una vision que el autor tuvo del futuro  No solo pinta a la perfeccion lugares como la Rusia socialista o la actual Korea del norte  si no que su acertada descripcion de la perpetuidad del poder puede ser identificada en paises como Mexico  Estados Unidos  y tantos otros    verdaderamente terrorifico  La autodestruccion parece ser el proposito ultimo del ser humano  para solamente ser  Terrifying and fascinating  I especially enjoyed the themes of censorship  brainwashing  independent thought and government surveillance  Though perhaps a little dry in points  this was perfect for me  Love  love  love it  In today s modern age and social media we don t know about where many of our colloquial language comes from  1984 led the path to coining the term BigBrother  and gives an insight to what we may face in the future or what we are currently experiencing in the modern era   I only say this because I am a secret conspiracy believer   Be forewarned this classic book does include a subtle tale of forbidden love  One of the best books I ve ever read  It s genuinely terrifying and saddening  It remains remarkably original  even in the present day  after having seen everything which took inspiration from it for all these years  It s filled with a depth and detail that most books don t reach  Ideas and themes explored in a proper sense  to more than just make you think about them  but to provide arguments and dialogue  It s most striking feature is the third act  or the section marked as III  that  like any climax  amps up  yet  it doesn t feel like the book is dependant on it  it doesn t feel like the whole thing is a boring build up towards it  Not at all  Before that there is  SPOILER  Julia and Winston  The romance they have does not feel throwaway or obligatory as it might have  instead  it reflects the coldness of the context and the rebelliousness of the characters  Their relationship  as other parts of the book  may seem so surreal whilst taking in account our reality and our common perceptions  yet feels so real to the world presented in the book  And this consistency is very important  You can connect little threads of Orwell s totalitarian warning with today  in the smallest quantities  and more than that appreciate how back in the day  the text would have connected to the world around them  It is startlingly beautiful in that sense  There is a well reasoned logic and lunacy to everything  Which is kinds meta considering how the protagonist feels the same way at a certain stage  But the book does that  It involves you into the story so well  yet pulls you out enough  A remarkable thing being  SPOILER  Goldstein s book  We go through the story with Winston s feelings and sure enough the book is just those feelings and thoughts  the very same ones  but makes them more organised and consolidated  This is important as when he says that the book doesn t tell him anything new  we really get what he means  We re really inside his mind  Goldstein s book  and what follows after that  also rigidly gives definition to the slogans and makes them real  It s a quality which  pardon me for comparing  popular fiction often just does not have  And this is just one example of the book s brilliance  It s use of motifs are strong  foreshadowing is used to great effect and it manages to have a twist like twist as well  Another thing I loved was the Newspeak appendix at the end  It worked on so many levels  I haven t given much time to writing this review  and it may not come out too well  but everything here is totally honest  Read  This  Book  He escuchado por ahi que los mejores libros son los que dicen lo que ya sabes de antemano  A mi me parece que los mejores libros son los que superan las expectativas de un conocimiento propiamente empirico  Por eso digo con toda seguridad que 1984 es uno de los mejores que he leido  Orwell nos proporciona con sus ideas futuriastas  que no se alejan de nuestro presente  una utopia  A el Estado solo le interesa el poder absoluto  y lo consigue con una prefecta sociedad jearquica  dominando en su totalidad al individuo  fisica y sobre todo psicologicamente  El hombre es privado de todos los derechos humanos  no existe libertad de exprecion  intelectual ni de pensamiento  las emociones y el placer estan prohibidos  el amor y la amistad son lacra de esta sociedad mientras que el miedo y el odio son sus principales herramientas de dominacion  Crea su propia lengua para asi dejar atras la manera  arcaica  con la que se comunica el ser humano  En cada capitulo suceden cosas impactantes  es adictivo y una vez que se hayas iniciado no podras parar  Es un libro que hace trizas  por momentos  la conciencia humana  It s a book great to read in all ages  specially when you re a teenager starting to questioning the world  It had a great impact on me  and since then I have read the books several times  There s an urgency in his concern  I believe  that serves to interpret and make sense of much of our current days  This reading was my third of this novel  I admire and respect it with each reading  This time  I read it as Eric Blair s Last Will and Testament  He was dying while he was writing this  and he knew it  but he continued on to finish this and give it to the world as his final narrative of the perils of totalitarianism  A funny thing happened to me when I was reading it  My wife and I needed to go to the Homeland Security Office and get fingerprinted  we were adopting internationally and this was a way for them to watch us in their fighting the war on terror  When we arrived for our appt   we had to pass through the tight security similar to what we all do to fly  There were more surveillance cameras in this new government building than you find at WalMart  The security agent  a rather ample lass  had me called out since I sent the red lights flashing  I had to empty my pockets while she got her wand out to search me  When I was emptying my pockets  I pulled out my copy of 1984  That s a great book   she said  I know  This is my third time through it and I love it   I said  spread eagle  watching her pass over me with her wand while the security cameras collected my profile  Oh  I ve never read  I ve just heard it s good   She seemed satisfied with that I cleared finally and we proceeded   I ve read this book several times  first in Spanish and later on in English  It s haunted me every time  and it remains one of my favourite books ever  I love dystopian universes   worst case scenario futures  and 1984 is THE dystopian book  It s a masterpiece  terrifying in its message  its warning  It presents a future in which people are watched  deprived of freedom  taught to think what they  should  think  I ve always been fascinated by the tight hold on language  the destruction of words and works of literature that the protagonist is initially a partaker of  If the word disappears  no one will remember its meaning  thus the concept will be gone  and not dangerous for the system anymore   Another remarkable symbol is the chamber of horrors in which every rebel has to face their worst fears until their mind collapses and they yield to the will of the authorities  Overall  it s the tale of an impossible struggle  a fight that s lost from the beginning because the protagonist can never win  Freedom is dead  and  Big Brother  rules  After writing this review  I will probably go and read it again     Velika  vechna kniga  koiato nikoga niama da se zabravi i vinagi shche b de aktualna  Dzhordzh Oruel e Prometei    I haven t read a book that fascinates and terrifies me as much as 1984 does  Orwell s acute vision of the future   a totalitarian state controlling it s citizens with technology and doublethink  among other things   is astonishing and horrifying  To think that he wrote this in the 1940s  long before the internet and phone tv cameras  and certainly long before the XBOX One    telescreen    this is such an ambitious and daunting venture  I cannot believe it must have been easy to write it  nor to get people to accept it and believe in it Orwell is a visionary  his prose is succinct and well written and his plot is captivating  1984 spins a lot of questions and contains a lot of answers to them  It makes you think  it makes you relate it back to our  real world  and challenges a lot of norms in society  Winston  Julia and O Brien s characters are particularly well done  Part three is haunting and sickening and morbidly fascinating  I think this is one of the very few books I have given 5 stars too  Definitely a must read for everyone  many of you are expecting use this space to decry the steps that our government has taken that have brought us ever nearer to the dystopia envisioned by Orwell  And I have to admit  that when I started this book  that was my intention  As I got into the content of the book however  it occurred to me that there is another lesson here for me  and perhaps for you as well  I read this book in high school  but I remember almost nothing about it  Not only do I not remember the story  but also  and more importantly  I don t remember anything about the lessons it has to offer  How is it that a young teen could be exposed to such an important work as this and yet take nothing of any significance from it You might say  particularly if you are one of the professional educators that follow me  that this is simply a flaw in my character or a lack of commitment on my part in my High School days  I don t deny that there were things that attracted an undue level of my attention in those days  and if this were unique to me  you might in fact be able to make that case  It appears to me however that the situation is more endemic than that  There are several others that have I have spoken with that share the same or similar experiences Perhaps you might also make the case that this was just a case of a single ineffective teacher  But again  I would suggest that a cursory review of the experience of others rules this out as a feasible explanation I would suggest instead that this is a problem with the way we approach education as a whole  Perhaps there is no real value in  exposing  our youth to topics such as this in which they have no significant interest  Perhaps instead that our seeking out and encouraging the interests of our youth  Perhaps even stimulating interest in underlying principles and offering something like 1984 as supporting material I ll leave it to those of you who know more about this topic to me to discuss the ramifications of these ideas  One thing is certain  there has to be a better way of bringing the world of ideas  not just facts into the education system  Es genial y aterrador y ese final da escalofrios  Definitivamente es uno de los mejores libros que he leido en mi vida  1984 is a marvelous novel that definetly lives to its reputation  Its similarities with many details that we are witnessing at the moment is extremely shocking  and fir me raised the question   Did George Orwell forsee the future technology  or help inspire it  The narrative takes you through a journey of hope that ends with a shocking revelation in the last words of the book The concepts of oppression that were developed in the novel as well were very deep  A great example for this is the use of  Newspeak  and its development throughout the years to replace the English language  and through that deleting whole concepts by simply deleting the words used to express them Overall  it is an eye opening book that needs to be read if you aspire to gain a new perspective if you hope to read between the lines in our day to day experiences  A must read book  It opened my eyes to many  many things  nSHny Sdyq bqr  hdhh lrwy  b d mzr   lHywnt

a second time but it is absolutely absorbing  The future that Orwell dreamed up with a totalitarian party reshaping everything that makes us human in order to gain and maintain absolute power is truly frightening  The details of this society are amazing  from the devolution of our language so that heretical thoughts against the party aren t even possible  to the destruction of human and family bonds  to the destruction of history and the past and all that humanity has accomplished   He who controls the past  controls the present  He who controls the present  controls the future   I hate that the reader is left with no hope that Winston s world will ever get any better  in fact it will get much and much worse  but for it to feel truly authentic to get his point across Orwell couldn t have ended it any other way  khtb drkhshny bwd dwssh dshtm m wnqdr fDyy khh twSyf khrdh brm dhsht brh khh trjyH mydm dygh nkhwnmsh       m yzl ld  lkthyryn mn  tqd rskh b n kl khyr  Ht  lkhyr lsysy

for influencing me through this book  If you haven t read it  you need to  It seems impossible that Orwell could have foreseen so many societal ills with the accuracy that he did  especially before many of the technologies that he wrote of scarcely existed during the time of his writing  Of course  much of this prophetic story was not fulfilled by 1984  some of it has still not come to fruition  However  Orwell shows us in this work that it is possible to look decades down the road and foresee with some clarity the fruits of our labors   This book is THE definitive dystopian work  The first time I ever heard about  1984  was in 5th grade   It s a story about a man who lives in a society that is entirely surrounded by cameras   said my teacher   until one day he finds one spot in his house where the cameras can t see him  This was a simple enough explanation for a 13 year old that I picked up the book a few years later  What I read changed my life  1984  is a depiction of absolute totalitarianism  In the world of  1984   all public and private spaces are continually monitored by cameras  3  of the population forms The Party    the one true government which rules over any and all aspects of life  They monitor and watch another 13  of the population    the middle class  who are kept in poverty via an eternal war  The government  symbolized by  Big Brother   tells you what to eat  when to exercise  who to marry  where to work    but it does not stop there  The government also decides what is history and what is not  It decides which words exist and which ones are not to be used  Most frightening of all  the government specializes in detecting and punishing  Thoughtcrime     the abominable act of thinking thoughts that do not agree with the State Into this world is set a man named Winston Smith  who begins to do the unthinkable and imagine that the State is not  in fact  all powerful Everyone needs to read this book  It addresses the worst aspects of the conflict between man and state  but digs deeper than that as well  questioning the very concept of authority and free will  Can mere authority change reality itself  Is it true that the human spirit can never be conquered  This is the book that made me ask these questions  Read it  Great book  I absolutely loved it  I think my ninth grade English teacher once said that if a book is really good  you ll still have hope the inevitable won t happen  To the last minute  I hoped Winston would not get caught and when he did  it was the most unexpected thing  Almost scary  even  Would 100  recommend it to everybody   Timeless and amazing    Orwell depicts a vivid portrayal of the ills of a totalitarian regime   even the consequences of government overreach in general  His society is the most extreme one imaginable created by a government with absolute power  While painting his picture of a dystopian world  Orwell links us into Winston Smith  the main character  an everyman who the reader is able to identify with  He is someone like us   an outsider in this totalitarian world  who is unable to completely submit his mind and will to Big Brother  the State   We are able to experience the absolute control of the government through Winston s eyes   its physical and psychological control of its subjects  to Winston s expanding discontent  his rebellious acts and finally their destined consequences Under this veil  Orwell demonstrates how weak and frail a totalitarian regime truly is  In order to control its subjects  Big Brother has to have absolute control of information   to even alter the past  to constantly control minds through propaganda  to create constant war to keep the society poor  and to use fear mongering  i e  encouraging kids to rat out their parents to the thought police  to force its will on the people  It even uses language as mind control   whittling language away to limit thoughts and expressions  Ultimately  Big Brother is only able to force Winston to submit by torturing and brainwashing him into an empty shell like the rest of its subjects This book is great for the high school reader and beyond   it is an easy read while allowing the reader to consider the implications of living in such a society  Its endurance is also impressive   this book was originally published in 1949   the same work could be published today and be just as relevant  Orwell was genius in inventing the principle of  doublethink   Even the reader has to learn to doublethink in order to fully understand the book  There is hope  but at the same time the absence of hope  He shows the power of the individual as well as the weakness of the individual in front of the mass  In addition   1984  has the power to scare  it is inevitably an actual book and it will always be  It is out of the ordinary because it threatens the reader through their future rather than the past  and  more important  Orwell shows the importance of the present  by making clear that it is not repeatable    This review refers to the Italian translation Operating on the principle that l ignoranza non e forza  I wanted to read some books in Italian before taking a trip to Italy in a few months  My Italian is rusty  to put it mildly  1984 may seem like a strange choice of Italian reading material  view spoiler  unless maybe it s for a Celebrity Death Match   hide spoiler    but I found an ebook version of it and figured since I ve read it a gazillion times  it wouldn t matter too much if I occasionally got lost  The syntax is straightforward  which helps  believe me  I am not ready for Umberto Eco   My husband thought I was a little crazy to read this  but wait until we get to Italy and he wants to order a glass of Victory Gin  Who s going to have the last laugh then I found the translation feature on the Kindle to be very useful for reading in a second language  You can load a translation dictionary so that when you touch a word in the book you re reading  you get its translation  If a translation isn t available  it defaults to a standard dictionary in the book s language  Sometimes that s even preferable  since it doesn t take your mind out of the language you re working in  I found that on average I probably looked up about as many words per page as I did for Ulysses  which is  ostensibly  in English  As far as the quality of the translation goes  I don t think my Italian is good enough to be too critical  I thought Manferlotti did a good job with Newspeak  especially with the fictional appendix at the end  It s a tricky thing to convey the sense of Newspeak in a language other than English  but it worked well One quibble   I thought the use of the word topo for  rat  was strange  especially given its importance to the story  That word makes me think of Mickey Mouse   Topolino    like in these comic books similar to those I remember at my grandparents  house years ago   The word ratto seems a lot closer to 1984 s not so benign rodent  which I picture more like this charming guy   This was my third attempt at reading this book if I remember correctly  and though I finished it took me quite a long time to do so  A couple months I believe  I kept getting bored and forgetting about it for a few days and then finding it  and forcing my way through more  knowing that this was one book I promised myself I HAD to finish whether I wanted to or not  I d say it was about the half way point to the beginning of the last quarter of it that I had trouble with  I just have three things to say  1  Oh man  am I glad I made myself finish this book  2  I was not expecting it to wind up being so shocking  horrifying  powerful  and burned into my memory  I tend to forget books and movies for them most part about a month after I finish them even if I really enjoyed them    which is why I stopped attempting to study history finally   3   WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A VAGUE SPOILER COMING UP NEXT  I literally felt sick to my stomach and finished the last quarter with my eyes wide open in horror and shock and was slightly traumatized for weeks after  Not over the graphic detail so much  I mean  a bit of course but that was not the point of my shock and horror   but just the powerful concept and story to it all that came together at the end in a way I was not expecting  I don t know if I should have been expecting that ending  but I wasn t and it shocked me and you know art is good when it is powerful enough to shock and traumatize  if that s the direction it was supposed to be going in   It left me thinking deeply and worrying deeply and understanding finally what all the fuss is about and I am so very glad I read this and will read it again  nh ltqr  lk  tqr  mn jdyd   Orwell s masterpiece to me  though Animal Farm is of course up there  So spare and lean without an ounce of fat on its bones  yet resonant beyond its short length  This book is  Important  which stops a lot of people from realizing it would otherwise be a nice  spooky Sci Fi tale  Beyond genre  and beyond apropos for any time and place  Orwell   such a brilliant visionnary   created this timeless masterpiece   for us to think about our world  and our values   what is truth  What s real and what s illusion  Can we really be free  how far would you go to be free   At what cost comes peace     its a book that everyone should read  Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood   The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you already know   What can you do  thought Winston  against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself  who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy   WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book  Gosh  probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I ve ever read  1984 should also be included in the horror genre 1984 describes a Utopia  Not Thomas More s version of Utopia  but this is one is the antithesis  i e  Dystopia  Imagine living in a country  whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen  in the most extreme ways  which make Hitler  Mao  Stalin and that old bloke in V for Vendetta look like sissies Working  eating  drinking  sleeping  talking  thinking  procreating   in short living  all are controlled by the state  Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police  telescreen  or even your children  who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities  Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself  since individualism is a crime The past is controlled  rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler  Who controls the past  controls the future  Who controls the present  controls the past  There is no real truth  The  truth  is what the state says it is  Black is white  2 2 5  if the state says so The world in 1984 is divided into three states  originated from the ashes from World War II  Oceania  British Isles  the Americas  Pacific  Australia   Eurasia  Europe   Russia   and Eastasia  the rest of it   Continuous warfare between those three  who hold similar ideologies  is required to keep the society s order and peace  Si vis pacem para bellum  That s describes the first slogan The second slogan  freedom is slavery  means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party  That way  you ll be indestructible and immortal Ignorance is strength  means the division on high  middle  low classes in society will never be changed  The middle wants to be the high and they ll act  on behalf of the low  to dethrone the high  Afterwards  a new middle class arises  all will change except the low  The high and middle make and uphold the law  the low  proletarian  is just too stupid to revolt  The state maintains its structure by torture  intimidation  violence  and brainwashing Blimey  Orwell s Animal Farm is already depressing  but 1984 gives  depression  a new meaning  at least for me  I first read this  as many do  in high school  Now  after 40 some years  I have come back and re read it  I m not sure how I got through it in high school  It s a wonderful dystopian novel  but it does bog down in parts  And the last 1 3 of the book is intense and terrifying and depressing  I was left sad and wrung out when I finished it My only issue is Orwell s dismissive attitude to the masses   the  proles   These are the salt of the earth people   the people who produce the food and make the clothes and furniture and necessities of life  He treats them as though they are unworthy of being mentioned or thought of   they are stupid animals  I know it s fiction  but somehow I think he truly looked down on the poor and uneducated  I also was bothered by the lack of religion   after only 40 years  there would still be pockets of true believers  Not everyone is a believer  but those few that are true believers would not give up their faith in God and in a better  after life so easily  Winston Smith is an average man living an average life    Other than the fact that he s living in a dystopian society in which  Big Brother  is always watching  Winston has frequent rebellious thoughts about the totalitarian government  which he writes about in his journal  in a nook in his apartment so that the telescreen can t see him  Other things exist in this society to oppress and control its citizens  such as the fact that if you think rebellious things  the Thought Police will catch you and execute you  In a society controlled by the government  will Winston be able to join the revolutionary Brotherhood group with his lover Julia  or will he succumb to the ideals of the leaders of the society In this classic novel by George Orwell  the utter concept of the book will have you turning page after page  It s twisted  creepy  and fascinating in every way Reviewed by  Emily B  I really  really enjoyed this book  It was so well written and I thought the story was really exciting  I especially loved the ending  even though that might be a weird thing to say  Well  This book Actually  I kinda confused to give how much stars to this book  Around 4 5  but let s  exactly enough  5 stars I confused about this novel  Sometimes I just wanna put it down  read another novel  maybe YA  no  always YA  actually  But I tell my self to  like   just give it a try   I did finished Animal Farm  even I have to forced myself to read it  cause task for college  but eventually  I enjoyed it  And it did the same with this book  After the story started to the conflict  it can t make me put it down         The thirty nine Winston Smith is one of employee of Departemen Catatan  Record Department   and also member of Partai Luar  Outside Party    In his country  Oceania  the holder of power fall to the Partai  Party   which is  as outline  divided into Partai Inti  Core Party    Partai Luar  Outside Party    and Proletariat  Winston always make  good  expression   good  body language  and really careful about what his thoughts But  for the last  he not really successful to eliminate that  Always  in his subconscious  he always can remember what Partai  Party   told them it s wasn t happen  He antipathy to Partai  Party  and Big Brother  and Polisi Pikiran  Mind Police  Conflict really happen  when piece of paper stuck to his hand when he helping a girl with black hair from Fiction Department It turns out  not only he  who felt that way Exceedingly  when Persaudaraan  Brothers   became  real  in his life          If I can compare it  just the politics  with The Hunger Games  Hunger Games became the fiction  and 1984 became the real life Kinda similar  I thought And this is more scarier than HG  if it s in true real life Well  let s hope in 2050  Orwell wrong  Minimal  about the Newspeak  No  about everything A  Terrifying and with an incredible real feel  especially after getting a live  glimpse  at the communism  Fun fact  Not sure how this thought came to mind  but I wonder if GRRM drew inspiration from The Party s torture methods for Reek s reeducation  Please  make sure you fully understand this book and what it holds between its pages before judging it This book will open your eyes  you ll realize while reading  how George Orwell s vision was and still coming true  Sizofrenik Bir Devlet Teroru Ornegi  1984Bir devlet dusunun   Hayali bir dusmani olsun  O nu ele gecirmek isteyen  Ve devlet bu dusmana karsi amansiz bir savas icinde olsun  Vatandaslarini her gun iki dakika nefrete tabi tutsun yayinlariyla  olur da meyletmesinler diye  Ya da vatandaslarini buharlastirmaktan cekinmesin  meyletmis olabilir diye  Bir devlet dusunun  Yurttaslarini her an ekranlardan gozetleyen  Tek amaci onlarin aklindan gecenleri de okumak olan bir devlet  En buyuk suclarin dusunce suclari oldugu bir devlet  Dusunmeyi engellemek icin her seyi yapmaya hazir  Dili kisirlastiran bir devlet  Cunku insanlar kelimelerle dusunur  Dusundurecek dili olmayan bir devlet  Yabanci dil mi  onu hic dusunmeyin zaten  Bir devlet dusunun  Sevgiyi yok eden  Aileyi sadece kendine bagli partili yetistiren bir endustri olarak goren  Bir devlet dusunun  Bilime dusman olan  Topraklarin hala sabanla suruldugu  Ama kitaplarin makineler tarafindan yazildigi bir devlet  Bir devlet dusunun   Gazetelerin kesinlikle karsilastirma yapmadigi  En dogrularin devlet baskani tarafindan yapildigini yazan  Hatta arsivlerini sik sik duzeltip devlet baskaninin dedigi olmus gibi hazirlayan  Bir devlet dusunun   En onemli guvenlik guclerinin dusunce polisleri oldugu  Uykuda sayikladiklarinizdan oturu cezalandirilabildiginiz bir devlet  Bir devlet dusunun  Dusunce suclularinin hemen oldurulmedigi  Once onlarin ne kadar yanlis dusunduklerinin onlara kendi inanclari olarak kabul ettirildigi  Daha sonra suclularin buyuk bir pismanlik icinde zaten olumu istedikleri  Ne kadar yanlis dusunmusum diye  Bir devlet dusunun  Surekli savasiyor gozuken  Halkini dinc tutabilmek icin onlari bombalamaktan bile cekinmeyen  Bir devlet dusunun   Evladin  babasini ispiyonladigi  Insanlarin makinelestigi ve sadece parti icin yasadigi bir devlet  Bu liste daha boyle uzar gider   Evet  George Orwell in 1984 unden bahsediyoruz  Bir devlet ki  Hobbes un Leviathan i gibi adeta bir canavardir  Orwell da devletin yeri geldigi zaman nasil bir canavara donusebilecegini olaganustu resmetmis  Iktidar arzusunun neler yaptirabilecegini anlatmis  Her zaman soylenen ozgurluk guvenlik dengesinin saglandigi terazinin kirilarak  guvenlik sizofrenisinin devletin uzerine coreklendigi zaman neler olabilecegini gostermis  Devleti frenleyen mekanizmalarin ne kadar onemli oldugunu  hesap verilebilirligin ve yargi gibi bagimsiz bir organin ne anlama geldigini anlamak ve dusunmek icin iyi bir kitap  What a compelling read  Or I should say listen  since I did the audiobook  Where do I start  I m still processing  I think  In some ways I wish I had read it since I don t feel like I really grasped some of the concepts like doublespeak right away  But by the end I think I got it  It just astounds me how prophetic so many things seem to be  especially when I m at my most cynical  The differences between why young Julia breaks the rules vs  why Winston is breaking them  for instance  Big Brother could be the NSA  or heck  even Facebook  The reason for the  war   good God that rings true  When I look at the divide between classes in America  and the suppression of the lower classes  and being a struggling middle class member myself     Not to mention the mind games the media plays  It all rings a warning bell  Oh yes  there is a lot to process on this book  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a desire to think about society and the way things can go horribly wrong  The damage that can be done by just going along with the status quo  In some ways 1984 is an outrageous exaggeration  but then when one looks at where we are today  the things that haven t come true are far more plausible given the things that HAVE come true  not precisely  but thematically  This is not a happy book  There isn t much action and it does not end with a happy ever after  It is thought provoking  and if you have nightmares after reading it  as I have  all the better  Crappy translation and numerous typos aside  I loved this book  There was something so powerful and unremitting about it  like a quiet  but ever present force  I could not put it down Orwell s nightmarish vision of the future  or  is it the past   kept me up and alert for hours  I barely slept or ate  Things like feeding my cat didn t seem so important anymore  How could they be when I feel like we ve narrowly escaped this bleak  horrible world described in the novel  A few maniacal propositions here  a bit of fire there  a few wrong choices  mix it well and add a dash of lunacy and there you have it    the perfect world  I m not exactly sure which frightens and shocks me the most   a world where literature is being rewritten and simplified  a world where language is being altered in horrible ways or a world where history is being rewritten and  in some cases  even completely destroyed  to the point of being rendered as non existent  Good or bad  history is history  It should not be touched  only learned from This domineering  totalitarian society reminds us of many past and present ones  However  the people in charge of it have taken their reign to a whole new level  Eliminating basic human emotions  suppressing natural human impulses  suffocating free will and exterminating all and any bonds of friendship and love among people  Turning children against parents  propagating hatred and violence and controlling all aspects of one s life  to the point where one has to discipline gestures  face movements and even thoughts  Reality is no longer what it is  but what they tell you it is  A chill ran down my spine just writing that sentence This is the bleak  depressing world the protagonist introduces us to  His greatest crime is buying a diary  a way of emitting his thoughts and ideas without constant vigilance and fear of being discovered and charged with  thoughtcrime   He is not sure himself why he has gone to all the trouble of buying a diary and keeping one  In time  he comes to realise that this life he and millions of others are living is not how it should be lived  He wants to educate younger generations the way older generations failed to educate and help him  A natural rebellion of the mind that quickly shifts into a rebellion of the body once he meets Julia  I loved the early scenes between them  I loved that they cursed and drank and ate the forbidden fruit  I loved that their love making was a political act of rebellion  I loved that they turned out not to be so similar after all  Variety is the spice of life  It can never truly be extinguished  People can never truly shut down their emotions and turn into robots  The human mind and the human spirit will always find a way to re emerge  even if one was taught to block humanity from the very beginning At least  that s what I strongly believed  And then I read the novel in its entirety and my jaw hit the floor  They got to him  In the end  they managed to break him and brainwash him and plant their own babies in there  I never  not even for one second  thought that it would happen  There wasn t even a possibility that allowed that in my mind  And yet they broke him  How  Isn t the human mind and spirit supposed to be impenetrable   Sticks and stones may break my bones  but regardless of what you do  you ll never be able to change my mind   or something like that  But  I guess I was wrong  Nothing s impenetrable  not even the mind In the end  we have a broken person  He is no longer the inquisitive  feisty rebel  he can no longer love  just thinking about certain things aches him  He has become a hollow shell  a mere shadow of his former self  He loves Big Brother  For the first time  he loves him for real  Hdhr  1984 qd tkwn sbban fy zyd  mywlk lntHry  nth    HbT bkl lmqyys Required reading in a world where txtspk is newspeak  where Wikipedia is the nascent Minitrue and telescreens are everywhere in every possible form  Big Brother is watching and we re never far from the next Two Minute Hate Sky News Update  It s funny when you know you ve read a book  can remember a few details  but have little or no memory of the book or when you read it  That s how 1984 was for me  I know I read it in either high school or college and it wasn t assigned reading  From the book  my main memory was actually from the final scene between Winston and Julia even though I could barely remember their love affair I don t know what my reactions were the first time reading this book  but this time I was amazed and saddened by the loss of freedom  It was one thing that the Party controls every aspect of their lives  but that they insist on controlling their every thought and emotion  I just can t imagine that freedom being taken away from me and it broke my heart to see how they broke Winston down until he did not even have one iota of himself left  It s a terrifying  but incredibly intelligent and beautiful book that everyone should read it   1984  is the classical dystopian novel by George Orwell  It portrays a world where government sees and controls everything  A planet with never ending war that is meant less for conquest than to channel the energies of the population away from the repressive powers that control them  A hell where even the wrong expression on your face can send you to prison  torture and death  A place where the truth of the past is systematically eradicated and revised and where even the people who remember historical events are confused as to whether their memory is correct  And where you can trust no one  not even your children who have been trained to reveal you to the authorities if they detect the slightest trend towards dissent Orwell started the novel at a time when the Nazi threat was receding and being replaced by totalitarian Communism  The Communist threat seemed to grow more bigger during the writing of the novel  Not only had almost all of Eastern Europe fell under the Communist yoke  but also even in the democratic West  there was a lot of sympathy for Communist ideas and parties that openly supported socialist ideas  especially nationalization of key industries  Clearly  Orwell imagined a slippery slope situation where the Anglophile countries would undergo a Communist makeover and become just as oppressive and controlling as the countries behind the Iron Curtain If the novel seems a little over the top  two things should be remembered  One is that Orwell was imagining a worst case scenario where government not only wants to destroy rebellion  but also force rebels to disown their ideas  Second is that many things mentioned in the book actually happened and still happen  albeit not at the same scale and not always together  Orwell s worries were about a socialist dictatorship and in the second part of the twentieth century  we saw the horrible disasters in the Soviet bloc and China that resulted in millions dead and displaced  Today  on a smaller scale  they happen in North Korea  At the same time  we also get to see religious fundamentalist regimes do similar things in Iran and Afghanistan  In all these cases  war  or cold war   torture  gulags  censorship  surveillance and other instruments of government power have been used to promote the ideology of those in power and to suppress any rebellious voices Notice I have not yet said a word about the plot  The reason is that the story is almost boringly simple  A man wonders if he can fight the government and then the government shows him the answer   Nineteen Eighty Four  is a book containing a very elaborate description of the future world and which uses the character of Winston Smith to bring it all together in a cohesive narrative  It is interesting that the entire novel is completely written from Smith s point of view  but still uses the third person  Part of me wonders if it was not originally written in the first person and then changed so that the ending is not predictable The good thing is that Orwell s predictions did not come true  Communism as the driver of government policy has been dismantled in most countries  More countries have been moving towards democracy  And while there have been setbacks in the form of various wars and conflicts  particularly the Middle East and Africa   humanity has seen enormous progress in reducing poverty and disease  It could all change  of course  After all  human nature still remain the same  But there is good reason for optimism and to cheer that we are not living in the world of 1984  This book was completely insane  It is the dystopic book to end all dystopic books without a single doubt  It is certainly up there among the most depressing books I ve ever read but the writing and the story structure was nothing short of brilliant  It is absolutely terrifying and makes me very grateful that I don t live under a totalitarian government  This is a world where sex is a political act  your thoughts are controlled  you live in a twenty four hour clock and the true history is eliminated  I m SO glad I finally picked this classic up  Firstly  the psychological manipulation and the lack of humanity of the people in this was terrifying Other than that  it was really good   I see why it s a favourite for English students  There are so so many themes to be analysed  so many symbols   for example  the symbol of big brother  a family protector  But in that 1984 world  families are not families in the traditional sense  so what would a  big brother  mean  Another similie I liked was one comparing a helicopter or something like that to a bluebottle   what a helpful way to envisage the story  But it was scary how the society  the existence of human beings had almost become obselete  There was no need to live  no real purpose in their lives apart from just existing  working  and hating the ever changing enemies of Oceania  Even the language was being whittled down  so all the many hundreds of lovely adjectives and words  with slight variants of meaning were being reduced to nothing  so reducing the ways of expression of the children and people in that society   although could it really be called a society This is a little spoiler  In these kinds of books   the hunger games  with Katniss Everdeen being the one that springs to mind  the people revolt against the government  and there s a revolution  the people win  But with this  you re prevented from ever thinking to  and if you do  what s the use of the actions of one person against the Party  Isn t that   the fact that you cannot do anything to escape or change your situation such a horrible thought To conclude this short short review  I ll probably reedit this at a later date  I d really really recommend this book as a must read   Cok etkilendim  5 yil once okusam fantezi derdim ama hem burada hem dunyada olanlar   belki de bendeki degisim  anlamlandirmami degistirdi  Korkunc bir kehanetin cogunun gerceklestigini saniyorum  Umarim yillar sonra tekrar okur ve o zaman cok karamsarmisim derim   I loved this portrait of a negative late twentieth century utopia by George Orwell  1984 is the story of Winston Smith  an  outer party  member who dislikes the Party  but tries to hide it  The Party is the controller of the section of the world he lives in  where they created an atmosphere of doublethink that harmonizes clear opposites  Thus  the Party s main slogans are  war is peace  freedom is slavery  and ignorance is strength   The Party s figure symbol is Big Brother  the looming dark mustached figure who sees all from behind the telescreen  And because there is nothing Big Brother can t see  the outer party members  like Winston  lead fearful and scrutinized lives  When the Party finds its enemies from within the party members  it takes no mercy  It tortures them until they confess everything that has ever happened in their life  converts them into loving the Party and Big Brother  and eventually kills them  I thought that this book was George Orwell s way of warning the people of the 1950s of what could befall on humans if they follow a socialist like path that leaves them all to be humans without individuality and imagination who only live to serve the government like the Party  One of the most scary parts was that even the kids were brainwashed in their little groups formed by the government called Spies  and they are even told to turn over their own parents for any type of thought crime  What was most interesting from this book is that there was a third class other than the inner party and outer party members  the proles  The proles were the masses that the Party propagated to believe in things that they  basically  made up  What is interesting about this group is that they are 85  of the population and are therefore the only people who can overthrow the Party and create a new government  as Winston wrote in his diary I would hate to live in this world  My journey to the dystopian world just began   1984  is happened to be not only one of the best works of George Orwell  it is regarded as one of the 100 best English Novels of 20th century  Nineteen Eighty Four is a treat for lovers of hatred  torment  torture  This is the first time I have ever had a taste of dystopian Novel  I considered myself lucky as I started with one of the finest types of it  This Novel presented the sheer picture of totalitarian society where the slightest idea of  Individualism  was absent and this was an unknown word to all  Instead of that  the  oligarchic collectivism  is the ultimate purpose of the society  The past had been altered and controlled according to the need of the ruling party  The individual memory is a matter of trifle  The freedom of speech was being shattered every second  Every individual was stalked by the thought police every single moment  The ruling party was controlled by a big man  they called him  Big Brother   His party was continuously injecting the idea of peace  slavery and strength into the blood of people in his own maneuvered way  The ruler was the ultimate source of power and everybody had to love them  Anybody ever went against them had to be disappeared or vaporized  There was no opposition against the ruling party  The story of this book is brilliantly constructed and told  The Protagonist of this book named  Winston Smith  kicked against the pricks  But  in doing so  he had to undergo path of dreadful anguish which I believe no one could put up with  Luckily  he was not vaporized  But  it was all right  everything was all right  He hated the party and its  foreman with abhorrence of the last extreme  The hatred against Winston Smith is not against him merely rather it was against those who would ever try to go against the tide  But  he couldn t victory over them and had to obey them till the final day of his death The most discerning pick of 1984 is the  Power  for which everyone was craving for and became voracious for  This craving for eternal power led to the founding of utter  Totalitarianism  in Oceania  The only longing thing is the  Power   Everything was being done for the retention of it  Here  the writer showed that the tyranny had been in the place for controlling everything which included human mind as well  This appealing Novel  written almost in lucid English  has the capacity of overwhelming someone with utterance negativity leaving no hope whatsoever  The writer manifested that the power should have been held with mass people  He presented all the possible solutions towards freedom  peace and strength yet ended the Novel with victory of evil over good  This pessimistic end of Novel with pessimistic thoughts of world once again will put anyone in the circle of never ending dystopia  In case of a Novel  there is always a protagonist and the writer always puts his or her protagonist in the scene for describing things from the standpoint of a person  Anything is not worth describing if it is not from the standpoint of a single person  This option of choosing an individual is capitalized for understanding and presenting the entireness of the society through the eye of an individual  George Orwell has proved himself as a maestro by capturing the horrific scenario of  Totalitarianism  through the eye of a mere common man  Mr  Orwell s analysis of the lust for power is one of the less satisfactory contributions to our enlightenment  and he also leaves us in doubt as to how much he means by poor Smith s  faith  in the people  or  proles    Smith is rather let down by the 1984 Common Man  and yet there is some hint that common humanity remains to be extinguished This dystopian Novel is one of the best works in its genre by any means and is a must read for people who adore this category  After reading this Novel  I wanted to go back to many of his other iconic writings and already put them in  to read list   I rejoiced in George Orwell s graceful and heart warming writings  Let s call it a day with a smile of utopian  LEANLO  AHORA   Now I will tell you the answer to my question  It is this  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake  We are not interested in the good of others  we are interested solely in power  pure power  What pure power means you will understand presently  We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing  All the others  even those who resembled ourselves  were cowards and hypocrites  The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods  but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives  They pretended  perhaps they even believed  that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time  and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal  We are not like that  We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it  Power is not a means  it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power  Now you begin to understand me   nh rwy  tqr  thm tqr  mn jdyd one of greatest English language novels  important in so many ways  for defying genre as book art manifesto politik  etc   for functioning as a work of art in the social political spheres of the real world  truly impressive feat unmatched by any novel since  I say this without thinking  i awarded this distinction arbitrarily simply because I can     Although the novel has so many IDEAS  the writing style and the dialogue and plot  etc  are not undermined or made irrelevant because the ideations occur at the level of the character  Winston  and at the level of the sentence overall plot  Characterization and action occur alongside Orwell s ideological intentions and expressions  an undefinable work of art that bridges the gap between literature and reality and between art and life  the book has too many dimensions and my entire understanding of what it is and what it represents are found only on the periphery of my consciousness  elusive to my grasping it so directly in order to transcribe it here  I will fail and fail and fail to say what needs to should be said about this book   This gets the 5 stars because it has no major flaws  yet I reckon it could be much better than it is  I consider it totally worth the time  except a couple of moments when the author gets carried away writing theory I read this book as a way to organize my own ideas and try another point of view  obviously you can t take all written here as truth but pretty much as an exaggerate truthWhat I learned with it  view spoiler   You can change the past eventually  pragmatically  changing the records of the past To change the past can change the present and the future The ultimate torture is to control the thoughts  Instead of doing a war or having a scapegoat to control the masses just emulate them  even easier to control the situation Let the smart join in and step on the stupid makes it easier The government type really doesn t matter  all humanity has always been in a similar pyramid The only way to have a equal society is to live all in the same step of the pyramid  which should have to be done by the lowest and wider step To change the pyramid power is needed  so the situation is bound to be stable  hide spoiler  If I had to describe this book with an image it would be for the quote If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face    forever 1984 by George Orwell is an amazing piece of artwork  The sheer power it holds behind it showing how much we rely on privacy and security in our everyday life s if a tale of it s own  Within recent years the book has been brought back into light with all the NSA and privacy on the internet talk  In 1984 you follow Winston who from the gecko is all ready feeling oppressed and denied liberty  In Winston s world free thought and self expressionism is not allowed and is prohibited by Big Brother  No matter how hard Winston tried to get away from the party he couldn t succeed with party spies  thought police  telescreens  and community policing  This was one of the most influential books on me  In this Orwellian totalitarian world that Orwell described thought isn t a free concept that just anyone can have your everyday people are limited by what they can choose to believe in and talk about due to the mass surveillance and thought police  Without these basic liberty s and human rights that we are given people won t continue to thrive and want to develop new ideas  Well the major concept often taken away from this book is that over surveillance is bad and people need freedom we still can take a lot from this  The main points that 1984 brings so us in the modern era is that security is a timeless matter it doesn t matter if you are fighting against an oppressive government or if you are trying to stop backdoor s into encryption  Orwell showed us that in governments were people no longer feel safe they are willing to linger to another person who feels the same way that they do  Often times this will be used against them like it was with Winston  1984 by George Orwell remains one of the books that I can reply to someone with 100  confidence that it had the biggest effect on me not only as a person but as a member of society   Orwell has written such a thought provoking book that kept me thinking long after I read the last page  I marvel at how he was able to get inside my head and change the way I saw things  While I was reading 1984  every question had an automatic answer   because the Party and Big Brother wants it that way   It was amazing how quickly Orwell took over my thoughts  Every word  every number  every detail was placed in precisely the way he wanted to give us as readers the feeling he wanted  It s crazy to think about the parallels to this dystopia that exist in the world today  Telescreens and security  vaporization and genocide  Newspeak and language   to name a few  This book made me angry  and it made me sad  but most of all  1984 made me think  It made me think of the relationships we have with other people and the trust involved  It made me think about love and the fact that every human being deserves it  It made me think about truth and lies  and how to stand up for what I believe in  Orwell is such a great author to have put all those messages for me in one relatively short book  The paradoxes in the Party slogans made me think even more  In the beginning of the book  I just got angry at how the Party thought they could take away basic rights so easily  But as the book went on  I realized how these slogans could be true  I may not have liked them  but they DO make sense in a twisted sort of way  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time  It s a classic  and now I understand how it has become relevant to every period in time  Every day there are new connections you could make between the world and Orwell s imaginary world of Oceania  All people can learn from this book  and I definitely did  It made me rethink my life and why I did things  Did I do this because wanted to  or because society told me I should  I will now carefully examine every action I take before I go through with it  1984 changed the way I think  and its influence will never go away  Far from cheery   but a great book  I m currently teaching this book in my English 12 class and it sparks the most interesting discussions in my class   Well that was genius and terrifying and wow  I don t really know how I feel about the ending because I m not sure I understand it s significance  but I ll be studying it in English soon so I guess I ll find out    ktbt fy GsTs 2013  n hdhh lrwy  l tHtj l  ryfyw    wlknh tHtj llqr  kl ftr  Ht  nZl mtdhkryn

is Nineteen Eighty Four about    and let them talk People I would not want to talk to will tell us it is all about how every action we make is watched and monitored and how we are nailed the second we step out of line  And for certain  this does happen in the novel  In fact  it can be rightly argued that as Winston goes further and further out of line  the powers that be just keep watching him and waiting for the right moment to really put the boot in  But if one carefully analyses the work  one notices something very  very interesting Surveillance is only a minor detail in the world Orwell creates That probably surprises a lot of people unfamiliar with the work  but when one realises this critical point  one is deserving of congratulations  a pat on the back  Because now they are ready to really start reading Nineteen Eighty Four One of Winston s early adventures in the story concerns itself with his attempts to mingle amongst the  proles  and ask older proles about what life was really like before Ingsoc and Oceania  Were people really as miserable as Ingsoc propaganda proclaims  Did people really live in universal poverty whilst  capitalists  stepped on their heads  This question of comparison between this society that tells him  we are better than the old way and you better believe it or else  and the old  forgotten society that Winston is so desperate to find confirmation about is the first of many clues to what Orwell was really talking about Winston has a small handful of people he talks to at his day to day work  Probably the most important of them is a man who works on the parameters of what English will eventually be replaced with  English is renamed Oldspeak in what is called Newspeak  the language that the Party intends to replace it with  Newspeak is deliberately designed to not only be possible for the speaker to speak without any emotional or thought level connection to the words coming out of their mouths  but also to limit the parameters of thought itself That  ladies and gentlemen  is what Nineteen Eighty Four was really about Consider if you will the word  Ingsoc   the ideology that the Party is driven by  In Oldspeak it would be rendered  English Socialism   and all of the attendant questions would be stimulated by the sound of the words  What is England  What is Socialism  And so on  These questions  when answered  would prompt further questions  and on it goes until thoughts that are not merely contrary to the ideology of Ingsoc occur  Some of the thoughts that these words can stimulate would prompt a desire on the part of those thinking them to destroy  tear down Ingsoc  So Ingsoc s Party helpfully creates a word for us that bypasses any emotional or intellectual stimulus  and helpfully tells us that we had better start learning to use this word and nothing else  or else we might disappear  completely Remind you of anybody Winston s day job is to change records of past events to reflect whatever reality the Inner Party wants to be current  If Oceania is at war with Eurasia and allies with Eastasia  then every newspaper  historical record  and file must reflect this  Even if it means that Winston and every hapless coworker he has in this job must rewrite the same record multiple times over to reflect this new reality  He even receives communications during the course of his work about old revisions he made  His old article is scolded by the bosses as  refs unpersons  and  doubleplusungood  and so forth  The narrative even explains to us that without Newspeak  the messages would inform him that his old work is  highly unsatisfactory  and  makes references to non existent persons   I am uncertain of whether Orwell intended for his work to reference this fact or if it were just a  un happy coincidence  but Humanity is literally overflowing with idiots who would not notice that he is referencing the mechanic of how one truly controls people  It is not sufficient to just put people in chains and give them orders  No  you have to physically and psychologically reinforce that the chains are the natural order of things and that they are in these chains for a reason other than people put them there  An author concerned with the subject of slavery wrote that if you control a man s thoughts you need not concern yourself with his actions  Orwell takes this to its logical conclusion  if you control the language available to a man  you have complete and utter control of his thought process  Even today  we are seeing people attempting to control thought process through language   Person with   and so forth Some people are so dense  so committed to believing what they want to believe or what they are told to believe  that they fail to notice something very peculiar about Nineteen Eighty Four  The last ten or so pages of the novel  after we learn of Winston s ultimate fate and the ultimate horror of Oceania  explain further the principles of this strange new language  We are told how the vocabulary is deliberately split into three distinct families with very distinct purposes  who uses words from each family  and why the people who use these words use them Put simply  if Orwell had known just how stupid people would get a mere half century after his death  he would have instructed publishers to print  THIS STORY IS ABOUT HOW THE SCOPE OF YOUR WORLD IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF WORDS TO EXPRESS CONCEPTS   only dumbed down into words that those surveillance focused mouth breathers can understand on literally every page And I have not even begun to discuss the story itself yet In Oceania  we are told  we have a class structure with the Inner Party  the Outer Party  and the proles  What we are not told  and I suspect Orwell did this on purpose  is who ultimately benefits from the squalor and deprivation that every Oceanic individual lives in  Which ultimately brings both the audience and Winston to ask his Inner Party interrogator the ultimate question  Does Big Brother  the figurehead of the Party  the source of many an above mentioned idiot s confusion concerning what the story is about  exist  When the question is asked  the interrogator  the only individual Winston meets who appears to have any capacity to provide a definitive answer  does not appear to properly understand the question on first try  The Party exists  Ingsoc exists  ergo Big Brother exists  But Winston displays why he is the protagonist in this story  essentially  he is a little too smart for his own good  and asks the interrogator the same question with a different phrasing  Ultimately  he asks the way a scientist would ask  I occupy a space in the physical universe that nobody else can occupy at the same time  breathe air  drink water  eat food  piss  shit  and so forth  In that sense of existing  does Big Brother exist  The interrogator never gives a real answer  simply dismissing the question as irrelevant But there are real figures alleged to have existed on our world that also behave or are held by others in a similar manner to Big Brother  It is illegal under penalty of torture  psychological destruction  and eventually death to not love Big Brother  Big Brother is held to be responsible for everything the Party wants you to believe is good  and if you do not believe it to be good  see above   Big Brother is held to have rid the world of all manner of evils and problems that you will suffer the above fate for acknowledging are still very much present and accounted for  Fornication is now your duty to the Party  to produce a new generation of Party members who will go on living by the above  But if you should happen to feel anything about the individual you happen to be fornicating with  well  again  see above There are people from a part of the world that I will not name here who will murder people for pointing out how similar the above  Big Brother  looks to the historical figure that they will have us love and accept and bow down at the  feet  of or else That has always bugged me about Nineteen Eighty Four  Is Big Brother a religious figure no different from the other religious figures  not existing in the present and of dubious historical evidence at best  Or is there a living individual who makes all of the decisions at the very top of the party  who gets swapped out upon death  and is ultimately just known as Big Brother  Orwell s genius in this part of the story is that although the story is satisfying without needing to know the answer to this conundrum is  beyond its real world connection I am trying to reference   one could fill a book with theorems about whether this figurehead exists in the literal sense that Winston asks after  Big Brother does not need to watch you when you so intensely believe he is watching you that you start asking yourself if the colour and consistency of your droppings is pleasing to him Julia is simultaneously the most confounding and most interesting character in Nineteen Eighty Four  Nobody s exact age is ever revealed in the story  but she is easily the most exuberant and  youthful  character the story offers  Orwell was keenly aware that the combination of legal majority and youth brings a great desire to explore and discover what is possible in the world proper  After a fashion  he even expresses this knowledge through Julia s mouth  You want to have a good time  the Party wants to stop you from having it  Although this summary is a misunderestimation of the Party s true motives  Julia does at times like these give us an interesting window into how people born into this thought in a box world might respond to it  The immediate  unerring compliance that many think will occur is instead met with a  okay  I will follow you as far as I need to before I can get a little break and enjoy myself  sort of response  Julia s purpose in the story is both to provide the audience with a glimmer of hope that this abyss Humanity has fallen into is not permanent  and demonstrate that there is a root of rebellion that that perhaps bring the Party down if stoked correctly But this is an Orwell novel  and Orwell novels are about Human nature  Possibilities like Julia have not only been thought of well in advance  they have been incorporated and planned for in the programme  During the interrogation  we are given faint hints as to how this process is going for Julia  and they are not pleasant  The interrogator tells us they have never seen someone  come over  so quickly  and whilst there is the possibility that he is just telling Winston this in order to further soften him up  the scene late in the novel where they meet up once more for the final time suggests that she really has broken as quickly and utterly as suggested A final test of audience stupidity is offered early on in the story when Winston is writing his reflections  He writes a date in the journal  ending it in the year Nineteen Eighty Four  Idiots will proclaim oh  that year was long ago  the danger has passed us by  This relates to one of my favourite rules about writing fiction set in the future  If you feel a need to be specific about the date when the events are taking place  then do  but explain first in a plausible manner how the world got from where the reader sits to what the reader is reading  Orwell delivers a king hit when writing that the year is Nineteen Eighty Four  Because everything in the records is falsified and then made truth with the  believe this or else  technique  as he himself reflects internally  Winston has no sodding idea what year it really is  It could well be twenty nine eighty four for all he knows to the contrary Although with the way people with near monopolies over the flow of information announce alliances with  charities  determined to exterminate people who are hard wired to think differently  there is still a great probability that Winston was really living a scant few years from now   It cannot happen here  is a phrase one should expect to hear in a place where  it  will happen For an English author living in the early to mid twentieth century  Orwell understood the Human animal a lot better than a lot of the Human animals of today ever will  ln ykwn hnlk fn  w  db  w  lm  fHynm tjtm  fy ydyn kl sbb lqw  ln tkwn bt Hj  l  l lm  kkm

genius  I remember being enamored with this book in high school  ANIMAL FARM is the superior satire  but  hey  you really can t get by in life without reading 1984  It s kind of like the reduction ad absurdum of all modern political discourse  What to say about 1984  I ll keep it brief  my mind might explode were I to illustrate all of the complex parallels drawn and comparisons made in one of Orwell s finest novels  Though the story may seem character central at first  we become aware that Orwell is conveying a message  or better  a warning  concerning the dangers of Totalitarianism  It is an alternate reality  showing the extreme side of the totalitarian ideology  if it wasn t extreme enough  I feel that one would enjoy this novel even more  were they to have a brief  or even in depth knowledge  of Stalinist Russia  I do not wish to spoil this book  but I would entreat anyone with any interest in Orwell  or the philosophies that dictate societal structure to read this incredible book   mdhhl  hdhh lrwy  wmkhyf    w kthr m  dhshny  nh nshrt fy  m 1949   lknh lzlt tSf b Dan mm fy wq n lm Sr ll sf  I ve delayed my final review for about 3 weeks to have enough time thinking how I could use my mere words to describe such powerful  insightful and great a book George Orwell s 1984 was in every possible way able to entertain and impress me  This novel could fill it s reader with doubt yet amazement during the reader s journey of reading it You can t help but smell the lousy smell of Oceania and live through it s people s struggle and control your thought in order to prevent it from any thought crime while reading through the pages of the novel  You can t help too but feel you re being watched by Big Brother s watchful gazing eyes  You ll be more thrilled with every page as your journey goes With no monstrous amount of description for the world he created  save that of Newspeak   Orwell could make it very familiar to the reader and could easily indulge us in his story I can t fail to mention that the story till now embodies and represents what many major powers do nowadays in every single aspect  So it d be totally normal if  during your reading it  you thought that it was just written in the last decade Finally  I ve really enjoyed this masterpiece and I d like to recommend it to everyone regardless the preference  age and gender  Asi si vale la pena leer

possa cambiare  che vale la pena lottare  ma ogni sua illusione viene drasticamente calpestata  spezzata  schiacciata brutalmente Attonita  mi sorge la domanda piu inquietante  e fantascienza o realta   Como posso ter lido tantos livros antes deste  nao sei  Da primeira a ultima pagina  George Orwell cativou me com a sua visao de um mundo totalitario assente em regimes verdadeiros  mas com um enorme laivo de imaginacao e hipnotismo no que respeita ao relacionamento social e politico  A semelhanca de  Animal farm   o autor brinda nos com uma critica profunda ao totalitarismo e a pior face da natureza humana  numa narrativa tao fria e crua que nao pude deixar de imaginar o que sera viver num regime tao estrito  1984   comeca por nos dar a conhecer a sociedade onde o protagonista  Winston Smith  vive  Atraves dos seus olhos  conhecemos rapidamente a forma opressiva em que Londres vive e lida diariamente  nomeadamente na capacidade de esconder emocoes e de agradar ao Partido das mais variadas formas e sempre sobre o olhar atento dos seus trabalhadores  Ao longo da historia  questionamo nos acerca da existencia do Grande Irmao e dos verdadeiros ideais de quem rodeia Winston  embora percebamos rapidamente que poucas ou nenhumas hipoteses ha de contornar um sistema tao rigido e com tantos olhos  Na verdade  Winston tenta lutar contra o sistema e opta por pertencer a minoria que lutara durante decadas ou seculos  se necessario  para alcancar a liberdade do povo Desde a criacao de ministerios com objectivos especificos para controlar e castigar a populacao  a construcao de um Partido omnipresente no tempo e no espaco  a transicao para um idioma novo  a recriacao permanente do passado e a capacidade de adaptacao das pessoas atraves do controlo assente no medo e no castigo  George Orwell demonstra nos que qualquer mensagem e passivel de ser transmitida atraves da linguagem mais simples e com os formatos mais banais  O rompimento com o actual idioma  a actualizacao permanente do passado  a observacao atenta pelos ecras e o desaparecimento de revolucionarios traduz pura e simplesmente o objectivo de controlar o pensamento e de criar uma sociedade feita a medida e o autor consegue faze lo de forma cativante e inesquecivel Ao longo do livro  apercebemo nos da forma minuciosa como Orwell criou e estruturou a historia  e complexa e quase tangivel  E dotada de infimos pormenores e nao deixa escapar qualquer resposta  E um retrato da sede de poder e de controlo e da obediencia e disciplina  No fundo  e uma visao arrepiante e nao tao longe da realidade quanto isso  E um livro a ler    e reler  I am a fool for not reading this sooner  I read Animal Farm and enjoyed it and then just forgot about Orwell  Fool move  I agree This book is a revelation  An unpleasant  depressing  horrible  painful revelation  I find if difficult to believe that a book written so long ago could make complete and utter sense today  years and years later  But make sense it does  Too much sense 1984 leaves you with a sinking feeling of despair and self awareness  George Orwell was a mad genius and a prophet  rolled into one  This book will stay with you  Forever  Because what is more permanent than the realisation that there is no hope  no good  nothing  Big Brother is ALL  Orwell s predictions are spot on  All of his theories about how in the future there is no privacy and no freedom are true  If you are in any way interested in a book that will question almost every thing about our lives  then this is the book for you  And as for me  I m frankly scared of what the world has come to  You ll realize this once you read 1984   Orwell said it himself  The best books    are those that tell you what you know already   This is one of those books that consumes your energy and make you reconsider your opinions about life  manipulation in different forms of government and triggers a range of emotions from frightment to pure anger  This is by far the best and the worst novel I have ever read  Furthermore  I was quite impressed about the tough circumstances Orwell was in when writing it  struggling a terrible illness and still he managed to deliver such a masterpiece  Albeit  I believe the title  The last man in Europe  would ve been more suitable   1984  ONE OF THE MASTERPIECES OF ALL TIME  AMID MY TOP THREE another PERFECT work of art MIND F  K   When you think it s over   but you read   the principle of new speak      I remember when I was in 7th grade my baby sitter who was 17 at the time asked me my thoughts on this book for a book report she was doing  She had told my mother she was doing the book report  and my mother said it was one of my favorites  so she asked me about it  I felt So Cool  I remember I got it from a used bookstore we used to go to  either at the suggestion of my  older  best friend at the time  or my mother  I can t remember  now  This is the first adult book I ever obsessively read and reread  I did so because it s awesome  but also because of the sex scenes  I thought somehow     people would know that I was just reading the sex scenes over and over again  so I reread the entire book multiple times  It is still a book I reread occasionally  but not for the sex scenes  This book has probably impacted my thinking more than any other book  In particular  there s the scene where  spoilers  O Brien has him strapped down  post torture  well  I suppose this is part of the torture   Anyway  O Brien has him strapped down  and he s trying to convince Winston that he  O Brien  can float  I think   He says  well  if I believe I floated up out of this chair and hovered in the air  and you believe it too  then it makes no difference whether I actually did or not  BAM  Changed everything for me  I mean  what do you even SAY about goddamn 1984  other than recount personal memories of it  The book 1984  written by George Orwell  tells of a society that is much like an exaggerated version of the 21st century  New ideas are not welcome  and whatever the Party  government  says is what happens and what has always happened  Oceania  the protagonist Winston Smith s home  is at war with Eastasia  When allies are switched and Oceania and Eastasia are no longer at war  all the books  written records  papers and newspapers are changed to say that Oceania was never at war with Eastasia  instead it has always been fighting against Eurasia  All the citizens of Oceania are brainwashed to believe exactly what all the written records say  and anyone who thinks otherwise is accused of thoughtcrime  which is believing is something other than what the government says  They are then sent to the Ministry of Love  which is in reality a place where they torture people who commit thoughtcrime  These people are tortured until they believe what the government say  and then they Vanish  No one is allowed to ask questions about where they went  because all the written records of that person are destroyed so that no one can find any proof that they ever existed  Big Brother is the head of the Party  and everyone should look up to and worship him  even though no one has ever seen what he really looks like  Winston Smith  a man who is around his 50 s  does not believe in the ideals of the Party  but he goes on with life because there is no other alternative  except torture   It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage   is what Winston told himself when he wanted to rebel  Orwell 73   One day  Winston falls in love with a girl named Julia  and they meet each other in secret until they discover a secret society that is against the Party and Big Brother  called the Brotherhood  The Brotherhood is led by a man named O Brien  who gives Winston a book that says how a proper member of the Brotherhood should act  Julia and Winston keep meeting in clandestine  until one day they are both arrested for committing thoughtcrime  The person who arrested them was O Brien  He put them in separate buildings  and tortured each one until they treasured Big Brother and accepted everything the Party said  O Brein used reasoning such as  we  the Party  control all records  and we control all memories  Then we control the past  do we not    Orwell 667   Winston began deteriorating  to such an extent that when they released him he was fat  alcoholic and smelly  He saw Julia again  but she was disappointed in him and they no longer loved each other  The book 1984 by George Orwell shows what our society would be like if people weren t free to think what they want   1984 by George Orwell is a book of political fiction  propaganda and social issues  The book was about a place controlled by a party that only gave some privileges to their people  The main character of the book is a man that goes against the political party in control because he doesn t like the party and wants change In addition  I enjoyed this book mainly because of how detail it was and how it explained the theme and setting  All the points that the main character believed in was well explained  Another reason I enjoyed this book was because the politics involved with the book  After reading this book I highly recommend it to people who enjoy political rebellion and also people who enjoy being mind blown  Arguably Orwell s greatest work and most famous dystopian novel  1984 was truly a profoundly impacting experience  The story is set in Airstrip One  an alternate communist version of the United Kingdom  The main protagonist  Winston Smith  starts questioning the dogmas of Ingsoc  English Socialism  and of its enigmatic  Draconian leader  Big Brother  All citizens of Airstrip One  which has been annexed along with its empire by the US  are constantly surveilled by the Thought police through a never stopping TV called the Telescreen  Winston ends up growing more and more skeptical about the Party and ends up defying its orders by entering a relationship and trying to enter the Brotherhood  a rebellious organization formed by one of the party s ex foremost leaders during the revolution  Winston ends up being tricked and is captured by the Thought police and is tortured until he loves Big Brother  1984 is a magnificent novel that provides lots of food for thought  Orwell never clearly states if Big Brother really exists  if the entire world has really converted entirely to communism  or if even the Brotherhood is real  Everything we know is through what Winston perceives and through the doctrines of the Party  The state of living that is described in the novel is a remarkably similar to what individuals felt in the U S S R   and the gloomy mood set forth by the author creates quite a vivid feel of Communism in general  The ending was quite unexpected and was worth the read  Overall I would recommend this classic to anyone and is one of my favorite all time books  Mind boggling  slightly disturbing  illuminating  and amazingly accurate  A novel that makes you think about what you think you re thinking Before reading the book  I was well aware of the entire plot of the novel down to its conclusion  thanks to  Video Sparknotes  on YouTube  However  the summary did not suffice to illustrate the revolutionary concept  and purpose  of the novel  It was beautifully written  The detailed descriptions of situations  train of thought of the protagonist  and the justifications of  the other side  will immerse you so much that it will disturb your beliefs  and also provides the opportunity for self evaluation   induce opposition  protest and passion in your head  and appreciation of the reality you re in The idea that humans can be controlled  manipulated  and dehumanized in such the manner described in the novel is frightening  I have found myself continually evaluating our present society  appreciating  and promising myself to properly and responsibly exercise  the gift of free will  and questioning the very definition of  truth  and what it encompasses  If the human race would happen to fall into such a state wherein the moral compass of the people deemed as leaders are egregiously flawed  yet somehow justified   I could only hope that human nature  instinct  and religion would prevent us from plummeting to chaos PS  After reading the novel  I m quite certain that a visit to sparknotes  skimming through chapter summaries and analyses  will help ease your pain     Mi novela favorita de toda la vida  Maravillosa de principio a fin  Una maravilla distopica que narra la brutalidad de la dictadura y la cultura del miedo que te lleva a dejar de pensar por ti mismo y obedecer ciegamente lo que te dicen que debes pensar  Una poblacion que idolotra a un personaje que pareciera ser imaginario y al mismo tiempo ser omnipresente y mirarlo todo  Este libro es una metafora de muchas cosas  del culto al heroe  de la censura periodistica  del miedo  de los regimenes autoritarios Pero a mi  personalmente lo que mas me gusta es que pese a que su eje central es una novela de ciencia ficcion  de transfondo pone una  historia de amor  tal vez solo de sexo   El personaje principal  alguien con quien la mayoria de los hombres nos podemos identificar  un tipo con complejos  no el tipico pretty boy valiente  sino un hombre muy realista  inseguro con su cuerpo tiene varices y dentadura postiza  pese a todos sus defectos en su mente pasan ideas maravillosas  que logran interesar a una mujer muy atractiva  por su manera independiente de pensar  Para mi una obra maestra  pese que a muchos les puede aburrir  pues carece de escenas de accion  Pero he ahi su grandeza  pues los dialogos son magistrales  Nosotros somos los muertos  Nuestra verdadera vida esta en el futuro  Formaremos parte de el como polvo y astillas de huesos  Pero ese futuro quizas dure mas de mil anos  Por ahora solo podemos ir extendiendo el area de la cordura de poco a poco  Amava il Grande Fratello  Ogni volta che penso a questa frase di chiusura un brivido mi scorre lungo la schiena  Assieme al piu soft Fahrenheit 451 di Bradbury e uno di quei romanzi che ogni giorno potrebbe diventare realte  Da leggere  I have FINALLY read this book  Sometimes when a book is recommended to you so many times  one feels one already knows enough about it  and therefore actually reading it is not important It seems I was deeply wrong The good  It works as a novel   surprise   Unlike Starship Troopers  which is 10  novel and 90  rant  1984 is roughly 65  novel and 35  rant  Orwell has the gift of describing characters  Everyone is vivid  Everyone has a visual presence in the mind s eye  The characters also speak like real people  in informal dialogues  Very well structured  Each of the 3 parts has a distinct feel and the transitions turn on unexpected plot twists that provide impetus for the reader to keep reading  Orwell has the skill of a seasoned mystery novelist  The primary horror is not the surveillance  or even the lack of freedom  but the concept of double think  Something that most fans do not underline enough imo   The ending is utterly and totally complete The bad  possibly   A significant portion of first half is probably the product of some kind of male adolescent fantasy   especially since Winston doesn t seem like a very sexy bloke  It s almost Twilight for men    The sections from  the book  are a unapologetic exercise in heavy handed exposition and wall of text infodumping  I don t really mind this though since the prose is well written and densely packed with content  Winston s inner thoughts are often shocking for the sensibilities of the modern reader  He displays partial misogynist thoughts  somewhat subverted later in the novel  and definite misopedic thoughts  This book has definitely made some people TOO PARANOID  I mean  get a grip  The world is bad  but it s not this bad yet  Don t feed the luddites I suppose what impressed me most is the energy and liveliness of 1984  I was expecting a dry and grim  prophecy  for the morbidly minded  and instead  I got something mysterious and soul stirring  O Brian is the best character here and   I think I like him even more than a certain character in Fahrenheit 451  it s a spoiler to say who    I love to hear a good rant once in a while  I have always wanted to read 1984  It s one of those books that everyone seems to buzz about now and again   and with increasing intensity as time has rolled on  I cannot imagine a time before now when it has been more relevant or applicable  I read this in two days flat  and it is safe to say that I have never read a more hauntingly creepy book  While seeming an eerie echo of a disturbing sci fi inspired nightmare  it is also vaguely familiar  The telescreens  the surveillance  the continuous war  the inequality and the Thought Police    It all remains in my mind like a horrible idea of a probable version of the future  and I just cannot shake off the dread  It inspires hope  but it also invokes despair  Hopelessness  It provides ammunition for the time ahead  when we are inevitably going to face increasing levels of desperation and depression  if we do not manage to make some changes to the structure of society   and our perception of the world  I have earmarked many pages in this book for future reference  and one paragraph struck me in particular  If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies  The sealed world in which he lives would be broken  and the fear  hatred and selfrighteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate    p  204 I highly recommend reading 1984  It is a wretched  damned thing but it is necessary  However   do so at your own risk  There may be night terrors to come   Also  I listened to Pink Floyd s  The Wall  while reading  and it has proven a near perfect soundtrack   For the past few weeks  ever since I started reading 1984  I have burrowed myself into a literary hole  My main topic of conversations has been 1984  My thoughts have all been 1984  My dreams have been 1984  My life has been 1984 Yeah  I m aware that everybody says that about books they love  But one never seems to understand it until it happens to them  or at least that goes for me  I have been completely absorbed by the terrifying world of 1984  and throughout the pages have been putting myself into it  simply because I have found it impossible not to do so For those of you who don t know  1984 is the story of a totalitarian future where the country of Oceania is watched by Big Brother  an unknown and mysterious figure  and the Party  an organization and government that handles everything  Hellbent on destroying any rebellion  they have created the notion of Thoughtcrime  which practically explains itself   from subtle facial movements to words uttered while sleeping  Thoughtcrime is punishable by death  and  for those with original thoughts   they have invented Room 101   the worst place in the world  Winston is a man living in the world of 1984  who works for The Party  He has always questioned the morals of the society  but until he finds love with Julia  another Party worker  he has never done anything about it  I can t reveal anything more because if I did I would be committing the greatest crime in novel history   spoiling a really good book  So I ll leave it at that 1984 seems all too real  and is definitely one of the most disturbing and terrifying books I have ever read  yet not in a Stephen King or Clive Barker kind of way  It is terrifying in the sense that it actually raises the thought of a future that is exactly like the one Orwell so brilliantly depicts  What if our every move is governed by some sort of secret God figure  and any act of rebellion can lead to your deepest  darkest fears  It is that constant sense of being watched that is most scary  that if we even sneeze in public  or exercise an innocent nervous tick  that single act might be the cause of our death  But other than this  how can we prove that we are the ones in the right  If  according to The Party  2   2   5  how can we possibly prove that it is wrong  Orwell explores those questions in the novel  more towards the end  and when Winston asks these questions  so does the reader  If an all powerful government tells us that our memories are false  that the one memory we have of our childhood didn t actually happen  how can we question it  In this society  The Party controls the present  and in controlling the present it also seems to control the past  When the Thought Police take someone away for an act of thoughtcrime  they have from that moment on never existed  If they don t exist in the present  this must mean they don t exist in the past  and there is no way of proving that theory wrong   the only way we see the world is through our own minds  So if the past has already occurred  then it doesn t exist now  and in another famous 1984 term  doublethink   this means it never existed in the first place  Food for thought  huh Orwell writes the novel at the perfect pace  He never takes too much time to explain anything  yet is descriptive enough to be both captivating and remarkably intelligent  And I can say that not often is a book both brilliant and extremely entertaining  most of the time you must pick either one  But Orwell  oh Orwell  you seem to juggle both functions magnificently  For that  its disturbing familiarity  and the altogether emotional explosion this book entails  1984 will continue to be read  and become more and more powerful as time goes on and Big Brother becomes even more relevant to our society   Being 21  I wondered how i got on without ever reading it before Now that I have  I must say  it was one of the most extraordinaryliterary experiences I encountered  Orwell s novel  with its portrayal of the future negative utopia coming from a time still scarred by totalitarianism  strikes me for its originality  its modern style  and the way that its futuristic portrayal finds a match in today s media crazed world  A work that will inspire many generationsof writers  but certainly not only writers   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Those are the three tenets of George Orwell s uber dystopian world of Oceania  which is a mash up of UK  the Americas and Australia  1984 is Orwell s disturbing image of a post World War II future where he thought democratic values wouldn t survive  Instead  we have the Party led by this dude called Big Brother  if you thought the show was annoying  wait till you get a load of this  and there are  telescreens   which are just TVs spouting government propaganda and spying on your actions 24 7  The world is divided into Party members  Inner and Outer  and the  proles   which  if any of you have ever heard of Marx  is pretty self explanatory  Harry Potter fans  think Deathly Hallows and Magic is Might   Except the fact that these uneducated proles are 85  of the population and they are effectively controlled by the Party by no concrete regulations since there are no laws in this world  The only wrong you can do is  Thoughtcrime   and that too can only be done by Party members  If caught  all traces of you existing will be destroyed and you will be vaporized or turned into an  unperson   Frightening yet cool Our hero  for lack of a better word  is Winston Smith  a morose  paranoid  frail 39 year old who is an editor in the Minitrue  Ministry of Truth   where he falsifies historical records to keep up with the ever changing party line and deleting the existence of people who have been vaporized  secretly hoping for an invitation to the Brotherhood  the hush hush anti government organisation  Just like Joseph Stalin used to airbrush his  fallen comrades  from photographs and remove their names from books and newspapers  Constantly being forced to rewrite it  Winston is fascinated by the past and makes clumsy attempts what truly happened  either by talking to really old drunks in prole bars or going to antique shops and buying journals and coral paperweights  Total badass He falls in love with Julia  a hot member of the Junior Anti Sex League  Yes  they existed  because in this world one of the Party s aims is to take the joy out of sex  Children are born through  artsem  and as soon as they grow up they join this terrible organisation called the Spies where they get to listen in on doors and report suspicious activities of adults they don t like  Try making your kid eat veggies now  Mom  Anyway  Winston and Julia have the oddest ever  He dreams of raping and killing her and she falls passionately in love with him by stalking him  Total fairy tale romance  They have sex in hidden meadows and bombed churches before  finally  getting a room  And real bread and jam  And coffee with real sugar  And Winston gets invited to join the brotherhood with his own copy of the manifesto and all Wait a minute  I thought they were living in a super surveillance state in a state of perpetual war  Yes  they still are  Except apparently Winston s been having the biggest lucky streak of his life and never thinks to question it  Then he gets caught  Shocker  Which is when the real fun begins in the Ministry of Love  aka Miniluv  LOL   Starvation  Beatings  Torture  Betrayal  And  RATS  The book is rife with symbolism from wartime Britain and Russia bashing  For instance  Oceania changing allies when it suited them  Russia and Nazi Germany   Goldstein being a facsimile of Leon Trotsky  animal transformations and all and Big Brother as Stalin  The Thought Police could be the NKVD  Even the lovely contractions are derived from Mother Russia  Dialectical Materialism DiaMat   The slogan  Our  new happy life  a copy of  Life has become better   Personally  I think of NaMo s  Achhe din aa gaye  Jokes aside  I think 1984 is one of the most well written and chilling books I have ever read  Orwell  a democratic socialist at heart  has brilliantly demonstrated the perils of authoritarianism  Written in the immediate aftermath of World War II  it shows a chilling view of the future as a place where the language has been pared to so great an extent that it only serves the purpose of officialdom and people have been reduced to being tools of the Party  The  proles  are nothing more than the silent masses subjugated to the elites  Your thoughts  your home  your family  your leisure time are all subject to constant surveillance and you like it  It shows how the freedoms we take for granted and the past we derive them from are so fragile and can be snatched away so easily by those in power I would recommend this book to everyone who loves a good read  It is a searing political and social commentary as well as thriller  Read for the masterful way Orwell has used the English language  Read because it is as relevant as it was 65 years ago  The book may be a bit dry but Winston humanizes the more abstract themes in a relatable manner  It is a very worthwhile read with rich and layered meanings  It even has cool dialogues like  We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness  and  Until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   So if you ve somehow managed to avoid this book in your school years  do yourself a favour and read it today  If you ve read it and hated it  give it another try    nh  lm yzdd qsw  klm zdd nqan  HDr  b kmlh qy m   l  lkrhy   l mkn ll wTf Gyr lkhwf wlGDb wdhll ldht  l wjwd llmDy l fy lsjlt  wmn lmw kd  nk ln tjd

was just spectacular and really creepy  What also really impressed me was the skillful way in which  Orwell had not only devised a completely credible society  but had also developed the language  the politics  the motives  and all of it in the very same book  I am also in awe of Orwell himself  Such a great thinker  only he could have written such a story  This one will stay with me for a very long time  I regretted not reading this book earlier  It has always been in the list of books I must read eventually and I finally decided  at random  to give it a try The beginning was a little slow and weird for me  But then the whole story just swept me away and by the middle of the book  I was hooked and I just had to keep reading  The whole book for me was just unique and different from any kind of book  For instance there weren t that many characters and the main character Winston is  for me  not very heroic like any other main characters  He s not very attractive  he s a little weird  he s old  but he s courageous and you just can t help liking him But the thing that really made the book special was of course the setting of the story  It s creepy and scary to read it and some parts gave me chills but of course we could definitely see that kind of life in our current world to actually happen in real life  So that made the story even more interesting My favourite part of the book was nearing the end when Winston was being caught and all  That to me was the creepiest  most goosebump y part and the whole story and how it was written was amazing to experience  And of course throughout the story you just can t help but wonder what will happen at the end  Because along the way all I could guess is that the character probably dies  But the ending wasn t predictable at all and it left me speechless and blown away The whole story idea and the characters of this novel is excellent and although there were some parts that were a little boring  the plot was amazing and everything really made the readers think and reflect upon the story  which is what I really like about a book  Lo que hay entre 1984 y yo es una historia de amor que comenzo hace 4 anos y todavia dura  La primera vez que me lo lei tenia 15 anos y lo hice porque debia examinarme de el al final del trimestre  Lo escogi entre otros muchos candidatos que nos habian sido sugeridos por algo tan simple como que hablaba de una tal  Gran Hermano   No es que sea seguidora de ese tipo de programas  es mas  prefiero no ver nada antes que eso  pero me llamo la atencion que se mencionara aquello  me choco bastante  Dado que por aquel entonces llevaba bastante mal lo referente a organizar el tiempo para realizar las tareas del instituto  termine leyendome del tiron mas de la mitad del libro el dia antes del examen  Pero aun asi me encanto y supe que aquella lectura me acompanaria para siempre  Me hizo reflexionar sobremanera sobre el importante papel que juega la informacion y la Historia en nuestras vidas y lo faciles que son de manipular sin que nos demos ni cuenta  Como obviamos a veces el conocimiento cuando es un pilar fundamental en nuestra formacion como personas  De hecho  desde entonces  siempre he dicho que 1984 era mi libro favorito En consecuencia a esto ultimo  se me ocurrio leerlo de nuevo cuatro anos despues  para comprobar si todavia seguia gustandome tanto como antes o si me habia dejado llevar por la emocion del momento y el haber descubierto una literatura mas inteligente y de caracter mas politico  Eso si  si algo tenia claro es que en esta ocasion iba a tomarmelo con calma  iba a saborear cada uno de los capitulos de esta historia  Me alegro mucho de haberlo hecho porque he descubierto detalles que pase por alto en la primera lectura  he comprendido mucho mejor a los personajes  pero sobre todo  no he podido evitar sentir cierto nudo en el estomago de pensar que esa realidad que Orwell nos plantea en la que todo esta dominado por el Partido y donde las personas cada vez son mas ignorantes y  por lo tanto  mas maleables  no dista tanto del mundo en el que vivimos  Quiza en 1984 todo este un poco mas exagerado pero  a grandes rasgos  las similitudes son abrumadoras  El conformismo de cada uno de los ciudadanos de Oceania  que es el continente en el que transcurre la accion   que asumia que si el Partido decia que algo era asi  entonces debia ser verdad  El poco interes de Julia por todo aquello que no le afectara a ella  dandole igual cualquier manipulacion que se hubiera podido hacer  siempre y cuando no tuviese nada que ver con su persona  El mantenimiento de una guerra constante para evitar que el pueblo se diera cuenta de que el verdadero enemigo no se encontraba en los paises extranjeros sino en su propio Gobierno  La batalla interior de Winston por hacer lo correcto o hacer lo que se espera de el  el cuestionarse constantemente si en realidad esta loco por no comulgar con el pensamiento del Partido  su necesidad de demostrar que todo es una mentira  que debemos abrir los ojos y no dejar que nos enganen asi como asi  que  unidos  el poder ya no recae sobre unos pocos  sino que vuelve a donde siempre deberia haber estado  a las manos del pueblo  El muro con el que siempre se choca el pobre de Winston  la fe ciega en el Gran Hermano de los otros  camaradas  y la falta de consciencia de los  proles  sobre lo que en verdad esta sucediendo Y es que Winston Smith es un personaje redondo  un personaje que representa una serie de ideales que no todo el mundo tiene y que  ademas  esta dispuesto a defender hasta el final  Desde el momento en que acepta que algo no marcha bien con el sistema politico y social en el que vive  comienza a crecer y a desarrollar su propia forma de pensar  cada vez mas critico y mas sediento por saber la verdad de lo ocurrido  no solo en el presente  sino tambien en el pasado  No le importa poner en riesgo su vida si consigue hacer ver a otra persona que todo eso es una mentira  que en realidad  son simples marionetas cuyos hilos son movidos por unos pocos senores que viven en la abundancia mientras los demas se ven obligados a malvivir  Pero con Winston  Orwell no creo ni mucho menos a un heroe que no le teme a nada  De hecho  en los ultimos capitulos se aprecia perfectamente que  finalmente  es un ser humano  con sus temores y sus flaquezas  que no tiene una voluntad de hierro como puede parecer en un principio y eso es lo que mas me gusta del personaje  que es una persona real Por si la historia no fuera suficiente  el estilo literario de George Orwell es impecable  sin dejar de ser elegante a la hora de escribir  narra los hecho sin adornarlos excesivamente  dejando claro que lo que le interesa es transmitir una historia  una serie de ideas  y que la forma en la que esten escritas es algo secundario  si bien  de extrema importancia para atrapar la atencion del lector 1984 es una novela extraordinariamente inteligente que  una vez acabada  no queda olvidada en una estanteria hasta el fin de los dias  sino que te acompana siempre  para bien o para mal  Termina formando parte de ti  Una lectura obligada  vaya  I graduated high school in 1984 and had to read this the first time then  I appreciated it a lot more this time around   great book  Poor Winston   a true classic about what the world looks like when EVERYTHING we do is being watched  What to say    it s a Classic  Perhaps interesting is what the Yugoslav political activist and author Borislav Pekic said in a lecture about  The Historical Novel and the Historical Reality  held in 1984 at the UCL in London  in which he surprised his audience by naming 1984 as  one of the best historical novels ever written   The second example  of course  will arouse your surprise  It is George Orwell s 1984  the year through which we think we are passing  I say think  for in its essential meaning  we have in fact already past through it long ago  and the futuristic  negatively utopian form of the work which has deceived readers and critics alike  is in fact the artistic mask for one of the most perfect metahistorical novels of all time  For the basic condition which characterizes the society of Orwell s pseudo future  is that of Doublethink  And Double think is the content of the whole of human s history  from that very moment when mankind  at the dawn of consciousness  through the invention of the first tool  the innocent  and useful primeval forbear of our present day atom bomb  once and for all set out along the path of the lower  but easier materialist alternative of life  leaving behind only double think excuses for the spiritual one  This our civilization would not be schizophrenic if we were not aware of the mistaken nature of our choice  To overcome that awareness  which would have made history nonsensical for us in advance  we had to forget that this spiritual alternative and the possibility for it ever existed  and then forget that we had forgotten about it  We managed to achieve this by the complicated system of Double think in the different areas of human life of human awareness  In the work of organizing The Global Lie which would quickly take over both the destiny and the history of mankind  there came together rationalistic ideas of progress  the deterministic cults  the various philosophies of so called needs  and in the historical field  social utopias and pseudo humanist doctrines    Are you a sensitive reader  Don t read this  Are you not sensitive when you read  Don t read this  Are you curious about this book  Don t read

person now  I have never been so totally absorbed by a book  not like this  And I have never cried over a book  I sobbed when I finished this Orwell brings some hard truths  and some of our deepest fears  to life in 1984  Why do I say  don t read this  do read this  Because  if you are comfortable with who you are right now  this book will rock you to your core  If you don t want that  don t read it  but  on the other side  the truths within it are things that I believe we need to hear  We need to be rocked to our core All I can say is  proceed with caution    you ll never quite be prepared for what is within  But you won t regret reading it  either  l  rf mdh knt qr qS  mn lmD  m qr lwq  lmryr ldhy n yshh ln       Que maravilla  Tenia pendiente volver a leerlo y lo he

actualidad que estamos viviendo  En fin  un must  mn  Zm lrwyt ll  qryth    bltHdyd  Zm rwy  blnjlyzy  qryth    mbhr  Ignorance is strength Freedom is slavery War is peace A brilliantly made novel set in a dystopian world where every single human virtue and instinct was prohibited and violently punished  Was it still possible to be human For Winston Smith  it was  Well  in the beginning anyway  He was the courageous protagonist who thought that there was still an end to cruel   and  rather inconsistent   reality that he lived in  He was interesting character and I enjoyed hearing his thoughts  The question that he posted to himself would make the reader even question himself  Albeit quite gloomy in character  they all were gloomy   I really liked his character The other characters also left an imprint in my mind  At times  I had a profound distaste for them that I could not help but like  For who would not appreciate a character who could invoke such a strong emotion  right The plot seemed unrealistic to me  as was the political environment of the book  I was not convinced that a group of people would be that powerful to be able to ensure that a superstate would exist in perfect isolation  The idea seemed far fetched yet the reasoning and the logic had been so convincing that I feared living in the era  At the same time  I could not help but be amazed by the genius at which Orwell managed to conceive of such idea The killing of human values and instinct was another horrible thing to imagine  To fear your own family  marry mainly for procreation  have your privacy invaded and have your freedom prohibited were just some of the conditions that were present in the book  One could not help but wonder how can one continue living and if the essence of humanity still lived  It was way too horrible even to imagine and yet  you understand it  In its severely twisted way  you would be able to comprehend why the government did it and why the people continued to suffer  But that does not necessarily mean that you agree to it  Finally  the way they presented reality as something that simply exist in the mind and the past as something that can be altered was the main thing that captured me  I was so mindblown as I read about  doublethink  and tampering of the past  The book made you question a lot of things about reality and the past  Was the past really some sort of a fixed event in space or did it vary  Was the reality were you existed even  real   Or is it merely a state created by your own mind The real strength of the book was the depth at which it intellectually stimulates the readers  It made you question  reason  analyze  At moments  I found myself staring into the distance and wondering  Sure it was a gross and vile book  with the settings and ideas that it presented  but in its evil  you learn to appreciate it and the things that you now took for granted It is indeed a must read  With its ironies and perverse ideas  you re sure to find yourself thinking an wondering  I have long praised the Harry Potter series for its intricate details and back stories in its fictional world  This is the first book I have found since finishing Deathly Hallows three years ago that has done the same thing to such an extent  Not only was 1984 haunting and a tiny bit depressing  given its subject matter  but it was also phenomenally put together  Orwell s warning about communism is clear  but he was also able to construct a fascinating story about two people and their struggles  all around the framework of an extensive  extremely creative world  I was a bit fed up with Orwell after Animal Farm  wondering why he was praised as such a good writer  but this gem has restored my faith in him  My only complaints are these  the section given to relating The Book  a section that will be made clear to you if you read 1984  was a bit boring  A little too much information was given  The other problem I had was that Winston s terror of rats was never explained  But these are minor issues  certainly not enough to mar this thrilling story in any way  Recommend for 14  for difficult subject matter and some innuendo    There are classic books that one reads simply to see what all of the fuss is about  and are soon forgotten in the midst of busy lives  this book is not of this kind On the contrary  this masterpiece is as horrific as it is brilliant  and is sure to leave one engaged in deep contemplation long after completion  After reading 1984  I envision myself staring at my own reflection in a mirror  and choking with repulsion as I witness my own tortured and emaciated form  devoid of any discernible humanity   If you are human  that is humanity   I hear O brien say over and over  Far from being simply a seething satire of Stalinism and the rise of the USSR  Orwell s 1984 depicts an age wherein humans lose the capacity to think critically  rendering them immune to truth in any other form than the general consensus of the Party  a Party that only publicly glorifies its motives on the surface   by proclaiming that the present system is much better than the past  but is brutally honest in the confines of the Ministry of Love  claiming that power is the ends and not the means  that humans are destined to be ruled by an all encompassing ideology of the infallible nature of the structure of Governance   the Party  and  if non compliant  systematically tortured until free will is wholly eradicated  This is a book to be read and re read  especially in an age where consumption and entertainment are overshadowing the necessity of rational thought and wisdom  less   Mind boggling  A book the likes of which I ve never read before  One of the best  thought provoking  prophetic novels I have ever read One that I will surely revisit again  It s scary to think this book was written in 1948  and in 2015 we see some ideas from this book happening as normal day to day activities  Like Facebooking everything you re thinking  abbreviations of words in written conversation  emoticons  Television to keep the masses stupid  pointless wars fought for no reason other than  they re the bad guys  let s kill them   people having the need to buy new phones every year just because everyone else does it  having no friends or partner because you re only thinking about your job that you do to make others rich  goverment controlling everything even the food you eat  people living on wellfare better than workers without doing a thing  etc If you re dead tired about anything and or everything mentioned above  George Orwell was sick of it since 1948 Go read this book  dont vote  f ck the system  down with big brother  Lo mejor de lo mejor de lo mejor    y si ademas te gusta el

with Newspeak as a language the utter poverty of everything is extremely despicable but on one level   very impressive Totalitarian rule and perpetuating it throughout a sustained period of time entailing use of three principles which all focus on the use of doublethink is jaw dropping and making anything of remote pleasure such as food and sex as intolerable is a credit to Orwell s creativity and vision As the book devolves O brien Julia and Winston provide the perfect backdrop on which Orwell can expound his imaginary world of repression and mental subjugation Breakup of the classes and the departments and use of thought police as well as how the party contiues altering the past to ensure the future and present signified by  He who controls the present  controls the past  He who controls the past  controls the future  further adds to what seems to be an inescapable world of pain hunger and children denouncing their parents The ending just like most of Orwell s books is not one which is of happiness but his style of writing and the socialistic society which he created to replace the capitalistic one is brilliantly portrayed for 50 pages which for me was the best read in the book All in all a categorically brilliant political book which gives a view into how a world devoid of freedom and beliefs would operate and how  WAR IS PEACE  is what this book is all about  It is a beautiful novel knowing how beauty is subjective  One of the best dystopian novels i have read which just wrenches your heart  I love the way it ends  It makes one feel so incompletely

es mas que un libro  es algo que se te mete en la piel al leerlo  Me dejo un poco traumado  como un poco asustado  desequilibrado  mareado  perdido    No se si lo voy a volver a leer alguna vez  es demasiado profunda esta obra  me cambio los ojos con los que veo a la realidad  En serio  En algunas partes me asuste  como Orwell logra doblegarte el espiritu con sus escritos es digno de no creer  es escalofriante Nunca habia leido un libro TAN intenso  y ojala que llegue a leer otro igual  o que se le acerque por lo menos pd  Lease bajo su propio riesgo  te puede cambiar la mente en serio  Usted cree que la realidad es algo objetivo  substancial  con vida propia y derechos tambien propios  Y cree tambien que la naturaleza de lo real se revela por si mismo  Cuando se engana a si propio creyendo haber visto algo  supone que todos los demas lo ven del mismo modo  Pero yo le digo a usted  Winston  que la realidad carece de existencia corporea  La realidad no existe sino en el entendimiento humano y nada mas que alli  pero no el entendimiento individual  falible y perecedero  sino en el del Partido  en un entendimiento colectivo y  por lo tanto  inmortal  Lo que el Partido afirma  eso es la veradad  No es posible advertir la realidad sino examiandola a traes del Partido  Esa es la ensenanza que usted tiene que asimilar  Winston  Nada habia que no pudiera ser la verdad absoluta  Las llamadas leyes de la naturaleza no pasaban a ser sandeces y la ley de la gravedad  otro disparate   Si me propusiera  dijo O Brien  podria elevarme en el aire como una pompa de jabon   Reflexiono Winston   Si el cree poder elevarse en el aire y  al mismo tiempo  yo creo haberle visto hacerlo  entonces el fenomeno es perfectamente posible       nh rwyh tuqr  thm tuqr  mn jdyd This novel is a heart wrenching story that includes power  control  love  romance  and betrayal  Winston is a lonely man living in London in 1984 under a totalitarian regime  He begins writing in a journal  which is illegal  Winston longs for friends which manifests itself in his desire for Julia  Winston s life takes a turn when Julia slips him a note telling him that she loves them  and this is where the romance begins  The two begin a secret affair  which is against the law  Their affair makes the novel interesting because it shows Winston s willingness to go against the government for love  Then  Winston gains the courage to openly rebel  and he and Julia go to O Brian who they suspect is a rebel too  At that moment  the Thought Police break in and take him and Julia to the Ministry of Love to be tortured  Finally  the novel ends with the government completely breaking Winston down  which destroys his relationship with Julia forever  The ending shows the struggle between people s free will and the will of others and how that struggle affects the relationships in their lives  Dispute the date on the cover  this book  still  depicts a possible future if we GIVE away OUR RIGHTS by NOT VOTING and not paying attention to the things our LEADERS are doing while we just blithely go about our lives     It is a dark  frightening look at what is coming  When I read this in high school   1960 s  the idea of cameras everywhere was ludicrous     almost 50 years later  look a around    We also now use tiny aircraft to spy  READ THIS BOOK  IT WILL SCARE YOU  This is a classic which still should be read   Can one use political language without having read this book  I doubt it  It s like The Bible  if you haven t investigated it somewhat  you won t know what everyone keeps referring to  I am not much into writing reviews for books  but  1984  forces one to  This is perhaps the only instance where I saw the movie adaptation first  and read the book thereafter  partly because I received it as a gift   And it turned out to be a very wise decision indeed Set in a world where the government has the power to control every aspect of its citizens  lives   1984  impeccably portrays the fear and the desperation the protagonist  Winston Smith  goes through  It does not depict scenes of gruesome torture  not till the last third of the book at least   or inhuman living conditions  Rather  it portrays how the government continuously monitors its citizens  daily routines  constantly changes the recorded history  and erases the identities of people it wishes to  The fear of losing one s identity completely  as if one never existed  can instill fear in the strongest of hearts The defining moment of the story comes when Winston  incarcerated because of his part in the revolution  finally  betrays  his lover Julia  and realizes that he has lost all his love for her  as he shouts out  Do it to her    Its worth one s time to read the book just for the sake of this one scene  There are four stages  regarding the rules of writing  can be extended to rules in other areas  1  you don t obey the rules and your book is lousy2  you obey the rules but your book is still lousy3  you obey the rules and you write a quality book4  you don t obey the rules and you write a quality bookLevel three is rare enough  level four is something you find a handful of times during your lifetime  1984  by George Orwell  is a level four book It is even more noteworthy because the few  level four  examples I know of are by authors who broke structural rules  or rules that concern POV or character traits  But 1984 is the only book I know of that breaks the  show not tell  rule and gets away with it To be honest  it feels a bit odd at times  because the author spends most of the book telling  instead of showing  which is a sure fire way of ruining any book  but he somehow manages to make it acceptable There are some passages where it doesn t work  the most extreme example being the  Goldstein book  excerpts which should have been edited to  at least  one third of their present size and are extremely boring and repetitive  But apart from that  most of the book is very enjoyable  Its mix of quality in the detail of the writing and frontal violation of the rules of quality in general terms makes for a unique text which in the end is probably the ideal vehicle for the message of the story   both the style and the content make the reader cringe like chalkboard screech As for the story itself  I repeat what I ve already said when reviewing  Animal Farm   this is a fiercely anti Stalinist book written by someone with impeccable left wing credentials  Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side   which both adds to the fun of it and most certainly to the legitimacy  I don t even   I won t even   GAAH  qd ylj  lrwy y l slwb fnn lkryktyr fy ltqT  yb m fy lwjh  w  lmjtm  fy Hl  lrwy y   wltrkyz  lyh blmblG  fy t ry  swth wl   lm mldhy

quoi ajouter pour l instant  c est trop tot  Reporting bb doubleplusgood Refs unpersons and persons  Fullwise doubleplusgood  I d waffle at length about this novel s brilliant insights and wry observations  but it s been said before and better  So simply  here are my very favorite bites  savored for both taste and texture The horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part  but  on the contrary  that it was impossible to avoid joining in  Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary Winston was gelatinous with fatigue Crimestop  in short  means protective stupidity  But stupidity is not enough But I tell you Winston  that reality is not external  Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere else  Not in the individual mind  which can make mistakes  and in any case soon perishes  Two and two are four Sometimes Winston  Sometimes they are five  Sometimes they are three  Sometimes they are all of them at once  You must try harder  It is not easier to become sane You are a difficult case  But don t give up hope  Everyone is cured sooner or later  In the end we shall shoot you   If before you read 1984 you never saw how government intrudes in our daily lives and how things are so easily controlled  you will after reading it  Orwell s Dystopian classic lays out how easily we  the masses can so easily be deceived by political rhetoric  mind control and constant fear and brutality  How we can be misled to think the wrong thing is the right thing    and how we could be made to feel grateful for it  After reading this book  I can t look at our world the same ever again  So many shades of 1984 are apparent in everyday life and everything we do  political bills that have been passed  an economy spiralling out of control  You have to remind yourself that 1984 was written way back in 1949  It is a frightening prophecy of a world that is only a mere nudge from becoming our own  1984 is a warning of letting anyone have too much control  Of how through deception  freedom is made into slavery without us even knowing the difference  If you ever thought that there was something wrong with our world  that their was something more than what we can see or hear going on  read this book  it s simply amazing  But beware  once you see 1984 through Orwell s eyes  you may never see our own world ever the same through your own eyes  You will be awakened  and may never go back to sleep  I really enjoyed reading 1984  I gave it a 5 star because it was filled with suspense  very strong characterizations and a excellent atmosphere that George Orwell have created with his great choice of words  1984 is also very unique in it s own way and it s very original which no other author can write another book similar to 1984  I learned a lot from this book such as the lose if identity and uniqueness in a society  the idea of altering mental memories by forcing extreme physical agony in order to easily govern the population  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction but some of it s contents may not be suitable for kids or students with it s graphical and violent content  The main reason I actually like this book is because of it s connection to the real world  even though Orwell write the book a long time ago we can still see it in the present  such as Hitler  Soviets  the Islamic state  Al qaeda  Boko Hakam they are all evidence of government to hide some parts of information to create fear into the population to assert total control over the society   Genius yet horrifying  Everyone should read this book   Nem tenho palavras    There is a very select group of books that I decided to read again before submitting a rating on the site  Nineteen Eighty Four is one of them  The last time I read it was many years ago  and I was uncertain if it would still have the same profound impact on me that it had when I was a teenager As a matter of fact  it does  It is still one of the most powerful dystopias I know  especially because of the way it revolves around the views and experiences of one individual character  Its strong and lasting message comes as much from the way it is written as it does from the content itself It is not an easy book to read  much of it is dark and depressing and pessimistic  but to me  that aspect of it is what has made it so memorable  what made it shape part of my thinking in a way that few works of fiction can  I will continue to cherish it and will read it again years from now  rwy  tHtj l  jlst  ljy  lrwHk lnsny  mn b

the world in 1984 can be built in the real world  When I was reading the book I could not help comparing what I read with the reality around myself  Needless to say there is an exaggeration in the novel but the principles are the same in every totalitarian regime  The control of the media  the alteration of the past and history  the indoctrination of people and specially children  the deliberate degradation of the masses  and even DOUBLETHINK among many other ideas in the novel is being used to some extent in all totalitarian regimes as if 1984 is the handbook for building a dark dreadful autocratic government that seeks nothing but pure power From the first pages of the novel I had a feeling that the this story is not going to end happily  As a matter of fact I was right  But I hope for all the people suffering from living in such conditions  it ends well   I must say  I surely didn t expect this  I had a completely different idea as to what I d be getting out of this novel   a happy ending  perhaps  or even a lesson about revolutionaries and their revolts   and it was a shocking surprise  definitely in a good  yet awe struck  sense   What I felt through the first third of the book was patient curiosity about such a gray world and the certain absurdity of such a world actually existing  the second third waiting for some sort of excitement in order to awaken the dazed   brain washed population and  at the same time  admiring the creative genius of the author to go to such lengths as to make us readers vividly imagine the aspects of such a dreary  somewhat realistic world using such a language  in that day and age    building it by scratch  and the third  and last  part of the book just conformed me to such a dark mood which is unimaginable yet believable It s truly a horrifying book which tests anyone s mental state and stability  What s amazing is that  it isn t impossible to achieve  Moreover  it could be happening right now and we re completely unaware and oblivious  Such a chilling prospect of proportions   Chi controlla il passato controlla il futuro  Chi controlla il presente controlla il passato  Quando ho letto la prima volta 1984 non ne ho capito il senso  Ero troppo piccola  e  non so se fortunatamente o sfortunatamente  troppo ingenua per poter comprendere il mondo che si nascondeva dietro quelle quattro cifre  1984 e una data  che potrebbe essere qualsiasi anno  La sua estrema facolta nell essere attuale in tutte le epoche e uno dei punti di forza del libro  Di certo non per l umanita George Orwell  in quest opera  spaventa  proprio per questa sua profonda   forse non voluta  continua attualita  E proprio per questo reputo  1984  un obbligo letterario  Uno di quei libri che andrebbe letto in tutte le scuole  quando si ha l eta giusta per capirne ogni sfaccettatura  E per cercare  infine  di farlo diventare finalmente un libro del passato   I mostly read YA and I feel like I know a lot about YA fiction  YA is like familiar territory  like home  while books like 1984 are new  unexplored territory  I didn t know what to expect and I didn t think I would be able to finish it  But I ve wanted to read this and other books by George Orwell for the longest time and so I finally did  And I loved it  And as soon as I d read the last page  I wanted to start it all over again Dystopian books are meant to show us what our world or government is heading towards  At the same time  they re written in a way that you can see parallels between the horrible  imaginary world described in the book and the real world  Big Brother is Watching You   George Orwell describes a society  in which nothing you do or say or even think is private  in which even having negative thoughts about the Party is illegal  The Party wants mindless followers  wants them to be so incapable of thought that they never realise how oppressed they truly are  The Party does this by controlling everything you do  Everything from what time you exercise to whom you marry is decided and approved by the Party   Orthodoxy means not thinking  not needing to think  Orthodoxy is unconsciousness   To make sure there s no rebellion  they have to destroy your ability to think  they have to destroy your individuality  In this world  there s no art or literature  or even science  They have a new language called  newspeak  that doesn t even have the word  science  in it  There is a section of the Party dedicated to making the newspeak vocabulary smaller every year  Because if you don t have the right words at your disposal  how would you express your thoughts  How would you even be able to think  Don t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible  because there will be no words in which to express it  There s no religion  either  The Party wants you to worship  revere and love Big Brother like you would a god  They go so far as to make sure everything the Big Brother or the Party ever says or predicts is correct by rewriting past records and destroying them  Winston s job is to fabricate such records  He knows every historical is text is inaccurate and that every record has been rewritten  so he s been doubting everything around him and worrying about the truth  He meets and falls in love with Julia  who in his own words is a  rebel from the waist down   She doesn t care so much about the truth or freedom  but she does hate the Party and all it s rules  The only rules she s concerned with breaking  though  are the ones that stop her from getting what she wants  She is the final push Winston needs to actively rebel against the Party  Together they join  The Brotherhood  which is a group working against the Party  But is  The Brotherhood  even real  Until they became conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   The book is brilliantly written and is really believable  The future Orwell describes is recognizable  it was relevant in 1948  when this book was released  and it is relevant now  It s a book that you ll be thinking about for weeks after having finished it  This book was on sale a few weeks back  so I picked it up and decided it was high time I read it  It s one of the best books I ve ever read WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Every Orwell book has that saying that basically shoves the book along  Four legs good  two legs bad    but this one just glues itself to your brain  Today s dystopian fiction basically sits at the knees of this book and begs for a scrap of its greatness   Seriously Without giving too much away  this book is about a man named Winston  who tries to revolt against the government in a world where you are constantly being watched  It s a terrifying story and as the book progresses you re going to see just how much is scares the pants off you I m not going to go into much detail here because the book pretty much nails it in every single category straight across the board  There is  however  one quote I think you should read because it really does sum up the book very very well  Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling  Everything will be dead inside you  Never again will you be capable of love  or friendship  or joy of living  or laughter  or curiosity  or courage  or integrity  You will be hollow  We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves  It s epic   Nuff said  I waited till I was mature enough to read a book of this complexity  Most of my favorite authors quoted this book many times  I read  Animal Farm  just before  1984  Which showed me the perspective with which our lives are guided in the lies we are told and the lies we ask for to keep us sane  The way we rationalize the limited choices our ability of transduction let s us acknowledge for if you truly saw who you are  the knowledge alone would burn the sanity from you re face and touch   social dysmorphic disorder  is our shield  Our horse blanket  the flower we yearn for when there no longer there  Directly after I picked up  1984  That one  That book  made me see that no matter how close and full our lives become we will forever be alone in our minds and our hearts  Accepting is not part of the human condition  we might as well just stop If we stop dreaming  stop hoping  stop fighting  Its insanity of the human condition to be in perpetual conscious dissonance  Life has no reason to question itself only death has a reason and or right too  Winston Smith  Does Big Brother exist O Brien  Of course he exists Winston Smith  Does he exist like you or me O Brien  You do not exist       George Orwell That quote  is what I will never accept  I will fight the sad fact I know it s true sometimes  but not all the  and that s all that matters  2012Sent from my Telstra Next G device Nunca um livro me tinha apresentado um plot twist tao imprevisivel e repentino  Isso  aliado a uma historia espectacular e uma descricao incrivel de uma sociedade tenebrosa fazem com que  Mil Novecentos e Oitenta e Quatro  seja um daqueles livros obrigatorios  Words can t describe how I feel about this book  It has always been a favourite even before I ve read it but when I finally picked it up and read it entirely  I m even more in love with it  It s the dystopian community through the eyes of a certain Winston Smith  a community that would teach you to love  hate and blame yourself on why you exist No love is in the air Sex is not sensual but only a reproduction for the Party You don t exist  you never have  you are just a sub division of the Party  born to continue All I can say  is that this book should be read by everyone because it is a portrayal of what would happen if man became too integrated into society as to become only a cog in the hour Freedom is Slavery War is Peace Ignorance is Strength 2 2 5 Big brother is watching you

horrifying book I ve ever read because it s hauntingly   real  It s obviously a fiction book but the things it talks about make me think that this is what our world will be like in a few years  1984 was 3 decades ago but this story and theory  if you will  continue to live on  In this book  everything you read is monitored by the government  By everything I mean eating  sleeping  working  thinking  etc  Whether you re being obedient or rejecting the government  they find out  Even your children can go and report you to the authorities because in this world  government is number 1  It s absolutely insane how in this book individualism is a crime and it seems that this is what s starting to happen in our world today  You can t be yourself without someone having to say something negative or judge your emotions  thoughts  and beliefs  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to get creeped out by Orwell s creativity and unintentional accurate predictions   I m sure it s been said a million times already  but it is actually frightening how topical this book still is  There is only one thing that I had a major problem with   Suddenly  as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and re read every word  he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chapter III   I have NEVER done that and never plan to  That s a really strange way to read a book  in my honest opinion    Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past  Not many of you might know that famous television shows  The Big Brother  and its Indian version  Big Boss  are vaguely conceptualized on the theme of this novel  There are two ways you can read 1984 First  to read it word by word as a spectator to the novel or second  to live it through the eyes of the narrator  Winston Smith  George Orwell s 1984 is a gripping satire  a warning for human society and sheer storytelling brilliance  If Nazis  history has shades of barbarism then the extreme nature of totalitarian regime can be absolutely chilling 1984 is all about imagining existence of such a world   Spoiler alert for this paragraph  not much revealed though A mystical figure   The Big Brother  is believed to be keeping track of each of your activity  The past is mutable  A totalitarian party exists  which can choose to rewrite the history the way it wants  The history  to put in simple words  has been arrested  Any sort of evidence that might prove the party weak is altered  and any wrong prediction altered  A thought rebellion is criminal and it is caught by the telescreen that watches you all the time People are vaporized from society not for committing any crime  but based on their eccentric thought process which might have made them to commit a crime against the party in future  They don t die  they will never have existed   The party believes that killing people in the open will glorify the victim and shame them  So  they don t punish the heretic overtly but annihilate them from all records of past and future  The system is moulded to safeguard the infallibility of the party  War is a continuous process yet people are indifferent to it   In the eyes of the party there were no distinctions between the thought and the deed  In such savage conditions  what happens to a man called Winston Smith  who nurtures a thoughtcrime  a rebellion against Party in his own mind by falling in love  is central to the story The lines Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold me   are somehow gut wrenching and apt George Orwell as a storywriter engrosses you throughout with his lucid and thought provoking story astonishingly written in 1949 with a foresight of the world in 1984 Thoughtcrime  doublethink  crimestop  newspeak  the thought police Orwell s jargons force us to think of the relevancy of his vision in some subtle ways  It s not only engrossing  but at times frightening when you imagine your own existence in such a world This is a must read book and I have no qualms on why it is rated as one of the best books ever written   ttHdWth lrwy  bkhtSr  n Hy  wynstwn smyth  mwTnun mn dwl   wqyny

indescribable  Winston is such a powerful and influential character throughout the novel  The way he survives in such an unjust society just simply amazes me  I do not know how I would have lived being under the eyes of  Big Brother   The concept of Newspeak really fascinated me  it was interesting how making language more simple actually manipulates a population  I also loved the character Julia because she is such a powerful woman in her society  Her feminist views really sold me on this novel  O Brien was a confusing character for me  I don t want to spoil anything but once you get to part three of the novel you ll know what I mean  Such an amazing classic that I recommend everyone reads at some point in their life  I would like to read ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell as well  I read this book  I refrain myself real hard from not saying  masterpiece  every time because it is  for the first time a few years ago  in my first or second year of college  I loved it back then  and meant to reread it at some point  but remembering just how depressing it is  I didn t dare I finally got enough motivation when it came out in Ukrainian for the first time   a welcome  if much overdue  addition to my collection  This is something everyone in Ukraine should read  study and remember  because it gives a much bigger insight into the enemy s mind The book  already great in itself  contains a lot of informative commentary in footnotes by the translator and the publishing team  and in the afterword  a Ukrainian writer not just analyzes the novel  but also provides examples of the phenomena described there that we find in everyday life  You may feel  he says  that doublethink is too much and clearly an unrealistic exaggeration  but here   this is how it works right now  I m in love with 1984  If I didn t have a huge to read list  I might ve started rereading it right after I finished it   flktb l ymkn  n yfn   fHt  dh m  tlft lnskh  l khyr  mnh fn fy ws n  n n yd ktbth Hrfan Hrfan   This book is SO dense  It took me a couple days to make it through the first pages  This is one of the few books that take me a while to sink in  Can t believe I waited so long to read this classic  I totally loved it  and it surprised me  because I wasn t expecting so much of the writing to be so richly sensuous  Now I want to read Orwell s essays  Another justified classic  Still retains its power   I admit this is one I should have read years ago but never did  Reading now  it s interesting how it feels like a diatribe against totalitarianism   as if Orwell was brutally saying  is this how you want the world to be   Directed at dictators like Stalin  who had corrupted Orwell s idea of socialism with prison camps and torture Early into the book Orwell Winston asks  How could you communicate with the future   Of course  the simple read of the book is to see how much of the book is  prophecy   though I don t think that was Orwell s intention at all   of course  if our 1984  or 1999  or 2013 for that matter  resembled his Oceania  I think he would probably cry  My reading of it  and many others  coincided with the recent  shock  about Edward Snowden and the NSA  though I wasn t surprised at all by that  and felt that the politicians who were were employing a form of  doublespeak    but wait a second  don t our politicians on both sides of the political spectrum employ  doublespeak   I seem to recall several egregious instances of primarily right wing politicians deliberately contradicting themselves on multiple occasions in the media  Weapons of mass destruction anyone  And then of course the right would say that the leftist media controls what is  fit to print   so maybe we shouldn t listen to either side  and just watch reality television  which is where people are filmed all the time  their privacy willingly sacrificed for attention and monetary gain   I guess that was the increase in 1984 s sales for that week  but who actually read it     in my mind  the scary thing is how America has willingly sacrificed some of the freedoms Orwell was extolling in the book  privacy  expression  thought   there s an entire culture in America proud to be uneducated  unread   for the sake of convenience and consumerism  Posting on Facebook and Twittering and all of the social media is devoted to the elimination of the private spectrum   your digital self is exposed to the world   in thought and deed   And as Orwell feared the simplification of language would lead to the inability to express oneself leading to another form of thought control by the state  how many people communicate today via texting  Is this not a form of newspeak  Orwell  as also stated in Pynchon s excellent into  feared for the world of his children   depicted in 1984 as willing accomplices to the Party  So our children  now brought up with social media and texting  will inherit a limited vocabulary and dumbed down grammar  It is convenient to text though      That our government was recently exposed to utilize phone records and digital footprints to track supposed terrorists   this didn t surprise me in the least  The passing of the Patriot Act in 2001 was a tip that our digital means of communication can be read by anyone   when you get your cell phone bill  it  at least it used to  contain every phone call you had made during a billing cycle   who would be surprised when those phone records would be read by the government  I m sorry  the world of high level government  hell high level anything  is not fair or nice  That is the world we live in The difference between the automatons of the Party and our conformist automatons in America is that we willingly are giving up our individuality and thought by dumbing down the populace   the resistance to education  culture  and activity is what is turning into America s legacy  When Winston looks at himself in the mirror after being in the Ministry of Love for who knows how long  he sees what is essentially a concentration camp survivor  Ironically  the American Party member would be overweight  his teeth falling out from sugary drinks And while we re on that  it would seem to me that the right wing s using of the word  freedom  in terms of gun rights and the more libertarian aspects of their ideology  I want my jumbo soda and no gov ment is gonna tell me differnt   seems to be yet another example of a powerful doublespeak  What is the freedom to be found in pointing a gun at another human  By eliminating one person s freedom we are expressing our own  Of course  then  self defense  and  security  are thrown into the conversation which does admittedly complicate things  But there seems to be some sort of elimination of the relationship between the right s current ideology and what some would call objective reality  which I would describe as our inner selves relationship with the external world governed by what we define as physics   Of course  since the right love to use their religiousness as a selling point  faith is belief without fact  I m not going to get into the problems with the Christian right in America  but spirituality and religion are not the same thing  The usage of religious ideology to control and manipulate the populace ABSOLUTELY has a tinge of fascism to it  How can someone espouse that they believe in religious freedom when anyone who doesn t agree with their religious beliefs is condemned to hell  Scary stuff  that  Again  this was meant to be a quick comment not an epic  One last thing   torture  The last 100 pages or so of 1984 still retain their power to shock  Electric shock therapy makes me queasy and Orwell s depiction of the true nature of totalitarian power still holds its own power   In this respect  1984 shares similarities with another anti fascist screed  Pasolini s Salo  But the written word  while effective  still does not come close to the explicitness of film when it comes to depicting horror  Which is most likely why Salo is still one of the most unpleasant and upsetting films ever made  On a less explicit but no less disturbing level  the recent film Compliance definitely offers up some similar comments about the insidious nature of our current consumer culture and what it is doing to our populace   This might be completely off base  but since I m a fan of horror films  finding the recent  but passed  fad of torture porn  Saw  Hostel  Captivity  Martyrs  Frontiers  etc  has some parallels in an Orwellian world  If the directors find the need to push the limits of graphic violence by simply  and some might say gleefully  depicting the human body at the mercy of an unrelenting  unfeeling  inhuman torturer  this could metaphorically show that A  The crimes committed at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Gharib have seeped into the filmmakers  subconscious B  Barbaric torture in our world is accepted as a reality in terms of political enemies C  Filmmakers and audiences have made torture banal by depicting it as entertainment  Erich Fromm s excellent afterward made the point that after two world wars  multiple fascist dictators  and the atomic bomb  the hope for humanity that might have been born at the dawn of the 20th Century might have been swallowed by our destructive tendencies  Fascism and totalitarianism succeed amongst children and the uneducated because it caters to simplistic  base tendencies within our psyche  Orwell seemed terrified and upset that these tendencies would come to dominate our world in the future  Unfortunately  the redemption of our species that would seem to even hope that a utopia is possible somehow  seems to be dying as America devolves into ignorance  religious mania  and mental and physical laziness   Idiocracy anyone  I remember working on a commercial maybe ten years ago during the large Iraq war protests where there was an intense discussion with another production assistant about the rising sense of fascism in America  His act of rebellion was to send a copy of 1984 to every member of Congress  A friend of mine made the point that this was no act of rebellion   it would only make him feel better  non conformist  about himself  since none of Congress would actually read the book  And maybe in a hundred years  they won t be able to read at all   Left me speechless and overwhelmed   lkhTb lydywlwjy ldhy tm ktb  mndh

doublethink consumed me  The  mutability of the past  as Orwell terms it  To be able to rewrite history has always been an inseparable part of the fact that it is history  But to determine the future by determining thoughts  To determine the past by what you want at the present  To so inoculate society as to have them believe or not believe what their eyes see as evident  Incredible  And this Character O Brien  Who plays both the ultimate protector and simultaneously the antagonistic demon  How complex  How torridly interesting a role  I was so perplexed by circumstance and so overwhelmed by this O Brien that at one point my mind opened and I saw that perhaps Goldstein was Big Brother  perhaps Big Brother was only a secondary mask behind the fabricated society in which it was all only a trial  yes they must be trying this character  O Brien was trying him for some greater purpose there would be a better end    a better end  Indefensibly the ending was exactly as it should be and perfect although sickeningly so  What a brilliant piece of literature  The final chapters as the human mind is being broken down  As my own mind twisted into a myrid of thoughts and shapes  Rejecting  accepting  rejecting  accepting and finally loving  Loving  Inconceivable and yet absolute Ingsoc Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past  Does this give anyone else a greater appreciation for the already epic genius of Rage Against the Machine   Although there are flaws in the book  this definitely deserves a full 5 stars The pioneer of all dystopian novels  Orwell s nightmarish world of the all knowing and all controlling Big Brother is a compelling read  And Orwell does not lack for ambition   dabbling in ethics  economics  political science  metaphysics and linguistics in tying up to form a believable world His world is realistic because you can believe that an oppressed and conditioned people as such will behave this way  It is realistic because there have been echoes of such events in the past and the present From Stalinist Russia to the Kim s North Korea  elements of Oceania and Ingsoc are no longer simply fiction  And it is not only openly totalitarian states that have encroached on human freedom  Haven t even democracies taken up unheard and secret liberties on our freedom and rights 1984  The ultimate police state  As a disenchanted party drone  Winston lives in constant fear that his subversive thoughts will be discovered by the Thought Police and he will be erased from the world  Yet as he finds love and engages in overt acts against the Party and Big Brother he suffers betrayal and the consequences he knew that were inevitable One of the most frightening theme throughout the book  and what Winston quickly grasps is that by constantly rewriting history and making people forget the past  the Party does not leave any chance of discontent  There will never be a revolution I started this because I was planning on reading The Giver and Divergent next in response to the movie adaptions that have come out coming out  Truly to understand how terrible a book is  you really should start with the good  Okay so I was in honors language arts this school year and was assigned this book  I had heard many great things about it previously and my teacher had recommended many amazing books to me previously  I figured since she had assigned it to the whole class  it would be decent  It well surpassed my expectations greatly  The twisted ideas of Orwellian society got me thinking deeply about similar aspects of today s lifestyle  And May the memories of Winston and Julia reign supreme   Yes  I read this in 8th grade language   No lie   This is an awesome read and has an interesting plot  One of my favorites of late  That was by far the most disturbing book I have ever read  I don t think I will be able to ever forget it  A very      VERY chilling book about what humans are capable of  Wow    1984 is very well written  the first few chapters reads very much like a modern day North Korea account  It s hard to believe that this was actually written more than 60 years ago  I wonder how Orwell himself would have been astonished at how accurate a picture he is able to paint about the communist regime There is very good flow in the text  the book gives a very good feel as you read it  it is not too fast paced for you to want to take a break while reading  neither is it too slow paced that makes you want to give up reading the book  The book is split into 3 big blocks  each taking almost equal portion of the book  which is a good accomplishment  Orwell does not  like many contemporary authors rush through the ending giving a huge sense of dissatisfaction as you draw to a close The first part deals with the relative joy and dissatisfaction of Winston  the main character of the story  and his romance with Julia The second part mainly deals with his imprisonment and betrayal   Sorry this is really a short statement on a big block  but to go anymore will spoil the whole story  Read it yourself  The third part deals with his re education and re assimilation back into his society Highly recommended for those who are interested in North Korean or communist life  or any history major who just wants to have a vivd picture of life under the communist regime Ratings  5 5 I was fortunate enough to be entering high school in 1984  so 1984  the book  found its way onto a lot of reading lists  Reading 1984 heavily influenced my thinking and reading preferences  It s directly responsible for my fascination with utopian and dystopian literature  which was in turn partly responsible for me studying English in college  1984By George Orwell1984 is a vision of the future set in a dystopian society ruled by a powerful leader with the intent to control and manipulate the population in a manner that attempts to eliminate  individual expression and will  The story introduces the main character Winston Smith  a middle aged man who works at an organization called The Ministry of Truth  His job is to recreate any photo or document containing any facts that counter what is presented as the standard and established  reality   of the ruling government body  Winston is one of the few people of his society who questions the rules and norms he is told to live by  He is a rebel that attempts to resist the status quo  except this has to remain a secret  as a matter of life and death  for those who do not conform  are seen as a threat and are eliminated from the society  Later  Winston meets a girl named Julia from his work  who he falls in love with and shares in his  rebellious  thinking of the higher power which rules their world  The combination of these events that unfold with Julia and his defiant thinking  lands Winston and Julia in serious trouble  Winston has to face the higher powers that be and struggles to keep his identity  This narrative conveys that when humans forget their true nature  are denied the ability to feel and question authority  and threatened by institutional power that determines the conditions of their lives  it is possible to forget what it means to be human  This novel still serves as one of the best classic forms of a  negative utopia   whose purpose is to warn its readers of the potential of governments and established institutions of power that can overtake the direction and purposes of people s lives  The frightening reality of a  Big Brother   that influences media  political systems  commerce  and even daily life and social relationships  could prevail if humans become too passive about their roles and obligations to a society  What is accepted as order and compliance  as loyalty to the whole of a society  and what is seen as a personal choice of an individual  has been a matter of important debate for all societies  Although the year 1984 is in the past  many of the ideas in the book are still relevant today and continue to influence social and governing policies in modern society and lives  I think everybody can relate to the feelings of control  manipulation  and sometimes by our government and media which Winston experiences throughout the book  Even today  our privacy is violated and governments create intrusive policies  supposedly intended to keep their citizens safe  I would definitely recommend this book and think everyone should read this book at least once in their life  If you like reading fiction and history or have liked other works by George Orwell  you will enjoy this great book   Possibly the greatest book ever written   I loved every word  in every sentence of every paragraph  The scariest dystopian book I have ever read  due to how relevant it is to today s society  If are are not careful a lot of what goes on in this twisted futuristic reality could possibly come to fruition Truly mesmerising and impossible to put down   P  31    Sempre aqueles olhos a fitar nos e aquela voz a envolver nos  Na vigilia ou no sono  a trabalhar ou a comer  em casa ou na rua  no banho ou na cama   nao havia fuga possivel  Nada nos pertencia  excepto os poucos centimetros cubicos dentro da nossa cabeca   It s interesting  right now I am in London  and I think about this book a lot  Due to the fact that there are cameras everywhere in the Capital  Also a lot of signs saying in nature that  you are being photographed for your own safety   It doesn t set me off on london  but it s a city that is for sure in love with security  also there are notices to always beware  to be alert  and don t hesitate to turn in any information if you see anything strange  etc And a lot of the stores here have notices saying be careful with your mobile phone because there are thieves in the area or store  And for sure London has been hit with terrorist attacks  like forever  But it s interesting how this security situation is taken in stride by the London citizen  London is a great city and always changing  And this is one change I noticed since I last been here   which is a couple of years ago  Anyway  1984  is a great book   1984  by George Orwell is about a totalitarian society driven by fear  The citizens of the society are forced to follow a simple slogan of  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength   which is represented mainly by the invented character of Big Brother  Anyone who objects or expresses rebellious ideas would be captured by the thought police and vaporized  The main character in this novel is Winston Smith  an official that works for the Ministry of Truth  His desire in the novel is to be rebellious and become part of the secret organization  The Brotherhood  A diary is kept by him to express his rebellious thoughts and to supposedly communicate with O Brien  someone who he thinks is associated with The Brotherhood  O Brien eventually invites him to join The Brotherhood  and is eventually betrayed by him to be captured by the Thought Police   No one can be trusted in a totalitarian society like Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany  or in this case  Oceania  Winston seemed to be the light shining down at the dusty and dead civilization of Oceania  His desire to know his past and prove that the society was all a lie gave the impression that he was the savior of the society  But every hero has his tragic flaw and Winston s was being to trusting  It first began with Julia  someone who he has an affair with  and when he had made a lasting relationship with her  he began to lower his guard down and was manipulated into believing that there was a rebellious movement  His rebellious desire eventually took over and was easily convinced that The Brotherhood was indeed real  The idea of the thought police was always watching everyone faded and he expressed his ideas openly instead of writing in his diary and keeping to himself  He believed to be fighting Big Brother with an army  but eventually he was convinced that it was an army of one and it only consisted of him as Julia betrayed him also   George Orwell s writing style includes long descriptions of events that happened in the book such as the  Two Minutes Hate   He also includes collection of emotion which represents the manipulation of hate and fear created by totalitarian societies  I almost felt like I was living in a society much like the one depicted in the novel because I also felt the emotion  or at least believed  Winston was feeling  Orwell s opinions really became my own after reading the novel  The reason I chose this book was because of his other works  such as Animal Farm  and I also heard it was a good book to read  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone  but especially those who enjoyed reading Animal Farm because it is pretty much the same concept of expressing ideas of totalitarianism in an enjoyable way  Absolutamente fantastico Review completa aqui  http   labirinto livros blogspot com     Nao me recordo de ler ou ouvir uma critica negativa a 1984  Os classicos podem necessitar de tempo de adaptacao  Sera normal alguns nao se mostrarem acessiveis ao pensamento e disposicao contemporanea  ja conheci quem nao aprecie Dostoievski  por exemplo  Contudo  este livro parece estar imune a esse tipo de barreiras Orwell apresenta um cenario totalitario numa superpotencia mundial  O planeta encontra se dividido em tres entidades aglomeradoras dos paises convencionais  Pouco sabemos de duas delas  ja que a historia caracteriza se pela descricao incansavel da atmosfera onde os principais personagens se inserem  Este regime totalitario  empregue pelo autor devido ao panorama vivido sob as politicas estalinistas  abomina e elimina qualquer liberdade fisica  moral ou emocional  eliminando a importancia individual e acrescentando poder ao colectivo e ao ideal do partido dominante Nao queria alongar muito mais  O livro esta dividido em tres partes interessantes mas que podem ser consideradas como spoiler na sua descricao  E  sem duvida  uma obra fantastica  e que conquistou o seu espaco de destaque na literatura mundial  Como ja li noutro lado  e um livro que serve de aviso mas que nao pode servir como guia de conduta  Perhaps what makes this tale so gripping is the propensity of the imagined world to be translated in an objective observable human reality  more so as an empirical experience  not discounting that it may have been translated already   Orwell did a superb job merging a tragic romance and a corrupted political ideology  Worthy to be read beyond its years   I first read 1984 as a young teenager and found it disturbing and confusing  As I matured and began studying government and economics  I discovered this book had a lot to teach me  I read it again in my later high school years and found it very thought provoking and important in my daily life  1984 made me realize the news and social media outlets are all very useful platforms for manipulation  but you don t have to let it be that way  It taught me to be more aware of the people around me and what s currently happening in the world  Other than its importance  I found George Orwell s storytelling to be very well written with many  many quotable lines that exceed modern dialogue by miles  Winston Smith is one of the most remarkable protagonists in literature  I highly recommend this novel to anyone after an existential view on life and after the concept of what freedom is  and why it s so important  Amazing work of literature   1984 by George Orwell has not yet lost its appeal even after 80 years since it s first publication  The political views expressed in the novel remains very modern and significant for the current world events in which a kind of totalitarian government is a probability  It s a genius work written by a genius man with a deep understanding of the society around him and with the purpose of imparting to other people his ideals and stirring them to have the same  I m sure it will continue to impact people for more years to come   For my 10th grade CP english class  I had to make a reveiw of a book that I read for my final project  When my teacher introduced this project to our class I was figuring it was just another book I had to read and just more work for me to complete  I started the book 1984 and wasn t excited to read it  but once I got into it  it was one of the best books I ever read  I love how the book dived into deep sci fi like details of communism and controlling one s mind  It s the only book I ve read where 2 2 5  I expected the project to be dull and boring  but instead  it was actually a very good read  so I would highly reccomend 1984 to anyone who is thinking about reading it  This is one of the greatest novels I have ever read   lktb  lm y  l  kl Hl lyktb rwy  bhdh  lrw   lkn  n tktb shyy  lyuqr  mrr wtkrr fHtm  y d lTb  lbshr lt  l ttGyr  I think I was expecting the ending to be what it was  and I do love the last sentence The collective won while Winston thought about chess in terms of white always mating  checkmate  mate    It s a shame that human nature was exhibited the way it was    but what else are we expecting in this dystopia  The only page that spoke about perfection was when Orwell gave us a glimpse into a world that was completely controlled    when O Brien explains to Winston that the Party can do whatever it wants whenever it wants  We re talking about our ability to have power over everything  being able to control everything  We re not too far from that  actually  and if we are  there s only a matter of time Another instance that I found riveting  Time  It was masterfully planned to have the book titled 1984 around the time of the book s publication in circa 1948 1949  The theme of time fleeting and being re imagined   He who controls the past controls the future   reminded me of the conversations I ve had with my sister about how far facts go  Usually with either of us asking each other   How do you know   How would we know if the information has been put there by a sect of people  How would we know if history books are quite plainly   His  story books  There aren t many primary sources where the information given about crossing the harbor is straight from George Washington s journal entries  and penned by his own hand  I might add  It s incredible how very fragile and important the recording of time is  If the people of the past had nothing to go by  no hieroglyphs  no Mesopotamian Cuneiform  no sense of written language  they would have probably never existed  Civilization is built on language and records  not the kind you can play on a record player  by the way    Note  I love how Orwell mentioned memory  It brings Dali s Persistence of Memory to mind  because  according to some studies  paid by who  I have no idea   after a while we begin to construct our own memories from scratch    so after a while  we ll be telling a ton of variations of the same memory that happened to us some time ago  Pretty standard for the old man who was asking for a pint when everyone else was having a liter And now the part about the third part Questioning the system and not doing anything about it is a road to nowhere So it is expected that this character was not going to get out of the system as well as he had been before  It was something bittersweet that reminded me of my tears as I read Night by Elie Wiesel for Literature class back in 10th grade when we had 30 minutes reading time    and when I actually read into the book farther than I had expected at home  I basically started reading faster past the middle  and bam  I wouldn t let it go until Elie was done talking about his experience in Auschwitz   Winston s dehumanization reflected what I had seen of Night s ending    when the characters do not recognize themselves in the mirror  Save  Orwell went out the deep end of the spectrum of suitably subtle to  ohmygod  strong imagery  I felt the increasing need to embrace the book and embrace Winston for having gone through so much in the name of nothing at all That s another thing  The oxymorons of the party s insignia  or rather  it s three main phrases War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength We are slaves to our rights  and slaves to the consumerist economy  at least here in the U S  of A    We are always watching the news about Iraq and Afghanistan  And we are always taking the Television s word for it instead of looking for our own sources I like that Winston was caught  I like that there isn t a Happily Ever After  I also think that Winston is going to be killed because of that last sentence Anyway  of overalls and hidden Thought Policemen  I am so done  So done  Also  I did not find the end as scary as I thought it would be  but it was f   ed up  I do think that Winston was reconditioned into subjugation by the means of pain rather than reward  as many psychological experiments have gone   I hate the part where O Brien was trying to prove the collective right over individualism  2 2   4     Goddamn it   but that s how stupid politics are  There is no need to show off how brainy you are  but how manipulative you can be  The man was enjoying  cleansing  Winston The end where Winston neglects himself to forget far more than what he s forgotten for the sake of not remembering his painful memories  Anyway  yeah  I am just uber glad that I finally finished reading this book  I do wish that human nature was not what it appeared to be   I betrayed you     but it works   goes to sleep now because omg  I ve been wanting to sleep during my ride on the transit  in which I managed to read 30 40 pages that I lacked reading for this baby I recommend Orwell to anyone who has issues against and for social issues  just not pro choice  that wasn t something Orwell wrote about  though I loved the part where he said a thick woman was beautiful in her own way    But the book in question can be Unwind by Neal Shusterman  because that s where human fatality lies  do your parents want you to live a life of comfort or bad habits that cause them their life    Anyway    Oh The prime of man has not been found    yet  Unless we re on a steady slope to it  because the world in this book sounded like it was slowly going downhill without the Party being past enough to build a solid set on it  If small and great pleasures are not free to people  what says that they ll be drugged sheep   Also check out Across the Universe by Beth Revis  it s not as adult as this novel  but speaks more about the abuse of time as well as drugged sheep people  basically  Oh  and our current lives are not ready for a remake of the 1984 rendition of this book    People would get paranoid and start getting back on controversies alone  Be Wary of Big Brother As I held George Orwell s 1984 in my hands for the first time  I thought I knew the general plot of the novel  I knew it would be a tale of a dystopia  where  Big Brother   the leader of the book s totalitarian government  would be watching every move anyone made  constantly searching for signs of rebellion  As I started reading  I realized that I was right about the book s premise  but that the plot was so much more in depth and thought out than I realized  The story concerns Winston Smith  a man who works in the Ministry of Truth  a branch of the government that deals with altering history to make it seem like the government was always in control  Winston becomes dissatisfied with  Big Brother s  regime and purchases a diary  which are illegal in this world  where he begins to vent his frustrations with it  The story deals with Winston s struggles to resist the government  as well as his blooming love with his coworker  Julia  and his fascination with his boss  referred to only as  O Brien   The book has its fair share of twists  turns  and surprises  After finishing the novel  one of Orwell s messages is clear  Be wary of the government  and make sure you do not let them take away your personal freedoms  This theme rings truer than ever with the recent revelations about the NSA spying on the citizens of the United States  This novel helps to open people s eyes and make them warier of their surroundings  As Winston said   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   70   Overall  the novel is a classic  a must read for teenagers and adults alike  Not only is the book an Aesop about the dangers of governmental control  it is also an entertaining tale of hardship and love  Winston s love for Julia is one of the driving factors toward keeping him from giving in to  Big Brother   however  as the book progresses  it becomes harder and harder for Winston to stay defiant  While the book s ending is somewhat of a downer  the novel as a whole helps to warn people against giving in to totalitarianism  In today s world  this advice is more poignant than ever  This book is tied for my favorite with East of Eden by John Steinbeck This was brilliantly unique and unlike any utopian book I ve ever read  and I ve read a lot  As it is often said  it is an all too real story of what could happen  The disturbing parts of these books are the way they brainwash and torture and censor all so that they can keep power  The way they construct ideas about an endless war is terrifying  but fantastic  Something about this world draws me in  The way that the police are at every section of their country is crushing  How  just for the hell of it  they can change the basic laws of math and science Maybe it s because nowadays  we rely so much on technology that later this may be our fate  This for sure shows how a true utopia can never work with human beings  There would have to be all this censorship and diabolical manipulation to do anything close to a perfect world  But this novel highlights how much the human race needs its art and lust and emotion more than it needs peace in a society  Politicians often look past what is at the base because they believe it isn t a problem anymore When Orwell said that this could potentially occur  I didn t believe it  But as I consider it more and more everyday  perhaps it could I will recommend this to anyone who is interested in the human race  Or anyone who enjoys the new YA dystopian books  See how this influenced every utopia book after it  Yes  even including The Giver  which took a lot from this    He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   It took me a long time to actually enjoy 1984  especially in the end  George Orwell hated Stalin  which is an observation I have noticed from his two books  1984  and Animal Farm George Orwell  I think  imagined a world where people like Stalin ruled the whole world  with a Stalin like man watching over everybody  With Stalin like enemies   And everyone else was basically the Russians and the Ukrainians  And even though I have many Socialist ideas   I cannot call myself a hardcore Socialist though  because that would be an exaggeration   I totally agree that Stalin was a tyrant who murdered and starved his own people Back to the book  I found his vision of what would now be called an alternate History much detailed with many symbols that make us ask ourselves about our future  What will happen to us Will we always be free to say that 2   2   4 or just what we were forced to believe in I think this is a great book to discuss that matter  And so  I have found it an amusing book and definitely worth the time  Al principio tengo que admitir que me costo empezarlo y agarrarle la onda  porque no estoy del todo acostumbrada a este tipo de lectura un poco mas pesada  pero acostumbrarme no me resulto dificil tampoco Realmente interesante con una postura sobre el mundo muy critica y con mucha informacion politica  George Orwell crea un mundo comandado por un tal Hermano Mayor  con una nueva forma de lenguaje  creado para generar una nueva forma de pensar  el doblepiensa   La Policia del Pensamiento  que vigilaban cada uno de tus movimientos  los monitores y microfofonos escondidos para controlar hasta el aire que respiran y un sentido de la vida un tanto angustiante y en el caso de Winston  un poco paranoica Probablemente lo que mas me gusto de este libro es la explicacion dada en forma de texto que el protagonista lee en este libro  Orwell lo penso todo minuciosamente y nos lo explica detalladamente  La comparacion entre este libro y otros mundos caoticos me fue imposible no hacer  y la mayor diferencia es que el personaje principal no es ningun heroe  el lo sabe  solo es una persona con ideales diferentes en un mundo que tiene solo una forma admitida de pensar  Esto lo hace mucho mas realista y al principio me genero un  como va a solucionar toda esta situacion de mierda si ya estoy a mitad del libro y ni se unio a grupos clandestinos ni empezo su propia guerra ni nada   Como lo va hacer en solo un libro   Pero ahi estaba mi error  es una historia sobre la esperanza y los valores sociales al mismo tiempo que no lo es  mirada por un punto de ista completamente diferente  Podian averiguar hasta el ultimo detalle de lo que habias hecho  dicho o pensado  pero el interior de tu corazon  cuyo funcionamiento era un misterio incluso para ti  seguia siendo inexpugnable   The genius that is George Orwell did it again  This is the type of book you finish reading but never cease to think about it s contents and constantly draw parallels with our world today  Timeless indeed  Will definitely revisit the chapters from  The Book    1984 Review  Caleb BirdWell I liked the book but I thought there was a lot that could be improved on  Winston  the main character of the novel  lives in a country where individual thought is banned  where only the leader  Big Brother  is allowed to reason and to decide  Prodded by his natural need for reflection and critical analysis  Winston finds it hard not to make use of his inborn talents  He starts questioning the wisdom of Big Brother and moves hopefully toward his own liberation  But in his struggle for emancipation he stands alone  The large mass of common people do not find in themselves the need to think independently  to question or to investigate what they have been taught and to love Big Brother  another slave is born  another cog is placed in the machinery of the State  and the last man in the world is dead 1984 is a political statement  It contains only a simple warning to mankind  Orwell did not believe that 35 years after the publication of his book  the world would be ruled by Big Brother  but he often proclaimed that 1984 could happen if man did not become aware of the assaults on his personal freedom and did not defend his most precious right  the right to have his own thoughts  It is the vigilance of the citizens that has prevented Big Brother from starting his reign in the free world  This vigilance  Orwell would say today  may not relent if freedom is to be saved Orwell s imaginary States do not exist  but the world order of 1984 resembles in some ways the world of   1984    Indeed  there are two major world powers with a third one on the rise  They seem to divide the world into three zones of influence  Which is just like Ocian  Eurasia  and East Asia  I am guessing he meant to do that   The end of the book is very strange to me  I think it would have been a lot better if he had made it to where in the end Winston would have succeed and took down the party that is main part of the book that I could not believe  Also it seemed like it was a little slow to get to anything interesting and when it does it gets over that part and there are long spaces of very boring parts and in those parts George Orwell does not make it clear what is going on   Really it is a great book other that the boring and confusing parts but I enjoyed it at points  So eerily true even of today http   fourstar ir 1388 07 11 1984   There were four ministries the government was divided  The Ministry of Thruth concerned itself with news  entertainment  education and fine arts  The Ministry of Peace concerned itself with war  The Ministry of Love  which maintain law and order  And the Ministry of Plenty  which was responsible for economic affairs  Their names  in Newspeak   Minitrue  Minipax  Miniluv and Miniplenty  For me  this book is an epic  An absolute masterpiece  A book that accurately translate collective human nature greediness over power  Nomor satu di daftar my best book of all time Tokoh utama kita  Winston Smith bekerja di Ministry of Truth alias Minitrue  Winston tinggal di kota yang dulunya bernama London  dan kini disebut Airstrip One di suatu negara yang bernama Oceania  Di tahun 1984 di masa Winston hidup  kekuatan Dunia terbagi menjadi tiga bagian  Oceania  Eurostasia dan Eastasia yang terus menerus berperang satu sama lain Ocenia dipimpin oleh suatu figur maha besar bernama  Big Brother   Poster wajah Big Brother tertempel dimana mana di seluruh tempat umum  dengan slogan khasnya  Big Brother is watching you   Secara harfiah memang di dunia Winston pergerakan setiap orang terpantau melalui telescreen dan hidden microphone yang tersembunyi di mana mana  Bahkan ketika anda berada di WC pun pergerakan anda terpantau telescreen  Privacy is a mere fantasy Struktur masyarakat terbagi menjadi tiga bagian rigid  Inner Party adalah masyarakat dengan kekuatan paling atas yang menentukan kebijakan dan aturan  Outer Party adalah common people seperti Winston  para pekerja  Dan satu lagi adalah The Proles  masyarakat kumuh yang derajatnya nyaris disamakan dengan binatang  The Proles are inhuman Setiap pemikiran untuk menghianati kebijakan Big Brother termasuk dalam kategori kejahatan  Cara bergerak  mimik wajah bahkan igauan dalam tidur pun bisa dijadikan bukti kejahatan terhadap negara  Catatan sejarah telah seluruhnya ditulis ulang sesuai dengan kepentingan partai dan dapat terus menerus diganti dan ditulis ulang jika dibutuhkan  Anak dididik untuk mematai orang tuanya dan menyerahkan orang tuanya ke partai sebagai penghianat jika melakukan tindak tanduk yang mencurigakan Suatu hari ketika berjalan di sekitar daerah kumuh  Winston secara spontan membeli sebuah buku harian kosong  Buku harian tersebut memancing pemikiran pemikiran yang selama ini terendap di kepala Winston  Semua doktrin dari Big Brother adalah suatu kebohongan  Apakah hanya ia yang memiliki ingatan akan hal ini  Maka Winston pun memutuskan untuk menulis di buku harian tersebut untuk mendokumentasikan pemikirannya  Winston pun menulis   To the future or to the past  to a time when thought is free  when men are different from one another and do not live alone to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone From the age of uniformity  from the age of solitude  from the age of Big Brother  from the age of doublethink greetings  Sebuah langkah yang sangat berani mengingat pada saat itu sekedar  pemikiran  dapat dianggap sebagai sebuah kejahatan besar  Semakin banyak Winston berfikir dan menulis  semakin ia merasa gelisah  Satu orang tidak mungkin melawan seisi dunia Kemudian Winston bertemu dengan Julia  anggota Outer Party yang tadinya Winston kira adalah seorang mata mata alias Thought Police yang sedang berusaha untuk menangkapnya  Sampai suatu ketika dengan usaha yang hati hati Julia berhasil menyelipkan secuil kertas yang bertuliskan  I Love You  Bagaikan permainan Cat and Mouse mereka berdua berusaha keras menciptakan pertemuan pertemuan di tempat tempat tersembunyi  Pertemuan dengan Julia menimbulkan pemikiran pemikiran baru dalam kepala Winston  Bahwa dahulu  di suatu masa  personal loyalty adalah sesuatu yang berharga  Rasa sayang dan ingin melindungi antara satu manusia dengan manusia yang lain adalah nyata  Di suatu saat di masa lalu  Sebelum diganti oleh idiologi Big Brother dimana kesetiaan dan cinta hanya boleh didedikasikan pada Big Brother  Winston menyadari bahwa anggota partai lah yang bukan manusia  The Proles dengan kebebasannya jauh lebih  manusia  daripada mereka  Being a minority  even a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad  Winston dan Julia kemudian bertemu dengan O Brien  Seseorang yang mereka kira adalah seorang sekutu  Apakah mereka akan berakhir bahagia  Of course not  Winston dan Julia akhirnya tertangkap dan mengalami penyiksaan demi penyiksaan  U see  seorang yang tertangkap karena pemikirannya tidak serta merta dihukum mati  mereka harus melalui serangkaian cuci otak untuk mengubah 180 derajat pemikiran mereka sehingga segaris dengan partai  baru kemudian dibunuh atau dilepaskan sesuai dengan kepentingan  Lalu apa akhir bagi Winston dan Julia  Hhhhh   Cukup getir   After all this Big Brother society is too well constructed to break apart in the face of one man s resistance   And the people under the sky were also very much the same everywhere  all over the world  hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this  people ignorant of one another existence  held apart by walls of hatred and lies  and yet almost exactly the same people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world   Estava a espera de encontrar um bom livro  mas surpreendi me ao encontrar um livro genial A escrita de Orwell e brilhante  o enredo que construiu impressiona qualquer um  de forma assustadora  Escrito em 1948  esta obra mostra nos um cenario imaginario daquilo que seria o mundo em 1984  de certa forma inspirado nos regimes totalitarios do seculo XX  mas levado muito mais alem A ideia do Big Brother  de um mundo completamente controlado  onde a liberdade e a possibilidade de escolha sao inexistentes parece  numa primeira analise  uma hipotese completamente descabida  sem qualquer sentido  No entanto  a forma como Orwell constroi este mundo utopico negativo parece de tal forma real que chega a ser assustador e leva a pensar se sera possivel algum dia algo deste genero acontecer    E um livro perturbador  doentio e um pouco psicotico  E precisamente isso que o torna numa obra prima fascinante  read this if you want to understand WHY language is so important bh Trz bwrnkhrdny khrq l dh  dr mwrd hr zmny  hr mlty w hr mkhtSt jGrfyyy

dystopian novels and films  mainly because they re different and controversial  1984 by George Orwell  to me  was absolutely mind blowing Who could ve possibly imagined an alternative world where such logic could exist  A world where the human being is degraded to such a kind of person where moral standards and humanitarianism is a joke  This novel made me step back and look at several horrifying truths about our society A world where there are only three major governments  all totalitarianism governments  that control and monitor every single event in its domain  History and truth is ever changing to suit the government s needs  and people are  vanished  for the mere act of Thoughtcrime  an offence of simply thinking negative thoughts toward the government Winston Smith  the protagonist of the novel is a person who sees through the government s lies and deceptions  and think that it is outright wrong  As the story progresses  we disturbingly see the human spirit rise with hope and then fall  vanquished pathetically  This book is terrifying  disgusting  and simply an amazing piece of work  This book is something that makes you think  no matter how hard you may or may not want to  Be grateful that we still have the privilege of privacy and freedom of speech  because this is the kind of world we would be living in without them I truly and honestly look forward to reading George Orwell s Animal Farm in the very near future  Vraiment terrifiant   Et pourtant  ce sont bien les impressions eprouvees lorsqu on est paranoiaque  veritablement espionne ou surveille par une entite superieure qui vous met en position de faiblesse  et donc sous controle   toute infime pensee n a d autre peur et desarroi que d etre entendue  et surtout chatiee  Orwell marque la un coup de genie  le plus grand contre les totalitarismes  et donne des mots aux droits de l Homme pour son pire cauchemar  A lire absolument   khurfy   Simdiye kadar okudugum en saglam distopyadir  There probably remains little to be said about this book  It s the story of a rigid and conservative imperialist white dominated political mass that finds power in the alteration of fact and the very meaning of history itself  Convincing its citizenry that if you believe you just floated to the ceiling and I believe you just floated to the ceiling then it means you just floated to the ceiling is part of its dogma  There are other nifty thought tricks and arguments cementing the apathy of the masses and the governing power s unquestionable control  wars steeped in falsehoods whose acceptance by the public is guaranteed by their own inability to think critically or to even remember what occurred a week before  science as a projection of a false reality whose efficacy is called into question by its own objectivity  and so on Technological control of the masses is guaranteed by ever present devices that monitor one s every move and thought  Even language itself comes under the politico cultural boot heel with communication being purposefully reduced down to truncated versions of former words  with sentences and syntax as incomplete as one s thoughts  Literature and the arts as a whole are churned out on an industrial scale to dictate the tastes of the day   Wait   this is fiction  Easily one of the best books I have ever read A remarkable mixture of fantasy  love and political ideologies   a book which  in contrast to Animal Farm  not only contains strong political ultetior motives but but also a thrilling story of two induviduals who love each other The book is an eye opener  and portrays a society of totaliarism we must avoid  In this book  everything that could go wrong after 1948  regarding the iron curtain and the seperation of two worlds with two different ideologies  went wrong  At Orwell s time  the fear of the INGSOC society portrayed in the book was developed   a fear my generation finds it hard to regognize  considering the democratic world we rejoice ourselves in today  The novel paints a picture  distant picture for my generation  of a world we could be living in today  had events turned out differently than they did 1984 is a novel I found quite frightening to read  where all human values are whiped away by a totalitarian state   values such as friendship  freedom  hope  curiosity  induvidualism and even love  Induvidual human beings are not strong enouch to withstand the pressure from a constantly surveilling government   a government which makes you betray and forget the ones you love the most  1984 portrays the deep  desperate need humans have for power  something that will never go away  1984 is therefore an extremely important book everyone should read to remember the importance of democracy and individual freedom   something we must not  by all means  forget  mn hm lrwyt lsysy  lty lbd n tqr  kthr mn mr  lrwy  ttklm  n tslT lHzb lwHd w l kh l kbrldhy yshhdk w shrT  lfkr lty trqb kl khTwtkwshsh  lrSd

nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever  This book is timeless  It doesn t fail to haunt you by the future that could have been  or the future that could be  The ideas put forth by this will be as against the grain as  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength   but the author has so perfectly crafted this hopeless future  that like the notion of  Big Brother   it is impeccable  It is like a masterpiece of story telling  with mystery and thrill accompanying every part of the book  Apart from the idea of a totalitarian power which will rule the humans  which cannot fall  ever  this book feeds you with the thoughts about individual versus authority  thoughts about what is reality and the dynamics of human societies and the powers which rule them  And everything weaves together this incredible literary work which makes you realise most fundamentally  what makes you human  It is the peace you feel  the freedom you experience and the knowledge you possess Live through 1984 and it will show you what classics are made up of  This book changed my life  No  that s not an exaggeration and a biased comment  based on my love for George Orwell s writings   but it really did This novel was recommended to me by my English teacher in high school when she heard that I have a voracious appetite for reading  Along with Aldous Huxley s  Brave New World  and Nathaniel Hawthorn s  The Scarlet Letter   Orwell s 1984 changed my perspective of the world  It opened my eyes to the grandeur mankind has created  our ability to push ourselves beyond imaginable limits and the worst vices of human nature that plagues our very existence and ultimately   to our downfall  I have lost count on how many times this novel have aided me in writing my essays for school  I delegate blame to this book for no longer seeing this world through tinted rose lenses  for I now look through these glassy sky scraping buildings  power suits  men who walk with grey eyes and wonder whether they are subject to their own  Big Brother   But then again  in today s society  aren t we all  O Brien   How does one man assert his power over another  Winston  Winston   By making him suffer  O Brien   Exactly  By making him suffer  Obedience is not enough  Unless he is suffering  how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own  Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation  Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing  Do you begin to see  then  what kind of world we are creating  It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined  A world of fear and treachery and torment  a world of trampling and being trampled upon  a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself  Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain  The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice  Ours is founded upon hatred  Wow  This was an amazing book and I think everyone should read it  But as I say this  I know most people in our western society will only look at this being about eastern communism and not realizing they are just as bad  but they will use  doublethink  to make themselves think otherwise  Even though this book is mainly about a political takeover of the human mind  I couldn t help but relating religion doing the exact same thing My favorite quotes  Crimestop  means the faculty of stopping short  as though by instinct  at the threshold of any dangerous thought  It includes the power of not grasping analogies  of failing to perceive logical errors  of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc aka their religion   and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction  Crimestop in short  means protective stupidity Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible  But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the Party is not infallible  there is need for an unwearying  moment to moment flexibility in the treatment of facts  Applied to a Party member  it means the loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this  But it means also the abiltiy to believe that black is white  and more  to know that black is white  and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary  Pg  212 Thus  the Party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement orginally stood  and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism  Pg  216Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past  Pg  248You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity  You preferred to be a lunatic  a minority of one  Pg  249 No  I believe it  I know that you will fail  There is something in the universe   I don t know  some spirit  some principle   that you will never overcome    Do you believe in God Winston   No   Then what is it  this principle that will defeat us   I don t know  The spirit of Man   Pg  270Anything could be true  The so called laws of nature were nonsense  The law of gravity was nonsense   If I wished   O Brien had said   I could float off this floor like a soap bubble   Winston worked it out   If he thinks he floats off the floor  and if I simultaneously think I see him do it  then the thing happens  We imagine it  It is hallucination   He pushed the thought under instantly  The fallace was obvious  It presupposed that somewhere or other  outside oneself  there was a  real  world where  real  things happened  But how could there be such a world  What knowledge have we of anything  save through our own minds  All happenings are in the mind  Whatever happens in all minds  truly happens  Pg  278What was required in a Party member was on outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew  without knowing much else  that all nations other than his own worshipped  false gods   He did not need to know that these gods were called Baal  Osiris  Moloch  Ashtaroth  and the like  probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy  He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah  he knew  therefore  that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods  Pg  306  Sound familiar all my religious followers   Who controls the present now  controls the past  Who controls the past now controls the future  Who controls the present now    NOW TESTIFY    This book is THAT good  So much so that every movie novel afterwards ceased to be simply dystopian or anti conformity and simply became  1984 esque   Not to say that any book of such themes is bad  in fact I still might hold Fahrenheit 451 in higher regards  But obviously 1984 is the gold standard and this I believe for a simple reason   Spoiler  Most definitive works are so good that most who read watch think that there is no need to see another film of a similar theme  After _____ everything else doesn t match up   However  Orwell s depiction of the Party is so convincing that you HAVE to go watch read write create a similarly themed story with at least some measure of victory at the end  Fahrenheit offered a glimpse of better things to come while Equilibrium showed you the final uprising  But you will never NEED those victories as much as you do after reading 1984  Because if you don t  if you leave yourself hanging on the Winston s famous last words    you might start to believe that the light at the end of the tunnel IS actually Room 101 as you start to calculate in your head the possibility that 2   2 might actually equal      1984  see how I did that there   I can t believe that I have not read this sooner  This should be required reading in highschool  Bravo George Orwell  one of the best books I read in a long time  One of the best books of the 20th century  It s overwhelmingly haunting  I guess the best prophets are those whose prophecies can abolish the very future they predict  The world of 1984 is both frighteningly plausible and implausible  it s terrifyingly dystopian I couldn t help but find innumerable parallels with Scientology  and other cults and religions too  but the case for Scientology is even stronger  This books works as an essay and cautionary tale  the plot and characters are not the focus  but rather the world and mentality are  I was immersed from beginning to end  I understood the way people thought in that world  and at the same time I found no solution to the story other than a tragic one This is a book everyone should read  axla vp ik rob rato gviqvars shedarebebi    D  D amis shedareba 451 p arenheitt an

that the story takes place in 1984  It all starts out in a fictional place called Oceania where a totalitarian  post World War II superpower rules everything  The main character Winston Smith has an imagination and ideals that could get him in big trouble  The government watches everybody threw television screens and other various devices  Winston is very naive so he creates a journal expressing his views of the government  most often they are in a derogatory way  If he was caught he would be executed for his wondering mind  To add gasoline to the flame Winston begins to have a love affair with a coworker named Julia  They only show there with each when they are in hiding  at least that s what they think  To end an oh so interesting book he joins a  Brotherhood   a so called resistance  He meets a guy called O Brien but he just happens to be a police  They take him and torture him till he rejoins society with the new government s ideals  Even though this book is a classic I think that many people of the younger generation would be captivated by the book  I say this because of the action and that keeps the attention of the reader  It gives you suspenseful feeling that you always have to be looking over your shoulder  This would give the reader an ideal of what kind of government they would not want to have  I was very satisfied with book so I have it five stars  The reason I gave this book five stars is because I love books that talk about government and how they should work  From dictatorships to communism they all speak of ways of creating peace but they all seem to have flaws  So in this book they chose a totalitarian government so they could control every aspect of society  This gives me a sour vibe but it widens my view to be thankful for what I do have  That is why I gave this book five stars   1984 review  spoilers Imagine a world where your basic rights are obsolete  every conversation is recorded  you are always being followed  and one wrong word can end your life  This is what life is like in George Orwell s world  This is one of Orwell s classic books  He explores the subject of total governmental control with mentions of history being altered and the concept of Newspeak  The book also explores the main character  Winston  and his transformation from being apathetic of Big Brother to openly being against him  It also has a side story  in which Winston discovers a fellow Party member named Julia  and eventually falls in love with her In short  if you are interested in what life might be like in a totalitarian dictatorship or if you just want a good love story with a twist  then this is the book for you  1984Nineteen eighty four is a must read for young adults  the book is breathtaking and with some thought you can equate it with modern life and the technology age  This book is the leader in the dystopia genre  Winston the main character and every other person not in control of big brother were constantly suppressed and limited and swayed in what type of thoughts they had  Big Brother was just a concept to instill fear in people so that the party would keep their control like in a communist party The book is has a connection with modern time  the telescreens represent the CCTV and the newspeak represent the news providers creating and displaying propaganda  Censorship was also a big thing in the book  one thing going on right now in some countries like china and some islamic states  The book having these connections makes it a better read for me after I take time to reflect on how closely related all the topics discussed are to modern times Winston Smith positively depict that he was in a horrible spot  Winston and his illegal relationship  Julia  were both held hostage by the general public that they lived in and couldn t even consider another alternative  for even this was restricted  Later they would both go on and go against Big Brother by meeting in a secret place  Winston s friend O Brian would help him out with the love affair going on  O Brian was working with the party later setting up Winston and Julia while they were having their thing  In doing this they wanted to prove that Big Brother was still in control and no one could go against him  During this point the book started to get to a point Where it got more interesting  the plot twist was not that expected unless you were reading all the hints to it before it happened  While bringing Winston into room 101 the book got a little messed up in the way that Orwell wanted to get Winston to give up Julia  Otherwise the book always kept you thinking making it a good read    l b s   l b s  h qd ntSrt  l  nfsy  wSrt  Hb l kh lkbyr  bhdhh lklmt nh  wnstwn lthwr  ldy r  bdkhlh Dd lnZm wlkh lkbyr ly lnh bkl thq  wt

was a really tough book to read  especially towards the end  The sheer lack of any humanistic values of the people around the protagonist was appalling  The brainwashing  the torture  the forceful conversion  and the lack of any sort of privacy made this an extremely depressing  though a very interesting story  A lot of what has been foreseen in this book has definitely come to pass  but I still think our world is not as harsh as the one shown in 1984  However  it could certainly be going in that direction  While the brainwashing is very obvious in the story  it is very subtle in our world  Nonetheless  it is still there  This is the type of book that you have to discuss with a lot of people  because it has such vast ideas present in it  One such idea is  doublethink  that is the ability of a person to hold two contradictory statements and believe in both  Others such as  thought crime  and  newspeak  really open your mind  I was often thinking of Brave New World while reading this  While the future in that world is based on pleasure and happiness  the one in 1984 is based purely on hatred and fear  In the end  both these worlds lack any meaning in an individual s life  I found 1984 to be more poignant and straight forward  as compared to the scientific focused Brave New World which often got boring  1984 really deserves all the hype it has gotten as I felt a lot of emotions reading this mainly shock   fks sys     lsys  hy D f nqT  fyh      lmjtm     lmjtm  nfsh wtrkybh wTryq  t mlh m  lHdth    wtGyr Tryq  t ml wnstwn nfsh m  lHdth qbl m ykhsh wzr  lHb wyTl  mnh

tqwyDh    I hate the introduction  Gara gara baca bagian introduction nya  malah kena bocoran cerita  _   Kenapa harus taruh bocoran ceritanya di awal  Kalau memang mau taruh analisa bukunya  mending di belakang  deh  Nineteen Eighty Four bercerita tentang Winston  seorang pria 39 tahun yang tinggal di Oceania  sebuah negara  semacam  totalitarian  Winston bekerja di Record Departement  sebuah departemen pemerintahan yang bertugas untuk menyesuaikan sejarah  Tugasnya adalah mengubah catatan catatan sejarah yang ada  misalnya artikel di koran majalah  agar sesuai dengan masa depan  Misal  pemerintah meramalkan bahwa jumlah produksi barang A adalah sejumlah X  tapi ternyata jumlah itu tidak sampai  maka tugas Winston adalah mengubah berita yang ada All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper  while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot  And so it was with every class of reorded fact  great or small  Everything faded away into a shadow world in which  finally  even the date of the year had become uncertain   hal  44 Winston  yang merasa tidak puas dengan kondisinya  merindukan sebuah kebebasan sejati  Dalam kondisi itu  dia mulai menjalin hubungan dengan Julia  gadis di Fiction Departement  Walau tahu bahwa hubungan mereka terlarang  Winston dan Julia tetap menjalankannya sebagai bentuk pembangkangan terhadap pemerintah  Tapi  berapa lama hubungan mereka akan bertahan tanpa diketahui  mengingat setiap langkah warga selalu diawasi oleh pemerintah But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays  No emotion was pure  because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred  Their embrace had been a battle  the climax a victory  It was a blow struck against the party  It was a political act   hal  133 Yeah  ada banyak topik yang dibicarakan di buku ini  Tidak mungkin semuanya bisa dibicarakan di ulasan pendek ini  George Orwell membawa kita menelusuri sebuah dunia yang tidak memberikan tempat pada individualitas  Tidak ada ruang pribadi  Semuanya dilakukan untuk pemerintah  Semua gerakan diawasi oleh pemerintah atas nama Big Brother  sang tokoh pemimpin pemerintahan Buku ini sendiri mungkin memiliki kelemahan kelemahan seperti yang dipaparkan di introduction jilid yang kubaca  Misalkan tokohnya yang dibilang dua dimensi dan ada hanya untuk menunjukkan karakteristik pemerintahan yang ada  Kupikir mungkin ada benarnya  tapi mungkin memang akan seperti itu karakter yang ada mengingat bagaimana pemerintah mengondisikan masyarakatnya di buku ini  Kekurangan yang ada tidak membuat buku ini kemudian menjadi jelek  karena ada banyak poin kuat yang membuat buku ini  klasik  Saya juga akan memperingatkan bahwa  1984  bukanlah  The Hunger Games    1984  adalah sebuah novel distopia  tradisional  dalam hal nuansanya yang menimbulkan depresi  Jadi  kalau mencari buku distopia yang optimis seperti THG  saya sarankan untuk membaca buku ini dengan pola pikir yang berbeda Secara keseluruhan  seperti yang Ben Pimlott tulis di introduction   erroneus thought is the stuff of freedom   Buku ini untuk tantangan baca   2015 New Authors Reading Challenge  2015 Lucky No  15 Reading

visao mais sobria do mundo  A personal favourite  Goodreads Critique 1984 by George OrwellGeorge Orwell s 1984 takes place in his own surprisingly accurate guess of the year 1984 from 1949  Its about Winston Smith in the country of Oceania  and the tyrannical government that crushes all rebellious acts including thoughts  Winston Smith is very opposed towards the government and he decides to start rebelling in his own ways This book is filled with themes and lessons like the government is more powerful than you think  and that the government will become corrupt in the future  The government is always watching us  not on telescreens like they are in the book  but on cameras or by looking at our own private messages  Luckily we know about this thanks to Edward Snowden  but that brings me to the other theme  that we know less about the government than we think  I think that the government is still watching us in their own ways  This book can be compared to the book the Hunger Games  They are both about an extremely tyrannical government  but in 1984 the government punishes the thought the same as they would a robbery or murder in the Hunger Games to exert unwavering power over the people  One thing about the book was that the beginning was slightly boring and didn t capture my attention  After the beginning though  it was extremely interesting and one of the best books that I have ever read  I recommend this book to people looking for a book with romance and a plot extremely intricate and complex that will have you wondering what s next on every page of the book  This book was so entrancing that I actually felt strange reading it  I become so engrossed in the author s world that I found myself wanting to look around to see if  indeed  Big Brother was watching me  This book is as important now as it was when it was written  In the words of the late great Cristopher Hitchens  when describing North Korea   Its as though Kim Jong il read 1984 and said  can we do this  Lets give it the old college try    A very haunting book that I literally forced myself to stop reading so that I could get two hours of sleep before working the next day  Chilling  Terrifying  All too real and all too possible This is the book to read if you want to see masterful world building in action  The entire first third of the story is world building  There s almost no dialogue  no action  no plot  It takes Orwell one third of the page count just to set up his vision It s a world where everyone is monitored day and night  Actions are not a crime in this society   thoughts  are criminal Winston is a member of the Outer Party  the government   and he is one of the people responsible for altering the past  One of the first examples we receive is the chocolate ration  A news report states the ration for chocolate is reduced from 30 grams to 20  Winston s job is to go back over newspaper articles and newsreels that featured government promises of the chocolate ration not being reduced  and change them to warnings that a reduction may come  One day later  newsreels start reporting that the ration is being  increased  to 20 grams a week And everyone accepts it  People celebrate Big Brother  the symbolic head of the government  for his decision to bestow this generous gift on the people  Everyone simply forgets that there was a time when the ration was higher  They accept this alteration of the past  and the government s propaganda that times are good and always getting better  when in fact they are continually deteriorating  This is just one example of the terrifying society Winston inhabits  Orwell never comes out and states what the government is doing  He instead presents all the different methods the Party uses  convincing the people that the orgasm is a crime  erasing people from the record  and Newspeak What hit me hardest is Winston s conversation with Syme  one of the developers of a new language called Newspeak  Syme s explanation that  shades of meaning  are being eliminated from English  and Shakespeare will have to be rewritten to reflect it  slapped me across the face  Not only is the government manipulating people s memories  but they re making it impossible for people to have rebellious thoughts If people can t remember happier times  but instead are convinced that they are living in perpetually good times  even as those conditions deteriorate   they people will always stay in their place  If they lose the ability to have thoughts  feelings and emotions in the first place  they will never want to overthrow the government The proles  the working people  are living in perpetual poverty  but are happy to live in it and never complain because as far as they remember  there have never been better times to live  Chocolate rations have always been high  standard of living has always been wonderful  and times are good  But they are uneducated animals scraping a pointless existence out of the refuse of an unending world war  They mindlessly accept what they re told  do not strive to achieve anything  and don t even know they re oppressed  The government has seen to that  everything they do is to keep the people docile and in their place so the ruling class  the Inner Party  can live in luxury  That is scary This is masterful world building  The story is almost irrelevant  The real focus is the world Orwell creates  A truly terrifying and completely believable vision of a future that may have already happened  and we d never know it  It had my head spinning for hours after I finished it  I strive to blow my readers  minds away like this  too  It is the best novel I ve ever read I did a book movie comparison  Check it out  So disturbing certain aspects have stayed fresh in my mind for the past 35 years  And even more disturbing   parts of it have come true   Winston Smith believes it is 1984  although he doesn t know for sure   He was a kid when the world changed for the worse  Now he is a Party member who works in the Ministry of Truth altering the past according to the desire of  Big Brother  and the Inner Party  Winston tries to put on the face of a good Party member but secretly detests his country and leaders  He has memories of past events that he is required to alter  sees through The Two Minutes Hate  and falls in love  In a world where every move is watched  how long can Winston rebel Many parallels to today s time  Couldn t put it down  Este livro e maravilhoso  E um daqueles livros tao inteligentes que em certas alturas aprendi imenso e fiquei deslumbrada  enquanto noutras  inevitavelmente  me senti muito burra porque nao consegui perceber onde e que o sr  Orwell estava a tentar chegar Apesar de me parecer estar aqui uma critica ao socialismo  posso identificar varias coisas que nao sao comuns apenas aos regimes socialistas e inclusive algumas coisas que se aplicam aos dias de hoje  o que so fez o livro mais interessante para mim Mil Novecentos e Oitenta e Quatro e um daqueles livros que nunca fica aborrecido  fica sempre cada vez mais interessante e desafiante  A historia e super cativante e  para mim e um dos livros que mais me cativou e envolveu  fez me sentir verdadeiramente la Talvez nao devolva este livro a Madalena  As this book is one of my all time favourites  it seems only fitting that My first review in this site should be about it  Despite the fact that it is a bleak  and pessimistic story  it is still amazingly well written  Orwell really manages to portray the everyman protagonist in Winston Smith as a normal  sane  rational human being who through no fault of his own is in an irrational  insane  unfair situation He really is a character that you not only empathies with  but can put yourself in his shoes  and so when everything is taken away from him  up to and including his humanity  it really hits home because the character is by that point under your skin  even in a seemingly happy ending where he gets his  freedom  and a well paid job  its a hollow and quite depressing end because he lost his positive emotions  his sense of self and above all  his love  and that saddens me  because I do and have always believed that love  Real love  can endure almost anything  and to not be able to hold it in your heart is a betrayal of self as well as the other person  I ve read this book a handful of times and despite the hollow feeling it leaves me with  and the sense of paranoia that it enforces in me  I still really like this book  and I m still not sure why   When I first started reading this  I thought it was interesting but very far fetched  But then I realized that much of it is so similar to a nonfiction book I happened to be reading at the same time   Wild Swans  Much of Wild Swans focuses on life in communist China  The parallels are creepy   the cult and power of Mao Big Brother  denunciations  the ignorance and brutality of the common people  rigid and controlled lives  brainwashing and suffering of millions  blind obedience  disallowance of human relationships  etc   so creepy   I started to read this a few months ago  but I just couldn t get into it in the first few pages  Setting it aside was apparently the right thing to do because when I read it this time I enjoyed everything about it  with the exception of the ending   1984 counts for both my 2012 Back to the Classics Challenge  20th Century Classic  and The Classics Club Once again  as it seems happens more and more frequently  I m at a loss of how to respond to a novel  I both loved and hated 1984  I thought the ending was a bit tough to get through  but once you got through it the middle of the novel was amazing and kept me wanting to know what happened  but then the ending was let down  even though I get it I want to talk a bit more about the ending  I mean I get why it happened the way it did and I think Orwell was right in doing what he did  Part of this books charm draw is that for 99  of the book Orwell keeps you interested and hopeful that Winston will break the trend  will do what no one else  that we know of  will be able to do  Even at the end of the novel you think   this is it  he s going to break free  but then Orwell shuts you down and you  the reader  begin to feel the helplessness and despair that the party members of Oceania must feel Click here to continue reading on my

reassured its position at the top of my favorite novels  George Orwell is able to capture  with a prophetic voice  perhaps the greatest horror story of all time  a future society that has reached an equilibrium  The absence of progress  or legal free thought for that matter  is a frighteningly convceivable reality when told by Orwell  That humanity could take such a turn  sacrificing liberty for contrived happiness  with government as a means to an indefinite end  seems altogether possible when one considers the development of class struggle as described in Goldstein s book It is only natural to identify with Winston and his state of cognitive dissonance in the Ministry of Love because everything that O Brien preaches defies logic yet facilitates the Party s pusuit of power  thus making it entirely logical  Even more disheartening than the torture scenes are their result  Winston s loss of the last vestiges of his freedom as his mind finally embraces doublethink is culminated in the final  harrowing sentence  lktb ldhy syj lk tshk fy kl shy mn Hwlk lktb ldhy ySwr tHkm lslT  fy l m lktb ldhy syGyr fkrk mhm kntlHrb h  lslm l bwdy  h  lHry  ljhl hw lqw shkr jwrj wrwyl 1984  depeint une societe ou l histoire est constamment reecrite  ou l individu est nie et surveille par le tout puissant Big brother  Orwell reussit le tour de force de proposer une synthese des totalitarismes presents  passes et futurs  ou chaque derive est mentionnee  A lire pour que notre vigilance reste intacte 1984 is interesting among science fiction because it isn t  so to speak  science fiction  It doesn t have anything to do with science or technology  The year 1984 may have come and gone  but the scary thing about it is that it really could have happened in the year 1984  and it could happen today  It s a really interesting book because it s more of a philosophy book than a science book  What would life be like if the government controlled everything you did  What if all of human society was controlled by a Party that destroyed and falsified evidence against it  was constantly watching you  and even controlled language so that it was literally unthinkable to go against it  In this new society  the only emotions are  fear  rage  triumph  and self abasement   page 267   The main character  Winston Smith  works in the Ministry of Truth  a branch of the Party that works to falsify evidence to make it seem like everything s in the party s favor  The public  which has no memory  thinks that society is getting better and better while in reality it s getting worse and worse  During one part of the book  Winston has to change an article which says that chocolate rations have been lowered from 30 grams to 20 grams  The next day  there is a speech on how plentiful everything is  including that chocolate rations have been raises to 20 grams  Because of his position in the government  Winston is alone in his possession of a memory  He notices this when during Hate Week  a patriotic celebration of the war against Oceania s enemy  Eastasia  the speaker changes his point of view mid speech and claims that Oceania was always at war with Eurasia  Oceania ally  and allies with Eastasia  Seeing all the anti Eastasia posters  the crowd thinks the celebration s been hijacked by terrorists  He gets quickly found out because of telescreens  a monitoring system that the Party uses which are everywhere and constantly blast out pro Oceana news while keeping the people under surveillance It s a philosophy book in that there is a lot of metaphysics involved in the plot  When Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love  the building that the Party uses to torture and correct  heretics   he and O Brien  the member of the Party who tortures him  have a long conversation in which he tries to prove to Winston that the Party is infinitely powerful  An interesting point that he makes is that the past and even the present are dependable on human experience   Before man there was nothing  After man  if he could come to an end  there would be nothing  Outside man  there is nothing   page 265   When you destroy the evidence for the past  there is no way of proving that it ever existed  There is no way to disprove that   The stars  are bits of fire a few kilometers away   The Earth is the center of the universe  The sun and stars go around it   page 265   There is a word in Newspeak  the official language of the Party  called doublethink  meaning to destroy all evidence against the Part while still keeping it in your head  Another concept that is explored is the concept of  sanity is statistical   If everybody thinks the same way  even though it might seem insane  there s no way of knowing if you have nothing to compare it to   The Party has the power to make two and two equal five    repeated several times throughout the book   Leggere questo libro vuol dire assistere a quello che l umanita non dovrebbe mai vivere  o aver vissuto  In uno scenario postatomico  in cui 3 grandi continenti in lotta tra loro si sono divisi la Terra  gli individui sono assoggettati ad una forma di governo ultratotalitaria che interviene in ogni singolo attimo della loro vita  Amore  sesso  cibo  tabacco  tempo libero  divertimenti  tutto cio che puo portare i cittadini a distrarsi dai dettami del Partito e messo al bando e duramente condannato  Il controllo  dei comportamenti e dei pensieri  della storia e della memoria  e il cardine del Partito  comandato dal Grande Fratello  il padrone assoluto dello Stato  le cui immagini sono sparpagliate in ogni angolo della citta  ma che nessun cittadino ha mai visto di persona  Gli fa da contraltare Goldstein  il capo di un fantomatico movimento rivoluzionario  che attenta  stando alle dichiarazioni del Partito  alla sicurezza degli individui  Sicurezza garantita anche attraverso una guerra costante che vede perennemente coinvolti tra loro i tre continenti nemici  Ma quanto puo far male venire a sapere che spesso le bombe che uccidono centinaia di persone sono lanciate non dai nemici ma dal proprio Stato per mantenere uno stato di paura inalterato In questo scenario si dibatte la figura di Winston Smith  un membro subalterno del partito  che inizia a dar cenni di una ribellione al sistema tanto necessaria quanto pericolosa e che trova linfa in una ragazza simile a lui 1984 e un capolavoro assoluto  con un Orwell geniale e visionario che dipinge i tratti di quello che non vorremmo mai diventare ma che in qualche modo  forma o maniera in qualche parte della Terra e gia accaduto ed accadra di nuovo

world he lived in in 1949  and how it would evolve in the future  This story is the most famous dystopian novel ever written and was great enough to create a whole new category of books  In Orwell s society of the future one was required to believe whatever lies  The Party  and  Big Brother   the government  told  If one did not comply  he or she would be convicted of a  thought crime  by the  thought police  and would be executed or sent to labor camps  The protagonist  Winston Smith  works for The Party in the Ministry of Truth  rewriting the past to what The Party wants it to be  This job gives him the power of memory  leading him to believe The Inner Party guilty of  doublethink   being conscious of the truth while lying  Winston searches for The Brotherhood  a group opposed to The Party  which may or may not exist  as he looks for ways to overthrow the government  Most importantly he searches for the truth  What are The Party s motives  The constant war  And ultimately  what really happened in the past  The reader gets the opportunity to be part of Winston s discovery process and feels a part of his struggles against The Party  This book was well written in Orwell s signature straightforward style  The style of writing gives the reader a sense that he or she is there and watching everything happen  As a result  1984 is a page turner  bringing the reader into the story to explore this world  though the plot is also exciting  Orwell s writing creates a sense of urgency that the dystopian society is completely possible  His vision of the future is interesting  too  not because it seems so impossible but because parts of it mirror today s society  such as the principles of doublethink  not knowing the truth  and always being watched While 1984 is extremely well written  this is not a book for children or young adults  It is emotionally disturbing  with motifs such as betrayal and fear  From the first page the question is always  Who can Winston trust   This idea is common in today s society  Many question whether they can trust the government  companies  or even friends  Winston is betrayed by many and  in turn  betrays them  The reader learns that in this world  it is impossible to trust anyone  even oneself  Orwell also shows what fear can do to a person through the infamous Room 101  where  thought criminals  are brought  The threat of being sent to Room 101 can force one to believe that 2 2 5  freedom is slavery  and good is bad  The dystopian future of 1984 is felt in the world today  but even more so in the fictional world popular among teenagers and young adults  Ideas from 1984  such as censorship  totalitarian governments  fake histories  and being fed lies are seen in many popular dystopian novels  such as The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and The Giver by Lois Lowry  The fact that fears from 1949 have carried over to 2012 is interesting given that the world has changed so much  It makes one wonder whether these are natural human fears or whether things are increasingly heading in a frightening direction  1984  being the most famous dystopian novel has set a precedent for others of its genre  While the plot is similar to other dystopian society novels  it is better written  much more interesting and is the source of many ideas that are prevalent in books today   Terrificante affresco di una societa del futuro immersa nell assolutismo piu totale L ambientazione contraddice tutti i principi di democrazia in cui noi occidentali veniamo cresciuti  risultando odiosa a chi questi ideali li da per scontati Si ha per tutta lo svolgimento della trama un terribile senso di oppressione e paranoia  la sensazione che la catastrofe sia imminente e  piu avanti  l impressione che dall incubo non vi sia via di uscita I risvolti orribili di un potere che e invincibile ed eterno si presentano uno dopo l altro  disegnando scenari ansiogeni che spaventano piu delle trovate di molta fiction horror Il diritto al libero pensiero negato e forse la cosa piu orribile e presto ci si rende conto che e il passo iniziale  e anche quello finale   della distruzione dell uomo come entita autocosciente Ottimo l escamotage del libro letto dal protagonista per inserire nel romanzo un saggio di Orwell sulla politica e la gestione del potere  ottimamente scritto e molto illuminante Un libro di una forza rara  che sara sempre attuale  perche lo spettro dell abuso del potere e insito nella natura dell uomo Secondo me un testo che andrebbe letto in tutte le scuole  perche e con la cultura che si alimenta la democrazia  non certo con i fucili o i reality show   Power is not a means it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish a dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power   George Orwell  1984I wonder  if Orwell was alive today would he think we were still going in the same direction he predicted  Would he think of websites like Facebook that offered to keep track of your whereabouts and activities everywhere you go and at all times as similar to the  telescreen  that watched you and waited for you to slip up I wonder how long it will be before the thought police come bearing down on us  condemning us of  thoughtcrime   Or has it been happening all along and we ve just been too distracted to notice  Already  some governments require their faithful voters to practice  Doublethink  in order to support their criminal wars raged for power and resources and not for the overtly stated purposes  Already some people have adapted themselves to the reality that war need not be justifiable  it need not be in defense of freedom  It need only be frenzied and constant The lessons we are meant to learn from 1984 are as viable and applicable in today s world as they were the day the novel was published In fact  this is more than a novel   this is a warning  This is a prophecy   It was one of the best literary experience I ve ever had  Started out slowly  the book tried to relate and immerse us in a possible world of complete authoritarianism without the slightest room for personal freedom  The protagonist tried to keep his  sanity  in an absurd world under a suffocating pressure designed in the evilest way one can imagine  Then  he discovered love and lust for a woman as an embodiment of his humanity and as a form of rebellion against the mechanical society But the book truly shined later  close to the climax  Orwell ingeniously challenged the value of humanity  exposing how frail the nature of altruism and love in the face of overwhelming power  He questioned even the nature of our cognition and reasoning and argued the possibility of an ideology where the purpose of life and power is not the replication of life itself  but merely the replication of the idea  A wild and dark way to defeat the ever present fear of death and annihilation swimming deep inside every living being An idea of a society oriented not in a preservation effort of the species and the gene  nor in freedom or self actualization  but by killing humanity and life instinct and replacing it with a power cult using a sophisticated method of education  enforcement and supervision  With the help of a terrifying  carefully systematized reasoning method involving solipsism as dark version of a  leap of faith  in a kierkegaardian sense  That idea is both my biggest criticism and fascination  Is it possible even for an extremely powerful and meticulously crafted political system to override human instinct  Some religion and ideology proved that it is possible  but all of them in one way or another always relied on life and immortality  Even a suicide bomber is motivated by heavenly pleasures  and a war hero might have been motivated by a notion of immortality through respect  legend  or simple well being of their kin  Power has never been the end  it was always a mean for life  But the the  aristocracy  of Oceania doesn t even overindulge  neither they try to inherit their power to their kin  Can the sheer power of dogmatized reasoning kill off the human instinct  I don t think so  it sounded like an absurd idea  yet it left a sense of wonder about human and life  The way Orwell describes this dystopian world is absolutely marvellous  Only by this book it is really seen how the world would have become if it was ruled by dictators  even ones we don t really see  It is a great representation of how the world treats people who want to and actually do think differently and are not mere puppets  but also desire to see something else than what they re seeing and doing  It shows us how the world treats love and compassion  It shows us how we trust without thought and end up in places we only dreamed about in nightmares  It shows us how blind we can be as humans  Excellently written  In a word  1984 was stunning  Its parallels with real society is pretty scary  1984 is the story of an omnipresent  omnipotent  and omnimalevolent ruling class simply called  The Party   that has seized control of a country now known as Oceania  once known many years ago as Great Britain  and has firmly and forcefully planted itself in a position of total power  The story follows a forty something year old man by the name of Winston Smith  who begins to reminisce about the past years  but can t quite fully remember everything  The Party takes freedom away in every aspect  rewriting history as the need  making the public believe anything that they need  plastering propaganda on every street corner  keeping watch at all times everywhere with the telescreens  and enforcing the thought police on the unaware public  all represented by the figure of  Big Brother   the dictator of Oceania  In this world  simply saying or writing your thoughts loud can get you killed or worse  reproduction is only used for increasing the population with no emotional satisfaction remaining  and nobody can be trusted  Until  Winston meets a young woman named Julia  She  like Winston  has a carefree attitude towards the totalitarianism of The Party  and try to bring back the characteristics of what makes us human  by evading the thought police  and joining the underground opposition   The Brotherhood   they realize that The Party is far more capable of containing someone physically  but it can drive every last distinguishable characteristic of what makes you able to call yourself human  every hope for self questioning  and turning you into what everyone else under the control of The Party is  a mindless  faceless zombie  that will accept everything right in front of your eyes  qr th b d rwy  mzr   lHywn

Posiblemente sea la mejor representacion de la sociedad actual   Disturbing and thought provoking   An advisory narrative to enlighten society of the dangers of allowing governments to control aspects of our lives and the media to heighten their control   As fresh today as it will be tommorow   This book is my new favorite book  Eric Blair  or George Orwell as he chose to be called  is genius  The way he portrays the mindset in this whacked out society is fabulous  Even the main character  who has more of what we would consider a normal  logical way of viewing the world  has his moments that let us see just how absurd the society of the fiction 1984 is as view from today s society  That is the thing that makes this a timeless novel in 1949 Orwell worried the society he depicted would never come to fruition and today we can be thankful that it hasn t Now for my opinion on the most important part of the book  the ending I thought it was a perfect way to end the book  It is predictable yet unpredictable  This ending is exactly what the reader doesn t want yet exactly what it needs to be for George Orwell s point to stick  Libro que haya estado prohibido  Da miedo las similitudes con la realidad en la que vivimos  La ilusion de la eleccion  la libertad  este libro rompe eso When admiration for a book goes beyond the limits of well structured words  you are only left with one central idea  only one thing you gather yourself up to say  And in the case of 1984  the idea that haunted me while reading it for the second time is about cruelty  The roots of cruelty are embedded in the most devastating realization I came to reach by the end of the novel  that our saviors from this seeming invincible oppressive power that controls this world are our hearts not our minds  we prevail by impulsive sentiments not by rational thoughts  they can get to your mind by their sleazy  highly structured and organized tactics but they can t touch your heart  You came to realize that relieving conviction just to watch it destroyed  and it turns out they can do what you thought they are in capable of  they can get to you heart and then leave you all hollow   a shadow of a man   This is the first time I read this in ages  I was familiar with its anti authoritarianism  but I did not remember the more philosophical theme that emerges in Winston s talks with O Brien  Basically  if truth is taken as relative and merely  socially constructed  without any referent to actual existence  then the man with the gun gets to determine  what is truth  for those without guns  Stray musings   1  If you think life under Ingsoc is terrible  those poor souls in Eastasia have to live under Death Worship  which sounds much worse 2  Could Oceania sustain itself  North Korea seems to have done it for 60  years  but I have my doubts about whether a continental North Korea like Oceania could be viable  which ties in with   3  This is kind of weird to say in conjuction with the whole truth is relative theme  but it seems to be part of the horror of the novel that anything beyond Winston s immediate experience may be a lie  Are there three competing superpowers  Is the rest of the world really like Oceania  That is to say  how much of Goldstein s book  which tells Winston what he already knew  is true  Remarkable  astonishing  overwhelming  powerful  It really goes deep in how human minds can be manipulated through fear and pain  depicting a social and political system which is auto manageable and above any personality  Even with more than 50 years  Orwell was able to predict in his utopian world  one of the most dangerous contributions of technology to our current days  the surveillance and loss of privacy  A must read to everyone  Imagine living in a world where everything you do from working to eating and even thinking is all controlled by the state  Where any hint of disobedience can be detected by the Thought police  your telescreen  and even your own children  Where a new language is implemented just to eliminate any words related to political rebellion  Where black is white  and 1 1 3 all is the state says so  Where the past is rewritten to strengthen the appearance of the state  Where the  truth  is what the state says it is Imagine living in a world where WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHThis is the reality of the main character  Winston Smith  a low ranking party member of the ruling party in London  From the start  Winston has always disliked the party s ideals and has even illegally purchased a diary where he can express his criminal thoughts  As the story progresses  Winston starts to meet more characters who also share his same thoughts about the party Overall  George Orwell does a spectacular job of creating a depressing horrific speculation of the future  one with such an engaging story line that pulls in the reader from the first page I would highly recommend this book to whoever liked Animal Farm or anyone who particularly enjoys dystopias in general   I know the book was good  but I never would have guessed wit would be this good Starting from the first sentence  I immediately got hooked from the start  about the dystopian world Orwell created and made us believe  the political system and the higher power  which he explained in details  This felt like half fiction  half essay   you can always find arguments that Orwell wanted to prove  and along with those arguments  some look at the facts and examples  This book is more towards visionary attitude  Orwell speculated that in the future  to regain total control of human beings  the higher power has to do like this Reading this towards the end  I begin to discern things   to gain a foothold  you lose a foothold  You can never have more than two beliefs  We as individuals are subconsciously turning  into power driven or individualistic maniac looking for something to control  And where does that lead  What solution it needs The answer  Stability and Order That s where Big Brother came  Where what you say or do are known  watched behind the telescreens  The name registry  your job  your families   all will not know you are gone  The slogans have become fundamental belief of Big Brother WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Each has different meaning  and that s the core of INGSOC  English Society  in Orwell s world  the Big Brother who seemed to know everything  They use torture and fear to make them deny the reality and eventually  to see where they ve been wrong  Fear is the central attention of control  and once they have it   they could alter the truth whatever they like Highly recommended  especially if you wanted to know what could happen in the future  according to George Orwell  It was very interesting and the value it taught you are priceless  Kniga iaka inodi rozrivaie mozok vid dumok i divuvannia   iak  nu iak liudina v seredini 20 stolittia mogla napisati pro te  shcho vidbuvaiet sia zaraz   Kniga  iaku varto prochitati  I  dumaiu  ne odin raz   Bu muhtesem distopyanin bir sosyalizm elestirisinden cok  her anlamda bir uyari ve endise hikayesi oldugu bariz  Aslinda cok daha baska amaclarla yola cikilan devrimlerin nasil saptirildigi  her defasinda halkin  proleterlerin  kaybettigi ve iktidara sahip olan her kesimin bunu mutlaka kendi yararina kullandigini anlatan  essiz bir yapit  Zamaninin degil  her zamanin kitabi  Orwell is the closest thing to a prophet that I ve ever read when it comes to fiction  His read of humanity  its probable course  and the likely consequences are not only stunning  but frightening  From spoofing communist Russia in  Animal Farm  to painting the chilling dystopia of 1984  Orwell has consistently impressed me with his wisdom and understanding 1984 didn t turn out the way Orwell s novel said it would  and yet  so many of the ideas posited in the novel have taken root in the society I live in  and that only 25 years after the book is set Though they re not called  Thought Police   the proponents of political correctness have done effectively the same thing  We see fulfillment of the scripture that speaks of people  making a man an offender for a word   wherein I see demands for apologies and penance on far too regular a basis for my own liking  and often in response to slights that could readily be ignored by a more mature person  In one of his speeches at a college commencement  the late Charlton Heston spoke of a friend of his  I seem to recall it was a Congressman  who was forced to resigned because he used the word  niggardly  in his speech  which means  shoddy  or  sloppy    but because of ignorance on the part of the listeners  they automatically assumed he was making a deeply offensive racial slur  and when it was all over  he had lost his job Telescreens aren t necessary in our modern day version of  1984   we willingly plug ourselves into  the tube  to be fed a steady diet of marketing tripe  much of which we seem to buy without question  at least in my observations  Who needs to watch us all the time without our consent  when we gladly tune in to what they want us to believe anyway  Heck  we ll even get our political views from comedians  these days  O Brien  Colbert  etc    Rewriting history isn t even necessary in our  1984   we don t even want to  know  it in the first place  Why waste the time trying to change it  Besides  even when you do bring forth historical evidences  I ve seen it ignored or misinterpreted in many instances  I just read a 7th Day Adventist column about opposing Prop 8  for instance  that used concubinage and past polygamous practices to try supporting the idea that marriage as historically a male female relationship was specious and difficult to support without the bible  We have plenty of bureaucracy in place  just as Orwell s novel did  The division between the prols and the upper class isn t too different in 2009 than from what it was in  1984  The bottom line  I think  is this  Orwell seems to have known enough about our past to make a reasonably accurate prediction of our future  Let s face it  despite the technological advances since the dawn of the Industrial Age  humanity is still essentially the same as it was in the Stone Age  as far as behaviour goes  Isaac Asimov s Harry Seldon might have had what seemed a difficult job putting together the math for his predictions  but Orwell demonstrates that it doesn t take advanced math to know where the race  as a whole  will probably go    In this book  Orwell writes about Winston who lives in a world where the government brainwashes and manipulates the minds of their civilians  He later on falls in love with Julia and together  they hold to the belief that the party can never take away their love  SPOILERS  In the end  when the party found out about Winston s relationship and his attempts against the government  they mentally physically tortured him to an extent that he yelled to the party to do it for Julia instead  which proves how the govt is capable of controlling their minds  SPOILERS  Ok you can read now This book has been challenged several times and it was actually banned in the ussr for its political themes and anti communist ideas  It s kind of funny cuz whenever I read the word  big brother   I instantly think of Stalin bcs to me  they re very similar Do I recommend this book Yes  I recommend it though it could be depressing and you need to have a strong stomach to read it  I felt dizzy reading certain passages   Orwell purposely wrote this book to warn his readers about the dangers of a totalitarian regime and I personally think that it might happen but ANYWAYS    I highly encourage everyone to read it and if I remember correctly  it s available in the ZU library  so you can read the first few pages as a sample    Maybe I m biased because this book setting takes place in April  my birthday month  Or it could be the description of Victory Mansions that give me the chills  in any case  1994 by George Orwell is my all time favorite book  This book is so true to life that it s eerie  I wonder when Mr  Orwell wrote this book did he really predict by the year 2016 that BIG BROTHER would be watching us all  in reality  How could he forecast such a prediction The Thought Police really did a number on my mind  I still have a problem having certain thoughts around people because I feel the wrong thought will be exposed  Not to mention  you can see  The Ministry of Truth  in this years 2016 elections for Presidency    War is Peace    Ignorance is Strength   Freedom is Slavery   If I didn t know any better I would assume that the Illuminati read this book and used it as their blue print for the New World Order 1984 will forever be the book that literally opened my eyes to a new realm This book took me by surprise  I expected a dystopian society  but I didn t expect to feel personally invested in it  An shockingly imaginable and haunting reality  A few stunning lines   But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him  The horror was that he might also be wrong    Freedom is the freedom to say that 2 plus 2 equals 4  If that is granted  then all else follows    The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you already know    If you clung to the truth you were not mad   Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as understood    What can you do against the lunatic more intelligent than yourself   Lessons to learn   I read the book at 14 and liked it  I was told beforehand that it s about a dystopian world  and it did deliver  I know the feeling of having to watch over your shoulders  or guarding your words carefully  But I was also into the love story between Winston and Julia  At the time  Sting s  Fields of Gold  was playing on in the background as I was reading  so I associate the two with each other  The book  like the song  was pretty sad  I personally always root for people like Julia  the kind of savvy girl who likes to make the world burn to burn away the bullsh t  George Orwell realizo una diseccion descarnada de la historia politica del hombre y de la opresion de los partidos totalitarios  desde una perspectiva tan logica que me da escalofrios el pensar que tal posibilidad todavia es viable  Creo que  al final  si queremos evitar una situacion como la expuesta en este libro debemos replantear nuestras indagaciones historicas y volver a buscar la respuesta a la pregunta   Es posible un mundo en el que seamos iguales y en el que todos tengamos que comer sin tener que pagar por ello con nuestra dignidad      msk lkhtm l m 2014   knt qd qrrt qr  hdhh lrwy  fy  bryl lmDy    nshGlt blrwyt l khr  Ht  qr

his life  1984  published in 1948  is a foreshadowing of a future dystopian English society Divided into three major powers  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  the earth is dominated by tyrannical dictatorships eternally at war with one another  Winston is a member of the political party of Oceania  living in England  A quick peek into his world paints a horrifying image of life under a totalitarian regime  Every move he makes is monitored by a large television screen in his flat  he works for the government as a rewriter of historical documents to suit the needs of the Party  and happiness is all but absent The novel takes a turn when Winston meets Julia  a young woman whom he sexually desires  The two begin a relationship in secret that  if discovered  could mean certain death for the two lovers  Winston s slow ascent to revolutionary continues as he keeps a journal  also in secret  to document all his feelings and desires  The tension rises later in the novel as Winston and Julia s affair is eventually brought to light  It is there we see the true evil of the Party  as the lovers are tortured by their greatest fears  The sight of true horror is finally revealed at the novel s conclusion  Even in the most passionate of souls  the mind can still be changed so thoroughly as to believe two plus two equals five  2015 Reading Challenge   A book with a number in the titleI had this book on my TBR pile for a long time and I finally picked it up and took my time to read it  It took over a month for me to complete this read for one reason  you can t read it in a rush This book is thought provoking and it s impossible to avoid comparing our society to the one portrayed in 1984  It made me reflect  re think  discuss and theorize about today s society and what will come  How far ar we from a government like the on portrayed in this book  Aren t we already controlled  Twitter  Facebook  Instagram and all the social media are making our private life public for all to see  and the industry is already taking advantage from it  How long will it take for the government to use it on its own benefit  Even  aren t they already doing so All in all  George Orwell is a must read for those who are up to read about a critical view of past  present  and a yet to reveal future  Don t expect just another light dystopia  And remember   BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  Full review on my podcast  Check out SFBRP  113  I should have made this one episode  101  Oh well I reviewed Halting State by Charles Stross in second person present tense  Should I try to review this entirely in new speak   Utterly and unrepentingly bleak   1984  paints a dystopian landscape that  in all the everlasting power of its narrative  sits uncomfortably at the back of your head  whispering   To some degree  this is happening to you right now   Under the looming shadow of its political message   at different stages of the story and across various chapters    1984  explores a vast landscape of human emotion  disgust  rebellion  sexuality  despair  But above all  the unfathomable depths of human pain   from the lingering discomfort of a society gone wrong to the purest  helpless humiliation  A disturbing  provocative and gut wrenching read  WOW  Everyone needs to read this book  I understand how someone could think it s slightly intimidating  but this is one of the best thought provoking books I have ever read  I m really disappointed that I put off reading it for so long  now I just need to read the rest of Orwell s books    From Wikipedia   Thematically Nineteen Eighty Four  1949  and Animal Farm  1945  share the betrayed revolution  the person s subordination to the collective  rigorously enforced class distinctions  Inner Party  Outer Party  Proles   the cult of personality  concentration camps  Thought Police  compulsory regimented daily exercise and youth leagues  Oceania resulted from the U S  annexation of the British Empire to counter the Asian peril to Australia and New Zealand  It is a naval power whose militarism venerates the sailors of the floating fortresses  from which battle is given to recapturing India  the  Jewel in the Crown  of the British Empire  Much of Oceanic society is based upon the U S S R  under Joseph Stalin  Big Brother  the televised Two Minutes  Hate is ritual demonisation of the enemies of the State  especially Emmanuel Goldstein  viz Leon Trotsky   altered photographs create unpersons deleted from the national historical record   This should be read back to back with Solzhenitsyn s THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO  Also worth reading is Isaac Asimov s review of it in its entirety Excerpts from Asimov s review of 1984  That book described society as a vast world wide extension of Stalinist Russia in the 1930s  pictured with the venom of a rival left wing sectarian Other forms of totalitarianism play a small role  There are one or twomentions of the Nazis and of the Inquisition  At the very start  there is a reference or two to Jews  almost as though they were going to prove the objects of persecution  but that vanishes almost at once  as though Orwell didn t want readers to mistake the villains for Nazis The picture is of Stalinism  and Stalinism only By the time the book came out in 1949  the Cold War was at its height The book therefore proved popular    It was most popular at first with people who leaned towards theconservative side of the political spectrum  for it was clearly ananti Soviet polemic  and the picture of life it projected in the London of 1984 was very much as conservatives imagined life in the Moscow of 1949 to be    Orwell  however  had no time for either Mussolini or Hitler  His enemy was Stalin  and at the time that 1984 was published  Stalin had ruled the Soviet Union in a ribbreaking bear hug for twenty five years  had survived a terrible war in which his nation suffered enormous losses and yet was now stronger than ever  To Orwell  it must have seemed that neither time nor fortune could budge Stalin  but that he would live on forever with ever increasing strength    And that was how Orwell pictured Big Brother Of course  that was not the way it really was  Orwell didn t live longenough to see it but Stalin died only three years after 1984 was published and it was not long after that that his regime was denounced as a tyranny by   guess who   the Soviet leadership   Orwell imagines Great Britain to have gone through a revolution similarto the Russian Revolution and to have gone through all the stages thatSoviet development did  He can think of almost no variations on the theme The Soviets had a series of purges in the 1930s  so the Ingsoc  EnglishSocialism  had a series of purges in the 1950s  The Soviets converted one of their revolutionaries  Leon Trotsky  into avillain  leaving his opponent  Joseph Stalin  as a hero  The Ingsoc therefore  convert one of their revolutionaries  Emmanuel Goldstein  into avillain  leaving his opponent  with a moustache like Stalin  as a hero There is no ability to make minor changes  even  Goldstein  like Trotsky has  a lean Jewish face  with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and asmall goatee beard   Orwell apparently does not want to confuse the issue bygiving Stalin a different name so he calls him merely  Big Brother   Isaac Asimov s review of 1984 http   www newworker org ncptrory 198     Not having to do with any review of this book  but as an aside  Hilariously  most people I know DON T REALIZE this book is largely based on Soviet Russia  I can t count how many times I ve heard social liberals who count this book among their favorites exclaim in subdued conspiratorial whispers how much 1984 seems to be like a prophetic novel about George W  Bush s eight years in office  Meanwhile  Bush Jr  s Keynesian economics  exactly the same as that which Obama advocates  and big government neo conservatism  neo conservatism is center right and only slightly distinguishable from social liberalism  has very little to do with the USSR and communism  One social liberal who harbored a rabid hatred of Dubya I knew even listed Stalin as among people whom she admired yet after having read 1984  she exclaimed that 1984 was terrifyingly similar to Dubya s vision of America  It is difficult for me to take the idea of Bush Jr  or Obama for that matter  being

novela  pero si se puede hablar del tema central  que es una sociedad de 1984 consumida por distintas guerras  y un control absoluto por parte del Gobierno en Inglaterra  Winston  un trabajador cualquiera  se va dando cuenta poco a poco que el partido no es en realidad lo que le hace creer a la gente  y lo que en realidad busca es quitar todo pensamiento racional y acabar con el pensamiento liberal de los individuos  La rebelion al sistema no es una opcion  puesto que el Gobierno tiene vigiladas la ciudad entera tele pantallas  asegurandose asi que nadie se rebele al sistema absolutista que en realidad gobierna a Londres en 1984   Hd  nwdr l Sr  l tqr h w nt mshGwl b mr mhm  l nk ln tnjzh  whdh lys mn qbyl lmblG   George Orwell s 1984 kept me in awe  This book was astounding  It left me speechless several times  The novel was well written and kept me wanting more  The cruel reality of their situation was well written  This book made me want more  One of the major themes in this story is power  The government has too much power and they re using the power to oppress the citizens  They are ruled by a totalitarianism government  The citizens have no control over their lives therefore losing individuality  Individuality is what makes a person unique  If the government has too much power they are bound to abuse it This story is written in third person limited omniscient  This point of view gives off the feel of what is going on and helps you further understand the situation  The experience wouldn t be the same without this point of view  The characters are well written and would be believable as real people  The rebellious and the oppressors   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   In this quote Winston explains that people who are not aware of there surroundings are blind  He is the man who refuses to cooperate with the Party  The story is set in the near future Oceania  The setting of this story is the government rules with totalitarianism  Unlike them we have freedom  They are forced to conform and lose their right to individuality  You can imagine the poor living condition and the constant war going on  They lose their sense of privacy and are forced to be watched  Just imagine a place where living conditions are poor  rations  being watched all the time  and losing everything that makes you unique Winston Smith is a low ranked member of the Party  The Party keeps watch of all the citizens  The face of the party is known as Big Brother  They want everyone to follow what they say  So they decide to make them learn a thing called Newspeak  This prevents rebellious thoughts  If they were to have thoughts of rebellions they would be treated as criminals and punished  Winston refuses to follow the Party and decides to do what he wants  In this story you see his choices and the paths he chooses seeing the outcomes of his choices  I believe that this book does not have any connections with ones I have read so far  The only things that I might have read about is the government abusing power This book was well written and I enjoyed the horrific reality of their situation  I would recommend this book to people who want a story they would never want to put down with a well written plot and well developed characters    In George Orwell s novel 1984  the life of a totalitarian nation called Oceania comes forth  The main Character Winston carries out his everyday life in the horrid traditions the nations holds dear  Overall I enjoyed the book because of its complex nature and detail  but was horrified by its eerie fictional society  Never the less it is a fantastic novel that opens your eyes and creates reason to question your government  It shows that maybe the everyday activities that you do isn t necessarily justified or morally correct  Orwell warns against the dangers of authoritarianism  The story even goes to the extent to show that in this nation one cannot state or think anything negative of the ruling party  Orwell uses Winston who kind of a socialist to open the readers eyes  Throughout the novel Oceania is constantly fighting with the other two super states  This encapsulates the theme of war being necessary  Without war big brother would lose control over the people  They party and big brother also loves manipulation  for they use it to control not only the future  but also the past and present  Over all I Give the novel a 5 5  while horrific  it was thought provoking  Always remember  Big Brother is Watching You   Orwell 2   1984 Book Review11 December 2014In the world of 1984  If you want to keep a secret  you must also hide it from yourself   While the year 1984 may be long behind us  the messages and themes in 1984 are still as relevant as ever  maybe even more so today  1984 talks about a dystopian future  In this alternate future Great Britain is governed by a totalitarian government in which no one is allowed to have their own opinions  love anyone or even have close friends  The government is supposedly run by someone by the name of Big Brother  He watches everything the citizens do at all times  while on the street  while at work and even when they re in there own homes  The streets are littered with posters with the phrase  Big Brother is Watching You   written on them  The London of 1984 is very dull and depressing  there are excessive amounts of poverty  missiles hit the city from time to time and everything is very old and dirty except for these large pyramid shaped government structures that are placed in random parts around the city  The story centers around a man named Wilson who works for the government and lives a very depressing existence with no friends and no one to love  He hates how the government is run so he starts to write a diary to get out all of this built up rage and frustration even though writing a diary is illegal in Wilson s world  Overall I thought the book was very entertaining and that the original premise was fantastic  I think that the problems faced in this book speak more to people today because we can see clear similarities between how our government spies on us and how the government in the book went about doing it  Although it takes awhile to get to a point in the book where things start to pick up  and the book does tend to drag on at times  I still think the overall story and the surprise ending completely makes up for it  I definitely would recommend this book  not only lovers of science fiction but also to anyone who loves a well thought out story that most can relate to   I must say I have read this book twice  first in Spanish and then in English  The first time I read it  I was around 16 years old  I had to read it when I was in high school  Then  I read it again 3 4 years ago  and I have to say that I really loved it  This book is definitely among my 5 favourite books ever  I loved the story  Despite it is sad   the plot is perfect and I admired Orwell when I  met  Winston Smith  That character is perfect  maybe he is like us  a normal guy  kind of silly  kind of intelligent sometimes    but it is just marvellous how he struggled against the Big Brother    And the end  holy cow    I LOVED THE END  I am pretty sure I cried when I was reading the last 2 pages of the book  What a story  what a climax  what a context  what a message  It was good  although disturbing  A Note I ve found and I honestly and totally agree with   wbSrH    lm twq   bd wqt n wD t tlk

because one just can t write about it with a half mind or without organizing the Tyndall effect like agitation it creates in your mind  I had the same feeling after reading Animal Farm  but this book takes it few notches higher This story set some 50 years in future  from the time Orwell wrote it   depicts a dystopian world  where the ruling party  depicted as an ever watching  all knowing Big Brother s eyes  has such tremendous control over the lives of the masses  that they have no freedom to do as they will  or even think as they please  The people are monitored at all times by the Telescreens put up by the ruling party  which serves as a TV to instruct people  and a camera to monitor their activities  Every form of expression  or any possible means of deriving pleasure is termed as prohibited  All the history  philosophy and literature is modified  in a way the party wants them to be This novel depicts the heights of Totalitarianism  when the government controls and has the power to change people s thoughts and ideas  by all possible physical  mental or emotional means  So  when a certain Winston and Julia decide to rebel against the party  they go through unimaginable pains  and their extremes are tested  I will not reveal the end  in the fear of killing the book for you  but this story is so powerful  that it won t be surprising if you get nightmares while after reading it  This book is like a social fiction  cautionary tale which makes you think  what if this comes true   A super strong recommendation to each who wants to read something worthwhile  and huge respect for George Orwell  Tristan Knight 6 5 151984 ReviewOften times  there s nothing more invigorating than a good old fashioned dystopian piece  Whether to gain insight into the flaws of humanity or to simply feel better about where we currently are as a society  there is a certain sensation that can only be provided by a dark  cynical story of the future  George Orwell s 1984 covers all the aspects of a quality dystopian novel  each with a unique twist that sets it apart from the innumerable works that crowd the genre  the individual with a tense inner conflict  the omniscient and omnipotent overpower  and a plot to undermine the grand authority  With his masterful writing  Orwell crafts a thought invoking work of great impact in the literary realm The most prevalent feature of 1984 is the conflict within the main character s mind  This novel is one all about sacrifice and concealing one s true intentions  where even thinking negatively is a capital crime  the slightest twitch of the finger can mean the difference between life or death  The protagonist surmises it very well in the following excerpt Your worst enemy  he reflected  was your nervous system  At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom   Orwell Such a predicament creates a whole new area of distress  besides knowing that he has already broken the law himself  there is the clear possibility that Smith can be arbitrarily killed without thinking anything  It resonates in the audience personal fears of being in similar positions  such as no longer having their own thoughts remain private  or being in a position where one cannot defend themselves from a potentially life threatening allegation  Beyond this  the protagonist must dodge constant television surveillance  plainclothes spies  militarized children  and actual followers of the government  Smith s life is under constant scrutiny  and the reader s investment in his success faces off against the seemingly insurmountable odds against him even being able to express his dissatisfaction to another  nonetheless spur an entire revolution  Such a tense situation presented to the main character creates an interesting and suspenseful read sure to keep one on the edge of their seat The second part that makes 1984 such a phenomenal piece is its unique oppressor in the Party  They go far beyond the normal dystopian  big brother  government  indeed  the term big brother is derived from this book itself   employing dastardly and inhuman tactics to keep its citizens in line  Most crimes are met with extensive physical and psychological torture  followed by an often delayed execution  The expectations the Party places upon its citizens are also ridiculous to the point of being on the edge of plausibility  yet just possible enough to allow the reader to fully grasp the extent of the madness at hand  You are a slow learner  Winston   How can I help it  How can I help but see what is in front of my eyes  Two and two are four   Sometimes  Winston  Sometimes they are five  Sometimes they are three  Sometimes they are all of them at once  You must try harder  It is not easy to become sane    Orwell In this quote  the question is literal  The torturer truly desires Winston to believe that two plus two equals whatever his superior says it does  Such a scenario is fantastic enough to be clearly fiction while just plausible enough to seem like a potential future  Already  there are corporations issuing gag orders and groups like the Church of Scientology notorious for drawing its followers into a ridiculous lifestyle and beliefs  Of course  there wouldn t be much point in reading a story where the protagonist flatly accepts society the way it is  The plot against the system  although rather slow at the beginning  advances rapidly and forcefully as the piece approaches the middle  It is set apart from other pieces in the subtlety  secrecy  and fear behind it  With the strict adherence demanded by the Party  the audience is constantly reminded of the troubles faced by one who tries to face off against the higher powers  The futility felt by Winston is perhaps best depicted in the following excerpt from his journal   April the 4th  1984  To the past  or to the future  To an age when thought is free  From the Age of Big Brother  from the Age of the Thought Police  from a dead man   greetings    Orwell Although his conviction is clear   he readily assumes that there will be a future in which his writing is read  and that that future will be one of freedom   he is also convinced that he has been sentenced to death upon penning such a statement  This is not far from the truth  with the knowledge of the society that has arisen in this novel  such a simple act as writing one s true thoughts in a book is one of the bravest things that can be done  There is not much that can be easily done in the way of groups of people  the all seeing government ascertains as much as that  But watching the protagonist make small personal victories against them becomes infinitely more riveting when the bar for execution is set at considering such a course of action  As Winston sets his eyes on higher goals  the plot becomes more and more tense  and the efficiency with which it builds suspense off of the most minor of accomplishments is truly something to be applauded A good dystopian novel is often hard to come by  The genre is flooded with everything from angsty teen dramas to glorified Mary Sue fanfictions  With such a huge market and vast distribution in writing quality  it can take some time to find a good read  Luckily  the search must go no further  George Orwell s 1984 is an amazing piece that contains both a suspenseful conflict  a thought evoking Big Brother government organization  and a riveting plot that will carry the reader through any rainy day or bout of boredom  If a solid piece regarding human nature and societal flaws is what s desired  1984 should be the primary choice  The first book I ever read that made me weep   other than nursery stories when I was little   was Animal Farm  1984 had as profound an effect 40 years later  To my shame  I had never this classic until now Of course it is a monumental work and I cannot add much to that already written  but what did strike me was how much of the Party s methods were used in modern British politics  and most particularly since 2010  the re writing of history  the surveillance  the presentation of onerous changes as somehow wholesome I now have the glorious Huxley classic Brave New World to read  and to compare and contrast    Ciftdusun  islemi Orwell in betimledigi dunyada  gercekligin denetim aldinda tutulabilmesi icin

que daqui em diante sempre que ler uma distopia terei que a comparar com este livro  e que muito provavelmente irei achar que nao chega aos calcanhares deste  Alias  o melhor elogio que posso dar ao livro e que gostaria de ter sido eu a escreve lo  O livro e simultaneamente original  surpreendente  cativante e profundo  quatro adjectivos que nao uso frequentemente para descrever um livro  muito menos todos eles em conjunto   Freedom is slavery   a liberdade de sermos escravos da realidade que nao existe senao dentro da mente de cada um  num presente que define em simultaneo o passado e o futuro   Heads up Let me be up front admitting that this is one of those self absorbed reviews that doesn t tell you much about the book itself  but rather my experience reading it  So much has been written about the contents and significance of 1984  I don t think I can add much there  I write about how it affected me because it did  A lot  And I remain grateful to George Orwell for writing it  Thanks also to Ceridwen  for the Listopia link that got me thinking about rewriting this review today 1984 affected me profoundly  It s no exaggeration to say I think about it nearly every day  Yet that s all I wrote about it in my original review  Why is that  I m not sure  It s one of the  Big Books   capitalized  but without quotation marks in my mind  in my life  One of the top four or five which touched me in some way which transcends the conventional reading experience  I m not a very fast reader  so I can count the number of books on one hand that I ve completely read cover to cover in one sitting  1984 is among them  I was fourteen years old on Christmas of 1983  and somebody  I forget who  decided that with 1984 just around the corner  Orwell s work would be a good Christmas present for me  A few days later  with the luxury of ample Christmas break free time on my hands  I started in on it  I was home alone all day  and devoured the book  Afterwards  I just lay on my bed staring at the ceiling for like twenty minutes  digesting its contents in my parents  silent home  my room bathed in the anemic light of late afternoon in winter  which somehow reinforced the power of Orwell s dark vision  The experience hadn t been like reading a book at all  It had been like opening a message in a bottle  A message Orwell had scrawled off thirty five years earlier  and then cast into an ocean of media and ideas whose unpredictable currents had somehow ended with me  It wasn t a prophecy  as in  These things will come to pass   It was a receipt for Orwell s thoughts  which were now being whispered to me across time and from beyond the grave   Brian  I thought these things  and that means other people can think them too  I wrote this in 1948  when Hitler still seemed real  You live in a world where he doesn t seem real anymore  but he was real  He wasn t the only one with a horrible plan   The mere existance of Orwell s dystopic story proved that it was important  Standing on the cusp of a paradigm shift for months  this little push was all I needed  There was a flutter in my stomach  There really is a monster in the attic  The call really is coming from inside the house My interest and knowledge of history at that time was minimal  School had taught me the standard fare about the Pilgrims and Indians  Lincoln freeing the slaves  and World War I killing 16 million people because a virtually unknown archduke  is that like a prince   was assassinated  Everything else I knew had been powerfully drummed into me by my party line patriotic  Republican leaning  economically abused blue collar family and hometown  The political narrative I received in childhood went something like   America are the good guys who always fight countries like the USSR and the Third Reich  who treat their citizens poorly  Well  we treat black people poorly  and probably other people too  but not as bad as Hitler treated Jews  plus  things are getting better now   well  the worst parts of Buffalo do have a lot of black people living there  so it doesn t really look like things are getting better for them  but that s what everybody says  Anyhow  everything was fine until Jimmy Carter got into the White House and screwed things up so badly that my father got laid off and eventually lost his job at a company in Buffalo that made industrial presses   another thing which had an enduring impact on me   There was probably a little more to my worldview then  but not much more  and those were the highlights  I don t really want to debate the merits of my perspectives at age fourteen  the point is only that I embraced a sort of sanitized  black and white  star spangled American exceptionalism mixed with Hollywood happy endings which didn t quite ring true in the face of actual evidence from my own life  Before you fire up your keyboards to tell me  Sorry about your Dad s job  but Jimmy Carter isn t Big Brother   let me clarify that I didn t and do not think he is  1984 didn t speak to me directly about my family s finances or Jimmy Carter  but merely crystallized the vague notion that had been swimming around in my head that maybe all the lauded institutions around me were not necessarily designed with my personal Life  Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness in mind  Lest you think that 1984 made me suddenly think I had all the answers to history and social injustice  let me assure you I didn t  Orwell shocked me  but didn t turn me overnight into a    well  into anything  I started reading a lot more about history after that  and changed course in my thinking more times than I can remember  I guess 1984 made me more curious and engaged in current events  more critical in my thinking  and more skeptical of authority  That s all Orwell did for me  and I can t imagine an author doing more for a reader than that     It is twenty seven years later  and Orwell is all around me  as ubiquitous as the air  His whispered warnings have become shouts  which remain  it seems  mostly unheeded  Whereas my initial response to 1984 was a vague unease and a drive to examine the mechanations of history and politics  my present day response is a much more specific and literal recognition of the many ways Winston Smith s world mirrors my own  Analogies to 1984 pop up every single day  painful and uninvited  but irrefutable and obstinate  If you search the phrase  police taser citizen  on YouTube  you ll get enough results to occupy the next solid week watching them all  It s called  pain compliance  in law enforcement circles   See   it s not brutality   Since the PATRIOT ACT was passed  America has collectively consented to waive its privacy  allowing our phones and computers to be warrantlessly surveilled at any time and without notice  The terrorists these laws were supposed to be for don t live here  These laws are for us  We talk about waterboarding and secret renditions as matter of factly as we would discuss gardening  We are in the ninth year of an apparently unending  War on Terror  against Islamic extremism  We ve always been at war with Islamic extremists   except when they were our friends against the Soviets in 1979 There really is a monster in the attic  The call really is coming from inside the house Am I oversimplifying some of these things  I know some of you are just dying to tell me that I am  Go ahead  It won t change the fact that Orwell has never been more relevant than he is today  and there may never be a more important book in my life than 1984  flsf  sysy  jtm y  qtSdy  fy qlb rwy y   Hyn  tmn

considered one of the greatest novels out there  and I have to agree on that  This thought provoking novel exceeded my expectations  It delivered not only enjoyment  but also knowledge  1984 is about Orwell s vision of the future  Some view this as a warning of what could happen to the world in the future if we don t make a stand  This dystopian novel is thrilling because Orwell is correct  All the symbolisms are spot on  and some of the terrifying ones are only about to come our way  I m well aware of the controversies he tackled on  but this still helped become an eye opener  I have to admit that the writing is a bit outdated  1984 was first published in 1949 and it s a forgivable trait  It s not even considered a flaw back then  and most people don t even consider it as such today We have Winston Smith as our main character in this novel  He works for the Ministry of Truth as a clerk  He has a wife  but they don t live together  They don t even see each other anymore  In the monotonous world that he lives in  no one knows that he is against the power  In a world where everyone worships a higher power  there will always be a few who will rebel  Winston is one of those rebels  but he doesn t know how to fight the power  He is afraid  just like everyone else The situation Winston is in could be compared to a lot of things in the modern world  The afterword of Erich Fromm in this 60th anniversary edition further widened my knowledge of the novel  It s true that Orwell didn t say that these things will surely happen  but this is a warning for the readers  I understand now why this is considered one of those banned books  It s because this novel seeks to inform the readers of the truth  The truth scares people  especially those who will get exposed  I was assigned to read this novel back in third year high school  I was 15 years old then  and I hated anything that was assigned in school  I read about two to three chapters of this and ended up closing this novel and read something else  My mind wasn t interested in the topics that Orwell discussed here  but now I m regretting having done such atrocity  I can t believe it took me 5 years to realize my mistake  It took me that long to finally pick this up again and see what was all the fuss about  Being 15 isn t an excuse for my ignorance  I have a huge amount of important novels to read soon  and I m glad that I can finally tick this one off my list  I will read this again though  because I enjoyed reading it  It didn t feel like a textbook  or an online article  but it was a novel  Simply a novel with an interesting plot  well developed characters  and thought provoking ideas  I will admit that 1984 made me feel a lot intimidated before I read it  I was in such a condition because I feared that I wouldn t fully grasp the essence of the novel  I felt that I wouldn t understand the real purpose why the author wrote this  I decided not to chicken out and read it anyway  I m glad that I saw what Orwell wanted to depict  or at least most critical explanations backed up the thoughts I had after reading this  I decided to think about what I really felt and learned about the novel before reading someone else s opinion of it I didn t write much about the plot because this isn t a chapter by chapter analysis of the novel  This is a review of my journey into 1984  You can find hundreds on explanation online about the novel  and I suggest you check them out if you want to understand the novel more  I hate spoilers  and I won t be the guy who will spoil this novel for potential readers of this review who haven t read the novel  For high school students  please don t rely solely on sparknotes or whatever online analysis you can find  because it would rob you of the enjoyment that you would feel after reading this I ve had some warnings stating that this novel is depressing  and not enjoyable  I consider that as ignorance  You can t forever steer clear of these novels and divulge in happy ever after plots  You have to see the truth behind what happened  what s happening  and what could happen  I m not criticizing people who don t read classics  but I m annoyed at those who will recommend skipping such novels because they consider them depressing  profane  and Stalin like  Just my two cents  you don t have to take it if you re one of those people  Like I said  I m just annoyed  I m not trying to attack you After reading this  I felt as if there is still hope for the human race  The terrible things hasn t happened yet  and although it could still happen in the near future  I believe mankind can still prevent that from happening  First thing we need to do is inform  and then act on it  We can t live in a world like Oceania  it will drive us insane 5 5 stars  Truly spectacular  I enjoyed every page of the novel  and I will surely read this again in the future   rwy  1984    jwrj wrwyl  wl mrW   ktb nTb y  n Hjh qr th w n khyf   lHqyq

  This book made me think about all the different human excuses and reasons we give ourselves to live  But the point that winston the main character makes when being tortured to abandon his free will and not think for himself was when asked How do you know you exist  He says I do exist i am here I am now and I know I exist because no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time  That part of the book was by far the part that made me think the most  Not that all the points made about free will and the ability to avoid authority didn t equally make me think  But one of the most frequently asked questions of humanity is Who am I  and Why do I exist  And as much as we ask those questions it does not change the fact that we are here  We occupy the space we are in  and no matter what reasons we give ourselves it does not change the fact that we are here and we are the person we are  1984 made me wonder when given the choice to be ignorant  or to have the ability to think for yourself which one would someone chose  As painful as knowing is  knowing is what makes us live    George Orwell may not have answered these questions  but in my opinion in a way he trully did capture the idea of existance    tnwyh   qr th btrjm   lHrth lnbhn  w knt trjm  mmtz    jbtny kthyr wnHw qr  thny  lmtrjm akhr thm bllG  l m  rHl  Twyl  S b  wmt b  wkl hdhh l Hsys  l  slbyth l  nh mmtzj

 Everything faded into mist  The past was erased  the erasure was forgotten  the lie became truth      George Orwell  1984It s been over 5 years since I last read 1984 and I still find the storyline as horrific as ever  It s terrifying to think of a world in which your own children are spies for the government and can turn you in  where cameras are watching you 24 7  where one could be accused of committing a  facecrime  or having an  ownlife   a world in which we live nervously worrying about whether the sensitive machinery that is watching you will pick up an increase in heartbeat that may incriminate us When I first read this book I imagined a similar dystopic world taking place in a Communist country or perhaps in a dictatorship like the one so many of my relatives were raised in  Now I realize it could just as well take place in a so called democracy under several guises  and that s the scary part  My mind did wander quite a bit while I was reading this book  thinking of the eerie possibilities  trying to find parallels between what I was reading and what I was observing in society  We are witnessing so much propaganda which may not be as obvious as some of the hilarious pro Stalin and pro Mao posters that I ve seen online and in history books  but it s there in an often subtler form I think one of the scariest parts for me was seeing how language can be used to manipulate and control    All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory   Reality control   they called it  in Newspeak   doublethink   Language is definitely becoming more simplified and some of the words that are making it into the dictionary are just laughable I kept thinking about the following Virginia Woolf quote while reading this book   Lock up your libraries if you like  but there is no gate  no lock  no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind      Virginia Woolf  A Room of One s OwnFreedom of mind is something I take for granted  We all want to believe we re untouched by all this propaganda but are we really  Yes  this is definitely a cautionary tale  I wonder how many are listening  1984 is a dystopian novel that is set in the future    except there is no future because Big Brother  a political party that rules a huge power in Oceania  controls time so there is no past and there is no future  there is no memory and there is no ambition  Winston Smith works for Big Brother under the ministry of truth where he is carefully watched by Big Brother via cameras  and he starts to write in his journal about what he doesn t like about life  which is forbidden by Big Brother   He does what he can to revolt against Big Brother  and all odds are against him  I really loved how the book was written in 1949 and we can still see some of the books messages still prevalent in today s world  The book is so applicable to our lives in many ways which I don t think has happened to me on this scale while reading this book  1984 really is a great book  Gryb kyf lktb  n yTrH lrw   lsysy  lldkttwryt wshkhSyth w slyb qydthm wmsh r lsh b w fkrhm wmydwr fy khwljhm mn rGb  fy lthwr  tr  wlnqyd tr   khr    wkl mydwr fy flk lmjtm

campur tangan Tuhan dalam kehidupan manusia  Ada hukum hukum yang diciptakanNya yang bahkan diriNya sendiri pun tidak dapat melanggarnya  Selamanya 2   2   4  Saya tidak yakin Tuhan dapat merubah itu  Bahkan bila seluruh manusia berdoa untuk itu  Bagaimana bila ada dunia imajiner di masa depan yang diperintah oleh pemerintah totalitarian yang kekuasaannya sedemikian absolut sehingga 2   2 bisa menjadi 5 bila Pemerintah menghendakinya  Pemerintah menguasai semua sendi sendi kehidupan  segalanya  bahkan sampai kehidupan sex dan asmara warganya  Buku ini menggambarkan tentang itu Buku ini bisa saja menjadi sebuah teori kekuasaan yang sangat masuk akal bila saja tidak terlalu banyak penyederhanaan  Bak Machiaveli  Orwell menceritakan cara cara Partai melanggengkan kekuasaan yang lucunya mirip dengan cara cara yang digunakan pemerintah totalitarian di mana pun termasuk OrBa di Indonesia  Yang paling mencolok adalah sebuah usaha yang sistematis untuk mengubah sejarah demi kepentingan penguasa dan pengkultusan individu  Lebih jauh lagi  Penguasa bahkan berusaha mengubah bahasa sebagai kerangka berpikir  Bila berhasil  ini akan memutuskan secara total dari masa lalu Buku ini ditulis di tahun 1940 an tentang keadaan dunia di tahun 1984 di mana dunia dibagi menjadi tiga negara besar  salah satu penyederhanaan berlebihan yang saya sebut di atas  yang selalu saling berperang  Oceania  Eurasia  Eastasia  Novel ini disebut sebut sebagai salah satu novel terbaik sepanjang masa  Pertanyaan yang terlintas adalah apa menariknya membaca sebuah fiksi tentang masa depan yang sekarang sudah terlampaui dua puluh tahun  Dengan sedikit imajinasi agar tidak terjebak dengan kerangka waktu  novel ini   paling tidak menurut saya   masih pantas menyandang gelar sebagai salah satu novel terbaik sepanjang masa  Yang paling menarik  buat saya  adalah cara Orwell menyajikan klimaks cerita  Janganlah mengharapkan sebuah perang revolusi yang berdarah darah  Klimaks yang disajikan Orwell jauh lebih memikat dari itu  sebuah konflik psikologis yang intens  A must read   I m going to be honest  this book took me MONTHS to get through  It kept getting put on the backburner for a while because of other class books and because some parts made me wanna fall asleep  In fact  it took me four months  Despite that I loved it  This book was the perfect mix between a novel and an essay  It made me think about so many different things  the government  media all the different parts of the world controlling who everyone turns out to be This is a story about a man named Winston  and in this dystopian society any thought against the government can be deadly  And Big Brother is always watching  Winston begins to try to escape the telescreens that are all over the city  these can transmit and receive anything that happens  and falls in love with Julia  Winston decides he hates the government and wants to join the rebels  however things don t really go according to plan This book makes a statement about the world  not just how it is today but how it is in the past  In this book the past is alterable  if the government says they were at war with Eastasia then they destroy all evidence saying they hadn t  There was so much philosophy in the final part  of three  and this entire book made my head hurt  in a good way  The ending was exactly how I expected it to be  but not how I actually wanted it to end  It was the perfect ending for Orwell s message  Maybe some day I ll read Animal Farm  Roman 1984  je smjesten u buducnosti  jer je knjiga izasla 1948   u Londonu  Svijet je podjeljen na tri velike sile  Euroaziju  Istaziju i Oceaniju koje medusobno ratuju  Sve prati Veliki brat koji sve vidi i sve cuje  drustvo je podjeljeno na partije  Uzu i i Siru  visi i nizi stalez  i prole koji ne pripadaju nikakvoj strani  Cilj partije je potpuno osvojiti covjeka i onemoguciti mu privatni zivot  Svaki dom se putem telekrana pozorno motri  svaka aktivnost  svaki pokret i covjekov izraz lica  a na pokornost pazi Ministarstvo ljubavi  Ljude se drze u velikom siromastvu i smanjuje im se i najosnovnije resurse Djecu se uci da budu vjerni clanovi partije i stave je cak ispred obitelji  da budu dobri spijuni  Djeca su nasilna  vole partiju  napadaju svakoga sumnjivog i vesele se svacijem smaknucu  U skoli se uce lazi  iskrivljuje se povijest  pljuje se u udzbenicima po kapitalistima  a gradani se poticu na mrznju prema vanjskom neprijatelju tijekom Dvije minute mrznje U sredistu radnje je Winston Smith koji radi u Ministarstvu istine  gdje je preoblikovao podatke koji bi odgovarali sadasnjosti  Winston tek pocinje pobunu kad se zaljubi u mladu aktivisticu i radi nje prekrsi svako pravilo  tajni razgovori i spolni odnosi Winston je jedan monoton lik koji je otpocetka mrzio mlade zene jer je znao da nije u mogucnosti dobiti niti jednu  Monoton covjek je kao mali bio svinja prema majci i novorodenoj sestri  uzevsi im iz ruke zadnji komad cokolade  To je bio zadnji put da ih je vidio  Lik prema kome malo tko osjeti simpatiju zavrsio je onako kako u najgorim nocnim morama nije ni zamisljao i poput ljudi koje je nekoc prezirao  Kraj je bio onakav kakvog nijedan citatelj ne bi i nije zelio  sto pokazuje da nema izlaza iz takve situacije Knjiga pokazuje svijet koji smo mogli stvoriti  pokazuje ljudsku mizeriju  zelju za moci i ceznju za slobodom  George Orvell je stvorio svijet iz kojeg nema izlaza i politiku koju je nemoguce unistiti  pokazao je kako mala skupina ljudi moze kontrolirati masom  Orwell was only wrong on one count  the tyrannical dystopia was not completed in 1984  but it was significantly ramped up    In the 26 years since Apple s infamous  1984  Mac launch  and  the subsequent breakthroughs in the PC world which would eventually place us all in front of a screen  we ve lost more privacy  freedoms and rights than ever before  We ve also replaced them with nothing more than a shiny   new technocracy that promises the entire world  yet delivers only 0 s and 1 s Here I am  writing a review which may very well be seen by my children  and my children s children  The thought of every generation to come knowing what we read  Goodreads DailyLit   what articles publications we researched or subscribed to  Bloglines Digg Delicious   what websites we visited  Google Yahoo    what images we looked at

which Orwell warned about is very real  and we are indeed living in its growth stages today The question is  will it be as dystopic and seemingly hopeless as Orwell forewarned when it reaches its maturity One thing is for sure  we had better thank Orwell now and plan our escape  because it seems everywhere we look the control grid is in lock down phase    which side of history will you be on   One of the biggest books of the 20th Century  heck  they even named a year after it  I don t think totalitarian regimes totally dig it though  Without any doubt the best book i ve read so far  Some parts of it are so brilliant and evil that it hurts  I was somehow disappointed with the ending  although i m not sure if it s me or the book  I barely find any ending of a book satisfactory Yet it deserves 5 starts  and every god damn minute of your time  my fellow reader  It wasn t until the third and last part of this book that I realized this story is some kind of horror  It s really disturbing when you think there is no way out    and worse  when the crude reality of this book hits you in the face  All the dogmas explained in the plot  every crowd control scheme  each idea spread throughout this book is could be valid in a real world  An unbelievably inteligent and terrifying story   hdhh lrwyh tmthl nbwy h lrwy yn blHyh Very thought provoking  a book very suited for the times we are going through now  Infuriating ending  threw book across the room in anger at Winston  E  meglio essere amati o essere temuti  Puo esistere qualcosa per cui non esistono parole per esprimerla  La realta e oggettiva o e tale solo nella nostra mente Gioca con la filosofia Orwell  ma lo fa in modo cosi brillante da riuscire a trascinare il lettore senza alcuno sforzo  La trama in se non ha nulla di eccezionale  ma tutto il resto ha un fascino irresistibile  Il mondo creato non e soltanto un angoscioso regno del controllo assoluto del governo sui suoi cittadini  ma e un tentativo di completa distruzione della volonta umana non solo utilizzando il terrore  ma modificando la realta Un libro da inquadrare senza dubbio nel contesto storico che lo fece nascere  l esplosione dei regimi totalitari in Europa  con tutte le loro atrocita morali e materiali  ma anche un romanzo immortale  potente  angosciante  attuale Consigliatissimo e  aggiungerei  obbligatorio  Sicuramente una delle cose migliori che mi sia capitato di leggere  Meine Ausgabe stammt aus einer Zeit  als es offensichtlich noch keine ISBN gab  daher diese Ausgabe hier  Ein   trotz des Titels   zeitloses Buch  dessen dystopischen Szenarien und Parolen erschreckend aktuell wirken  Krieg bedeutet Frieden  Freiheit ist Sklaverei  Unwissenheit ist Starke  das Wahrheitsministerium  Manipulationen der Medien und damit der Wirklichkeit  Proles und Elite     I enjoyed this book an awful lot  I was amazed to find it so gripping  especially as it was written in a different period from now  I loved Orwell s style of writing and the way he pulled you into the story  the way he described the setting and what was going on  I really felt for Winston  The book had a lot of alternation which made it the total opposite to a dull read  which before I picked the book up and started reading  I was imagining it to be  no this was a fast paced story and I loved it  I d recommend it to everyone  because even my sister Rowan  who NEVER reads  read this book and loved it  I m now looking forward to reading more of Orwell s classics   1984 is a dystopian novel that takes place in 1984  a year once thought to be very futuristic and technologically advanced  1984 follows the story of Winston  a man who lives begins to question Big Brother and the way they run society  Big Brother acts as the government in 1984  they are very controlling and oppressive  When Winston begins to rebel against Big Brother he starts writing in a journal  which is not allowed under any circumstances  as the book progresses on Winston meets other people who understand him and share the belief that Big Brother is up to no good   or so he thinks  I thought 1984 was a pretty good book  but its pretty old and it was slightly hard for me to understand what was going on at some points  other than that the book was fantastic  I would not recommend this book to young children  because it gets pretty graphic for a while One thing that I really liked about 1984 was how we the ideas of Big Brother and how they treated their people can be seen in many governments today  and that s a pretty scary thought  Frustratingly brilliant   1  1984 raises the question of whether honor  duty  and responsibility are possible in ourown day for the individual who finds himself under the control of the modern totalitarian state In 1984  the individual counts for nothing  Whatever feelings of conscience an individual has can be destroyed by brainwashing The state can replace feelings of conscience with whatever it wants 2  Information is not lacking  however  the people of Oceania are constantly flooded with news Winston Smith is one of the small cogs that helps make the system work Winston Smith s job at the Ministry of Truth is to fabricate history  because one slogan of the Party is that  he who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future  Those in power can rewrite history and  thereby  control the perceptions of future generations 3  In Oceania  people are told that ignorance is strength  war is peace  and slavery is freedom  The people must be willing to accept these paradoxes  To survive in the Oceania of 1984  one must practice and be convinced of doublethink  the ability to hold in one s mind two completely contradictory ideas and believe them both sincerely 4  During a hate session  someone has whispered to Winston   We will meet again in a place where there is no darkness   That person sounded like O Brien Winston reads to Julia a disturbing book that O Brien has given him  It indicates that the Party is really about control  describes how to get and maintain power  and shows that warfare is a way of creating constant poverty  Winston learns that the entire social fabric is a lie 5  when Winston and Julia thought that they have deceived party and O brein is on their side they were taken to the Ministry of Love and shocked by knowing O Brien is really an agent of the Thought Police O Brien interrogates and tortures Winston until he believes that 2   2   5 if the Party says it does  Winston realized that Power is the ability to inflict pain and humiliation on another and nothing is more awful than physical pain  pain that makes him cries out   do it to Julia   6  Winston  the man of honor and courage  understands what the individual can do in the face of such overwhelming power  nothing 7  after Winston is released  he met Julia  Winston felt nonchalant about her  They spoke of their mutual betrayal and how torture can change people  They agreed to meet again  though neither intended to carry that out 8  Winston  the man who wrote  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER   now is listening to the telescreen spewing propaganda that he now truly accepts and looking up at the picture of Big Brother on the telescreen  and feels joy over his love for him and the great victory he has won over himself  as a traitor   mn rw  lrwyt w jmlh I will look at life differently after reading this   It is annoying when people tell you that you  must read  a book  I am well aware  and sympathetic  of that fact  But in my opinion  if there is one book that every American should read  it is this one  The absolute gold standard of dystopian fiction  1984 is an uncomfortably prophetic vision of a disturbing future  An enormously important book  and a riveting story to boot  Do yourself a favor and read this before the clock strikes 13  6 stars  highest possible recommendation  This book was mind blowing I just finished reading it and i m speechless  it was in Newspeak  Double Plus Good  Quotes that I loved  The best books    are those that tell you what you know already    He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   If you want to keep a secret  you must also hide it from yourself   If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  for ever   Until they became conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious    The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind  happiness is better    Being in a minority  even in a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad    For  after all  how do we know that two and two make four  Or that the force of gravity works  Or that the past is unchangeable  If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind  and if the mind itself is controllable   what then    cok acimasiz bir distopya  bile diyemiyorumKitaptan korktum ozellikle gecmisin degistirilebilirligi ve var olmanin aslinda gercekten var olmak olmadigi kalkfgjdlkgdj Neyse okuyun WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Oh my god  probably the most haunting book I ve ever read  1984 should also be included in the horror genre 1984 describes a Utopia in a way that makes V for Vendetta look like sissy  All the lives are controlled by the state  A mere hint of disobedience or dislike can be detected by state  They use the apparatus such as the Thought Police  Telescreen  or even worse your children  The language Newspeak  is also modified in such a way that you cannot express what you want to  since individualism is non existent The past is rewritten into something that will strengthen the current ruler  again and again  over and over  Who controls the past  controls the future  Who controls the present  controls the past  There is no real truth   Everything faded into mist  The past was erased  the erasure was forgotten  the lie became truth  Overall  a visionary novel in which George Orwell creates a disturbing picture of the future  A must must read  lkh lkbyr yrqbk ndm tkwn mHsb  l  Hssk w nfsk w Ht  Hrk   ynk n ykwn hnk shrT  llfkr lshy  lwHyd lmftrD l ykwn hnk

ftr    1984 is about Winston Smith who is living in a world with a system that he doesn t believe in  The Party control everything by altering the past through records  The way they see it  they can control reality by having control over the past  and people s mind  Winston wants to rebel  He meets a girl named Julia  who feels the same way  The have an affair secretly  and try to get into the underground system of rebellion  The only questions are  who they can trust  and how long it will be before they get caught  This book was written really well  It had a really good writing style  The book was explained just enough to make you think without being completely lost  It s great that the author  George Orwell does an afterword where he really reflects on the themes in the book  It makes it seem realistic  and makes you be able to see it in your world now   I personally thought this book was great  The themes made you think and really relate to your world  I would definitely rate it a 5  I would recommend this to anyone who likes conspiracies as well   I am more then halfway through the book and I felt compelled to write what I thought of it thus far  The book reminds me of Anthem in many ways  It s almost like a pre Anthem society that tells a very similar tale  Controlled society  man rebels  man meets girl  girl adores man and also rebels  etc  This story is a bit more involved though  especially regarding the Brotherhood and how there is not just one man against many  but an entire group rebelling  underground   Anthem s message skimmed the surface but so far 1984 has broken it down and analyzed it more  which I am really enjoying  This also makes me feel more connected to the story One of the thoughts that came to my head was  To fight against control  one must be controlled  The brotherhood controls the ones fighting against the Ministry  Big Brother   therefor using control to gain freedom from control  Dying for freedom is a scary thought but a big theme in the book which has awakened me to an understanding of survival of self vs  survival of the human race  So far the story is extremely entertaining  thought provoking and slightly scary  After finishing the book  one word describes how I felt  Hopeless ness   I cried a bit at the end but not from a loss of a character or from any tragic event but from a feeling of absolute hopelessness  My friend had said how he hated the ending  and I disagreed    I loved it because it created the strongest emotions from the message the author was trying to convey  If the ending had been victorious the feeling wouldn t have been as strong and the tone would have been completely wrong  in my opinion     He had won the victory over himself  He loved Big Brother As a writer  or a person who is willing to be an official one  writing isn t easy  It drains all the intellectual power you contain  and its perfection is a must  To imagine the combination of the perfected elements within this novel somehow indicated 1 either George Orwell is an absolute genius or 2  he is not human  Both presumptions are equally possible  The language is perfect  the imagery  the Dystopian world the plot  the metaphors  the events  all are perfect  After finishing Part 1  I couldn t help but notice that this novel might be considered the father of Dystopian novels  and that many famous novels today have been inspired one way or another by this book  Examples are Veronica Roth s series  and Lauren Oliver s trilogy  Both writers have took a sub idea and developed it into a series  Veronica worked on division of the ministries  Laurel on the prohibition of love lust desire and also created a society on that basis  While reading this novel Orwell s biography hasn t escaped me  I sensed its impact on this novel  as well as on his others  since they are all merely political  Here are some of the most interesting information I discovered which have a link with the novel   Because of his background  he famously described his family as  lower upper middle class   he never quite fit in  and felt oppressed and outraged by the dictatorial control that the schools he attended exercised over their students  lives     He hated his duties in Burma  where he was required to enforce the strict laws of a political regime he despised    Orwell bought ragged clothes from a second hand store and went to live among the very poor in London    He later lived among destitute coal miners in northern England  an experience that caused him to give up on capitalism in favor of democratic socialism    he rise to power of dictators such as Adolf Hitler in Germany and Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union inspired Orwell s mounting hatred of totalitarianism and political authority   According to one biography  Orwell s first word was  beastly  Why am I mentioning this  I believe in the school of Traditional Criticism  where there is usually some information on the writer and his times  and a little illustration  but no close analysis of the individual work or its aims  Somehow some of the facts above might have inspired him when he wrote this novel Varied themes have been carried throughout the novel  all which are as important as the others  starting from him alluding to the dangers of totalitarianism  going through the psychological manipulation  the physical control  the control of information and history   the first by inventing a new vocabulary under the label of NEWSPEAK  and limiting it to a small amount of words to prevent the party members and the proles from thinking  the second by instantly deleting every record of any past dangerous events which might in any way threaten their power   and ending with technology  smart smart technology shaped into telescreens and microphones The most prominent symbols which will stick through your brain all the way long are Big Brother  a non existent figure according to our current scientific terms  or as Winston put it a person who accomodates a space  which has a mass   an existent according to Ociena and a figure which will never die  The Telescreens also symbolize how totalitarian government abuses technology for its own ends instead of exploiting its knowledge to improve civilization  The Red Armed Prole Woman whom Winston hears singing through the window represents Winston s one legitimate hope for the long term future  the possibility that the proles will eventually come to recognize their plight and rebel against the Party  The Place Where There Is No Darkness instead of being the future paradise he had imagined  it was merely a prison cell  Hopefully  none of our future has met Orwell s expectations  but the novels depicts people in power and the sacrifices they can make to permanently control it  It is also depicts our capability of turning inhumane once we take hold of this omnipotent power Fantastic  Note  The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism  by Emmanuel Goldstein   is a genius thing that needs to be extracted from the novel  Maybe if everyone reads this they will begin to understand the danger of blindfoldly believe their governments and become aware of the tricks which are played on their behalf   mn  hm lrwyt l lmy  w rbm l hm mn Dmn lrwyt lty ktbt kkhyl  lmy w tHwlt lywm lwq  m sh w dhlk km yr  lkthyrwn mmn yw mnwn b n lmjtm t

it the first time when I was 18 and it blew me away but it didn t have the same effect second time around  Still loved it thought Very intense story and that ending        scary shit Dystopian novels are absolutely fascinating  And  when a novel written as skillfully as 1984  with a captivating story line came along  I found myself enveloped in every nook and cranny of this book  The story follows our dear friend Winston  a member of the extremely oppressive Oceania  With an ultimately overruling government   the Party   and its supreme ruler   Big Brother   Oceania has abolished all relationships  love  family  and marriages  All devotion and loyalty must pertain o the Party  as there are even thought police and telescreens to survey their every move  Winston becomes aware of his hate for the Party  falls in love with Julia  and is caught by the though police  After undergoing extreme brainwashing  he then falls victim to the Party and Big Brother I really enjoyed how detailed the book was  Personally  I appreciated knowing every knowing every detail of Winston s life  as I was able to better understand his world  I also found Winston uncomfortably admirable  With a complete drive to rebel and an ultimate surrender  Overall  this is one of the best stories I have read and would definitely recommend it    rdt bshd  mfj   l Sdq hn  l  ljwdrydz bqwlin mthl  hl t

dunyanin en guzel anlatimiydi  So realistic for dictatorial regimes   I just have realized why the Egyptian police have arrested a guy for having this book  Thank you our Egyptian police  if u had not arrested that guy  I would not have heard about this amazing book    I never read this in high school  and I probably wouldn t have appreciated it if I had  But it s a classic for a reason  brilliant  prophetic  and more than just a little bit frightening Full of so many gems that speak to tactics used by governments  religions  and even corporations  This is one that struck me as I read it   War prisoners apart  the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia  and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages  If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies  The sealed world in which he lives would be broken  and the fear  hatred  and self righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate  It made me realize how common a control tactic it is for groups to use fear and the concept of  other  to not only exercise control over their followers but also promote blind  dogmatic obedience and unquestioning deference to and worship of the authority of the leaders of the group as the only protection from the fabricated enemy  Today we have free access to languages and information so this should not be an issue  however data overload makes it so that we look to  trusted  sources to help us digest  often with the result of our using those sources much like a drunk uses a lamp post  not for illumination  but for support  A cautionary tale for us all  Aguulgyn tukhaid eronkhiidoo Zheorzh Orvil gekh

the first time I spend this much time reading some book This book is really AMAZING  It tells the story of the oppressed people everywhere  the story of dictatorships worldwide  The story of Oceania applies to every country in the third world countries  It tells the story of my country  Syria  The big brother is there  the thought police is there  the Newspeak  the principles of the party  even the party is there  I imagined every single detail in this book as it is happening in front of me  Winston is every person who is aware of what is going on in the country I recommend this book to EVERYONE  EVERYONE without exceptions   Libros que en su momento salteaste porque te los habian mandado a leer en la secundaria  y que mas tarde entendes por que te habia quedado un bache fundamental

government  politics  humanity  and the world deeply overwhelm me  I have learned that it has been this way for a long time  and sadly  will continue on like this for a long time  The slogan   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  sadly continues to ring true today  We are pacified by frankenfoods  falsified news stories  and the fear mongering media  My hope is that future generations will read this book under different conditions  but that can only happen if people awaken and discover their ability to enact change  Although this did not work out for Winston and Julia  I hope the conclusion is not predicative of reality  This book confirmed what I already struggle with  I am excited to move on to  Brave New World   next  Huxley  here I come  My second time through this book  and it made a lot more of an impression on me  I don t think the idea of  sex as political act  is entirely understandable for a 13 year old   What strikes me in reading this in the 21st century is how often we refer to it   for reasons it wasn t intended for  When we talk about 1984  we use it as a warning of technological advancement  of Big Brother watching us through telescreens and in reference to the Patriot Act  Really  that is simply a small tool used to show the destructive of something far larger   the obsession with power  especially from a Socialist standpoint  when read after Animal Farm  the emphasis on anti Socialism becomes more obvious   More interesting to me was the direct correlation between Smith s emotional and physical states  When he s living under the Party  he has a multitude of health problems  pains  and drinks often  It s only when he s with Julia and experiencing the positive human emotions that we were created for that he feels healthy  Perhaps the easiest way to identify a violator of thought crime is to look for physical health  After he is under the Party s influence and has been broken in spirit and filled with hate  he loses the remaining teeth he has  balds  becomes gray  and drinks more than ever  Losing those positive capabilities was more detrimental than not having them in the first place  Overall  an interesting and perceptive account of what it means to be human  and a glimpse of what life could look like without the positive emotions that make us so  Quite possibly my favourite novel of all time  Haunting  entertaining  gripping  didactic and most of all  somewhat relevant in our world  This book has significantly changed the way I look at power and control  There is a line in the book   the best books are those that tell you things you already know   This is one of those books  You can t help but notice the similarities between the ultimate infallible leader   Big Brother  and North Korea s supreme leader or how the fictional state of Oceania is virtually cut off from the rest of the world like North Korea  Ignorance is Strength   or how there is complete and comprehensive surveillance via telescreens just like the recent NSA scandal where it was alleged that everyone is being spied upon  The fictional States in the book are in tacit  peace  with each other due to possession of atomic bombs  much like the major powers in our world today   War is Peace or Peace is War   Orwell s attack on totalitarianism in 1984 follows his attack on Stalianism in the Animal Farm  But 1984 takes it to another level  Inarguably  one of the best books I have ever read  This scared and shocked me more than I could ever have imaginedAt first I thought the main character to be annoyingly inhibited and found his thinking restrictive like   it s happening right in front of you  don t think in circles  just name it REPRESSION    but he is a product of the world he is forced to live in  In that light  he is an exceptionally open minded and rebellious thinker I think George Orwell did an amazing job  showing the dangers of a society that wants to control not only what is known  history   but also what its citizens think  personality  or feel  humanity  and will do so to an extend where the human mind is but a farce of itself accepting everything that is offered to it by an  infallible  authority out of fear or confusion  1984  is a book a lot more adults should read espercially in this time of virtual surveillance and to make them think about what kind of future we want for ourselves I know just about everyone is forced to read it in school but that s different from reading it and really getting the message    Si habia alguna esperanza  radicaba en los proles  Although George Orwell wrote this book a long time ago when 1984 was still way into the future  it is scary just how relevant his fictional characters fit into a contemporary setting in the 21st century  Through and including the ongoing and seemingly endless wars in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Libya  It is an uncanny coincidence to just how close we are to the world Orwell writes about   I had to read this book for class and i didn t know what to expect  My teacher had the class analyze the book in depth and how it connects to our government and society today  This book is great for essay and getting to learn how people think  Its very twisted and makes you think this is how some people think of the world and how to rule over a mass of people  It shows that in society there will always be a few rich and strong people ruling over the mass amounts of people and through the deception and brainwashing the have control and power of a society as a whole  It s amazing and i think you should definitely read this book   Few books have had more of an impact on my life   George Orwell wrote this book to show how Josef Stalin  the leader of the Soviet Union  was controlling society  It also relates back when the United States  in 2002  when Edward Snowden  whistle blowed   project PRISM  which NSA and CIA used to dig in metadata along with terrorist preventions  This book also shows a world where privacy is all lost  The story is mainly about the main character opposing to society s notion of privacy  Should the protagonist actually take this risk of opposing society  Please read

mind and really provided an eye opening take on the future Orwell is able to craft a menacing dystopia that focuses attention on some of the growing problems of the present  The characters are developed only as necessary  but still able to portray feelings and emotions in a very stripped down sense  The third part of book is a special achievement pulls me back to digest over and over again   2 2 5  No matter what you think   no matter what you know   when the government tells you that 2 2 5  they are correct  Disagree  and you will disappear  You will become an unperson  George Orwell s dystopian novel 1984 takes place in a totalitarian society where the government has control over every aspect of citizens  private and public lives  It is the year 1984  and every move that is made  every facial expression shown  and everything that is done is monitored by telescreens  And  as always   Big Brother is watching you   The story follows Winston Smith  a man who can remember a time when the omnipotent Big Brother did not have control over everything  He slowly begins to rebel against the Party by committing thoughtcrime such as writing in a diary  avoiding telescreens  meeting up with his sweetheart  Julia  and eventually working secretly under Inner Party member  O Brien   Winston works at the Ministry of Truth  where documents are edited to make the Party look as good as possible and adhere to what they tell the public  Such as in the case of the province of Oceania  which is always at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia  Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia  But  it has always been at war with Eastasia  When the Party changes one thing  the entire history must be changed  And Winston is the one to edit it   Winston is an Outer Party member unlike many of the others and is incapable of doublethink  which means  the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously  and accepting both of them   Other Oceania citizens are capable of doublethink  and this is why they accept that one day they have always been fighting Eurasia and the next day they have always been fighting Eastasia  His refusal to be manipulated by the government and the way he views society makes Winston a trustworthy and favorite character of mine  It is interesting to see how Winston views other characters  such as Julia  At first he fears  that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police  who had come to take him away for writing in his diary  However  Julia is actually a rebellious young woman who soon falls in love with Winston  Julia is a bit of an irksome character as she pays no attention to politics  and often when Winston is explaining something to her  she falls asleep  The two know their love can not last long as Big Brother is always watching  but they try to stay together and meet in secret as long as they can  O Brien is a member of the Inner Party who holds a position high above Winston  Early on  Winston thinks that O Brien might hold the same hatred for Big Brother as he does  which is proven true when he invites Winston to work secretly against the Party and Big Brother  However  the way Winston views O Brien will change when they  shall meet in the place where there is no darkness   I have always found O Brien to be untrustworthy since he is a traitor to the Party  even though he claims he wants to return Oceania to what it once was  Although 1984 is told in third person  it is told from Winston s point of view  While still referring to the character as  he   Orwell grants us access into Winston s thoughts and opinions by using third person limited point of view  Orwell tells the story in a sort of detached way  as though simply stating facts and not romanticizing anything  such as when Orwell writes   As he put his hand on the doorknob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table   What is happening is still being described  but not poetically as many authors do  Orwell s style adds to the story because it is dystopian and bleak  so the disassociation compliments the genre and tone of the book  Orwell also expands his version of a dystopian by introducing the language of Newspeak   Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc  or English Socialism   Newspeak eliminated unnecessary words that existed in Oldspeak  our current day English  such as replacing  bad  with ungood and  excellent  and  splendid  with plusgood  along with introducing new words such as thoughtcrime and doublethink  However  Newspeak was only enforced by the government and regular citizens did not commonly use it while speaking  Orwell s word choice enhances the idea of a totalitarian society and makes this book more interesting  Even though the story takes place in 1984  it still has many similarities to the dystopian books we read about that happen hundreds of years in the future  We live with the constant fear that our world will turn into this type of society  and most importantly  Orwell is warning us to avoid a totalitarian government at all costs  The events of this book are a real possibility of something that could happen in the near future if we allow the government to accumulate the power to control our whole lives and convince us that 2 2 5  I would recommend 1984 to those who are intrigued by dystopian societies  but with more mature tastes than that of Divergent or The Hunger Games  1984 contains the same type of rebellion against the government except with a more realistic society that focuses around adults instead of teenagers  Orwell tells the story bleakly and as it is  rather than romanticizing it for younger people  Despite my interest in young adult books  I found 1984 to be very well written and intriguing  and it really made me consider what it would be like to live in a totalitarian society  drbrh khwd khtb w tfqty khh twsh myfth w khry khh b adm mykhnh

characters are uninteresting  and barely fleshed out this book is probably one of the best books I ve read  if you could call it a book rather than an essay  At the beginning you feel as though you re reading about a remote existence  a hyperbole that would never happen  a society that would never function  But as the book goes on you begin to feel as though this is something possible  something that our own society  even if just a little bit  could touch upon one day  It highlights the beauty of humanity  with all our flaws and instincts intact  but also the beauty of our powerful intellect  At many points I feel as though George Orwell is pulling us between our ruthless energy to strive for better  bigger  faster and more POWER  and the instincts that make us human and have barely changed for thousands of years  I loved it  and would recommend it to anyone  not as a story but as a message  a peek into a society that could have been  or could be  and a voyage into the heart and mind of a man who feared the voracious  untamable increases in technology in the modern era  George Orwell s frightening classic of a despotic government gone mad is one of my favorite novels of all time  Every person   man  woman  or child   can relate to the protagonist  Winston Smith  who finds himself through the course of the book  an enemy of the State  known as IngSoc  or English Socialism  in the novel   Winston is one of the few people in the story who finally  awakens  to the tyranny around him  It almost seems like the majority of the characters in this novel are like zombies   just going through the daily routines so they can finally get home and watch some football and drink some beer  the proles  This book  in my opinion  is a seer s prediction of the near future  It s a prediction of what s to come if the human race doesn t steer itself away from the current path of destruction that we re readily racing towards  It wouldn t surprise me at all if every government on the planet had a copy of this book  and were using it as a blueprint to carry out their evil deeds  If you want an intriguing story  full of political intrigue  romance  hardship  and philosophy  you need to read George Orwell s 1984   and soon  before you can no longer do so    nn ndrk  n m mmn  Hd ymsk zmm lslT  whw yntwy ltkhly  nh n lslT  lyst wsyl  bl Gy   flmr l yqym Hkm stbddy lHmy  lthwr

think  I don t want to read that right now  I just keep picking it up  I m a sucker for incredibly bleak dystopias  and for the everyman everywoman who s life we are viewing  Winston is just like you or I   struggling to do his best in a world that is certainly not always on his terms  In fact  everyone is sort of normal and unremarkable    Just as most folk in any fascist dictatorship oligarchy monotheocracy etc are normal and unremarkable As such  none of them  with perhaps the exception of O Brien  are particularly note worthy in and of themselves  They re boosted into interest through their situation  But that s okay  Like I say  I like an everyman O Brien  however  is terrifying  Terrifying in his very geniality  His absolute grasp of power and dogma and control is frightening because you cannot reason or bribe or convince a man like that  You are utterly at his disposal  There is no reprieve  There is nothing you can offer him that will turn him away This book is a grim look into a possible future  and certainly not the only one or maybe even not the best in it s genre  but to me it lingers the longest in the memory  You are immersed in this greasy feeling throughout  the discomfort of every citizen  the grime  the cheapness  the rot  the smells  the poor quality of everything  You almost watch it in your head in muted tones  Its very visceral and conjures true feelings of down and out drear and constant dread The part at the end where Winston admits that in the face of pain there are no heroes always gets me  It s incredibly true  We like to think of ourselves as noble  that we would do the right thing  hold onto ourselves and our secrets and protect those we love    but when it comes down to real physical pain we are all just cowering animals  All of us  I think this absolute truth is what keeps me coming back to it  Hace mucho que no leia una novela que me dejara pensando y me da gusto haberme decidido por esta  es una novela que si bien fue escrita en 1948 se puede muy bien sentir situada en epoca actual  no hablare en si del argumento de la historia mas bien me gustaria que tu como lector la descubrieras y formaras tu propia opinion  en lo personal no soy una persona muy empatica con todos los problemas politico sociales mi entorno  pero esta novela me ha evocado muchos pensamientos precisamente sobre esto  mas sin embargo si he de decir que 1984 no es una novela que pretenda entretener  mas bien plantear ideas para que el lector las desarrolle segun su propio criterio  muy recomendable   I first read 1984 back in junior high school  and was incredibly grabbed by its dystopian view of society  This summer  it shot up the charts due to the NSA scandals  which suggests that the government may be more of a Big Brother than we even thought  I figured it was a good time to have another look at it George Orwell wrote this book in 1949  and didn t intend it so much as a work of science fiction but a contemporary commentary  It has become an iconic book that not only gave us the terms Big Brother and the thought police  but a warning to any government that spreads its totalitarian wings The book is set in England during the title year  but England is part of a larger nation  called Oceania  There are only three nations on Earth  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  One is always at war with another  Oceania s government has complete control over its citizens  particularly those in the party  There apartments have telescreens that work both ways  transmitting and spying on inhabitants  Children are taught to inform on their parents  the youth organization is called  Spies    Sex  while necessary to procreate  is encouraged only for that purpose  and there is an  Anti Sex League   Citizens are encouraged to hate the enemy and the figurehead of the resistant movement  Emmanuel Goldstein  by periodic rages of hatred Winston Smith  an average man who works in the Ministry of Truth  is troubled by it all  He rebels by finding a nook in his apartment that is unseen by the telescreen and starting a diary  For one thing  he has memories and knows things he is told is untrue   The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia  He  Winston Smith  knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago  But where did that knowledge exist  Only in his own consciousness  which in any case must soon be annihilated  Winston s job is to recreate history  Anytime a person becomes an unperson  or the war changes  or an official contradicts himself  he goes in and changes the record  which in Orwell s world only meant print  It s amusing and disturbing to think that now this is much easier to accomplish  as digitally changing something is a snap Later Winston will meet a woman  Julia  who shares his views  She hands him a note that says simply   I love you   the three words that are most effective at changing anyone s outlook on life  They share an idyllic period of love and sex in the proletariat part of town  where people live in poverty but are not of interest to the party  But of course they are eventually found out  Then the book shows the full extent of the power of the government The book is easily readable  even with a large section devoted to the book written by Goldstein  which lays out the problems of society  there are three classes  the upper  middle  and lower  and that the first is trying to maintain its status  while the second tries to join the first  and the third is hopelessly locked in the basement  Winston believes that only the  proles  can provide the revolution needed to overthrow Big Brother  But Orwell will not let him  or us  have our fantasy This book is incredibly rich  Early on we hear a character called Syme discourse on  newspeak   an eradication of English into a simplistic form    It s a beautiful thing  the destruction of words  Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives  but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well   Take  good   for instance  If you have a word like  good   what need is there for a word like  bad    Ungood  will do just as well   what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like  excellent  and  splendid  and all the rest of them   Plusgood  covers the meaning  or  doubleplusgood  if you want something stronger still  Also  the notion of saying exactly what is opposite  which is a large part of most governmental language  comes into play here  The slogan everyone is forced to read on a constant basis is  War is Peace Freedom Is Slavery Ignorance Is Strength   Winston works at the Ministry of Truth  which is concerned with lies  The Ministry of Peace is the war department  The Ministry of Plenty keeps the people in starvation mode  And then there s the Ministry of Love The final act of the book is the torture Winston goes through after being caught  It is harrowing and eye opening  His torturer reasons with him calmly  even while giving him incredible jolts of pain  He is beaten down over months  and when he believes he has at least kept something  he has not yet betrayed Julia  they take that away from him  in a scene right out of Poe  it involves rats   I remembered the words for almost forty years  and here they were  exactly as I remembered them   Do it to Julia  Some other aspects of the book have become true   It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive  It was their delight  their folly  their anodyne  their intellectual stimulant  Where the Lottery was concerned  even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory  There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems  forecasts and lucky amulets  1984 is not a happy read  but it does have its moments of weeds breaking through the concrete  Orwell s position is that the party will never be overthrown  as they are too consumed with power to ever let it happen  But just by Winston thinking the thoughts he does is rays of sunshine   Being in a minority  even a minority of one  did not make you made  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the world  you were not mad  That s important to remember  especially when even in the freest of societies one realizes that the reality of 1984 is disturbingly too close for comfort  A must read classic  that will probably stay in my mind forever  haha    dapet lima ribu ajah  dg alasan nawar   mang  ni buku kan bahasa inggris  XDternyata  bagi pedagang buku  novel berbahasa indonesia lebih mahal daripada novel berbahasa inggris  so  harga buku ini  cuma setengah harga novel2 HQ XD Okumak icin baya gec kalmisim  Mukemmel  In the book 1984 written by George Orwell  the Party of the Oceania had control over the media  There is no private media companies  Actually  nothing is private  The party owns everything  which means that the Party can revise and even fabricate the history and news arbitrarily  Winston Smith  who is the protagonist of the book  works at the Ministry of Truth  which hold the control over the news and entertainment  In the Ministry of Truth  Winston Smith gradually found out that actually the history and news they learned and heard were all fake  Nobody knows what happened in the front line and how much products the country produced exactly  All the things are nearly fabricated in the world of 1984  One will never know whatever he or she heard is a lie or not  Things and news are constantly being revised or totally changed to establish the fact that the party is always correct  and the Big Brother is never wrong  The name Ministry of Truth actually self contradicts itself  It is a place full of lies  Let me just say  this is among my top novels of this year  1984 always has you on the edge of your seat  and I personally have never been so frustrated at a book Winston is just an innocent man with  brace yourselves  a functioning brain  Yet  the Party has brainwashed everyone  even children  to be the complete opposite  Eventually  poor Winston and his secret woman are found  and he is brought to the Ministry of  Love  which is ironic  because this is actually torture  Room 113 is filled with whatever you fear most  The Party s main intention is to force their victims to believe in the Party before they die  and several times  Winston overcomes the Party s influence  But I became so frustrated in the end  when Winston gives in and loves Big Brother  This is a highly action filled read  with little to no extraneous detail  which makes it wonderful  Highly recommend  llt dhyb mnTqs  wd llktb   n hdh lktb b d ltfkr  rwy  1984 ljwrj  wrwyl  stGrq  wrwyl ktb  hdhh lrwy  thlth snwt bdy  mn 1945  wnshrt fy  m 1949  w qd trjmt hdhh lrwy  l

talking about this book  probably due to the NSA scandal and suspicion or dislike of President Obama  Whatever the case  I decided to read this book because a couple of the news sources I use cite specific concepts from the book and apply them to current events  The two most repeated concepts I hear are  1  Two Minutes Hate and 2  Ministry of Truth  In current events  these two concepts are applied  respectively  1  to the treatment of those who do not conform to the worldview and opinions prescribed by mainstream culture or mainstream media and 2  to the mainstream media and political spokespersons In the book  the Two Minutes Hate is by far the most disturbing event to me upon first reading it  and it happens early in the book  You are getting to know Winston  the main character  and all of a sudden  you are led into a room with him and are swept up in the frenzy  Later events in the book seem heinous to me  but I am not surprised by them  i e  the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion   Ministry of Love   using force in unethical ways  as I was with the Two Minutes Hate In addition to producing works of art and culture  the Ministry of Truth is primarily responsible for writing history  Previously recorded statements or forecasts that contradict a later statement made by a Party member or contradict outcomes are destroyed and rewritten to fit the new agenda or confirm the realistic outcome These two concepts are just part of the totalitarian governance in Winston Smith s Oceania The story is a tragedy and the main character is aware of the inevitability of being captured for his Thought Crime  The tragedy is not in his capture and torture  but in his betrayal of his lover and his principles  In the end  he loves Big Brother and is killed by Him for it  Un libro assolutamente da leggere E  inquietante come Orwell abbia predetto il futuro  considerato l anno in cui ha scritto questo romanzo  Ogni volta che affronta una questione come il fatto di essere spiati giorno e notte dalle nuove tecnologie  l evoluzione della lingua o la sete di potere di chi sta al comando viene da pensare   come diavolo faceva a saperlo   Anche l atmosfera triste che aleggia per tutta la durata del libro richiama l apatia che contagia sempre di piu le persone di questo millennio Nonostante io sia totalmente a favore dei discorsi diretti che rendono tutto piu veloce  qui i dialoghi sono pochi ma la storia e talmente interessante da prendere vita da sola  Interessante notare anche la quantita di libri e film che hanno preso spunto da 1984   1948  Cielo CastroIntro  Throughout this time the book that I have been reading was 1984 by George Orwell  The book is a Dystopian fiction book  In my opinion I state that I did not like this book  because it had some confusing words like Polysyllabic  Labyrinthine  and Pneumatic  Those words bring to my mind the word  WHAT   Otherwise this book brings questions to my mind  because it s a hard book to understand  The way it expresses it s self or is written makes it hard for someone to picture it in mind  Since that is what most people do when they are reading a book picture the setting of it  In how this book relates to with todays society and back then is that they would try and make people get mad at you and or make things up about you  Which now days they don t because they know who you are very well  Body   In the novel of 1984 the main character was Winston Smith  and there setting was Victory Mansion with large glass doors  Had a painting of a face of the hallway on the wall  Although one of the things that I really liked was this one quote they used which was  Only because I prefer a positive to a negative  In this game that we re playing  we can t win  Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds  that s all   The reason why I like that quote is because that s all I do in life prefer the positive comments than the negative  Especially when it involves a game type of thing  I would rather hear positive comments that we will win then the negative  Meanwhile  almost to the end the book gets good because it involves Winston Smith  Better for you to read then me telling a summery about it  In fact  the author George Orwell did not just write the book of 1984  but also the book that seems pretty interesting named  The Road to Wigan Pier  which was a novel written in those days that he was struggling in life  The biography of George Orwell was that he was an English novelist  journalist  and a critic  There is one of his quotes that also makes me think of what it is referring to the quote is  Big Brother is watching you   In my opinion what I think this quote is trying to say is that God is watching after us  and that he knows all that we do   Eventually  I consider y all to not read the book 1984  because it will not make any sense to you  Going back to what the book genre is  it is a Dystopian Fiction book  The name of it is 1984  and it was written by George Orwell  Although I challenge you to read this book so that you can know if it is a good book or not  Trying to prove me wrong  Once you read the book ask yourself if it was a good book  and if not say to yourself she was write it wasn t a good book  Enjoy reading   lm shft mqT  lfydyw 2 2 5 lm  kn   rf  nh m khwdh mn rwy  1984 ljwrj  wryl wldhy lm  kn qd sm t bh wl brwyth

affect your vision of the world  but even your way of thinking  and the things you think no one could ever change your view or position about them  At the beginning of the book  you re certain that 2 2 4  that any other result is insanity and wrong  inconceivable even  as Winston said   How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes  Two and two are four   But as you turn the last pages  you realise that you re capable of accepting that 2 2 can be anything   Sometimes they are five  Sometimes they are three  Sometimes they are all of them at once  This book is an emotional and physical torture  playing with your mind and feelings with every new event  making you feel safe in one moment  happy even  then blow it all to dust  Making you think that you re  the last man    a minority of one  that isn t lunatic or mad  then show you that your thoughts of superiority can be destroyed under the right treatment  A book that took me more than a month to finish it  although it s not a long novel  but it s a life changing book  and every change needs time Nineteen eighty four starts as one of the books  that tell you what you know already   then defies what you re certain of  and shows you that under the right circumstances  you can  and will  be reshaped To conclude   Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing    This is easily one of the best books in my library  Orwell s writing is magical  It is a heartbreaking story which is too close to realism and quite frightening in its implications brilliant book  I enjoyed 1984 when I first read it at school as part of my GCSE English course and even more when I re read it a year ago  The way someone could write in 1948 about a future we would probably recognise as having become 50  true in the present day is quite remarkable  We see CCTV and state observation as almost run of the mill now and with the advent of interactive tv  holograms  3D etc George Orwell may have been 60 years before its time but if it was written now it would seem almost unadventurous  It is far from that   nh rwy  tqr     thm tqr  mn jdyd nh rwy  t br  n wq   SbHn n yshh bkl tfSylh

we aren t  What rings so true about this book is the metaphor portrayed by Big Brother  Although some things in this book may mirror our reality  other aspects of the book I find to be especially interesting  Love  betrayal  fear  surveillance  these are all themes found in this book and that s what I most appreciate about this book  I highly recommend this book    For more reviews  please visit my blog Obsessive Compulsive Reader   To the future or to the past  to a time when thought is free  when men are different from one another and do not live alone   to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone   From the age of uniformity  from the age of solitude  from the age of Big Brother  from the age of doublethink   greetings  Words escape me as I try to put down on paper my thoughts on this book  Animal Farm is a novel that stayed with me  even though it has been years since I studied it in year 9 English  And if I am blown away by that  what would I think of George Orwell s masterpiece In short  it is amazing  To say that my eyes have been completely opened wide would be an understatement  Never have I had to think so hard whilst reading a novel  Orwell has crafted such an intricate and frighteningly real society in which Big Brother and the thought police are always watching you  This is a dystopian society at its finest  It s perfect  It s impenetrable  And there s nothing anyone can do about it The characters are all extremely ordinary   in appearances  personality and careers  They hold no special abilities or secret plans to overthrow the government  Yet they are so believable and realistic that I couldn t help but grow attached to them And the message within this book  At first they didn t make any sense  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength  These three short sentences sound almost like oxymoron  However  once I finished the book  they make so much sense that it s actually quite scary  The world created in 1984 is not impossible  And perhaps that s what s so haunting about this book However  for fans of modern dystopian YA fiction  this may not be what you are looking for  There is no action packed plot or soul consuming romance   984 is a classic and you should approach it as such This is definitely one of the best books I have read this year  I cannot stress how amazing this book is

feel and live  Deffinitely one of the best and most interesting books I ve ever read  It has so much to do with our today s life and I was terrified to see the reflections of it s story in my working

and horrifying world of 1984  One of the finest novels ever written  George Orwell was a genius   qr  1984 twshk  n tkwn  d  snwy   jbt kthyran btrjm   nwr lshmy mn lmrkz lthqfy l rby  1984 by George Orwell is a fantastic tale about a dystopian society under the rule of a tyrannical government called Big Brother  In this world  Big Brother has created the ultimate dictatorship  They recreate history to fit what Big Brother says is right  use brute force to forge every citizen into a mindless zombie  and outlaw all things that let a human prosper  In this story  a man name Winston starts to question the core beliefs of his society  He is eventually caught and tortured for months until he is broken and completely under the influence of Big Brother   When George Orwell originally wrote this book in 1949  he used it to issue out a warning prophecy about the future  Orwell had experienced the Soviet Union first hand and predicted a future where a government had complete control  and used their power to insure that they would rule forever  Orwell s nightmarish prophecy has not come true yet  but their is definitely a chance for something like it to arise in the near future  We need to be careful so we all don t end up like poor old Winston  a mindless zombie   For me  1984 challenged how I view the world  I could relate a majority of the story to the world I live in today  Sometimes when I finished reading  I would get up and imagine that the Thought Police were coming after me  George Orwell was an extremely smart man and a little crazy too   you had to be to create a world like Oceania  Anyone looking for an exhilarating and challenging read  I highly recommend this book  This is a book that will keep you at the edge of your seat  and then make you fall right off  It s THAT good  I ll never forget this amazing read which has completely transformed how I view people  life  and government  Over and Out Jonah  Is there a novel written in the twentieth century with as much relevance  as much lasting impact  as 1984  Just think of all the terms and concepts from this book that have entered regular usage in our language   doublethink  Big Brother  thought crime  even the term Orwellian This was my first time through this classic  and I really enjoyed it  I can only imagine the impact it had on audiences in the forties  when it was published  and even to modern readers it s unfortunately all too easy to find many modern parallels to the totalitarian Oceania government  Obviously big totalitarian governments like that of North Korea are obvious touch points  but I think one can also find 1984 analogies in Britain s surveillance state or Enron s web of lies  I really liked the details about the Newspeak language  and how the Oceania government was working to dismantle and render obsolete the  oldspeak  English language  What seemed initially to me like a pointless busywork task instead becomes a vital tool in the complete destruction and control of the thoughts and minds of the populace  It really is a scary concept  Many of the book s control methods were obviously insidious  but this one seemed a little more subtle to me As shocking and terrifying as 1984 is  it s a book that should be read by everyone  everywhere  to arm the people with the knowledge to fight against encroaching tyranny by recognizing it whenever it appears  First of all  I have to apologize in advance as I am terribly inefficient with finding words adequate to describe my emotions for a novel that I read a while back and will definitely read again  That aside  that unforgettable ending was so powerful and awakening that I actually had to put down the novel  gaze through the foggy window  and ponder my existence  In all seriousness  I  as the typical reader who expects the usual happy ending in which the protagonist rides off into the sunset with his princess after vanquishing the bad guy  was very crest fallen to see the proud and resilient Winston to eventually crack after rebelling for so long against the omniscient  oppressive authority of Big Brother and even dies LOVING Big Brother  This dystopian novel by Orwell accurately emphasizes just how easily the general public can be deceived with empty promises and  more importantly  how valuable free will and the ability to question the status quo really is  One of my favorite quotes within the novel sums it up best   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows    Review first published at  https   bookwormrambling wordpress com When I started reading this book  I didn t expect it to end up on my favorites list  I had heard a lot about it  and had several people recommend it to me  But then again  I never end up liking popular books anyway  Still  I thought I d give it a chance  George Orwell s  1984  is the most disturbing  depressing book I have ever read  Also  the most brilliant thing you could ever read  This one is truly worthy of being called a classic In his book  Orwell managed to capture dictatorship in its darkest forms  He created this hauntingly realistic dystopia that forever scars you and changes your view of our current day world  In George Orwell s  fictional  world  extreme totalitarianism is the way to go  Leaders have complete authority over individuals and control as many aspects of both their public and private lives as they could possibly manage  The state monitors and controls everything you do starting from your work right down to the most basic things like what you get to eat and drink  when and how long you get to sleep  how you talk  what you say and think  what you do in your pastime  your ambitions and desires  basically everything that you would call living  Your life is not allowed to deviate from a preset manual that is forced upon you by the state  The slogan of the Party  or the government if you will  is  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength  In the world of  1984   the whole human population is divided under three superpowers  Oceania  where the novel is set   Eurasia  and Eastasia  The three states adopt pretty similar ideologies and possess equal amounts of power  And the three states aim to obliterate the other two and gain complete control of the world  But that would never be possible because they are all aware of their mutually assured destruction  And so  the three states are at constant war with each other  but never directly so  just enough fighting on the borders or on  inferior  grounds to keep the alarming sense of war necessary to stay in control over their followers   War is Peace  In Orwell s world  the state s strongest oppressive tool is the  Thought Police   armed with telescreens that are forced into every home to broadcast and brainwash the masses as well as constantly spy on their every breath  the Thought Police is practically invincible  You are never allowed to turn off the telescreens  You are never allowed the tiniest bit of privacy  You are never allowed to deviate from the glorious path of  Big Brother   Human relations in their common form become an impossibility too  You can t trust a single soul  and you re not trusted either  Your own children would not hesitate to turn against you at the faintest hint of individuality or  abnormal  behavior  Even language as we know it is not the same  It is heavily modified to serve the purposes of the totalitarian state  to kill any form of self expression or  thought crime  as they call it  They control the past when they rewrite it to serve their current purposes  And by controlling both the past and the present  how can the future escape their iron grips  The  truth  becomes obsolete  there is no real truth when it is always changing  The truth is what Big Brother says it is  And if moments later he declares it to be untrue  you take that declaration at face value and never even for an instant question it  In fact  you possess no memory whatsoever of him ever saying otherwise  If Big Brother says 2 2 5  that is what it is then  and that is what it has always been  The only way you can save yourself is by being a slave to the system and blend within the  Party    Freedom is Slavery  The gap between social classes has never been bigger  and that would never change  The middle class wants to be part of the elite  empowered by the low class citizens  they will attempt to dethrone and replace the high class  Subsequently  a new middle is created while the low class remain as they are after serving their purpose as an elevating tool for the old middle  They remain purposefully ignorant and uneducated so that they never get smart enough to revolt and recognize the unfairness of the system  And if they do  well there s always torture  violence  and all sorts of intimidation and brainwashing to solve that problem  executed by the Thought Police of course   Ignorance is Strength  George Orwell took everything that is wrong with the world  magnified it to the largest scales  and presented his readers with the most terrifying yet very compelling wake up call  an eye opener that shocks your very core  You cannot help but think of the mess we created of our world while reading this book  It will force you to see things differently  to evaluate and re evaluate your world views  and to marvel at the brilliance of its writer  I can never do it justice in just one post  but I do believe that this is a book every human alive should read at least once  I read this book when I was young and I think it left a deep mark on me  I ve been into dystopian novels ever since If you haven t read it  it s a must read for everyone If you re really young and haven t read it  it s a futuristic novel  because it was written in 1948  about an all powerful central government that controls everything in the citizen s lives and it manipulates their emotions  watches their every move by way of big screen TVs in every house  pretty cool imagination for 1948  huh   and one of the biggest projects the government is engaged in is trimming down the English language  The idea of that is  if there was no such word as  rebellion  for example  and you never heard of the word  then you d be less likely to ever have rebellious thoughts They also make people who are enemies of the state disappear  and then proceed to remove every record of that person s existence  I apologize for this not being a proper review  but I m sure there are tons of others if you were needing one and were unfortunate enough to stumble on this one Better yet  just skip reviews and read the book  You won t be disappointed  And finally finishedit will take me at least half year to recover enough to be able to read dystopian novels again and now to George Orwell s master piece 1984let s just say that in the very end it reminded me of a small play called the river of madness and how the king in the end decided to be like everyone else and drink from the poisoned river and become a madmanexcept that in order for Winston and Julia to be as mad as the Big Brother and the Inner Party wanted them to be  which was the Party s definition of sanity  they did have to drink from a poisoned river  they had to go through a horrible and long process of physical  mental and emotional horror and as the leader and the decision makers around the world are getting as obsessive about power as Orwell foresaw they aren t getting as smart and I have no idea whether it was a good thing or a bad thing w khyr khlSthwhkhd

against it  committing thoughtcrime  When he has a love affair with Julia  he is caught by the Party  He is brought before O Brian  a Party member  and is cured of his internal rebellion  He comes to love Big Brother Review This book is a prime example of a dystopian novel  It makes you think about Man s lust for power  and what that may cause  It shows you how a government can go to great lengths to achieve ultimate power  Concepts like doublethink and thoughtcrime are creative ways of displaying how people can be controlled by government  Overall  the novel gets you thinking about government  and does this in a way that engages you and makes you not want to put the book down  People might like this book if they liked  The Hunger Games  Animal Far  Fahrenheit 451  Divergent  MatchedReviewed by Ben Might contain spoilers if you are picky  but if you aren t there are hardly any This is a great book in the sense that it is thought provoking  It really makes you think and compare and understand concepts such as power and freedom  There are different  for lack of a better word  elements to the book  There s the narrative of the protagonist  there s a detailed description of the  Party   the name of the oligarchical regime in the book   and there s a thorough explanation of how systems work  the role of people  war  etc  There s a part of the book dedicated to language of Newspeak  The fictional language of Newspeak was made to restrict thoughts and control human minds  It s very interesting how the abolishment of certain words and the creation of simpler words can do that  There s an appendix on the language of Newspeak at the end of the book which explains it further A lot of this book brings perspective about regimes and how authority and control can be utilized to the full capacity  It makes one compare current totalitarian regimes to the Party and Big Brother  Of course  the Party is an extreme but I cannot help but see in it a lot of the Saudi way of doing things  or governing  to be more exact   I really loved the plot and the transitions of the storylines  There s a lot of suspense and surprised which I loved  I also loved the ending because of how unexpected it was  The author just has a way of spinning the story and putting enough fact and fiction I now understand why this novel is such a big deal  There have been a lot of terms based on the book  Orwellian now describes anything of social injustice  individual restrictions  control through propaganda  etc  Big Brother  the fictional leader of the Party  has also been used to describe anything from government control  surveillance  and censorship It is not a light read and I wouldn t recommend this for everyone  If you are interested in politics  political systems  and wouldn t mind reading a thoroughly depressing novel   then this is for you  When people ask me which is my favourite book I immediately think of this one  not for any other reason but for the fact that when I finished it I felt sadness  fear and shame all in the same time  I then started crying and couldn t pull myself together for 20 minutes    Absolutely awesome   I think everyone should read this book to realize how good are we doing    No words for it  absolutely loved it  The ending killed me  though  This book changed my perspective on the dystopia  Definitely gonna read more of this genre    Creio que nao tenho palavras   Detestei certas passagens  adorei outras  Nao suporto o final  mas louvo o  Creio que os meus sentimentos por este livro me fazem duplopensar  Sem duvida que mexeu comigo  e que o achei genial  mas ao mesmo tempo nao me satisfez completamente em dois ou tres pormenores De qualquer dos modos  recomendo  The father of all dystopians is a chilling masterwork  This is no more science fiction  it is a documentary  First Orwell I ve read  As perfect as any writer can get  The prose is relatively straightforward but it reads like every word is placed exactly where it should be  Superb read  definitely recommended  I have no idea what how to rate this one  I ve read several dystopian novels and always wished to live in those worlds  Hunger Games  Divergent  et al  But this  this truly is dystopia  this is a world I would never wish to live in The writing is good though the prose is really boring sometimes  or that s my lack of interest in political theories  The pace is rather slow in the first two parts but picks up in the third  Definitely recommend reading to those who love dystopia  Five stars for a world that truly is dystopian    It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen  Is there any better opening line to a novel  I don t care what Ishmael says I can call him  This is the one You ll find Orwell s chilling vision of totalitarianism as fresh today as the day it was published  The milieu of Winston s concrete grey  war starved existence could be anywhere  anytime  Technology retarded by circumstance  viewed by contemporary standards  or state is employed to observe and intimidate the populace  Its 1984 s questions as to the nature of truth that really electrify  though  What does truth mean when no record can be trusted  when no person is fearless enough to contradict even what their own memory recalls  Not content with controlling its peoples outward existence Big Brother wants to control the way they are even permitted to think  Their desires  their language   If you haven t read it  read it Because we ve always been at war with Oceania  right   John Bowen is the author of  Where the Dead Walk  and  Vessel   You can find him here on GoodReads  and his published work at Amazon  Ik ben heel blij dat ik dit boek eindelijk gelezen heb  dat werd tijd    Heel eigenaardig hoe een boek dat gepubliceerd werd in 1949  in kader van het stalinisme en nazisme  zo actueel kan zijn  Termen als  Big Brother  en  Doublethink  zijn de dag van vandaag niet weg te denken  Natuurlijk niet in de extreme vormen zoals beschreven in deze novel  thank God  Maar ze zijn hoe dan ook aanwezig in onze social media  sociale controle  de eenzijdige nieuwsmeldingen en het oorlog voeren in kader van de globalisering en het kapitalisme  Ik ben erg blij dat wij de dag van vandaag kunnen en mogen  denken   Macht en rendement blijven naar mijn mening een te belangrijke rol spelen  maar we hebben gelukkig de mogelijkheid om kritisch in het leven te staan en zo nu en dan zelfs te genieten van een glaasje wijn  een romantische relatie en  jawel   seks die niet in functie hoeft te staan van het krijgen van kinderen  hoera    Die kritische kijk op de wereld kunnen we ontwikkelen door bijvoorbeeld dit soort boeken te lezen  dankjewel daarvoor Orwell  Ik zou je trakteren op een biertje  geen victory gin  als je nog zou leven   The idea of anticipating the future on one side and critisizing dectatorship on the other side is just brilliant  I really enjoyed every second of reading this book  I will definitely re read it    Orwell s Blueprint for Absolute TotalitarianismOrwell s fictitious totalitarian state and its mysterious  omnipotent and omniscient Big Brother has long been features of our pop culture and political discussions  They are the embodiment of our worst fears about a time in the future when we would lose our most basic rights amid the increase in the power and influence of governments  Some may reject such notion as too pessimistic or paranoid  yet with the current surveillance technologies  we are usually being watched without us even noticing  In that sense  Orwell s novel should be treated as a heads up    a call for guards against any attempt to invade our privacy and deny our basic rights In the years prior to the second world war  communism was still on the rise and the cold war was looming clearer than ever  The rise of super powers have led many to believe that the days of scattered countries were numbered in the face of imminent annihilation by the massive nations  Orwell was worried that  to cope with such changes  Britain might have to change  even if that would mean turning into a monster against its own people  He wrote 1984 with such nagging worries hovering around his head  envisioning a near future when everything would change so drastically into a state of inescapable totalitarian dystopia  a place where it is not even safe to keep one s thoughts inside his head He called this place Oceania  a massive nation consisting of the Americas  Britain  southern parts of Africa  and Australia  Oceania is controlled by a powerful single party  with Big Brother as the head of state  The Party rose to power in the 1950s after the collapse of capitalism  and it holds its tenure as the manifestation of the principles of English socialism  or Ingsoc  While English is still the widely used language of the masses  it has faced a steady erosion into a rudimentary form known as Newspeak  The society is divided into three classes  the Inner Party  the Outer Party  and the Proles  while governance is achieved through four ministries  the Ministry of Plenty  the Ministry of Truth  the Ministry of Peace  and the Ministry of Love Winston Smith lives in London  an Outer Party member  working in the Ministry of Truth as a clerk in the Records Department  He lost his family members in some mysterious circumstances and was brought up through governmental programs  His work involves editing historical documents to conform with the present propaganda  Such mutability of the past is an important theme in Orwell s novel  portrayed as the corner stone of the Ingsoc principles and the tool by which the Party remains vigilant at any thought and immune from any deviation  As Orwell puts it   He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   Just like any Outer Party member  Winston s life is under continuous surveillance  even when at home  through the telescreen    a device which transmits and receives audio and video  Every part of Winston s apartment is within the scope of the telescreen except the tiny corner beside it  where Winston sits sometimes to practice the illegal act of thinking  Any slight change in expression in front of this device may hint for a pensive mood  giving the  thought criminal  into the hands of the Thought Police  guilty of a crime usually punished by death  Winston is reminded with this harsh truth through the poster of Big Brother s face on the wall  looking at him apparently in every direction  with the words  Big Brother is watching you  beneath it Winston  struggling with the lack of freedom in his home and the deceptive nature of his job  begins to cast his doubts upon the system  resorting to the rather revolutionary act of writing a personal journal of his political thoughts while in his hidden corner  as well as going for walks into the Proles quarters where there is no telescreens  but with the risk of being caught by patrols  He searches for the truth everywhere  in the places  in the pictures  and in the eyes of his acquaintances  but everything seems fake or obscured  The only hope  he writes in his secret journal  is for the Proles to revolt  but even that is impossible as he acknowledges  His thoughts wander further to the possibility of a revolt from within the party  as he becomes convinced that O Brien  an Inner Part member  is a conspirator  This is reinforced by the revelation to him by Julia  a colleague that seemed to be a staunch party supporter  that she is against the Party Winston s and Julia s love affair takes place in shady places and at distant intervals  He finds her as a solace to his painful solitude after the estrangement of his previous wife  who was committed to the Party principles to the point that she practiced her relationship with her husband out of sense of duty  rather than affection  Julia was the total opposite  While she lived publicly as a member of the Anti Sex League  her secret life was full of love affairs  Winston was amused by that love for sex  which during this times  was reduced to merely a  political act   However  his amusement of Julia s attitude didn t hold to her political convictions  as she wasn t interested in overhrowing the party or revolting against the status quo  calling her as  only a rebel from the waist downwards  The story takes its way towards conclusion starting from them finding a secret room among the Proles to conduct their love  Through this room we learn about the past prior to the revolution and the hope for the future driven by the sounds of the neighboring Proles  and through the relationship we learn about the distinction between thoughts and feelings  and their roles in constituting what is freedom  Winston s and Julia s contrasting characters make us discover the variety underneath the Party s molded characters  yet it proves to us that no matter how different human beings are  they act the same under the urge of their basic necessities Orwell makes no effort to conceal their fate  From the beginning of the story  Winston was convinced that no change could happen in his lifetime   We are the dead  was his assurance to Julia  Yet the uncertainty lies in whether their efforts would reciprocate to future generations or fall short to surpassing their time  Could they survive long enough in Big Brother s blind spot  Can they join the alleged Brotherhood and conspire against the party Contradiction  reduction and uncertainty are the main elements that constitute the logic of Nineteen Eighty Four  The contradiction is evident in the names of the four ministries  Ministry of Peace is for war  Ministry of Abundance is for scarcity  Ministry of Truth is for propaganda  and Ministry of Love is for policing and torturing the citizens  What makes this contradictions believable in the minds of the citizens is the reduction of their brain activity  formulated brilliantly by Orwell through the reduced language of Newspeak  which is basically English without all the redundancies and varieties that allow different thinking  and with all political terminologies removed  Instead  a limited new vocabulary was introduced to emphasize the normality of contradictions  like the word  doublespeak  Practicing doublespeak involves a subconscious belief in the validity of the party s actions  and a usually conscious disregard of any fact that may put them in question  The ability to do so is the difference between a conformist and non conformist citizen  and the ability to do so efficiently is the difference between living a blissful life or vaporizing into obscurity   vaporization  is Orwell s word of being erased from existence   Hence  the mutability of the past becomes possible  and with it reality becomes subjective  That s how uncertainty is brought into the equation  because there s no absolute truths except what the Party says  and even that is subject to change in the future With these tenets  Big Brother controls the masses  Yet  Orwell takes them to the extreme by questioning the existence of Big Brother as a person  and the validity of the year 1984 as the year in which the story takes place  He uses other red herrings to cement such mood  This atmosphere of uncertainty  where  for example  not even the fiercest supporter of the regime can be certainly safe from prosecution  is a characteristic of every authoritarian regime  because it implies the power of the rulers to do whatever they like  and the inability of the ruled to even rest assured that they are in a secure position  The more insecure a citizen feels  the more he clings to the promise of providing security  even if those who promise are the ones who denied it in the first place A few chapters of the novel are dedicated to the discussion of the political situation in 1984  including the three super nations  their politics  and their continuous wars  These chapters contain detailed explanation of Orwell s worst case scenario regarding world politics  Small nations are annihilated by three super nations  each with their own of absolute authoritarian conduct  Their continuous wars are nothing but a mean to get rid of any surplus  so as to keep the public engaged in constant fear  and avoid it becoming too comfortable and develop an ability to think beyond the status quo  He describes how this state global dystopia arisen on the ruins of    and in a way due to    capitalism  they took the good ideals of socialism as their advertised principles just to take hold of power   Power is not a means  it is an end   he writes  Wars become irrelevant as each super nation is invincible  hence   War is Peace   The only way to be free is to abide by the rules  hence   Freedom is Slavery   And the more blissful you are  the more powerful is the Party  hence  Ignorance is Strength   The three sentences form the motto of Oceania  and define its inescapable  subjective reality  Orwell s writing may lack the exquisiteness of the great classics writers  yet his concepts are both mind boggling and far reaching  His well crafted storytelling renders the efficiency of his imagined totalitarian regime  perhaps that s why many use the term  Orwellian  to describe similar states  His futurism embodies the sum of all our political fears and even those that we might not be aware off  His deep pessimism is well rooted in reality  and his conclusions are well accustomed with what s known about human psychology  Nineteen Eighty Four  therefore  is a scary read that requires a determined reader to finish it and grasp it to the fullest  He would then realize that it is all the more scarier  not only because of its dystopian atmosphere with its gruesome details of injustice and the feelings of servitude  but because it is all but possible   ly lmstqbl  w lmDy   ly lzmn ldhy ykwn lfkr fyh Hr Tlyq   ly zmn ykhtlf

of 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami  and continue to be amazed at George Orwell s prescience  with many small details even more relevant today than in 1984  Still worthy of 5 stars even after all these years  Masterfully written  deeply entertaining  and hauntingly eye opening  This is Orwell at his best  The beginning of the book was  as I remember it  a little slow  As the plot progresses though  the book is impossible to put down  The book is an interesting allegory on the world wars and their resulting futility  Orwell takes totalitarian to a whole new level  Though one can extract conspiracy theories or make radical speculations after reading the book  this  I m sure  wasn t Orwell s purpose  rather  to criticize those governments that engage in the inanities of war and to uncover war for what it really is  That is to say  enlighten the mind of the reader to see things a bit differently  to question authority  and to formulate personal opinions  instead of being spoon fed them   Orwell s command of writing is especially shown when he incorporates the forbidden book into his progressing story  The change of syntax  tone  diction  etc   is amazing  If presented separately  one would find it impossible for them to be of the same author  Throughout most of the story  there lurks ambiguities  However  the end ties it all together perfectly  The ending was absolutely one of the best best I ve read  It was like being punched in the face  Read it  you ll know what I mean  Orwell doesn t  believe in happy endings  All in all  one of my favorite books  Orwell is a genius of the highest caliber and his writings more than proves it  1984 is one of the best books I have ever read  To me  it is without a doubt the best book available in the dystopian society genre  1984 offers new views on people and the government  none being particularly optimistic  This book is a great warning for people to be wary of the government and not to follow it blindly  It also shows us that people can be broken  and that  in the end  you will always put yourself above everyone else  In this book  George Orwell very clearly lays out his views on human nature  In his view  we are selfish  dumb  and blunt creatures  This book was very disturbing and creepy as well  The whole time I read it I couldn t t help but think of how the government could be watching us just as they did in the book  Especially with today s technology  how easy it is to imagine that the government could be listening to our every conversation and tracking our every move  This book is truly a timeless classic that I will never forget  mdhhl       w mw lm    km hw mw sf  n tSnWf krwy    fm fyh   Zm mn hdh   To someone having personal experience with the  Chinese Cultural Revolution   or at least someone with the second hand experience from accounts of the older generation   this book was no political fiction  this book was political fact  China in the 60s and 70s of the last century  resembled Oceania in its domestic life to an astonishing degree  fanatic worship and blind loyalty to the  Great Leader   unfounded hatred to other countries with different ideologies  constant fear of all out nuclear war with other major powers  fabrication of production numbers  denouncement of family members with suspected unorthodox thinking  destroy of all objects symbolizing the  Old Culture   simplification of the traditional Chinese characters  and many more The  Chinese Cultural Revolution  was a closer resemblance to Oceania than the  Russian Great Purge  and the  Pol Pot Genocide   as the latter two focused more on eliminating political heretics  rather than stupefying the general population through brainwash The first simplified Chinese edition of this book didn t come until 1985  and was positioned as anti USSR book  and was classified as  Internal Material  only meant for certain group  It didn t popularize in China until early 21 century   wln qd ntSrt  ly nfsy wSrt Hb lkh

think I ve found the answer to that question whilst flipping the pages of this masterpiece George Orwell destroyed my beliefs  shuttered my convictions and condemned my conscious to weep for humanity  um dos melhores  se nao o melhor  livro que ja li  Even the slogans will change  How could you have a slogan like  freedom is slavery  when the concept of freedom has been abolished  The whole climate of thought will be different  In fact  there will be no thought  as we understand it now  Orthodoxy means not thinking   not needing to think  Orthodoxy is unconsciousness   The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you know already  Power is not a means  it is an end        The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power   Reality is inside the skull        Nothing exists except through human consciousness        Before man there was nothing  After man  if he could come to an end  there would be nothing  Outside man there is nothing   In general  the greater the understanding  the greater the delusion  the more intelligent  the less sane   Amazing George Orwell s 1984 is a great read for patient readers who like to have a large understanding of the time leading up to the story  The book is hard to get into but the narrative that Orwell gives in the beginning serves to further the development of the plot later on in the story  One of strengths of this book is the understanding of how the events impact the characters later in the story  The second half of the book was enjoyable  but it was frustrating to get started due to the lack of dialogue in the beginning of the book  This book is especially interesting to people who like stories about overcoming struggles and hardships  I would recommend this book to patient readers who like to have a great understanding of the plot  Il piu bel libro che io abbia mai letto    Inquientante  angoscioso  ma che descrive alla perfezione cio che stiamo vivendo oggi  Leggere questo libro mi ha aperto gli occhi non solo sulla situazione politica di oggi ma anche sull uso della tecnologia  Ho paura che anche noi come nel libro siamo controllati  veniamo spiati  Spero di sbagliarmi   La bravura dell autore sta nel fatto che descrive i sentimenti di paura timore angoscia che il protagonista prova e incredibilmente quegli stessi sentimenti li provi anche tu  A un certo punto avevo anche timore nel leggerlo quando ero solo    Wow  this could have been written in the 21st century  The observation of governments controlling the masses by controlling information through the media is more pertinent today than ever before  Great read  though a little scary    Winston watched them disgustedly  And yet  just for a moment  what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats  Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered    It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against one s own body   Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone    It s the one thing they can t do  They can make you say anything   anything   but they can t make you believe it  They can t get inside you    The primary aim of modern warfare  in accordance with the principles of doublethink  this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party  is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living  Even since the end of the nineteenth century  the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society   The essential act of war is destruction  not necessarily of human lives  but of the products of human labor  War is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent    There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve  One is how to discover  against his will  what another human being is thinking  and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand   The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you know already   But no advance in wealth  no softening of manners  no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer   For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one s own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes   It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody  in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here  And the people under the sky were also very much the same   everywhere  all over the world  hundreds or thousands of millions of people just like this  people ignorant of one another s existence  held apart by walls of hatred and lies  and yet almost exactly the same   people who had never learned to think but were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world   It was more natural to exist from moment to moment  accepting another ten minutes  life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it   Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen  that was the thought that defeated him   That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness  and that  for the great bulk of mankind  happiness was better   They pretended  perhaps even believed  that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time  and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal  We are not like that  We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it  Power is not a means  it is an end    If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever    What knowledge have we of anything  save through our own minds  All happenings are in the mind  Whatever happens in all minds  truly happens   Ha quem diga que as melhores historias ja foram todas escritas  um classico e sempre um classico  e ha um motivo que faz de um livro um classico  a historia e eterna  Estara espetacularmente bem escrito  Foi um livro que

na politica imposta  das coisas mais me impressionaram no livro e chegarmos um dia a um ponto em que algo que sempre tomamos como garantido na nossa alimentacao deixar de existir  chocolate  cafe  manteiga  vinho  ha que controlar tudo  mas como nao podia deixar de ser ha sempre um mercado negro  Aliado a isto como nao e so necessario alterar o presente  ha que alterar tambem o passado  por isso e necessario reescrever tudo quanto foi noticia  tudo quanto sao historias  para que as geracoes futuras so conhecam a realidade O lema  War is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strengh  pode ser lido nas ruas de Londres  em 1984  o mundo deixou de ser o que era  Inglaterra deixou de ser o que conhecemos  A tirania chegou ao poder  o partido que governa vigia toda a gente  the big brother is watching you   all the freaking time No meio disto tudo  a personagem principal  Winston  comeca se a revoltar contra o regime e nao quer ser mais uma marioneta nas maos do partido  quando conhece Julia  sabe que nao esta sozinho e os dois juntam se nessa luta So que para pessoas com ideias out of the box  o partido tem  o room 101 O Brian e dos maiores viloes que ja li em livros  a cena de tortura  foi lida as 2h da manha em vespera de dia de trabalho  simplesmente nao a conseguia deixar a meio Literatura intensa  definitivamente para maiores de idade  e altamente recomendada para ser lida nos dias de hoje  dada a crise atual que atravessamos  Preparem se para o fim  a mensagem que passa    nao e facil de digerir   Sem duvida dos melhores livros que ja li ate hoje  Por algum motivo e  o tal  classico  One of my preferred books to re read  this classic always fills me with joy  Just kidding  It fills me with whatever the opposite of joy is  only I still feel happy because the characters are so real  the setting so scarily applicable and the story so fascinating  I seem to remember reading this in high school which seems ironic  I would not think our government would want kids to be exposed to this given their current stance on the subject  Well it was seven years ago  maybe they ve banned it by now  Probably they ve banned it by now  I don t even know whether I m joking or not  And that s why I think everyone should read this  One of my ten favorite books  maybe it even breaks five  Check it out   Last read this as a tween  when it had a powerful effect  probably due in large part to what seemed like steamy sex at the time  What I think I missed back then was its rather direct parallels to Stalinist Russia  not unlike  Animal Farm    What was conjecture on Orwell s part in 1949   doublethink   rewriting history by erasing past incidents and people  children informing on their parents and an omnipresent secret police force  is now known to be true  Big Brother really was watching  I found this rereading powerful in a new way  not only because of Orwell s prescience  but also his crafsmanship and language  Here he is on the act of reading   Solitude and safety were physical sensations  mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body  the softness of the chair  the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek  The book fascinated him  or more exactly it treasured him  In a sense it told him nothing that was new  but that was part of the attraction  It said what he would have said  if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order  It was the product of a mind similar to his own  but enormously more powerful  more systematic  less fear ridden  The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you know already   Marvelous  The Everyman s Library edition also contains an excellent introduction  like all introductions best read afterward  by Julian Symons  a bibliography and a chronology of George Orwell s  Eric Blair s  life  Questo e uno di quei bei libri che tutti dovrebbero leggere almeno una volta nella vita  non solo per il piacere di fare una buona lettura  ma anche per far vedere a quali limiti estremi di controllo fisico e mentale e di perversione puo arrivare la mente umana  Prima di tutto  devo dire che sono rimasta veramente impressionata dalla sottigliezza di dettagli e di come ogni minima cosa si va ad intrecciare con l altra fino a creare una trama perfetta  E incredibile il modo in cui l autore riesca a farti cambiare opinione di un personaggio da una pagina all altra  proprio come ha fatto con Julia e O  Brien  Anche se all inizio non e facile concepire la situazione delle persone che vivono in questa societa  modernizzata in un modo impressionate per essere stata scritta solamente nel  49  la storia mantiene un ritmo costante per tutta la vicenda  fino quasi alla fine  dove li il ritmo e i colpi di scena diventano piu incalzanti  l ho trovato noiosetto solo quando riprende le pagine de  Il libro   ma non fondamentali e se uno vuole puo anche saltarle  Il finale   beh il finale e una cosa a se  Abituata a libri in cui il bene prevale sempre sul mare  sono rimasta molto sorpresa  Piacevolmente  Non lo so  Pero e stata piu realistica e piu umana come fine di tanti bei libri che ho letto  i quali avevano un finale forse troppo finto  Brilliant  Absolute genius  Orwell has such profound thoughts expressed so eloquently in minimal words   Sanity is statistical   Everything about the book is powerful the plot  the concept  the characters  THE ENDING Everyone should read this once in his or her lifetime  I know I m going to visit it again and again  rrrrrrrrrrry    wmqbD  wnbwy y  wmlhm  wmw lm  wkl sh  syqtD

the opening chapter and certain of the more pivotal scenes  how well it is written for what is essentially a polemical tract  The point isn t really whether Orwell s vision is realized or realizable  the point is that  while you are in it  he sells it so well  It is also important to remember that 1984 is not a warning about a possible future  but an exploration of Orwell s contemporary present  magnified to horrific proportions 1984 is a story about relationships  It is the story of Winston s relationship with Julia  but also and even more importantly  his relationship with O Brien  It is O Brien that represents some kind of fantasy comrade in arms to him at the beginning  he even says that he is writing his diary to O Brien   and it is O Brien that brings him back into the fold by the end  Ultimately  of course  it is a story of the relationships that build up a conformist state  Simplistic political analyses will mistake the State  or  the System   for a monolithic object  while slightly more critical perspectives will note that it is  made up of people   A better analysis of oppression realizes that it is based in relationships  and discusses methods for altering relationships in order to reduce oppression  In Orwell s bleak world  of course  it is impossible to do so  because the relationships are defined within a context which provides no opportunity for new relations to form   all relationships ultimately lead back to the State  in the culmination of the totalitarian dream  Again  this is probably more useful as a reminder of what is possible in a different context than as a warning of a realizable end to freedom   Grim  scary story with bits of hope for humanity but overall inspiring as it put forth the path that us humans should evade  Very

in the late 80s  Its still as great  and scary  as I remember it being  More or less you can combine 1984  Huxleys Brave New World  and Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail and you have a slightly exagerrated version of the world we live in now  Personally I believe that this book only partially came from Orwells imagination  He was involved in political movements to the point where he went to Spain and fought in the Spanish civil war  went to elitist Universities in England and wrote war time propaganda for the BBC so he had a view of the inside of elites and how they operate  Its such the cliche to say it but I believe this book was written as a warning  In 1984  Winston is a main character in a world called Oceania  It is a type of Utopia where the citizens are constantly watched by the  Party   The  Party  uses telescreens to watch every citizen and if anyone gives any indication of going against the Party rules then they will mysteriously disappear  The plot has a typical story of having no freedom and being controlled like in a dictatorship  George Orwell demonstrates Winston as a character who is against the Party  but does no physical action besides writing down his own free thoughts  Throughout the book  Winston grows and becomes more daring as he meets a girl named Julia who feels the same as him  Julia helps Winston become more confident about his thoughts against Oceania and soon does more than just write his thoughts down  This amazing novel is able to express the issue about choosing whether to take action based on your own beliefs even if the majority is against them  Winston is a perfect example of being sneaky and crafty about going against a government that gives no individual freedom  and the reader is always on the edge of their seat wondering whether he will succeed or not  Be prepared to go on a journey where a little guy is going against a whole army of big guys  Read this book a long time ago and it still stays with me today   rGm n

some health problems and issues with his former wife  Except form one detail   he s the only human being with a bit of conscience and remembrance of the past in the society where he lives  Things can not end well to him  Read this novel and understand the danger of being clever and able to connect facts and dates  I read this novel in Grade 9 as it was required reading  along with Diary of Anne Frank  Romeo and Juliet  The Stone Angel and A Handmaid s Tale  My children have now entered high school and their required reading still includes Romeo and Juliet and Anne Frank however 1984 has been replaced with The Hunger Games  The Giver and Divergent  I am not against any of the new additions  I just believe it would be so valuable to have 1984 and Fahrenheit 465  I think  it s been 30 years forgive me  as initial backdrops to these new and Hollywood fuelled novels  What is there to say about 1984  A classic and a must read  I have to say   I happened to be in grade 9 in 1984 so    even more thrilling time to read the novel   1984George Orwell Freedom is Slavery The year is 1984  The world is dominated by three World Powers  Oceania  Eastasia and Eurasia  Winston Smith is from Oceania  Oceania is ruled by a unseen dictator dubbed  Big Brother   Big Brother rules the country with an iron grip  His Thought Police catch any rebels who are plotting against him  Winston is a typical Party member  He has a push button brain and is thought to hate by a push of a button  He meets another Party member  Julia and the two become friends  In the end Winston s rebel thoughts get him into a prison and forced into being the typical person   I loved this book because because it has so much insight  This book relates to many things that are going on right now  There are constant wars on this planet and there is a constant war in 1984  George Orwell understands what is going on and puts it into a book that is interesting and has meaning  You could read a news article any day but you would only read what the government wants you to read  We  You read 1984 you know what s going on and nothing is hidden from you  Big Brother is much like the government we have today  There are many unknown officials who make plenty of choices for us  I personally think that every one should read 1984 so that nothing is hidden form view and the public can understand what is going on in the world outside of their house or thier office cubicle  People who are interested in dystopian science fiction  I know that many people do not like this because it is very slow  It has an older prose that I enjoy because it challenges me  there are not many books that challenge me  In 1984 it shows how people are forced into believing things that the ruler wants them to Orwell uses such powerful language that I am drawn in  Even though that most people cannot connect to Winston but I can understand why he is rebelling  He wants to make his own choices and he wants to be free from the oppression of the party  He thinks the if he helps the black market he will overthrow the ruling party  Most people in history work with the underground to overthrow rulers  This book is one my best read novels and will be in my list of top novels  Facts and theory presented here are utterly convincing and horrifying  It is a WARNING to the mankind   l kh lkbyr yrqbk   wh qd ntSrt  l  nfsy wSrt

and I wasn t disappointed though I had great expectations  That said it s more like an essay than a novel and the characters  it feels like   are merely there to make the description of the everyday life of an average person living in a dictatorship easier  There is something very terrifying about living in a state where there is no privacy and they have a say in every aspect of the life  The language gets less and less complex and the thoughts follow till everything spirals into emptiness   Orwell is a great talent  the style he uses made the dystopian circumstances seem natural and necessary for long long pages then made the whole thing laughable  scary   This book is one of my all time favorites  I read it  first    age 17  Pls note I did not have to  This is the first book I ever threw after finishing    not out of hatred for the book but  from of the emotion it brought out   rwy  mkhyf  kmy  ltshbh lrhyb bynh wbyn lwq  ldhy n yshh Hlyan mr b   l jz l khyr  bt zlk  n l lm

read  Pretty dense in parts  but a good overall read  Seems to fit in snugly with the other dystopias of that time period   Some details  like leaving the journal out for another to see  is eerily close to Zamyatin s  We    I m not so sure I agree with the premise that a certain group will seek to keep power but have no desire to keep it in their family  It seems to go against historical and biological experience and pressures  How a group could divorce itself from those tendencies remains unclear Further  if the inner circle is so advanced in ways of the human condition  why would they consider brain washed  i e  non free will  citizens as an acceptable part of their society also remains unclear  If it s because of their lunacy  alluded to   then their society would inevitably fall apart due to that very same lunacy Yet  it s still a poignant extrapolation of the control of the few over the masses who are too eager to give up their civic  and personal  freedoms for a measure of perceived security and prosperity  Let me begin by saying that I do not like Orwell s books  They are very sad and make me extremely depressed  However  I recognize how powerful  well written  and politically strong they are  1984 tells the story of a society that has arisen after the downfall of the United States  it is a society in which the people s very thoughts are controlled by the Thought Police  Winston lives and works in the society just like everyone else  until he meets Julia and they become lovers and rebels against the government only to be caught and broken in the end  For me  reading 1984 was  in some ways  very psychological  In this strange society  there is a process called doublethink in which the thinker knows that something is true and then refuses to believe it  he believes instead what the government tells him to  After performing this act of self deception  the thinker must then doublethink  he must forget that he ever knew the truth and that he deceived himself about it  That was nearly impossible for me to wrap my head around  and it also enraged me that anyone would trick themselves into believing a lie  No matter what the cost  I believe that one must always have their own beliefs not the beliefs of others  While I did not enjoy reading 1984  I was greatly impressed by its originality  The concepts of Thought Police and doublethink alone  without the rest of the plot  were ingenious  This is an extraordinary book   mDmwn Sly yn khtb bdwn shkh nw y ayndh ngry bry tmm Hkhwmthy twtlyth w dykhttwry st khh zng khTry r bry jwm  anh bh

 m  qr t2 2 5Big Brother is watching you La vigencia de esta novela publicada en 1949 con la Venezuela actual  desde 1998  es insuperable  A fascinating and horrifying roller coaster of a novel  Latter events in particular give the brain so much to mull over  great for breaking down writer s  or reader s   block  Overall I was more impressed by Animal Farm s simplicity  1984 is more raw with cutting detail  but still concise  which is a valuable accomplishment for a novel dealing with this subject matter   Until they became conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   1984  is a masterpiece of British literature and a strong  terrifying and stunning study of a tortured soul experiencing foredoomed romance  isolation from social affiliation and a hopeless struggle against totalitarianism and the invincibility of the state he lives in  Not only did I enjoy reading it  it also made me think a lot about the instruments of suppression and the numerous ways to manipulate mental activity  While Winston Smith  the main protagonist  will not be reminded as one of the most multifaceted characters  I mostly cared for his fate because of what has been done to him   Orwell s detailedness of introducing the reader to this dystopian world left me stunned and shocked by the possibilites of totalitarianism Orwell completely ignores any existent  show  don t tell  principle  writing thousands of words from a nonfictional viewpoint as part of what is meant to be an eassy from a lexicon on the world s history  Although this chapter explained a lot of important details  it was exhausting to read and nothing I would like to find in a fictional work  In general  Orwell s writing style may be considered to be long winded  but I consider it to be impressive  As much as  1984  is one of those works which I know I will return to at some point in future  George Orwell is   once again after having read  Animal Farm  some months ago   one of those authors I will never get tired to read of 4 5 stars  rounded up to 5 stars I finished this book a few hours ago  I don t think i ll be able to sleep tonight  George Orwell s final novel  1984  was written amidst the anti communist hysteria of the cold war  1984 seems to talk about dictatorship and regimes claiming revolution  but truth is  you can t see any difference between these regime and any what so called democratic regime  This novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race  It was a magnificent piece of work  that describes to us how any ideology based on one view can destroy human soul   Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere else   says O Brien      In the mind of the Party  which is collective and immortal  Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth     ln   lq  ly lrwy  l ny   tqd n lklmt stkhwnny w ln stTy   Ty h Hqh mn ltqyym w lnqdfqT s qwl n 5 njwm mn 5 njwm qlyl   lyh w lw kn hnk tqyym   ly l

mktwb   ss bllG  l rby  w lyst mtrjm  F d me up forever in a good way  The genius of 1984 lies in its cynical yet veridical observations about the potential manipulation of an uncritical national population  It s a cautionary fable that feels like it lies only a hairsbreadth from our reality  and Orwell coined such lastingly apt vocabulary to describe the deliberate fallacies needed to induce this fabular dystopia  That said  Orwell s clean prose describes a relentlessly horrifying  bleak  and miserable world  and  spoiler alert   no one gets a happy ending  It s best appreciated in the style of ancient Greek tragedy  a long slide through the pathetic life of a man set in fundamental conflict with his implacable world  yqwlwn n lzmn ydwy kl ljrHyqwlwn n lmr bws h  n yns  dy mbyd  n btsmt wldmw   br lsnynm tzl l  n tqT  nyT qlby  Inequality is the unalterabe law of human life The ingeniousness of George Orwell  which is a pen name  by the way  did you know  I didn t   can never be overstated  1984 is a classic of the dystopian variety and was written in 1948 1949  Orwell Eric Arthur Blair  sounds weird calling my man that  died two years after his novel was published  That is  to me  a very tragic notion  Glories that are earned after one perishes aren t really glories    This novel is amazeballs  Orwell is a golden writer of the English world and I don t think anyone can top him  Actually  I m pretty sure no one can top him  considering the amount of trash and garbage inflow in the dystopian genre these days  Contemporary writings  like contemporary humans  are seemingly decreasing in intellect with every passing year and the rate of decreasing intellect only appears to be spinning faster and faster  Humanity  you displease me  Has it ever occurred to you that by the year 2050  at the very latest  not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now  Well  Orwell my hero  I think you ve pegged that right  I m already starting to see the signs of the deliberate  or even unconscious  degeneration of the language you so lovingly caressed in your novel  The world of 1984 has come and gone  and I didn t live to see it  woefully  but your prophecy appears to become more and more valid than invalid as the 21st century slowly rolls over Rebellion meant a look in the eyes  an inflexion of the voice  at the most  an occasional whispered word I m not going to expand upon the plot line  That is for prospective readers to step on themselves  It s not dystopia that Orwell creates  it could be a more humanized version of hell  more accurately  The crude society presented in 1984 is beyond the tolerance of any of us  To the liberal West  which has come crashing out of the gates of what they thought was a prison  you most definitely will die out in this society  It s a true horroshow   Horroshow  reminds me  the novel bears semblance to A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess  Or  rather  the opposite holds true  since Burgess existed after the cessation of Orwell  Both able writers  both owning a mind with an insight to the worst nature of mankind   They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect  These sentences  they were written more than 67 years ago  Orwell was a modern writer in an aged age  He described exquisite phenomenons  presented convoluted ideologies and spoke of metaphysics  all of which can be safely said to require a comprehension skill beyond that of our developed world s youths  in the very simplest of manners  If this isn t genius  what is So ugly  and yet  so civilized You can t underestimate the emotional range depicted in this book  I myself had never before empathized with the despairs and the desires our character experiences  Almost as if Orwell innovated a whole new set of various sensuality  The very fiber that knits the world of 1984 is fraught with slavery and going against that slavery is a machete in the form of two lovers  Winston and Julia  You will be Winston  You will feel what Winston feels  You will suffer what Winston suffers  You will learn  and then re learn  what Winston learns and then re learns  It s not the deviation in practise that George Orwell pinpoints to  it s the deviation of the mind  Of the very psyche that embodies the human nature  It is  in the lowest form  in kinship with solipsism  Solipsism  a word I ve seen often  but have conversed with only just now  I enjoy talking to you  Your mind appeals to me  It resembles my own mind  except that you happen to be insane  1984 made its dent in my mind  Orwell scratched the surface of my cerebrum Shh Big Brother is watching   I M OFFICIALLY IN LOVE WITH GEORGE ORWELL The genius of Orwell lies in envisioning the whole situation and creating the strategies of a government that can control its own citizens  The state wants to guarantee 1 blind loyalty and devotion to work by the outer party  middle class 2 poverty and ignorance of the proles  lower class  so they are too weak and ignorant to revolt against poverty filth everyday s raids that kills hundreds of them  Also they have no chance to compare between how they are loving and how people in earlier ages used to live coz all history books are destroyed and rewritten To put that into practice the state inner party  takes intensive measures to control the thoughts of the the outer party members including 1 telescreens spread everywhere and every house that watches and hears everything and notices your emotions so you d better appear happy in front of it  police patrols everywhere in the streets and helicopters also that hover above houses to notice any abnormal behaviour  2 putting their members  mentality in a state of war all the time although there might not be war  but they want to keep the adrenaline rushin  through their workers to work very hard  for the outer party members 3 almost everything is prohibited from walking in the streets and owning a diary to falling in love   for the outer party members 4 controlling their thoughts through decreasing the words in the dictionary and by time the consciousness of people will decrease and they won t find words to express their revolting thoughts coz there are no words in their language which mean any of the rebelling thoughts and feelings inside them Also brainwashing them and everything the government says is true and must be believed they believe it even if they don t believe it  5 marriage is allowed only in the outer party s members  to bring children who will be an extension of the thought police and spy on their relatives and parents to see if they are thought criminals and have any opposing thoughts towards the government   6 controlling the past all real history books are destroyed and rewritten to make their citizens believe that they are living in the most luxurious era ever and people before were enslaved and tortured by the capitalists and almost no one knows anything about the real past old people who lived before the big brother had disappeared all of a sudden in order to never let anyone know about the past  WHO CONTROLS THE PAST  CONTROLS THE FUTURE  WHO CONTROLS THE PRESENT  CONTROLS THE PAST  GOD BLESS GEORGE ORWELL Don t forget   BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU    The writing is terrific  Its keen ability to engage  to make one contemplate how plausible it is that how an individual s rationality can succumb to the dominating few s absurdity  Is there some system that can effectively arrest the human instincts for friendship and love  In 1984  the superstate of Oceania thrives on this system  In this society  you turn against one another and you turn against your sanity  Children are schooled to be vigilantes for the regime  turning in family members suspected of disloyalty  All relationships are eradicated  Loyalty is only to Big Brother  Is love ever stronger than pain  specifically pain under torture  Orwell illustrates how the answer is a resounding NO  This is a dangerous and convenient understanding in the mind of a juggernaut on the quest for power  And power  not as means to an end  but as an end in itself  The speculative dystopian world of 1984 is not far removed from the world we live in  Rape  torture  executions  concentration camps  warfare  all measures for control and power  Of course there are innumerable other examples  but Big Brother immediately brought to mind North Korea s Dear Leader  because I saw the National Geographic documentary not long ago    look at that  when paperbacks used to be 60 cents   I felt like the book was more of an essay and I only say that because the method of storytelling has changed a lot since the time classics were written  However  in the book I was really interested on how Orwell  examined every aspect of the dystopian world  it s bleakness and his use of language because it elicits emotional and intellectual responses as the reader For example  when 1984 describes the future in a totalitarian state where where thoughts and actions were minutely monitored and controlled   Being in a minority  even in a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad  P S  I ve never hated a character as much as I hated ONE in this book  I wanted to strangle him  multiple times   And stab him with a knife  multiple times   And that wouldn t be enough  I was pissed during the whole day after reading that particular chapter  Spreading hatred everywhere   D This is what I call a GREAT book Here s my review   https   lostbetweenpagesbyghitabenabb       Oceania  the setting of  1984   is one of the most detailed and realistic fictional settings I ve ever read  I d put it right up there with Tolkien s Middle Earth There are also too many memorable lines and phrases to list  Being a huge David Bowie fan  I was delighted to read the origins of his song   We Are the Dead  in this book  Some may chastise the book for being too philospophical  or meandering too far from the plot while explaining the culture and backstory of Oceania  I will agree with this sentiment to some degree  but I found those parts to be stimulating diversions that made me buy into Orwell s world even more  Yes  this book is very dark  and the ending is very bleak  But I still found it very enriching and thought provoking  It is certainly not a balls to the wall adventure  and the story does move slowly  For me  this book didn t need that  I was in suspense the whole time and never felt bored  As a pyschological and social portrait  1984 is fascinating  I would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a feast for thought   Wow   This book absolutely blow me away   The topic of the total surveillance is more actual then ever before ____I wrote a more detailed review in german Im fiktiven Ozeanien herrscht die totale Uberwachung  es gibt kaum einen Winkel  an dem man vor den   Teleschirmen  sicher ist  Durch eine systematische Gehirnwasche  wird die Bevolkerung dazu genotigt die einzige und einzig   wahre  Partei  die des   grossen Bruders  als unfehlbare Instanz zu akzeptieren und deren Ansichten zu ubernehmen  Eine eigene politische  gesellschaftliche Meinung die der Parteidoktrin nicht entspricht  wird nicht toleriert und brutal bestraft  Orwells Zukunftsvision  eines totalitaren Staatssystems wurde zu einem zeitlosen Klassiker  Kein Wunder  den das Thema der standigen Uberwachung durch den Staat  sowie der fortschreitende Verlust der Privatsphare welche wir auch heute  in der realen Welt erleben  hat nichts an seiner Brisanz verloren   l yjb n t br rwyh bl knt nZrkh  ly nZrh  ly lmstqbl b d 50 snh

sitting  I remember the fascination and horror I felt about Newspeak  and the sneaking suspicion that the Norwegian lottery or any lottery for that matter  might be a sham too  I also remember the joy I felt towards the middle end of the book  when I saw hope for some of the characters  After I finished the book I remember feeling depressed  That ending    one of the most heartbreaking endings ever  It did fuel the cynic in me definitely  I have re read it  but the first impressions from this book overshadowed everything else  I know I have re read it  but I can t remember any of my thoughts from that time  it s weird  it s like that only served make the memories from the first time stronger It s one of those books you should read  if only because you might get where the term  Big Brother  comes from  I have had to explain this to people who thought it was coined by the people who made the reality TV show  For me who was politically active on the far left at that time it was a useful critique of the ideology I subscribed to  but also a critique of any form of ideology or form of government or social structures that take away individual freedoms  or any sort of freedoms really   And a reminder that it s easy to become blind to that oppression if you are to complaisant Also it s a good place to start if you want to argue with your friends about history and truth and what they mean and indeed if they mean anything  which can be quite fun  finally read one of my favourite books in original and it is more than amazing  it s a brilliant  breathtaking masterpiece  with every page you get more and more absorbed in this dark apocalyptic word of terror and in the end you felt a devastation and shock  Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows   For me to truly love a book I must desparately hate the questions that it forces me to ask and tempts me to answer  According to this criterion alone 1984 ranks as one of the best books I ve read  I am haunted by so many questions when I recall this beautiful book  Most frightening is the thought of what my Room 101 might be and who I would be willing to sell if I ever went there  More subtle is the question of whether or not I already love Big Brother without being subjected to all of his horrors  Wow  just writing this review makes me want to read it again  Credo che 1984 debba essere letto assolutamente  Non so perche ho aspettato cosi tanto prima di leggerlo  Tutti devono metterlo via solo dopo averci ragionato parecchio sopra  L idea di dittatura ipotizzata da Orwell e micidiale  Completamente diversa da quelle passate  Non piu una dittatura fisica ma mentale  Dove non c e piu spazio per amore  felicita  amicizia  fratellanza  Dove addirittura la famiglia perde il suo reale valore  E veramente un romanzo inquietante  Che ti fa pensare che prima o poi una cosa del genere possa succedere veramente   At the time the book was written  1984 was the future  In this future  England has become part of the multinational Oceania  The Party rules over the proles  proletariet  working class  and keeps an all seeing eye over Party members  They are constantly reminded of this surveillance by posters proclaiming that  Big Brother is watching   Not only does the Party watch people  but the Thought Police monitor facial expressions and other non verbal communication to detect thoughtcrime  any thinking that isn t explicitly for the good of the Party  To survive  one must master doublethink  the ability to know and believe two contradictory things  Individual thoughts  actions  and sexuality are forbidden  The language  Newspeak  is composed of a limited vocabulary that limits thoughts and expressions The book follows Winston Smith as he seeks out The Brotherhood  an underground society working to overthrow the Party s rule The SparkNotes are very good  1984 This book and Animal Farm are Orwell s most famous books  Both are dystopian tales of the dangers of a totalitarian government Similarities between the books The government knows best The intelligentsia seize power The naive proletariat are oppressed and kept ignorant The government bends or breaks its own rules for its benefit The government uses propaganda to keep the proletariat in check The government rewrites history to prove that it s correct and that life is better with the government than it was before the government s rise to power Both books have pessimistic endings  A dark  gritty tale which paints such a vivid and ghastly picture that it is at the same time terrifying  horrific and a certain kind of beautiful  Orwell is a genius and a man of detailed descriptions  The way he depicts the dystopian future it is really spine chilling  1984 is the original dystopian novel which proved to be an inspiration to various novels  stories  and movies over the ages  So  even after all these decades the way it still manages to be relevant is really worthy of all the praise and accolades that is showered upon it   This book is definitely not a page turner for the most part but the concept it brings home is something that will leave an everlasting impact on you and will linger around in your thoughts whether you like it or not  And that i think is what a good book is all about This is again a lovely classic that plays a trick with your mind and thoughts and enchants you with the ideas it put forth    From the age of uniformity  from the age of solitude  from the age of Big Brother  from the age of doublethink    greetings  I ve finished with this novel yesterday evening and still cannot settle my mind  I felt as if my brain was chewed out   1984  I started to read almost immediately after the  Little Women  of Louisa May Alcott and I knew nothing about it except that it s a dystopia  But neither Collins  nor Huxley or Bradbury prepared me for this  After the pink and fluffy Alcott  this novel was like a falling down to earth  with a further dipping into the pit of my personall hell  Yes  hell  as there is nothing worse for me than a full control over the man s reason  And though  in our time the influence of mass media on the trivial minds is huge  and streams of disinformation usually distract   we still have right to the individual thinking  We still have a right to the physical outpouring of our emotions But not here  not in 1984  not in the Orwell s world  In this world   Big brother is watching you    In this world it is vital to   Never show dismay  Never show resentment  A single flicker of the eyes could give you away   But this is not enough too  Nobody could control the momentary expression of the eyes  involuntary movement of the head or the most unpredictable   their dreams  And even if it could be   it does not matter  because they know  They already know all your thoughts  they knew everything before you realize it by yourself  So now  there is a little left to do   only teach you to think differently  The learning process gave me the willies and made me hold the breath  I involuntarily cringed to the embryo s position In my memory it was the first time  when I pray for the death of lead character as a mercy  It can be agonizing  painful  anything  but not the  final  necessary healing   I prayed Orwell  O Brien  Big Brother  by the end of the book he became almost real for me  for this grace  But no    even in the instant of death they cannot permit any deviation  This book has been associated for me with the song     Mad world   group Tears For Fears All around me are familiar facesWorn out places  worn out facesBright and early for the daily racesGoing nowhere  going nowhereTheir tears are filling up their glassesNo expression  no expressionHide my head I wanna drown my sorrowNo tomorrow  no tomorrowAnd I find it kind of funny  I find it kind of sadThe dreams in which I m dying are the best I ve ever had I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to takeWhen people run in circles it s a very  veryMad world  mad world http   gutenberg net au ebooks01 0100    lktb Htm kn  ysh bswrybyHky tfSyl ldwl lshtrky  lstbddy    kyf btshwf Swr lqy d lmfd  wyn m

to read  It is one of the truly essential classics of modern literature 1984 is a timeless novel that makes you question everything from conformity to the government and the media  The first half of the book is a bit slow and stagnant  yet the end section is absolutely frightening and marvelous  This book is brilliant  How relevant is Orwell s message to today   When you answer that question  you realize why this is novel  written in 1949  is a  future  novel   The best books    are those that tell you what you know already    Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood    Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength   Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   If you want to keep a secret  you must also hide it from yourself    If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  for ever   The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind  happiness is better    Your worst enemy  he reflected  was your own nervous system  At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows    Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull     what I just read     this was haunting and depressing as far as language is concerned just loved the terminologies of newspeak   at start I reread the first few pages because I wasn t getting much the new terms particularly with party slogan   classic example of double think   but these are explained very much in further pages as well as in the appendix about double think    book was fast paced during the start pages  during the middle  his affair with Julia  book is more concerned with details of their affair and derailed from political description  the last portion of the book is the most brain teasing and depressive  few important things the book discussed history is alterable and alter it to suit you governance  alter that in every existing document and no one can say it is altered  they will say it was the same as described  this alteration is shown in many places through out the novel especially status of war with Eurasia and Eastasia   like they suddenly declared during hate weak that they are at war with eastasia which was contrary to their previous stance  war with Eurasia  they have changes all the records within a weak and It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened     another instance of alteration of history was considering killed  book used the word vaporized  as  unpersons   newspeak word  means they never existed or ceased to exist like when he talked of his colleague syme    syme has ceased to exist he never existed   the sort of people party produced due to their continuous propaganda  they stopped using their brains and were just machines acting unconsciously  describing one of his colleague when he was talking to Winston he said   The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words  but it was not speech in the true sense  it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness  like the quacking of a duck   or when his neighbor parson was caught due to uttering  death to big brother   in his dream  he said he will thank the inner party    thank you for saving me before it was too late and just check the absurdity in wordings for description of a hanging   It was a good hanging   said Syme reminiscently   I think it spoils it when they tie their feettogether  I like to see them kicking  And above all  at the end  the tongue sticking right out  andblue    a quite bright blue  That s the detail that appeals to me   how people were deprived of basic need   how pathetic was their ration  the expressions on seeing everyday use items are worth noticing like     I have seen oranges    I can remember lemons they were quite common in fifties    vine like paperweight or Mr  Charrington s half remembered rhymes  itbelonged to the vanished  romantic past     I am using the same razor blade for the past few months  I ve tried all over the place  They don t exist any longer   it not like book only contain political talk only there is some romantic sentence also and the one below seems to me more poetic than just phrases    With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside  What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside  With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture  a whole system of thought  as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm   or this sentence   description of the same at another place   and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated    view spoiler  I was disappointed in last by the behavior of Winston   I strongly believed in  Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull   was sure he wont let those few centimeters in someone else hands  he disappointed Julia too when she told him   They can make you say anything    anything    but they can t make you believe it  They can t get inside you     at last they made him believe every thing even they make him love Big brother   hide spoiler   1984 ieji yra viena is geriausiu knygu  kuria as esu skaiciusi ir as beveik neabejoju  kad ji su manim pasiliks dar labai ilga laika  Is tikruju  retai kada atrasi toki kurini  kad atsivertes bet kuri puslapi galetum ten rasti kazka tokio stipraus  jog net uzgniauzia kvapa  Nors zmones vertina sia knyga ivairiai  as nezinau  kaip galima jai skirti maziau nei maksimuma zvaigduciu tasku  etc Mano manymu  vienas didziausiu sios knygos privalumu   tai jos aktualumas  Taip  ji buvo parasyta pries daugiau nei 60 metu  Taip  laikas  apie kuri rasoma  jau seniai praejes  Ir  zinoma  satyra apie komunistini totalitarini rezima galetu buti pavadinta pasenusia  Bet tik labai pavirsutiniskas skaitytojas nepamatys to  kas slypi tarp eiluciu  Tik visiskai abejingas ji supanciai aplinkai zmogus nepamatys  kad visa sita satyra visiskai tiksliai apibudina dabartini musu gyvenima  Butent tai ir kelia didziausia ispudi ir netgi siauba Pabaigai pasakysiu tiek  kad kiekvienas  nors siek tiek mastantis zmogus  turetu perskaityti 1984 uosius  Ne todel  kad jus suzinosit kazka naujo  bet tam  kad butu patvirtinta  jog jus nesate vienintelis  kuris taip galvoja    It s a very strong dystopia because evilness does actually bring you power all the time  You wouldn t expect people to obey you if you re extremely kind and nice to them  instead you would expect them to take advantage of you  But if you re evil everyone is scared of you and no one even attempts to disobey you because they realize that the consequences will be worse than their current situation if they rebel to change the it  Julia is one of  The Whateverists  and I love her for that  Who cares how the Party works if she finds a way to not get affected by it  She s exactly how lots of people are nowadays  People have accepted the fact that lies rule the world and that not much can be done about it   To know and not to know    to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies    That was the principal conflict in this frightening tale about a society where thoughts are collective  and reality is dispensable  Consistent from the start to finish  1984 scarred my mind and revitalized it at the same time  The trumped up futuristic concept by George Orwell might have been debunked so far as one s concerned  but with his playful words  his deep introspection and his enigmatic yet dark writing style  you ll be able to materialize in front of you the vile and delirious world you wouldn t dare to lodge in  A world where everywhere you go  eyes are darted on you  nothing is an escape route except the darkness    Ironic to say  perhaps  that the inconsistencies among characters    their eccentric attributes  their indecisiveness  their loathsome acts and their askew perspectives  did develop them all throughout the book until the concluding chapters  The villain  though reprehensible in a myriad of things  did actually come out as someone you  might  possibly look up to  Winston Smith  the protagonist  who for interminable times rendered himself into the dangerous world of consciousness  had started to fend off his indifference  1984 is a novel for those who are fascinated with bizarre contemplation and unreliable yet captivating narration  This is something that would keep you up every night    wondering as you gaze upon the stars Who am I to start with  Who am I as my life ends  Who am I as I lie down my grave  Read in high school and again as an adult and still love this story  I ve probably read the book ten times  at least  This is the book that introduced me to the dystopian genre  and I can t be more thankful for that  Awesome premise  great writing  A true classic in my book  This has one of the most striking first lines in English literature  It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen  It s an apt first sentence at that  one that immediately warns us we re in a world off kilter  By the time we get to the end of the second paragraph we re clued in that we re in a totalitarian setting  whether of the National Socialist or Soviet Socialist type  the enormous poster  a world absurd and ground down so nothing works  the run down building called  Victory Mansions  and a mention of  Hate Week   And then we learn the caption on that enormous poster  BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  This is arguably the classic work of dystopia modeled on the real things in the twentieth century but set in a future in one of the iconic Democratic countries  Britain  to warn yes  it can happen here   Or at least the future when the book was published in 1948  The year 1984 has come and gone  and many countries oppressed then  are free now  but there are still many a totalitarian country around today for 1984 to still resonate   The book gives us a road map and warning sign and many a famous phrase  particularly  Newspeak   Orwell through the book warns that above all such regimes corrupt and oppress through the corruption of language  Euphemisms that are obscene in their linguistic twists that limit how you can imagine and articulate protest  resonates today in the very language we fight over  pro life or pro choice  affirmative action or racial preferences  enhanced interrogation or torture  Oppression Persisting  Can t Fight this Brain Conditioning How did we get in so much trouble Getting out just seems impossible Oppression is persisting I can t fight this brain conditioning  Revolt  Muse  2009  inspired by 1984  Newspeak  def   ambiguous euphemistic language used chiefly in political propaganda Thoughtcrime  def   an instance of unorthodox or controversial thinking  considered as a criminal offense or as socially unacceptable Doublethink  def   the acceptance of or mental capacity to accept contrary opinions or beliefs at the same time  especially as a result of political indoctrination While I remembered  from reading this in high school  that  Big Brother  came from this novel  I was astounded to realize upon this re reading that the terms above  and more  now in our lexicon  came out of the pages of this enduring classic  which Orwell obviously aimed at the barbarous  sinister totalitarian communist regimes in place when he wrote it in 1947  primarily the Soviet Union and Stalin  Of course  another word long in common usage is Orwellian  meaning   resembling the totalitarian political methods decried in the works of     George Orwell  particularly in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty Four  characterized by use of misleading terminology  propaganda  censorship  totalitarianism  surveillance and repression  I d add to this list  Torture    in its most sadistic form  picture a room full of blinding lights  as a cage crowded with ravenous rats is about to be placed over the renegade s head  The story is gripping  and exceptionally eerie for its realism  in a post apocalypse setting or not  All post apocalyptic novels I ve read and movies I ve seen have borrowed from Orwell and this novel  George Orwell s 1984 was a  game changer     among a mere handful  BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOUThe essential crime that contained all others in itself  ThoughtcrimePeople simply disappeared  always during the nightYour name was removed from the registers  every record of everything you had ever done was wiped outYour one time existence was denied and then forgottenYou were abolished  annihilated  vaporized was the usual wordThoughtcrime does not entail death  thoughtcrime is deathWho controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the pastIt s a beautiful thing  the destruction of wordsthe whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thoughtOrthodoxy is unconsciousnessDesire was thoughtcrimeUntil they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become consciousEverything faded into mist  The past was erased  the erasure was forgotten  the lie became truthThe past not only changed  but changed continuouslyWas life better before the Revolution than it is now It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against one s own bodyBut you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays No emotion was pure  because everything was mixed up with fear and hatredIf you re happy inside yourself  why should you get excited about Big Brother There was a direct intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxyThe children  on the other hand  were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviationsIn a way  the world view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of realityThey can t make you believe it  They can t get inside youThe essential act of war is destruction  not necessarily of human lives  but of the products of human labourAll rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followersParty slogan  War is PeaceThe aim of the High is to remain where they areThe aim of the Middle is to change places with the HighThe aim of the Low  when they have an aim is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equalThe invention of print  however  made it easier to manipulate public opinionThe film and the radio carried the process furtherWith the development of television  and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument  private life came to an endThe past is whatever the records and the memories agree uponThe Party is in full control of all recordsDoublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously  and accepting both of themThe Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war  the Ministry of Truth with lies  the Ministry of Love with torture  and the Ministry of Plenty with starvationSanity is not statisticalIn the face of pain there are no heroesReality is not external  Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere elseIt is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the PartyTwo and two are four  Sometimes they are five  Sometimes they are threeIt is not easy to become saneBut we make the brain perfect before we blow it outWe shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselvesPower is not a means  It is an end One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolutionOne makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is powerWe are the priests of power  God is powerThe individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individualObedience is not enough  Unless he is sufferingPower is in inflicting pain and humiliationThe old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justiceOurs is founded upon hatredOur neurologists are at work upon it nowThere will be no loyalty  except loyalty towards the Party  There will be no love  except the love of Big BrotherThere will be no art  no literature  no scienceIf you are a man you are the last manYour kind is extinctDo you

es un libro tan crudo  directo y frio  pero muy real y probable en la actualidad  Tahun 1984 memang telah lama berlalu  namun karya ini tetap dikenal sebagai karya fenomenal dan bahkan menjadi semacam  holy grail  bagi para pecinta sastra klasik  alternate history  dan genre distopian  Saya mulai membaca buku ini dengan ekspektasi begitu tinggi tetapi ternyata kualitas dari buku ini tetap bisa jauh melampaui ekspektasi saya Rasanya belum pernah ada buku lain yang mampu membuat saya sesak nafas  geleng geleng  sampai stress gak karuan sepanjang hari  Dalam buku ini  rasanya seluruh kepercayaan saya tentang  semangat  kemanusiaan  harapan  kekuatan cinta  kebebasan  keadilan  logika  dan rasionalitas   hancur lebur  lumat  musnah tak berbekas sampai tidak ada ampas ampasnya sama sekali  Yang lebih mengerikan adalah  proses kehancuran itu berjalan dengan begitu wajar  seperti mengalun dengan perlahan  dengan proses yang begitu simpel dan tidak terbantahkan Saya angkat tangan  menyerah  Rasanya cukup saya membacanya sekali  saya tidak sanggup membacanya lagi  Buku ini betul betul gila  Benar benar tidak habis pikir  bagaimana mungkin Orwell bisa menciptakan dunia se mengerikan ini  Bagaimana mungkin ada seorang manusia waras yang bisa bertahan untuk tidak jadi gila atau sinting ketika menyelesaikan cerita ini   HOLY FUCKING FUCK SHIT OH FUCKIN  MINDFUCK FUCKING RAD FUCKERY    FUUCK  Honestly I had avoided this book thinking it had long passages about torture and brainwashing  It does  but before that there is the plot about Winston s political and romantic awakening within a totalitarian state  Feeble as this awakening is  the longing for truth  beauty and love is wonderfully described  There is no romanticism in this book  but there is hope in my view The book can be read as a prediction or as a cautionary tale  Taken as a prediction it is devastating  As a cautionary tale  it is an expose of man s potential for evil  Written just after World War II  Orwell was taking recent events to their logical extreme  His portrait of a world where personal liberties are snuffed out by a ravenous inner party seemed all to plausible at the moment  Within 1984 is a thorough description of the methods and mechanisms used to create the totalitarian society  Some aspects of this were obvious  Children spy on their parents  Television has no on off switch and is a two way devise allowing watchers to be watched  Love is anathema because any loyalty other than to the state  Big Brother  is dangerous  War is constant  because there must be an enemy Where Orwell departed from the obvious is where it gets interesting  The mottoes of the party   War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength   demonstrate how utterly the rulers want to alter reality  The invention of a new and simpler language   Newspeak   shows how this can be done  The book within the book written by Emmanuel Goldstein describes how war has no goal besides creating an outside enemy to distract the people from any other political strivings  And finally  control by the state will not stop at eliminating behaviors  The striving for freedom  love  knowledge and peace must also be destroyed Ultimately this book is as depressing as I thought it would be  However  it was much more complex and fascinating than I realized   Having no idea of what this book is going to be about I picked it And after turning few pages  I realised that I had a miracles in my hands  Orwell is genius  the way he imagined the world  the plot  the characters is just pure awsomeness  Well and so far he has been right about everything although he overstated some details  we re living in a world of slavery  where freedom is just an illusion  and all what s beyond we call forbiden The best book in

2015 m   This is a novel that describes a future world that is fucked up  It is a dystopia or an anti utopia  Although published in 1948   I was shocked by how much I could relate many of the book s event to how our countries in the middle east run nowadays I didn t particularly enjoy 1984 as a novel  I found many more novels more entertaining  However  it was a book where I would read a chapter  re read it again  realize how similar the inner party operates to many modern day governments  Then I re read again  and get blown away by the genius of George Orwell to analyze accurately how people function in this fiction  I would often sit for extended hours and link Big brother  the inner party  Winston smith  Julia  O Brien  Goldstein  and the proles to people I know and watch every day on TVs and in the streetThe chapters of the book that had portions of goldstein s book  The theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism  was the part I enjoyed the most  The way the words  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is strength  are analyzed is genius  After a lot of speculation  I can probably with some modifications tailor versions of 1984 to what is happening in Egypt  Syria  Lebanon  Iraq  and Libya  With one difference  our governments were smart enough to not publicly show  IngSoc   We have our own modern version of IngSoc   and we can t notice it The book will blow away anyone who is a fan of philosophy  Is there really any facts in this world  Does anything exists outside of our minds or is reality only inside ourselves  Is 2 2 4 or can it mean 5 or 3  I think i suck at writing reviews  but I wrote this not for anyone  but to remind me of how marvelous this publication was  I will probably re read the novel again  in Arabic this time  With complexity of this novel  I believe one reading isn t enough to grasp all ideas of this book I just finished reading 1984 again  having read it many times before  but not in the last 10 years  I continue to be alert to the sorts of things Orwell warns us about as they occur  such as cameras in public places  phone taps  the government  particularly the US government  which I respect  but less and less over the years  presenting lies to support their actions  Vietnam  Patrick Tillman s death  etc    using torture  etc   etc  It is amazing that these dangers could be foreseen in 1947  Perhaps I am naive  but Orwell is incredibly prescient However  what truly struck me at this reading is the actual writing  and the major concepts that he presents  Another reviewer here mentions it  Orwell s descriptions of what is going on in the human mind  usually Winston s  are so dead on that with only a few words  I know EXACTLY what he is talking about  And with those descriptions  he has identified some basic ideas that are obvious in retrospect  though not necessarily completely valid  The purpose of those in power is power alone  pain makes cowards of us all  if you limit the available vocabulary  you limit the range of thought  there is something for everyone that cannot be tolerated  the only reality is in the mind  the concept of doublethink is valid  There are others  I have read critics indicating that the characters are thin and that the ending is weak or false  I think the story and characters are intended to provide a structure for these ideas  and no more was needed   Que alternativas restam quando nem os poucos   centimetros cubicos no interior do nosso cranio   nos pertencem  No livro 1984  George Orwell criou uma assustadora reflexao politica que evidencia o perigo do totalitarismo  tendo por base o que o proprio testemunhou com os governos Russo e Espanhol Experienciamos a vida em Oceania atraves de Winston Smith  um trabalhador do Partido cuja mente resiste silenciosamente a exaustiva soberania do Partido  mantendo inedito sentido critico e ansia por respostas  Neste mundo  todo o tipo de liberdade foi abolida  seja de expressao  de imprensa  de reuniao ou ate mesmo de pensamento  consequentemente  todos os que forem apanhados a contrariar as diretivas do Partido simplesmente desaparecem    vaporizam se    ou sao submetidos a uma disciplina intelectual que os obrigara nao so a dizer o que o Partido estipula  mas tambem a acreditar em cada palavra Alem de constantemente vigiados atraves de   telecras   e de microfones espalhados por todo o lado  os cidadaos sao submetidos a doses constantes de propaganda politica que orienta a forma como devem viver as suas vidas  os incita a odiar todos os que se opoem ao Partido e a denunciar comportamentos que possam parecer suspeitos  incluindo as criancas em relacao aos proprios pais  O poder do Partido e reforcado pelo controlo que este detem sobre o passado  alterando constantemente documentos e livros  rebatizando edificios e ate paises  modificando datas  impedindo que os cidadaos mantenham documentos registos fotografias  o Partido consegue sabotar a memoria coletiva e  desta forma  controlar o presente  justificando as suas acoes e garantindo que   o Partido tem sempre razao    que as suas previsoes sao sempre correctas  A opressao do Partido vai ao ponto de criar uma nova lingua  uma que nao possua os termos que permitem sequer conceptualizar pensamentos revoltosos Enquanto passeia pelas decrepitas ruas da cidade de Londres  Winston repara na miseria em que vivem os   proles    mas tambem em como sao os unicos que vivem em relativa liberdade  passando a ver na classe mais baixa da sociedade a unica forca que podera um dia subverter o Partido  Nestas ruas esta tambem gravada a   incompetencia   do Partido para governar ou apenas o espelho da sua ganancia  o esforco e meios gastos para controlar o povo atraves de avancada tecnologia  nao e concordante com a pobreza que se ve Com Winston   com as consequencias das suas acoes   rebeldes     entramos numa inevitabilidade assustadora  Reeducado a forca  atraves de intimidacao psicologica e tortura fisica  Winston ve se sem escape e sem esperanca  morrer a odia los  apesar de submissao total  parece ser a unica liberdade possivel Esta e uma satira escrita em forma de aviso  expondo possibilidades terriveis  mas nao completamente originais  sobre a submissao intelectual do povo  a omnipresenca do governo que oprime e controla sem medida  difundindo a sua mensagem atraves de exaustivas campanhas  1984 alerta nos para o perigo dos terriveis  ismos  do comunismo  do fascismo  do nazismo       enfim  do totalitarismo   demonstra a relevancia da linguagem como concretizador de pensamentos e chama a atencao para a importancia de mantermos a nossa identidade  a nossa memoria sobre o passado e conhecimento sobre a Historia   2 2 5 Si toda la informacion que pudieras consultar estuviera manipulada   como podrias saber lo que sucede realmente en el mundo   Como puedes ser libre si todo lo que lees  todo lo que ves  todo lo que escuchas ha pasado por el filtro oficial para que se adapte a la ideologia del partido   Como puedes pensar algo que sea diferente a lo que quieren que pienses En 1984 se nos presenta una sociedad totalitaria donde el Gobierno controla absolutamente todos los aspectos de la vida cotidiana  En ella  los ciudadanos son sometidos a vigilancia permanente mediante unos aparatos instalados en las casas y si alguien manifiesta una opinion diferente a la establecida por el Gobierno es detenido  Si no estas conmigo  estas contra mi Ademas  se mantiene un estado de guerra permanente contra  el enemigo   Otra sociedad igualmente totalitaria  que no se diferencian en casi nada la una de la otra pero que se presenta a los ciudadanos como el mal y la causa de todos los problemas  Y si alguien cuestiona alguna de las politicas es indudablemente un simpatizante del enemigo  Porque el Partido nunca se equivoca y es la unica solucion posible a todos los males El protagonista del libro  Winston Smith  es uno de los burocratas de esta sociedad  Trabajando para el Ministerio de la Verdad se dedica a manipular la historia  Su objetivo es alterar libros  periodicos  fotografias    que muestren algo que vaya en contra de los postulados del Gobierno  Si ahora estamos en guerra contra Eurasia  siempre hemos estado en guerra contra ellos por lo que todos los documentos donde aparecieran como aliados deben ser modificados De esta forma  la verdad es lo que el Gobierno dice que es la verdad  El miedo  la represion y la impotencia provocan que no se cuestione la version oficial y parece que nadie nota las contradicciones entre lo que se dice hoy y lo que se dijo ayer Debido a su trabajo  Winston empieza a darse cuenta de todas las falsedades que le rodean y tras conocer a una joven con sus mismas inquietudes reune el valor necesario para dejar a un lado el conformismo y resistirse al control del Gobierno Durante la resistencia de Winston se nos van descubriendo las diversas tecnicas que usa el Gobierno para asegurarse el control de la sociedad  La manipulacion del lenguaje  la restriccion de informacion  la escasez  el enemigo al que achacar todos los males  la vigilancia de la sociedad por la propia sociedad  Y si todo esto falla  tortura y lavado de cerebro  1984 lleva el control al extremo pero nos hace reflexionar sobre nuestra propia sociedad y la facilidad con la que nos dejamos manipular  Las lealtades ciegas al partido politico de turno  la confianza que ponemos en lo que nos cuentan los medios de comunicacion y como muchas veces aceptamos que dos mas dos son cinco porque es lo que nos dice el Gran Hermano  Y recuerda  Big Brother is watching you  You can find my review of this novel at https   bookidote wordpress com 2015    Yours truly LashaanLashaan   Trang   Bloggers and Book ReviewersOfficial blog  http   bookidote wordpress com This book is one of the famous and intense distopian of all kind of books  George Orwell is quite successful to describe the community which dominated by fear and oppression  The mottos of this book   War is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength  compel us to think about the world we are living now The topic is profound and a bit scary at first but then you start to think that  these things are highly reflects our societies in terms of fear and oppression  From the book s date of issue 1942  it influenced people all around the world and aroused interests of all humans  I think every person who read this book would find something in the book plausable and interesting   1984 is the most geniality horrifying book  that after reading it you ll keep your mind wide open and be more conscious  and you ll never be able to see the world as it was before  Orwell s a genius   I was so anxious getting to the end of 1984  It s not a book that you want to be finished and get over with Maybe it s dark and written in despair but it s lively and vivid About politics  or better power  control and authority and its relationship with the 3 classes low  medium and high  how they see it  remember it  live it and endure it as a group and also individually  A system of deceit and treachery a police state with no laws or rights  Where thinking is a dangerous crime and obedience is not enough  A permanent war and fear and suffering A system we re all familiar with if it happens you lived under a dictatorship once or you are aware of what s going on around the globe Main character Winston Smith who believes the Party meant to be destroyed and things will change again but doesn t know how and when Julia who accepts the Party ruling as something unalterable  like the sky  you can t rebel against   you just evade it sometimes   The best books  are those that tell you what you know exactly  You may also need to carry on with  Brave new world  and  Fahrenheit 451  if you didn t yet    rwy   Zym  jd lkn Sdm  jd n knt mSdwm  Twl lwqt wn bqr  dwl  ndhm shrT  lfkr   1984  a novel in which George Orwell predicts a rather horrifying future  A future of terror  where people are put under constant surveillance  where they abolish you for being a criminal of thought by carrying radical beliefs  where they control the media and alter the truth  The further I got in the book  the more horrifying it became  the more I realized how familiar  they  seem to be  I realized that Orwell s novel almost hit the bulls eye in it s prediction  for many are already living in this state of terror  and worse yet  some don t even realize it  This was a disturbing book  This was a book that kept me up all night after the night of finishing it  This  to me  was more a masterpiece of a warning than it is of a book   C mon  This book is a classy classic  Big Brother  has become a living and breathing expression used by politicians and laymen alike  Orwell s ideas have helped to clarify political relations for a couple of decades now  a rare feat for a book under the umbrella of fantasy sci fi  If its influence were not enough to deserve this book at least a well thought out consideration  its actual literary quality is rather decent as well  Orwell s strength lies not in a well constructed imagination  but in the force of plot and the intention prescribed to certain symbols and characters  Even if you don t agree exactly with Orwell s way of attacking government s notorious self empowerment you still have to appreciate the divine literary exactness on display in Orwell s writing  Orwell  though a social critic  is firstly a writer  His intelligence is put on display well in his classic story  The novel 1984 By George Orwell is one that shall be read by young readers for centuries to come  With its third person view of the main character  Mr  Winston Smith  the book shadows him and his thoughts as he works day by day for the totalitarian government  the Party  Winston throughout the book seems indifferent to the party s absurd ideas and dares to go beyond the horribly stern rule of his government  The main idea of  The party  is to induce fear into the human individual so they themselves are so paranoid as to take a wrong step  Rewriting history to its own benefit the Party attempts to eliminate all  flaws in the pattern   By showing how the Party rewrites the history of the world from wars to the invention of the helicopter  George Orwell aims to show the results of a totalitarian government and all the problems that shall rise because of it  With a very dark and dim setting this book shows you the horridness of the Party from its posters of  Big Brother  the Party s leader who is always watching you to the public hangings of the prisoners of war  This novel shows you how a totalitarian government changes the entire lifestyle of the people who live by these rules for the worse inducing fear  brainwash  and taking away any sense of freedom Winston Smith always felt as if he  had been cheated of something he had a right to   Meaning the Party took away all his desire  leaving him alone and depressed  Even his own wife left him being more loyal to the Party than her spouse  His depression always seemed to get the best of him until Julia steps into his life  Julia  a rebel without a cause  captures Winston s heart  With her passion to rebel and her attitude  this only adds to this lucrative woman  Claiming to have had multiple affairs with Party members  she is the anti party figure that Winston loves  One major point brought to light in the novel was how fear conquers all  There are various ways they induced fear in to the people of Oceania  One of these are the Telescreens  they are large television screens that the Party uses to monitor all citizens throughout the city  These screens monitor your movements  conversations  and worst of all your thoughts  Nothing is safe from the Party s eyes as they delve into your mind and soul  This drives you to insanity  as your own thoughts become your worst enemy  Other ways they are able to put fear into the people includes public hangings of prisoners of war  and posters of the Party s leader  Big Brother   He is the face of the party and Winston himself wondered if this unknown leader even exists throughout the whole book  All these ways of ruling symbolize the totalitarian ideas of the government in this book and George Orwell uses them to show how powerless you truly are When George Orwell began writing  1984  in 1946 post World War II  many of the political leaders during this time period influenced his writings  The allies and axis in World War II can be compared to Eurasia  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasian  These were the 3 superpowers that took part in a never ending battle to conquer one another  During World War II he wrote for BBC S Eastern Service supervising broadcasts in India to counter Nazi Germany s propaganda  There he began to see all the horrid propaganda surrounding the war and the way Nazi Germany attempted to brainwash the mind of the people of India  just as  The Party  attempted to brainwash its own people throughout the book  During this time another totalitarian power was coming to rise  the Soviet Union  Gaining a lot of power post World War II many feared the rise of this superpower  Following the basic guidelines of  elaborate guiding ideology  a single mass party led by a dictator  system of terror  monopoly on weapons and communication  and central direction and control of the economy through state planning   This scared many as the Soviets power only continued to grow during the Cold War  Orwell disagreeing with this way of politics took these ideologies created by the Soviets in writing his novel   2 2 5  If you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself   These few lines explain the great power of the Party and how it affected everyone around them  Their lies are your truth  and your lies are their knowledge  Nothing not even your thoughts are safe from the Party  Orwell does a great job in depicting this throughout the book  Incorporating many different themes  symbols and character traits you get a grasp on how this government is able to keep itself afloat from day to day  successfully creating the allusion that you have absolutely no power over yourself  As the famous words of the Party are  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength   George Orwell s 1984 provides a chilling reminder that Big Brother is always watching you by taking this notion to the extreme  This novel follows the free thinker  Winston  as he attempts to break away from the totalitarian government s influence in small  yet blasphemous ways  As we progress through the novel  the notion of what s real and what is a lie becomes blurred over and over again until we are starting to  double think  ourselves  As Winston is subjected to Big Brother s coercive operations  we are reminded that standing out is a quick way to commit suicide  In order to survive  Winston must remove the very essence of his individualism and become a dutiful citizen that praises Big Brother with every breath  That proves more difficult  however  as the conditions he lives in each day take their toll  This book has made me ponder just how malleable the human psyche truly is  where even the surest certainties can be reversed or obliterated  leaving nothing but a true lie in its place  Orwell takes you on a journey through this brave new world  not sparing you the gritty details of its terrible inter workings  All the while  we are hoping for an escape   but Big Brother is always watching   1984 is one of those books that leave a huge impact on the reader  This is the first book of this kind that I have read  Our protagonist  Winston Smith  acts as the eyes for the reader  He is a  lunatic  in Oceania  one of the three fictional powers of this story  the other two being Eurasia and Eastasia  The way that the totalitarian government has been portrayed is exciting as well as intimidating  As someone pointed out in his her review  this could very well be classified as a horror story   PThe division of the story into three parts is apt  Almost all the elements  including the romantic angle  the handbook of Goldstein  Smith s fondness towards a time long forgotten and the characterization of O Brien  fit very well and add a lot of value to the story  I think everyone should read 1984 once to realize the extent of the freedom that he she enjoys in the current state  so that they can better utilize it   A masterpiece    its sad how this 1984 of george orwell remembers me of our 2014 and gives me ideas about how the 2084 will look alike    Its sad if at the end  they  can always fix us to be  happy  again and re run with the system    This book is quite frankly just awesome  There are so many quotable moments and characters it s unbelievable  and on top of that it has very elaborate yet intriguing plot  I simply could not predict it  except them getting caught doing their little thang in the end  Oh  uh  spoiler alert by the way      but it wasn t so far fetched that I totally didn t get it at all  Everything was easy to understand  Orwell is a masterful architect when it comes to writing in a way that is clearly intellectually higher than most while at the same time retaining a readability that I think is pretty much unsurpassed  The only other person I could compare the style to might be Ernest Hemingway  with the  simple yet complex  configuration  but at the same time throwing in some pretty gnarly words that catch you off guard  But Orwell s phraseology is more than that  it s a work of art  One can tell that he put extreme thought into every word and every phrase  and crafted each moment with such a simply virtuosity that he got across exactly what he wanted to get across  From characters that are the roundest of round and dynamic nature  a setting that bleeds with discomfort and exposed privacy  a plot that will keep you guessing without being overly complicated  and an ending that will haunt you till the end of your days  Orwell s magnum opus is exactly that  His masterpiece  This is the stuff legends are made of  khngaimt

groomed  edited works  which I go back through and re edit for clarity purposes  But 1984 is a book that inspires raw emotions in a doublepluspoignant way  so a carefully constructed treatise just doesn t seem appropriate Reading this book  I learned two things  1  George Orwell is one of the few people I ve ever encountered who saw the world as I do  even if we don t agree completely on the solutions to its problems  and 2  he produced what might be the finest book in the English language Mankind is a creature of very dual drivers  We want freedom  and justice  but we re chained by Maslow s hierarchy of needs  all things being equal  a well fed  warm  and entertained human usually won t make many waves in the political structure within which they live  see also  the Roman Empire   1984 s Oceania is an empire built around convincing the populace that the brutal regime they live under has given the very best state of existence ever known  and it has done this by controlling its residents  perspectives on both the past and the future  In such a way  it lowers the peak at the top of that pyramid of needs  while consciously and savagely attacking the concepts of familial love The optimist in me knows such a state might endure for hundreds  or even thousands of years  in the same way that North Korea exists in such a fashion but will  inevitably  one day be torn apart by its own people  The cynic in me  however  knows that mankind is always capable of being driven into such a system in the first place What we face in our own American empire is a turn key Oceania in the making  Our vast surveillance state is unapologetic  imagining that it has an inherent right to the personal information of not just its own citizens  but foreign nationals  Our military industrial complex is so vast that it has become a dangerously interconnected aspect of our economy  in which talking heads such as Andy Dean now openly implore the need for its presence as a bulwark against economic calamity  lost  it seems  are Eisenhower s own warnings on this very same dynamic   We chase shadows of shadows in foreign entanglements our founders implored us to avoid  we see a threat in every fracturing nation within the Middle East  we imagine one such nation as  our greatest ally   though  tellingly  none can quite qualify why   and defend it with  among other things  an  Iron Dome  defense system that shoots  50 000 missiles at  100 homemade incoming rockets Against this canvas of misdirected economic and security resources  we saw an election in 2012 built on  saving the middle class   featuring two candidates sponsored by a financial sector that no longer believes in reasonable reserve requirements  but took billions of dollars from the taxpayers when said investments folded  We watched elements of both parties co opt the populist revolts against the status quo  with the Democratic Party claiming Occupy and the Republican Party harnessing the Tea Party  what s next  the recruitment of Anonymous   We perform our own works on the social engineering front  as well  We have attacked the father and denigrated the homemaking mother  The concept of  child  is being eroded as we begin to train ourselves to think of the unborn as parasites  dress our children in increasingly more adult clothing  and widely regard raising our descendants as some sort of unending ordeal taking us away from our free time  We are abdicating the responsibility of the care of friends  fellow man and family to the state  We are more connected than ever  but spend our time together mired separately in smart phones and internet devices  Pontificators and their ilk train us to think that God and Science cannot coexist  that if Red or Blue will simply win the country will be saved  that sufficient intelligence no longer demands humility  that  they hate us because we re free   that the internet s fount of pornography is somehow a healthy alternative to true human intimacy  We are a society at war with our own civilization Our culture s fundamental value these days seems to be distraction  we are anchored to Facebook and enslaved to the meme  We don t have the time for Orwell s warnings  especially because we re the United States  and are thus somehow invulnerable to the same internal forces and ambitions that devastated so many past empires It is a time for doublethink  and we are all increasingly proficient at our Two Minutes Hate  One of the most frightening and prophetic novels ever written  What else is there to be said  Read it  I loved this book  This book had a variety of levels that you uncover every chapter  1984 explored topics from communism  fascism  and government control  Orwell shows government control and how it affects the mind and body  The book s government is ruled by an authoritarian dictatorship  A man named Winston has to help fight against the Party ruled by Big Brother  He meets the love of his life throughout the battle until Big Brother gets control      The original dystopian  One of my all time favorites  What can one write about 1984 that has not yet been written  It was popular in 1984  the year I graduated from high school and started U0  I did not read it then   my honors English class chose Dicken s Hard Times instead  We were reacting against 1984 s popularity and establishing our intellectual freedom from GroupThink  today it would written like a computer program with the G and T capitalized  It is eerily relevant to the current world  The constant low level war  the proles   referred to as pleebs in Altwood s trilogy  Trailer trash  white trash  red necks by the current vernacular  the war against terror  the war against drugs  the wars in Crimea and Syria and Afganistan  Cameras on the streets and the NRS  constant collection of data  Big data  metadata  We accept it in return for freedom  DoubleThink And yet the personalization of the brainwashing in 1984 is hard to imagine  Is Winston Smith worth the effort  Would each and every member of hte outer party require that level of intervention to accomplish the goals of the party  The conversations between Winston and O brian are essential to telling the story and yet they challenge the premise of the book  If the power took constant and individual vigilance would BB and the party be so powerful This is a book one should read every few years  And also the Feminine Mystique  They are essential touchstones to humanity  1984 by George Orwell is your classic apocolytic utopian novel  however is respectfully credited with the futuristic ideals the novel revolves around  such as  Big brother   betrayl of government  and population control through electronic media  Throughout the novel Winston is awaiting the revolution he realizes that the people are being lied to  However  the revolution never happens because Winston trusted the wrong people  This leads to a letdown at the end of the story  but stays as a prevalent significant and powerful reminded that if we don t govern ourselves first  someone else will  1984 is a fiction novel by George Orwell which is  at the time of its publication  based in the future  The book may be seen as a political statement or strictly entertainment depending on the reader  but the subject matter touches on political oppression  sexual repression  fear  paranoia  censorship  and power Orwell constructed a world in which there are only three political states in control  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  The state in focus is called Oceania  and it is an environment in which its citizens are under constant surveillance by the Party and its figurehead  Big Brother  To simplify the book and avoid giving too much away  the citizens of Oceania are controlled completely by the government  Their words and actions are constantly being watched via technology called telescreens  People can be arrested for literally anything that would be seen as an act of rebellion or even disproval of the Party  There are spies and police called the Thought Police specially trained to catch civilians in the act of Thoughtcrime  literally thinking anything negative towards the Party   Big Brother is set up to be a god  and Oceania has to view him as the perfect force in the world  Anything and everything viewed as positive in the world has come from Big Brother  The citizens are forced to believe and follow this society by being brainwashed through destruction of language to the point of elimination of thought  forced sexual repression except when needed for procreation  and the fear that at any moment a person can and will be taken away and literally annihilated from the face of the earth  On top of all these atrocities against humanity  there is a department of the government which literally rewrites history every day  changing any printed information regarding Big Brother and the Party in order to fit it to their agenda  The story follow a citizen of Oceania named Winston Smith  Winston knows that everything is wrong in the state  but obviously lives in fear knowing what could happen to him if he says or does anything that would lead people to discover his feelings  He believes that the Party will one day fall because the citizens would rise up and overthrow it  At the same time  Winston is struggling with history  his own as well as the world s  and wanting to find some connection with the truth  He does this by interviewing people who had lived before the Party took control and visiting an antique shop to find items from the previous world  Winston believes that there is an underground Brotherhood set up to destroy the totalitarian rule of Big Brother  though he cannot know for certain if it exists  The plot gives Winston s journey to discover if there is indeed an objective truth in the world and also his attempt claiming his own identity and place in history The book was honestly one of the most engrossing pieces of literature I have ever read  It is divided into three parts and builds up with an intensity that finally left me speechless at the close  The plot has so much detail and is put together so cohesively that I couldn t help but feel as though I was reading about a true historical event Overall  I was left with an understanding of why 1984 is considered a classic  It is a book that had gripped me from start to finish and made me feel the situations that occurred  When there was a moment of paranoia  I felt paranoia  When there was a moment of horror  I felt horror  The only con that I felt was the idea that the future world was set in a date that wasn t much farther in the future than Orwell was living  however  after finishing the book I completely lost that criticism because it s really not that important in the grand scheme of things  I recommend this novel to anybody  it is truly one of the best that I have ever read  The third part of the book was dreadful to read  Not because it was badly written  but because of the things it describes  By the end I wanted to hug humanity  It reminded me of the way the people that were  reeducated  in Romania said they didn t want a revenge  When reading other reviews I was surprised to see how many people think that in the end he was shoot  Although it is a very plausible ending to his life  in fact Winston was just dreaming with his eyes opened  One thing that caught my attention was  doublethink   Because I often see politicians acting this way  One day they will say one thing and the other day they will deny it  For example  in Romania we have more than two parties  Sometimes a politician collaborates with another party or a person  but after a while he says it never happened  Or what about American republicans  On the one hand they do not what gun control laws  because that would imply a breach of personal information by the state  Yet simultaneously they defend the NSA collecting all sorts of information  Don t they see the contradictions in the way they think about certain things  Or do they do it on purpose   The novel  1984 itself might need to be reviewed several times  in order to write a review on it  such is the breath taking imagination and complexity of the future created by George Orwell in his yet another marvellous piece Carrying on from where he left in Animal Farm  a satire on Russian Revolution   he presents a cold and chilling vision of a dystopian society where surely enough nobody wants to live in  A disturbing picture of the future is portrayed euphemistically in gory details The future presented speaks of a world of fear and treachery and torment which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself  It s not based on love and justice but on forgery where history is continuously rewritten  by the government  Big Brother  which is in ultimate control  George Orwell uses a perfect combination of irony and euphemism to highlight day to day falsification of the past  which were carried out by the Ministry of Truth and the work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love People lived in such a hostile society that nobody dared to speak above a whisper as they were under surveillance 24X7  And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract  undirected emotion which could be switched from one subject to another like the flame of a blowlamp  Winston Smith was one such fellow who had the fire in his belly and goes against Big Brother by having his own thoughts and a love affair  both of which were inevitable to hide Winston bears not only the physical torture of Big Brother s law force but also the battle within his own head  whether to stand his ground or give in  Just like Animal Farm  this astounding novel clings to the memory of every reader  It even goes one step ahead and forces them to think rather  doublethink  in order to understand  WHY  rather than  HOW  something is happening in their vicinity  kl Hrk  wkl klm  tqwm

period  I don t want to break this novel into chunks as I normally do as I feel it would ruin the experience  However  I will give a few of my views  Gorge Orwell perfectly depicted the  quite frankly  evils of a totalitarian government  The world  split into three vast states  Oceania  Eastaisa and Euraisa who are constantly at war  Through the technique of exploring his own views in Goldstein s novel  Orwell more or less points out that a world constantly in a state of war is actually in a state of peace  War has been redefined   designed by the parties of each state to convince its people that the other states are evil  against them  Thus  as a result the same strategies are often used  few actually die or are injured and being at war is the same as not being at war  Without war the states have marked borders  they control their people through harsh methods and with war it is exactly the same  In this war we would never see the massacres like in WW1 or WW2  Thus  war   peace Onto freedom   slavery  Orwell has quite intelligently pointed out that we are all slaves to death  that we are all slaves to our own minds  Big Brother and the Party  however  are eternal  Thus  if the people live  breathe  think and worship Big Brother and the Party they become part of the mass mind of the party  they too are immortal Ignorance   strength  I think that this goes without saying  If you read the novel this one is pretty straight forward  If you remain ignorant  perhaps like the Proles or several party members who have been brainwashed since birth  you will be part of the Party s mind   the strongest force at all  We see Winston   an intelligent individual who goes against the party   suffering  corrupted and humiliated  His mind is twisted from reality to fiction   he grows weak  ignorant  Therefore  ignorance is strength in this case So yeah  whilst I derived a lot more from the book those were the three main points that I think are emphasised in this novel over and over again  This novel is not only a wonderful story but it is also a lesson to all of us  Whether we believe in socialism or individualism Democracy is always best  We are the fortunate ones who never faced oppressions gone    Linkin park Wonderful read  Everybody should read this  5   lHrb h  lslmlHry  h  l bwdy ljhl hw lqw    lkh lkbyr yrqbk   sbw  lkrhy   lGrf  101   lHzb ldkhl    lHzb

julgamentos sem o devido processo legal  guerras  George Orwell imaginou  em 1948  um mundo sufocante onde governos tipo Hitler e Stalin seriam coisa de crianca quando comparados ao poder do Grande Irmao  o Big Brother Classico do que especialistas chamam de literatura politica  1984 traz um mundo aterrador  dividido em tres superestados que estao em guerra permanente  O objetivo da guerra nao e vencer o inimigo  mas manter no poder certo grupo dominante  As pessoas nao tem liberdade de ir e vir e  muito menos  de pensar  Em grande parte das residencias  um objeto chamado teletela  ve  o que todo mundo faz  O Estado detem a memoria  todos os registros do que aconteceu antes da chegada do Grande Irmao ao poder foram modificados e sofrem alteracoes assim que uma noticia  artigo ou opiniao entrem em conflito com as necessidades do momento  Nada havia alem do Partido   tudo se fundia e confundia num mundo de sombras no qual  por fim  a data do ano se tornara incerta  A coesao interna e obtida nao apenas pela opressao  mas tambem pela elaboracao de um novo idioma   a Novilingua   que impediria que qualquer opiniao contraria ao Partido fosse expressa  Trata se de uma colecao de vocabularios enxutos que condensa ou remove sentidos a fim de restringir o pensamento  Uma vez que as pessoas nao pudessem se referir a algo  isso passaria a nao existir  A palavra mais usada no livro  seguindo o novo idioma  e duplipensar  Seu significado corresponde ao fato de o individuo conviver simultaneamente com duas crencas opostas  aceitando ambas   Saber e nao saber  ter consciencia de completa veracidade ao exprimir mentiras cuidadosamente arquitetadas  defender simultaneamente duas opinioes opostas  sabendo as contraditorias e ainda assim acreditando em ambas  usar a logica contra a logica  repudiar a moralidade em nome da moralidade  crer na impossibilidade da Democracia e que o Partido era o guardiao da Democracia  esquecer tudo quanto fosse necessario esquecer  traze lo a memoria prontamente no momento preciso  e depois torna lo a esquecer  e acima de tudo  aplicar o proprio processo ao processo  Essa era a sutileza derradeira  induzir conscientemente a inconsciencia  e entao  tornar se inconsciente do ato de hipnose que se acabava de realizar  Ate para compreender a palavra  duplipensar  era necessario usar o duplipensar   O livro conta a historia de um funcionario do Partido  Winston Smith  referencia ao primeiro ministro ingles durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial  Winston Churchill  junto a um sobrenome comum no Reino Unido  Smith  que passa da indiferenca na sociedade em que esta inserido a revolta  Para ele algo estava errado  Faltava alguma coisa  Nao sabia o que sentia e tentava extravasar sua angustia escrevendo em um diario   sempre em um espaco fora do alcance da teletela  Se fosse pego  provavelmente se submeteria a Policia do Pensamento  que  sumia  com as pessoas  apagando qualquer vestigio de que elas teriam um dia existido  Tornaria se uma  impessoa  Com narrador em terceira pessoa  Orwell nos guia pelo caminho que Winston percorre na rebeliao contra o sistema  Chega de ser mais uma engrenagem  mais uma peca da maquina do Grande Irmao  Naquele contexto  as coisas eram como o Partido quisesse que fossem  Em um desabafo  o protagonista escreve em suas anotacoes   A liberdade e a liberdade de dizer que dois e dois sao quatro  Admitindo se isto  tudo o mais decorre  O Grande Irmao pode controlar aquilo que temos de mais intimo e particular  o pensamento  Para o autor  e o futuro  Um pesadelo  A metafora do mundo que estavamos  em meados do seculo XX  quando o livro foi escrito  invasao de privacidade  avancos tecnologicos a favor do controle aos cidadaos  a manipulacao da memoria historica  as guerras continuas cujo objetivo nao e conquistar territorios  mas manter intacta a estrutura da sociedade  Sera que o planeta em que estamos vivendo vai se tornar um 1984  Ou ja vivemos sob o olhar do Grande Irmao e ainda nao nos demos conta  mndh  n wq t  yny  l  Swr  lkh lkbyr ldhy kn yrqbny  nd shry y ltlk lrwy  wqd  lmt b n bh sr wlm  lmt  nh ttHdth  n mjtm  shmwly stbddy mtmthl fy Swr  Hzb l ymt llshtrky

riscrivere sistematicamente la storia  evoca partecipando alla vita   rigorosa successione di momenti coatti   la situazione dellInghilterra nel momento  Non un singolo aspetto  lasciato al libero arbitrio  Prima di essere increduli  leggete e vedrete con quanta maestria Orwell diede vita a un orrore plausibile  Tutti gli aspetti pi abituali di una vita decente sono controllati  ridotti al minimo o proibiti  Gli istinti pi ovvi incasellati  E degno di nota che perfino il cibo  reso volutamente scarso e di qualit mediocre o pessima  E chi giudica non  un gourmet ma un inglese medio  Il sesso  scoraggiato  tranne che per le classi infime  dove la trasgressione  incentivata ma sempre nelle forme pi degradate  Pure la musica e le canzoni sono ridotte a meccaniche ripetizioni di marce o di testi appositamente confezionati con macchine combinatorie  Il riposo  lozio creatore e gli incontri sono scoraggiati o proibiti  Nel mentre incontra Julia  I suoi pregiudizi  la sua situazione squallida e la generale proibizione di incontri affettivi fanno si che Winston la tema e pensi che lei sia una spia  come gi i bambini erano allevati ad esserlo  Winston mostra pian piano uninsofferenza strisciante e una ancora incerta consapevolezza dellinferno in cui vive  Winston si fa schifo  Poi Julia  a pagina 133  quando oramai siamo entrati totalmente nel mondo di 1984  con terrore iniziale di lui  fa avere a Winston un densissimo messaggio  il pi eversivo rivoluzionario e sedizioso che in quella societ si possa concepire e scrivere  due parole antiche  ti amo  La seconda parte  la loro storia damore  plausibile  seria  consequenziale e condivisibile  Quasi mai ricordata da chi cita 1984 se non con una nota di sciatta rapidit  Invece  per quale motivo noi dovremmo odiare quella societ  In base ad astratte nozioni di Libert  galit  Fraternit  Ci sono molte altre vittime del potere ma col quid pro quo  Julia e Winston non ci guadagnano nulla  si amano quindi si oppongono  Se loro non possono amarsi  una societ di merda e decidono di combatterla  Lintero romanzo si regge  in realt  su questo  Se il lettore trova la storia damore un po misera si mandi affanculo  Non me lo dica o glielo mando io  pi volte e gratis  se me lo dice in faccia lo picchio con la catena dellantifurto  La terza parte  lorrore  Scoperti vengono torturati fino ad abiurare se stessi e laltro  Molti fessacchioni di scarsa memoria o lettura millantata  riportano che lui la tradisce  Errore  Ognuno dei due lo fa  Molti altri ricordano che non si incontrano pi  Si incontrano invece e il reciproco tradimento li ha annichiliti fino a non pi piacersi  Pochi notano che in realt non si tradiscono  Che uno parli ed abbia forma umana  non dimostra che sia ancora un uomo o una donna  Quando si tradiscono non lo sono pi da tempo  Pur di non sopportare orrori senza fine non gli viene concessa nemmeno una fine orrenda  Il Grande Fratello  in realt una proiezione simbolica e un utile artifizio retorico  Il romanzo si reggerebbe anche senza  I fessacchioni lo citano come se ne fosse l ossatura  Contrariamente a quanto sostengono infine ulteriori fessacchioni  il romanzo non termina con la morte fisica di Winston che rischia permanentemente ma la scena non c   La struttura della Neolingua  in appendice  Il regime utilizzer come strumento principe di ideologizzazione una lingua priva dei concetti scomodi e delle strutture del pensiero libero  Unassoluta novit di Orwell  strutturata benissimo e che d definitiva patente di originalit al romanzo  Dei

umano da da faccia oscura della luna  da idrogeno liquido  da spazi intergalattici  Colonna sonora  Mulatu Astatke   the Heliocentrics   Inspiration Information I love the way he writes  He never assumes much about his reader and at the same time trusts them entirely to understand what he writes Either ways  the book was a great read  whether you take it as fiction or a political satire  There are so many things about this book that will probably haunt me for the longest time   You are the dead   Winston s turn at Room 101  the truth is what is collectively believed and not what you believe  despite of being right   and O Brian s and the inner party members   utter  complete and failproof belief in his lunatic view of the world  Not sure if pure power can really sustain itself that long  but the rat race of making more and more money has made current times come to a similarity that s striking and hence  really scary  As a side note  it s interesting to realize how  despite of belonging to the same race  man has the power to inflict extreme pain and torture on it s own kind and at the same time also has the power to endure it  Another classic I refused to read until way later than I should have  1984 has every aspect required to become an all time favorite on my shelf that also includes Burgess   A Clockwork Orange   Orwell s style of writing is beautiful  one of the few books I ve read where I often paused to write down sentences and phrases I particularly enjoyed  such as  It was not the man s brain that was speaking  it was his larynx  The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words  but it was not speech in the true sense  it was noise uttered in unconsciousness  like the quacking of a duck   While I was vaguely familiar with the story that is told in 1984  I was not ready for how utterly dark it is  The characters  their environment  and the overall atmosphere of Oceana and her inhabitants are described in great detail  painting a picture of despair that provides the reader a window for macabre voyeurism  My only con on this book   which isn t a con for me  at all  actually   is that the conspiracies mentioned throughout are all too real in our lives and in our society  often leaving the reader trying to apply the philosophies and ideas to their own lives  If you re a conspiracy nut  you have other issues to deal with  but for me  it was a great way to further understand and appreciate the thoughts of Mr  Winston Smith in his struggle  Every one of us is just like Winston  The question is  are we Winston in part I  or Winston in part III   mn   Zm lrwyt lty qr t   bqry un fdh  tlk lty j lt lktb ykhlq dwl an    bl  lman kmlan mn l dmkhyl br   wwSf qtlun lltfSyltHky lrwy  m n  wnstwn fy Zl nZm ldwl  lshmwly  lty ytr sh lHzb

first read this book in the late eighties  It is definitely worth a re read Counterintuitively  depending on one s own perspectives  this book is as relevant as ever  with the era of big data in the cloud and social networks  Big Brother  in all but name  is indeed watching us There is also discussion on the empirical method of analysis which has been the basis for advancement for modern society  and its erosion by the Party  In recent times  the advent of spin over scientific analysis has manifested itself in movements such as creationism and climate change denial   1984 is a book set in a police state London where the rights of the people are nonexistent   War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  and Ignorance is Strength  is the Party s motto which defines the very nature of the new government  The country is always in a constant state of war with the other two powers  Eurasia  and Eastasia  It s become illegal to even think  thought crime  as they call it  And all information is under government control  Patriotic stories are made up and history is constantly rewritten  A man named Winston  is one of those people who write these  Winston has a hatred of the party but always ends up falling back in line and conforming like everyone else  He has some fuzzy memories of what life was like before the party as a child  Something about nuclear warfare and the American take over of the British Empire  This is a dark world and a warning to what might happen if we allow it to  What I really like about this book is how it creates a whole world of a completely totalitarian government  It shows how the control of information  removing freethinking people  and how the endless propaganda keeps everyone in line  The people are trained to report on any suspicious activities  Even their own children can t be trusted as they are indoctrinated to loyally serve the party to the bitter end  It reminds me of how the nazis would put children into the Hitler Youth and were trained to uphold the principles of the nazis  That s another thing that I like about this book  Some of this stuff has already happened  From the Nazis to the Soviet Union this world has always existed  And as technology advances the easier it is to happen  I think it shows how just giving up your freedom for some protection leads to a dark world of oppression  We should heed George Orwell s message and  don t let it happen   Very interesting concept  Makes me wonder where society is headed  It is true that there are certain things that lead me to believe our government is trying to impose similar tactics  The Bush administration is always trying to cover up one thing or another  They want to be able to tap into people s phone lines if they  sound suspicious   It made me feel sad at the end  because I felt like there is no hope  that society as we know it is doomed  It made me sad that he wasn t able to maintain a little bit of reality and that he allowed himself to  turn to the dark side   I wasn t too disappointed that he betrayed Julia  but mostly because during the whole book I wished that he could find someone a little better  By that  I mean that she didn t really care about the whole spectrum of things  only what directly affected her life  I was a little sad when they met again  I wanted it to spark some feelings  I thought the whole concept of Newspeak was intriguing  It is true that with narrower language abilities  thought could be hindered  I had really hoped that he would join an underground society and it really threw me off that it didn t really exist  After reading the whole thing I can see how it would be almost impossible for a society like that to exist  what with the telescreens everywhere  Winston was right that the hope was with the proles  They were given a lot more freedom  The only chance of a revolution would be for a few intelligent proles to get together and form a secret society among themselves  After all the changes being implemented among the Party  the proles would end up more intelligent  They would actually be able to think and have their own ideas opinions  Overall  I really enjoyed the book even though it made me sad  The U of U play was also good  They rearranged a little of the order anda dded the weird people in the cell with him  It was well acted and it was cool that they had the lady get naked  I ve wanted to read this for a long time  but was never forced to in school and just didn t get around to it until now  It s an important book  Not only does it detail the dangers of totalitarianism  but also raises some really good questions about the nature of the past  Basically  if something happened in the past  and then all documentation was changed so that it appears to have not happened  and then everybody says it never happened  how can you be so sure you really remember it at all A brilliant book  if a bit slow in places  It s driven much more by description of the dystopian land of Oceania than by character or plot  If you re interested in the inner workings of the socio political landscape  you ll enjoy it  If you just want a fun little sci fi romp  this probably isn t for you All the same  I think it s a book people should read  The world of 1984 may seem overdramatic  but it is one plausible outcome of the gradual sacrifice of privacy and property in favor of governmental protection or the nebulous  common good   It s something worth thinking about  Indeed  that is perhaps this book s strongest point  it left me with an unusually large number of things to think about  That  my friends  is truly high praise for a novel  Note  Star Trek  The Next Generation totally ripped off this book in the episode  Chain of Command  with the five four lights thing  But Picard was a whole lot more badass under pressure than Winston  so they get points for that   Actually  I think I already read this on high school but Everything was so different when I went through this all over again  The big brother watching over you is kind of cliche in this time for us  especially of us in Korea While I was reading this with the book by popper  I wonder if Orwell started to build up the society of Oceania  by the exact situation which popper described as what Plato dreamed of I am not sure if Plato s perfect state in Republic is really in this way or not cause I ve never tried to read Plato   But maybe we could fetch more then that in the story  Totalitarian country controlling everything including the language and the inner thoughts of people is of course depicted in dreadful way  but I want to think and focus in the conflicting epistemology  which is  Winston smith s journey starts from where he tries to think  and write things down  which itself will not mean anything in reality  but the thinking  which he can logically find something out which is not conceived as real  that he can logically reach for rational facts  these are based on rationalism  But 2 2 becoming 5  by every means including everybody else who tries to reach that consensus and the historical background for it    which could be meaning exaggerated form of social constructivism eueum   hajiman

influence me day by day since it provides many factors limit mankind s thoughts  believes  interacting with individuals  actually it illustrates how danger it is to to communicate with even your parents    In other words  there are many details occurring similarly nowadays in many countries  Hopefully these countries would have a different end than the one the novel has 5 stars for George Orwell s fabulous narrating style    wHd  mn  jml lrwyt lty qmt bqrth    This story follows a man named Winston Smith  an ordinary member of the Party  the political group that is in power in the year 1984  The members of the Party are not allowed to deviate in any way from the Party s propaganda  even when they know it is a lie  Their very thoughts are policed to ensure the Party will remain in power  On the outside  Winston appears to be happy with the Party  but on the inside  he is most certainly not  However  because of the strict  and unspoken  rules  Winston can t rebel against the Party without being immediately killed  1984 tells the story of Winston s growing anger at the Party  and how he expresses his discontent The character development in this book was very strong  Winston goes from being just another mindless Party member to enduring physical and psychological torture in order to keep thinking freely  I found that the plot was not the most important part of the book  It was fairly basic  Most of the conflict occurred within Winston s own mind  The language was very good   not very surprising  seeing as the book was written in 1948  when educated people actually knew how to write well I gave this book five stars  I thought the subject was incredibly interesting  especially when paralleled to society today  Having read quite a few classics  I usually expect them to be slow  and at times  boring  but 1984 really pulled me in  I recommend this book to everyone  specifically high schoolers   1984 is a novel by George Orwell  The novel is set in the year of 1984 in London where the Party watches everyone who lives there  The leader of the Party is only known as Big Brother  His face is everywhere on posters throughout the city  There are telescreens that monitor every move each person makes  The Party created a new language to try to prevent political rebellions  Not only is doing rebellious things a crime  just thinking about it is considered a very great crime  The Party prohibits free thought  sex and anything that represents you as an independent individual  The Party observes everyone  they alter history and create lies about what happened in the past  They even create fake people to win lotteries and to take the blame for things  The main character is Winston Smith  He is a 39 year old man who lives in London  He is constantly monitored and watched every where he goes  Throughout the novel his hate for the Party increases  Winston illegally bought a diary where he would express his hatred towards the Party and write down his criminal thoughts  He meets O Brian  who Winston believes is a member of the Brotherhood  The Brotherhood is a group that is believed to work to overthrow the Party and its members  Winston works in the Ministry of Truth  where his job is to change history so it relates to what the Party say has happened  One day he sees a coworker stare at him  She is a beautiful dark haired girl who he immediately believes is an informant for the Thought Police   Winston starts to question what the Party said about Oceania and Eastasia had been allied in the war against Eurasia  Winston believes that he could think of a time when they weren t allies  He also starts questioning if Emmanual Goldstein is actually a real person  The Party said that Emmanual Goldstein is the Brotherhoods leader who is the most dangerous man alive  One day he met the dark haired girl again  She slipped a note into his hand which said  I love you   They arrange a meeting and she tells him that her name is Julia  They begin to have a secret relationship  They meet up in hiding places far away from the city to keep away from the Party who spies on everyone  Eventually they rent an apartment in the store where Winston bought his diary  He believes that they will get caught sooner or later so he decides to just go for it  Julia is a lot more optimistic  She doesn t think that they will get caught  While Winston is with Julia his hatred for the Party increases more and more   I believe that Orwell s message is that the totalitarian government of such as the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union is bad  He was afraid that the governments were going to take away people s freedom and human rights  He wrote the book as a warning to try to show what might happen if the governments move to totalitarianism   In my opinion  this book is a great book that you can relate to for some countries  It takes a look at how the world might ve become if the Nazi s won World War II  The plot twists are great and I found myself not being able to stop reading  I would highly recommend this book to everyone  It has a bit of everything in it   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows   With this simple argument  Orwell centralizes his book  It is a book that warns humanity of an impending menace that mankind is hovering into  It is an extraordinary script that will grip you from the first few pages till its last page  This negative Utopia book alters many of the well known standpoints of civilization and the progress of humanity on earth  It is worth to mention that Orwell argues about dehumanization of man which will represent the big threat to our existence on earth  Orwell s warning view of the future world is not meant to take a pessimistic reaction  but to warn humanity that there might still have time to save the humanity from impending in calamities of dehumanization of man  1984 lmD  lys lh wjwd md     hw fqT mHfwZ

the the creation of the laws which govern our land    Every record has been destroyed or falsified  every book has been re written  every picture has been repainted  every statue and street and building has been renamed  every date has been altered  And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute  History has stopped  Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right  I know  of course  that the past is falsified  but it would never be possible for me to prove it  even when I did the falsification myself  After the thing is done  no evidence ever remains  The only evidence is inside my own mind  and I don t know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories   If I am to describe this book with one word only  it would be  magnificent   It can easily get under your skin and send shivers down your spine  The whole atmosphere of the world of 1984 is bone chilling  it claws its way in your mind and invades all the corners of your thoughts  It stays constantly with you and that is not because it is breathtaking  but because it feels disturbingly real  as if we re already at the doorstep of making Oceania a reality but still wondering whether to enter or turn tail and run in the opposite direction I admit I haven t read many books  however  up to this point I have never ever stopped reading just to look through the window to think   wow  that s amazing   So that should speak enough by itself  It seems like this is the first book that has made me think about every single topic it touches  This is not your usual dystopian story  because there is no way out of this world  No matter how much you try to struggle  no matter how much you hate  how much you despise the government  there is no way out   even the supposedly existing revolutionaries do not exist  Or they do   in name only   their purpose being flushing out otherwise thinking individuals  The Thought Police and the torture inside MiniLuv do not create martyrs  they reshape the way a person thinks and even feels for himself  they destroy the person you are and rebuild you as a lifeless machine like creature  They build people who do not live  but simply exist for the Party  for Ingsoc  for Big Brother While reading I was definitely intrigued  but also baffled  disgusted  terrified  And I agree that everyone should read this book  Everyone  WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   1984 is a perfect representation of the 1950s anti communist mindset  Orwell s description of Big Brother and the history canceling  humanity stifling world of Oceania mirrors Soviet Russia  With the possibility of a world like Orwell s Oceania looming  it is easy to see why citizens in the 50s   80s worked so diligently to stamp out communism around the world  Even today  the Iron Curtain torn down over 20 years ago  1984 draws the eye to North Korea and other such countries where the lives of ordinary people are still censored and hidden from public view  Though Huxley s Brave New World is undoubtedly more relevant to present day America  1984 is still both a valuable historical reference and a fantastic piece of dystopian literature  It is both startling and heartbreaking  almost too real for the human mind to comprehend  Its perfect portrait of humanity in a world gone mad calls up certain unanswerable questions  What if Oceania were a reality  Would any of us be able to break through the all encompassing watchful eye of Big Brother   so the whole story goes like  here comes a candle to light you to bed  here comes a chopper to chop off your head           and then      under the chestnut tree  i sold you and you sold me          and the last four words    they were so surprisingly convincing    and CRUEL    the world the author created is cruel    no privacy    no trust    no love      every emotion on your face is fake    every word you say    everything you do    everything they tell you       everything you believe in    EVERYTHING IS A LIE   everything is fake     all the facts are lies    you fabricate them yourself    yet you have to believe those lies    and you end up believing them      you end up believing that 2 2 5    and you ll have no problem with that      and when you live in a world like that    you cannot even trust your own children    and you don t even have the chance to have friends     and if you ever think wrongly       you will be vaporized     you will never have existed          George Orwell s 1984 is an adult dystopian novel about the life of Winston Smith  a government official  who lives in a society controlled by Big Brother  a power Winston  who has been submissive to for most of his life along with a brain washed society  example  2 2 5   grows to hate Review I ve never read a book like 1984  Now a days there a so many dystopian novels that are almost exactly the same  the main character is a rebel that joins a group to fight the norm  has an unconventional love story  suffers a loss that changes who they are and goes on to defeat the powers at be  That is Tris s divergent nature  Katniss s and Peeta s love etc  Not that these aren t good books  in fact  because they create a world so drastically different from ours  these books are able to give their readers a wonderful  imaginative experience  But 1984 is different  The characters are complex  dangerous and beautiful The love is deep and forbidden Spoiler  The ending is not a happily ever after ending  It is sincere  It is realistic  It is raw and until the very last moment  I was on the edge of my seat George Orwell creates such an unimaginably complex and scary society  The concept of Big Brother is what scared me in the beginning but what he taught scared me even more  What stuck with me throughout the whole book and still fascinates me when I think about how people could actually believe it is that  War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is Strength  Overall  I LOVED this book and I would recommend it to everyone  Not just those who like dystopian novels or fiction but everyone because it truly is a great experience   This is one of the best books I ve ever read and it is quite disturbing I must say  This is those kind of books that will steal something from you or they will add something on you  so per say  I even fell it s quite hard to express what you get from it  but it s like one of those many awakenings you get from time to time  Orwell could create such a viable society based on the extreme of fear and hate with even a new simplified language that wouldn t drive you to think too much  and that was the main goal of this new society leaders  create a mass of non thinking persons  because they could even catch your thoughts and they would spy every single damn movement you made This is our society taken to an extreme  this is the result of people s apathy   Trying to explain this again  disturbs me one more time  all I can say it s that is very understandable why this is a classic of literature and that once you start reading this it s viral  you cannot really stop and you crave for more  I m definitely gonna read more Orwell soon   tstHq kthr mn 5   y jz lsny  n lt byr  n mdy rw   lrwy    hy lyst rwy  hy SHyf  tSf blDbT m SbHt  lyh lwD  fy bldn   lktb kn mtshy m ySfmsyHdth lbldh dh stmrt  ly wD h   ly lm nh kn ySfmsyHdth

relevant  Although our government is not exactly like the one portrayed in 1984  there are some disturbing resemblances  The most obvious example would be the documents released by Edward Snowden  Whether it s through a telescreen  a cell phone  or the Internet  technology plays a major role in how the government violates our privacy  Even the language of Newspeak resembles abbreviations used in texting  The Party s slogan   war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength   page 7  and the idea of doublethink resemble the mindset of some people  People speak of war being used to end violence  but it almost always is an act of aggression in which no side is blameless   Freedom is slavery  makes me think of people who argue that liberty causes inequity  as if equality requires a superior government to rule over people  The prevalence of the belief that  ignorance is strength  can be proven through a law of syllogism  if ignorance is bliss and bliss makes one appear emotionally strong in a perilous world  then ignorance must be strength  I have been told many times to  accept the things  I  cannot change   but I don t want to accept that I or others are being oppressed  I d rather change the things I cannot accept It is also said in the book that  freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  page 69    This is another way that 1984 relates to our current time  The government lies  and if someone tells the truth  they are called a traitor  Edward Snowden  anyone    Unquestioning obedience to authority seems to be of higher importance than doing what is right  and that worries me  If you are one of those corrupt leaders  remember those wise words you may have seen on the Internet   1984 was meant to be a warning  not an instruction manual  My only complaints about this book are bases purely on emotions and personal preference  But it s definitely worth reading  That is  unless you think it s an instruction manual  in which case  stay as far away from it as you possibly can and stop trying to take away our rights  tkhtlf rsm Swr  lmjtm  lmHkwm bnZm shmwl  f  dhhn kl qr lhdh lktb lkn lrbT byn lqr h  l fkr w ljm   l  aly  lnZm

1984 is a favorite of mine  I read it at a young age  having plucked it out of my older brother s bookcase without any idea what it was about  I remember that it chilled me to the bone  I d read mostly kids books to that point  and 1984 was the first  grown up  book that I read  I wasn t at all prepared for where it went  I ve since re read it several times and still find it disturbing A few years ago I had a discussion with a number of people when the topic of forcing students to wear RFID tags came up  A school district was proposing it as a way of keeping attendance and monitoring the kids  requiring the children to wear the tags hanging from straps around their necks  so that they could track them throughout the school using radio frequency readers  I was appalled at the idea  but even more shocked that most of the people discussing it seemed quite unconcerned about tagging kids like livestock The conversation eventually widened to include such things as national id cards and surveillance cameras mounted in public places  as is apparently common in parts of England  What concerned me more than the schemes in question was the attitude of many of the people participating in the discussion  which could perhaps be summed up as  since I m not planning to commit a crime  I don t really care if government watches me all the time  reads my email or can search my home without a warrant  etc The logical extension of such thinking is only criminals need rights because government by its nature is somehow altruistic  and an innocent person need fear nothing from surrendering his rights  I m not sure that anyone with such a naive belief     or with such a fundamental lack of historical knowledge as to the behavior of governments in the past     would truly appreciate Orwell s cautionary tale  They d probably point out that it was written to warn about the dangers of Socialism or Communism  but nowhere is it written that leftist governments have a monopoly on tyranny  With few exceptions  those in power will be tempted to increase their own power given the opportunity  Therefore  we should guard our rights jealously and view any attempt to encroach upon them with the deepest suspicion I m sorry if this isn t a proper review of the book  but that s what I learned from it  We read this for my Contemporary British Literature class and I was just blown away  Dystopian novels are apparently a trend in YA recently  but this has set a high standard and it s amazing Orwell has a really futuristic vision and I am amazed that he was able to produce a work like this in his time  The story is just realistically horrifying to me One of the things that interested me the most is the  Newspeak  that Orwell has created for this world  I studied linguistics  so generally  I learned that languages always obtain new words  thus widening its vocabulary  But in 1984  it is the reverse  How powerful and imposing a body of authority must be to be able to implement that kind of unnatural phenomenon I definitely recommend this to anyone  especially those who are into dystopian novels  I hope they enjoy this as much as I did  When I first read this book as a fourteen year old I was most struck by the terms  Doublethink  and  Doublespeak   Orwell had articulated my teenage observation that adults would often say things they knew were disingenuous or untrue so as not to  lift the painted veil   It is a sociological phenomenon that many humans will not voice   or even think   the contradictions and absurdities of everyday life for fear that they would disturb their carefully constructed existence  It was validating for me as a young man to have my observations about human interactions confirmed by an author who died a half century before  I also had a vague understanding that the book was a repudiation of totalitarianism Re reading the book as an adult with a through understand of political systems I am reminded of how incredibly prophetic Orwell was  He saw with utter clarity the dangers inherent in political movements  Animal Farm skewered the Communist Revolution and 1984 displays an advanced totalitarian system resulting from a Communist or Fascist revolution So much has been said about this book already that it is unlikely I can offer anything new  Orwell was both a political and sociological genius and his dire warnings about dehumanizing political systems are as relevant today as they were in 1948  I am grateful that he gave us metaphors with which we can expose government dysfunction and overreach I will mention that this actually a rather poor novel   rather it is a magnificent political essay with a narrative thrown in  hdh l ml mn  rw  m qr t    hdhh ltHf  lfny   d mrj  ry   whm ldrs  l nZm  ldykttwry   jwrj

dejado con el corazon en un puno  Creo que este libro no necesita comentarios  sino lectores que sepan apreciar su sabiduria  A mi me ha impactado    y recomiendo el impacto    I read a lot of horror books and often think of myself as desensitized  but this book is by far the most terrifying thing I ve ever read  At the start of the book  Oceania seemed like a horrifying world that I would never wish to be a part of  but by the last few words  it was more than that  It was a nightmare I never wished to have seen  It astounded me in every word of section three that this book was written in 1949  All of that being said  I am so glad that I read it  and am sure that it will stay with me for the rest of my life  I want to give this book to everyone I know and yet also shield everyone from it  There are so many thought provoking lines that I would have adored it even if the plot had not been utterly horrifying  This was the most beautiful nightmare I have ever had the opportunity to read  I would even venture to say that I  loved  every word  Interesting book     the story happens in a dark world  so dark it makes stories of alien invasion  demons taking over the world  and Armageddon like nice fairy tales    and yet  not very far fetched  You could almost believe it will happen Don t think it is something you read before sleep or in the bus     it is loaded with political  economic  and philosophic ideas    plus a lot of new vocabularies since it s a bit old  So it needs a lot of focus  The classic book is a dystopian novel  a book where the main character is wanting to break away from the oppressive government which spies on all citizens  The main character Winston Smith is watchful person at first wanting to join a rebellion group known as the brotherhood  He becomes more and more reckless whenever he meets Julia  a person who he dearly loves  Unfortunately  the political party in place known as the party  forbids showing an improper emotion displayed on the face  known as facecrime   thoughtcrime  and constantly is watching its citizens through a telescreen  The party controls the past with people having jobs to edit all previous documents that provide evidence of the party s lies  Winston Smith and Julia are caught by the thought police for conspiring against the party  trying to join the brotherhood   They are tortured and brainwashed into mindless drones that now love the party and all beliefs it stands for  This is an incredible dystopian novel  perfect for those who like dystopian themed books  Eric Arthur Blair  who used the pseudonym George Orwell  was a very influential writer in my opinion  I ve read this book at a young age with another masterpiece of him which was the  Animal Farm  Both of them were published in the  40s  the  Animal Farm  in 1944 and the  1984  in 1948 It seems that nowadays his writings are getting more and more actual  Sadly  He wrote the latter one in an extremely difficult situation  He was suffering from severe tuberculosis  and just had to face a new threat which was completely unacceptable for him  The Soviet Union The new standard  at that time  for a totalitarian dictatorship SO he wrote his novel in a very depressing period of his life First of all let s state the genre of the book  I would not call it a science fiction because it does not really meet the requirements of the above mentioned genre  Although it has some future tech related inventions such as the  TeleScreen  or the  Thought Police   I would rather call it a dystopian political novel The whole story takes place in London  in an imagined and terrible era where people have no rights  thoughts  no freedom of speech  You can t even say you love somebody except if you mean  The Party   The Party  controls everything  Literally  You have to attend their special meetings  show respect and willingness to their orders  Our protagonist Winston Smith is one of the many who works at the  Ministry of Truth   He is in charge for correcting newspaper articles  leaflets  book excerpts which contain information from the past  He has to rewrite these information according to the new doctrines  planned numbers which published by  The Party  He is just a small ant in the hill and in the beginning we can see that he is just like the others  Clapping  shouting like them at the public gatherings  smoking and drinking the same awful quality products  living in a weathered and dirty block of flats We can see the happenings around him through his eyes which makes the whole story even more depressing and tensious  but on the other hand much better As the story goes on we can see him slowly realising that something is really wrong deep inside the system and has to be changed He starts meeting with a girl from another department  Her name is Julia and she is a rebel just like Winston  Soon their relationship starts to bond even stronger  although it is not really based on mutual love  but rather hatred towards the whole rotting totalitarian system When they are captured by the  Thought Police  we want to stand against the system s will just like our heroes Their torture begins with the lead of O Brien  He is the one who embodies the system  He shows no mercy at all  he enjoys the whole terrible procedure At one time he orders his  minions  to take out Winston s teeth  tortures his body  treats him like an animal not a human being But soon we have to realise that it is impossible  Our volition is going to fall apar  our thoughts are manipulated and tortured just like theirs We have to face the saddening truth that one or two people don t stand a chance against the gears of such an enormous machine like the whole built system As a final chord we are forced to see that even their love is crushed like an old branch  When Winston says the sentence that he wants O Brien to torture Julia instead of him we can clearly see that their fate has been decided  their souls are emptied At the end we can see and understand how Winston feels  He sits in a cafe which he used to criticise in the beginning  He drinks the same awful vodka and plays chess just like the others who have been tortured already  It s like mere existince  agonizin  waiting for the end  This book is one of my all time favourite  Not because of it s cruelty  because it is not violent without a reason  It clearly shows that if we don t stand up and unite against totalitarism we can end up in a situation like theirs Nowadays his book is even more actual  because we live in a society where the  Big Brother  is watching every step of ours  where our messages  phone calls are recorded  where you unlock you password via your fingerprints  We decided to happily share every little piece of our private life on social networking sites We make our money transfers  our job related business deals electronically which can be easily surveyed by a third party The mass media shows only terrible and violent acts throughout the globe  tells only half truths  misleads people and generates a common enemy which can be the aim for our hatred  David Stuller I listened to the Blackstone Audiobook  read by Simon Prebble  via Overdrive  It was a perfect reading  and I recommend this version of the audiobook  It made for great listening while I worked out and worked in the kitchen I cannot believe that I waited so long to read this book  I never had it assigned in high school  and have filled my time with other books  In looking to catch up on some classics  I felt like I should check out 1984  and I am glad I did  It is a fantastic reflection on the power of government  and a staunch warning for us  as we continue to allow governments  schools  and other such institutions more power over our lives  Enhanced by Orwell s uncanny ability to create clarity and conciseness in his writing  the book was as much a sociopolitical expose as a novel Orwell s writing was able to impart knowledge of important and intricate concepts with its analytical style  but also to evoke feelings of real concern for the characters  safety  then disappointment in their decisions  and ultimately a harrowing sense of defeat Orwell s propensity for long ideological ramblings could become arduous at times  often seeing the book depart on long winded histories of some school of thought or the other  some childhood memory or the other    However  it was only upon reflection that I realised how much of the book was made up of non narrative writing and how much I learned from the book  and thus could appreciate how difficult a task it must have been to keep the writing interesting  I applaud Orwell for his didacticism  and I wish that more people would familiarise themselves with this book  Dobleplusbueno   ji ji ji sin duda una de las mejores novelas de todos los tiempos  un mundo no muy lejano en algunos aspectos al pasado   presente o futuro de algunos paises  al menos todavia nos queda la libertad de pensarCitas importantes La libertad es poder decir que dos mas dos son cuatro  Otorgado eso  lo demas viene solo   Ignorancia es fuerza  A traves del tiempo  desde la era neolitica  ha habido tres clases de personas en el mundo  los de arriba  los del medio y los de abajo  Se han subdividido de muchas maneras  se les ha dado nombres diferentes  su numero relativo ha variado de epoca en epoca y tambien ha sido distinta la actitud que han tenido unos con otros  pero la estructura esencial de la sociedad nunca ha cambiado  Incluso despues de revoluciones y de cambios que parecian irreversibles  ha vuelto a imponerse la misma estructura  Los objetivos de estos tres grupos son completamente irreconciliables  Los de arriba quieren quedarse donde estan  Los del medio quieren quitarle el lugar a los de arriba  Y los de abajo mucho de los cuales no tienen metas porque estan aplastados por las exigencias de la vida cotidiana  quieren abolir todas las diferencias y crear una sociedad en la que todos los hombres sean iguales     Guerra es paz  Una sociedad jerarquica solo puede existir sobre la base de la pobreza e ignorancia    El acto esencial de la guerra es la destruccion  no necesariamente de vidas humanas sino de productos del trabajo humano  La guerra es una manera de destruir productos que podrian ser usados para aumentar el bienestar de la gente y  por lo tanto  aumentar su inteligencia  Incluso si las armas no son destruidas  su produccion sigue siendo una forma conveniente de utilizar mano de obra sin producir un bien de consumo  There isn t much that could surely be said about this that hasn t already  but I ll try  1984 is near perfect in concept and has become hauntingly more poignant with each passing decade where what upon its release felt like an impossible fantasy now feels like impossible to imagine a world where none of it was reality  Whilst we don t quite live in this dystopia as it is  many of the problems and overt observation and attempt to control have become very blatant in today s society  Recent stories of people being arrested simply for a joke   opinion expressed on twitter   facebook reminiscent of Thought Police anyone   But this book s strengths don t lie in just how much it s managed to successfully predict  but in the narrative on its own merits  Although not as fond of the writing structure as I once was  the slightly stagnant style lends the appropriate mindset for the situation  the writing feels suitably controlled and almost stilted in descriptives   it s not the details that are important  but that they are any details at all  Not light reading by any stretch of the imagination  in fact I wouldn t be surprised if you could go several years without reading it through again  but the actual content  strength of character and the messages within lend it a strenght that does earn a purchase  And I feel there is no greater evidence in this statement than the fact that I used to own an Orwell collection featuring this  Animal Farm and a couple of others  and when it got destroyed I found myself going out and purchasing my second copy of this particular novel just for the time I would want to read it through again   I read this book when I was ESL student  I heard that this is a horrible story  when I was reading that  I thought they were right  How can people live in that ocean country which control the body and thinking of citizens  No people could have their own thinking and emotion  They even can not have love  because people have to betray their lover by government s forcing  Under the sky of ocean country  people have no freedom  they just can follow  eulogize their government  big brother  I also felt stressed when I read that terrible dictatorship  But jumping out of the novel  I really like this story that describes a special background  The writhing style of author is amazing  how could he has such wonderful imagination  recommend this book  Words like  Big Brother  and  Memory Hole  have seeped into our vernacular  thanks to this depressing  scary  critical  satirical  dystopian  novel  This novel is talking about themes like government surveillance of your every move  oppression and repression  the politicizing of sex and sexual relations  the power of media and propaganda in aiding an authoritarian regime and government sanctioned torture  which are very much relevant in our world  If you have not read this justly famous novel  I would strongly recommend that you do so  as soon as possible  I have to warn you though  it is very bleak and depressing throughout  with an ending that feels both like an emotional escape and a trap for the main character   it might be too depressing for some    but this is book not just depressing it is very enlightening in the sense that it forces us to rethink our actions not just as an individual but also as an group    how our action would affect not just us but others too and the consequences resulting from it    the image that the author is able to project in our mind is very vivid and frightening   a bleak future where we do not have a handle on our own actions   the possibilty that even our right to choose could be taken from us  And its not just our right to choose but even the most intrinsic human activity such as the ability to think     a future in which we can not even think as we wish is scary indeed     My thoughts while reading this book   A society where people s emotions are controlled by what the media  the government  the church wants them to believe  Hmmm     hasn t this always been the situation   Orwell s favourite thing to describe is depressing  dirty  smelly places with disgusting food and ugly looking  impoverished  frightening people   Imagine a cool sci fi version of this where the past is being constantly re written and people are being erased from history    oh wait  the British have already done that in Doctor Who   I can t believe how much of this was in Doctor Who   The whole  this is all happening  George Orwell was right  blah blah blah   etc    This is so frightening  I m probably going to have nightmares this whole week   The general state of depression I get in after every George Orwell book  WOW  I am absolutely stunned by this  This is terrifying  appalling and so toxic  i couldnt put it down  I ve wanted to read this for as long as i can remember  and i finally did  There are no words to express how much i loved it and how much the end only made it more sinister  All of the stars and definitely a life favorite  Full review on the blog soon   Throughout the book  all I could imagine was dim atmosphere  shabby apartments  controlled atmosphere everywhere and every person in factory clothes  Half way through  I was confident that the book will turn out to have a game changing plot  that INGSOC might be defeated  or perhaps the author had played my mind to make me believe so  But almost at the end  I had chills through my body  This is the second book of George Orwell I read and the ending has scrambled my mind like an egg   Pre Hunger Games  I stayed as far away from the dystopian genre as I could  Frankly  it scared me  And it s difficult to put into words WHY  but I could never start and finish any book that fell into that category  1984 was one of those books  It was only after reading a handful of YA dystopian novels that I was finally able to enjoy the genre and push my inexplicable discomfort with it aside  So naturally  I picked up 1984 as soon as I saw the chance  And it embodies everything that scared me about the genre to begin with It is not the characters I love in this book  it is not an intricate plot  or a sense of mystery and the burning desire to know more  It s the world  Very few authors  across all genres I have read  are able to construct a world as vividly and as realistically as Orwell has here  The politics  the language  the day to day lives are frightening  the constant sense of surveillance  of  Big Brother is Watching You  is claustrophobic  I wanted to put this book down  for once  I wanted to escape to MY world  to reality  and assure myself that society hadn t spiraled quite that far down yet  I read filler novels in between finishing this one because despite the manageable length of it  it wasn t an easy read  I found myself re reading pages  trying to grasp the philosophy of Ingsoc and finding no matter how many times I re read a paragraph  there was something horrific and new to come across every time A book has never made me more thankful that I am not part of its world  I have never cherished the freedom of thought as much as I do after reading this  Haunting  Absolutely haunting   pretty much the future of humanity  Yeah  yeah    I m late to the party The book is fantastic  It s so nice when a book  or anything else  for that matter  not only meets the hype surrounding it  but surpasses it One thing I found interesting is the fact that a lot of people take what the book is saying as a simply exaggeration  sometimes not even exaggeration  of some totalitarian regimes of our time but fail completely in seeing that a lot of it applies to our western civilization and culture We practice doublethink everyday folks  The edition I read has an afterword by Erich Fromm where he puts it better than I could  Books like Orwell s are powerful warnings  and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalin barbarism  and if he does not see that it means us  too   Plot Summary   SPOILER 1984 is about a man named Winston Smith who is living in a world that is ultimately a Utopia  but not the type we would normally imagine  It isn t perfect filled with love and peace  but filled with hate and censorship  nevertheless a  perfect  society  People listen to the government and love their leaders  However  there is a minority that exists and consists of people like Winston  People who realize that their society is warped  Winston goes about his life normally in the beginning  going to work  getting involved with the  two minutes of hate   following the crowd in whatever they did  Until he stumbles upon a shop that contains antiques  He find a diary which becomes Winston s  book of truth   Winston writes his thoughts and true feelings in this diary  After getting his real beliefs on paper his thoughts start to change  He starts to realize that the Party in charge of Oceania is in fact  evil   Soon after this his thoughts become actions  After going about thinking like this after a few months  he thinks that he is being followed by a spy for his  thoughtcrimes   However  this girl named Julia  is actually in love with him  They start to meet on various occasions to exchange conversation but it leads to more  sex   Julia thinks like Winston  They are both against the party  Julia believes that as long as she looks like she is  pro Big Brother  in front of other people  she can do whatever she wants in private  Her way of rebellion is by sleeping with Winston  In the midst of this sneaking around Julia and Winston do genuinely end up loving each other  even though it is expressed in secret and during their rendez vous s  After being together for a while  they realize that there are others that think and believe like they do  which leads them to getting involved with the Brotherhood  The Brotherhood is a minority that is against the Party  They never meet together  people within the group do not know who else is in the group  The only thing that binds the members together  is  the idea   The idea of hate  distrust  and disbelief in the Party  Winston knows a man named O Brien who is a part of the Brotherhood and gets both Winston and Julia involved with it  They both meet with O brien and are sworn into the secret society  Soon after joining the Brotherhood  Winston receives a book which is a manifesto of the Brotherhood written by Goldstein  the founder  While Winston and Julia are reading the manifesto in their secret haven  the thoughtpolice find out about them and they are both sent to the Ministry of Love for their  re education  They are both tortured and imprisoned in the Ministry of love for months  O Brien is in fact an interrogator of the Ministry and is not in fact their ally  he deceived them  Winston undergoes a long  painful  torture process that ultimately brainwashes him into loving  believing and trusting in Big Brother  Personal Response I love 1984  The plot was very slow to start and the introduction of their society was a little tedious but as it progressed it became riveting  The ideas and philosophies that are brought up can revolutionize the way a person thinks  My favorite part in the entire book is when Winston is going through his stages of reintegration  That entire section was probably one of the most intriguing dialogues I have ever read  The way that O Brien draws out the blueprint and foundations of their society is fascinating  The fact that the book is so different and mind opening is radical  I can feel the angst and frustration of Orwell through O Brien and the overall undertone of the story  There is one part of the book where Winston is reading Goldstein s Manifesto and I honestly think that the chapters within that manifesto is in fact Orwell s opinions on a totalitarian dictatorship fascist govenment society  George Orwell was alive during a time where where many of the world s ideals were collapsing  I can only imagine what it would be like living through an age of evolutionary thinking  The sheer creativeness  raw thinking  and different ideology makes this book very enjoyable  Small Tangent  While I was reading this book I could not help but be reminded about the movie  V for Vendetta   There are many similarties between the both of them  Quotes  But after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad  Being in a minority  even a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad    185  Sanity is not Statistical    186  We are the dead    188  Who controls the past  controls the future  who controls the present  controls the past    213   asking about where the past exists   In memory  Very Well  We  The Party  control all records and we control all memories  Then we control the past  do we not    214  It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world  however secret and powerless it may be  Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation    219  Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two equals four  If that is granted  all else follows    73  Under the spreading chestnut tree  I sold you and you sold me  there lie they  and here lie me  Under the spreading chestnut tree    70  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH    93   Two and Two make five    239  Do it to Julia  Do it to Juila  Not to me  Julia  I don t care what you do to her  Tear her face off  strip her to the bones  Not me  Julia  Not me    247  Room 101    243  He loved Big Brother    256       Nooooo     Uno lee 1984 y   la policia del pensamiento me persigue  I guess if you throw a little romance in  I m given to liking a story a lot better than normal  because normally I wouldn t read a book like 1984  The hero is part of a future society  where everything is controlled by Big Brother  a government who doesn t even like people to think nasty thoughts about them or they can be arrested  The hero manages to not only buy a diary in which to keep his thoughts  but find interest in a girl who secretly shares them  and have a sort of friendship with a high ranking official who claims to be working to take it down  but ends up as his torturer when he is discovered  I think this story does symbolically represent the way society is today in so many ways  With our internet  cell phones  credit cards  as well as so many other things our thoughts and behaviors are monitored day to day   When we exhibit behaviors that are outside of the recognized norm  they are subject to being judged  We can even be imprisoned for those thoughts and behaviors whether we did them or not  We are conditioned to hate those that seemingly don t do what we think they should in order to prove ourselves loyal to a government  religion  or whatever other institution that wants to control us  Ultimately what can we do about it though  Yes you can rebel but will it actually get you anywhere  That s what the hero learned at the end  I rated this story five stars because it made me think about the way things are  if only for a little bit  hl bmknhm ltHkm f  kl sh  Hwlk    wj lh ydwr km yHlwlhm    n m    tlk

dystopian fiction  no classic is bigger  no story more referenced  than this one  Orwell s Big Brother has not only inspired the name of the reality tv show that spawned a billion copies  it as also come closer to reality than even the author himself might have imagined In the introduction to Animal Farm  Orwell calls himself a socialist  And yet  he was always  or at least once the disillusionment set in  extremely critical of the so called socialist movements  He was strongly critical of the Soviet regime  even before it became popular to do so  And in this book  the  evil empire  that so often lies at the heart of dystopian worlds  is Ingsoc  short for English Socialism It all comes down to an idea being hijacked by those that are only interested in their own benefit  of a democractical thought being turned into a totalitarian one  Animal Farm deals with this directly  while 1984  in a way  deals with the aftermath  Here  the regime is truly total  for it not only controls its subjects actions  but also their thoughts  This is a frightening prospect and one that  or so one hopes  despite the constant surveillance most  free  people find themselves under  will never truly come to pass It is impossible to read this novel and not think about the ways in which Orwell seemingly predicted the future  This is the big reason for its timeless appeal  But there is more to it than that  The success of a totalitarian system in controlling the world  or at least a sizable chunk of it  seems much more unlikely today than it did in 1949  when this story was first published  despite the obvious parallels to our own developments the story shows  The threats that freedom  liberty  and all those other things we take for granted and lose constantly without even being aware of it  face have changed significantly  But the utter hopelessness of the situation the protagonist of this story finds himself in still feels familiar Where other dystopian classics  such as Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451  foremost in my mind for having recently re read them   offer ways out of the situation  this book never does  They offer hope and solace to their heroes  fledling and meagre as it may be  but for Winston Smith there remains nothing but acceptance of the situation and a despair so deep  he can t even feel it anymore  This is what makes the world of 1984 so bleak  and why it continues to appeal to readers of every generation  there is no way out What an incredibly hopeless message to send  What an incredibly true one  kutbt  m 1949 lttnb  bwqy   stHdth 1984 wlknh wSft m yHdth Hlyan fy  m 2013 This goes where Ayn Rand  where Alan More  where Lois Lowry would not go  the final and ultimate apocalypse of the human spirit  This is true horror  as we watch four become five  breathing human beings become non entities  and all things remotely human become perverted and twisted by the ever watchful eyes of Big Brother  And when you think Orwell couldn t possible shove the knife in any further  he does  Absolutely incredible  The author definitely has an exquisite style of writing  I have read the book quite quickly  Every single page is important and imformative  Not much have been changed since then  People who have a distinctive way of thinking are still under the pressure of masses  This situation is vividly outlined especially in post soviet countries  They will try to penetrate into the place where you hide that inner You  They will decrypt the code of the lock and change You  Unfortunately this almist always happens irrevocably  Even an ordinary book can hold your attention while you read it  It takes something special to stay with you long after you have finished reading it  By this logic  1984 is one the greats  There is a roller coaster of emotions  especially in the third act which made me squirm while reading  Completely different from what I have read previously  made me question everything from my sanity to reality  I highly recommend it  Although it might leave you a bit depressed for a while after you finish reading it though  Have you ever had a revelation that seems so obvious with hindsight that you re not sure if it was something you once  knew  but had long since forgotten I was thinking today about George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four Winston Smith lives in a world in which the larger than life Big Brother  who Winston sometimes doubts is a real person  is always watching   BB is everywhere and can apparently even tell what one is thinking   Winston and his lover Julia get naked in the scenic countryside where she gives him black market chocolate  the taste of which stirs thoughts that he was happier repressing   They rent a room where they believe they re free to talk without Big Brother and read aloud Goldstein s book of banned knowledge   The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism   Winston and Julia make love and wander around the flat naked and unselfconscious about it   They eat jam and their neighbour sings what she remembers of the nursery rhyme about now forbidden fruits  Oranges and Lemons  and on the wall of the apartment is a massive engraving of the Church of St Clement   It turns out that Big Brother has been listening all the time   there is a telescreen behind the image of the church   They are made to stand uncomfortably naked before the BB and the Thought Police before being forcibly removed from their haven and punished   Winston and Julia each blame and betray each other  but   in the end   at least they love Big Brother Since I studied this twice as a student and have taught it at least twice as many times as a teacher  shouldn t it have come up at some point that the book is a retelling of  Genesis    Because this afternoon  the idea struck me like a rat in the face            Uno de los mejores libros que he leido  de momento  Hacia tiempo que un libro no me emocionaba tanto  Ha sido  principalmente  angustioso y desesperante  Es casi inevitable meterse en la piel del protagonista  La impotencia que se siente  el destino escrito  esa perspectiva fatalista  Me ha dado tantisima rabia  que en parte lo he odiado  Ello ha hecho que me gustara mas la novela  porque estoy convencida de que esa era la intencion de Orwell  que sintieramos exasperacion  que nos enfadaramos  Obviamente  no solo genera frustracion  Tambien plantea multiples cuestiones  todas relacionadas con la filosofia   Cuan eficaz es la manipulacion que los medios y los poderosos ejercen sobre las clases mas bajas   Y si los datos que constan como historicos son falsos   Y si todos los acontecimientos actuales  politicos y sociales  son una farsa   Que tenemos que poner en duda de lo que nos cuentan   Que tenemos que creernos Me encantaria encontrar personas con quienes poder debatir estos temas  pues me suscitan mucho interes  Gracias  senor Orwell  por cambiar totalmente mi punto de vista respecto a todo lo que hay y por haber en el mundo  This is my first time reading a book from George Orwell and I already like this author  He makes it easy for readers to feel for the main character in the novel  Winston Smith  who encounters a variety of treacherous and suspenseful moments in the totalitarian society of Big Brother  He provokes certain feelings from his readers by using universal references and analogies that apply to the multiple scenarios Smith experiences  Not many authors can write about a totalitarian government AND keep readers at the edge of their seat  I further recommend this book because the concept of Big Brother is not too far off from how governments used to run their country over the past century  In fact  two governments in the 1900s ran their country similar to how Big Brother ran Oceania  Adolf Hitler killed people who spoke out against him from 1933 to 1945 when he was dictator of Germany  and Joseph Stalin killed millions more of those who threatened his power than Hilter when he was the leader of the Soviet Union  All in all  Orwell gets you thinking what it would be like to live under a completely authoritarian government through the eyes of an average civilian  Who knows  there may be a time when we live with telescreens watching our every move   This was just as wonderful to read the second time around  With my prior knowledge  I noticed even more little things that Orwell did throughout the book  and it really reinforces my belief of how wonderful an author he is  V tazi kniga preotkrikh minaloto  vidiakh nastoiashcheto i prozriakh b deshcheto  Spored men  chovek triabva

breaking and genre redefining  It s like an alternate reality that could have taken place  had certain post World War 2 events been different  A very possible and a deeply disturbing alternate reality  A world  where even free thinking is a serious offense  let alone free speech  A world  where the children are conditioned to admire and support a Fascist government  through clever propaganda  A world  where free thinking is punished by erasing a person s existence  Not just killing them  but erasing every trace of their entire lives  rewriting history  The most unnerving part is that much of what Orwell wrote in the book  was inspired by real history in certain countries  In the end  to merely label Nineteen Eighty Four a science fiction  is an insult to this timeless literary masterpiece  This should be taught in schools  so that mankind never has to face the grave and hopeless world portrayed in this book   t ryf 1984 ljwrj wryl h  rwy  sysy  ttHdth  n lnZm  ldykttwry  wlyt  mlh w

this made me think of so many things in detail  I would highly recommend it  There were a couple of sections that were hard and a little boring to read  but the book in its entirety was absolutely fantastic   I was around in the 80s  and I don t remember 1984 being anything like this  In fact  it was much worse  Bad hair  bad fashion  cocaine  synth drums and keytars  neon everything  VHS  the list goes on and on  Maybe growing up in England was different  Either way  I think they got it pretty good  Much better than my 80s experience  Quite possibly the best book I have ever read  I practically devoured 1984  finding it hard to put down would some time re read the same passage or couple of pages to really sink into Orwell s portrayal of a dystopian decade  I see other reviewers comments about Orwell not being that good of an author  but I beg to disagree  His language is different than that of other authors who published books in the 40 s and 50 s  I ll give you that  but considering his outstanding portrayal of the human mind and Winston s utter belief in humanity was  to me  breathtaking 1984 was written antecedent to its given year  In fact  what Orwell has served us is a futuristic dystopia which was written in 1948  subsequently published in 1948   Parallels can very well be drawn from the previous world wars  the second one just about finishing as Orwell set down to write his novel  It is hardly just a work of fiction  read for ones immediate enjoyment  At the same time as it s a struggle for humanity in a world of censorship and control  it s a love story  it s a proclamation of justice and injustice  it s a political controversy  it s philosophical and pseudophilosophical theory  it s all of this and so much more In 1984 Oceania is ruled by a totalitarian government acting under the political ideology of Ingsoc  where its Party members are under constant surveillance of telescreens displaying the face of Big Brother  Our story takes place in Airstrip One   it s a place of continuous raging war  changing between Eurasia and Eastasia  Oceania has always been at war with only one of them   review unfinished  to be continued  Hakkinda o

que hare jamas  Primero porque 1984 es un clasico de calidad pura  segundo porque me gusto tanto que se me dificultara ser objetivo y tercero porque es tan complejo y completo en su historia que es dificil no soltar spoilers  Pero me aferrare  o intentare  a mi politica de  Cero spoilers  y sere firme Todos sabemos de que va 1984  Ese clasico que es referencia de toda distopia actual  Un libro que sabemos que tiene gran calidad sin ni siquiera haberlo leido  porque las masas lo dicen y reiteran mil veces   Aunque el criterio de las masas ultimamente viene de caida  y Divergente es un claro ejemplo  Entonces mejor no fiarse de ellas Pero el mismo libro nos confirma eso desde sus primeras paginas  Cuando lo inicie tenia mucha expectativa  no queria salir decepcionado de un libro que prometia gustarme mucho  Pero a los 10 minutos de lectura ya estaba totalmente satisfecho con lo que leia El libro es protagonizado  y a veces narrado  por Winston Smith  Un miembro del Partido Exterior que trabaja para el Ministerio de la Verdad  Hace anos una semilla de rebeldia fue plantada en su mente  y es ahora donde parece que esta empieza a echar raices  Ahi inicia nuestra historia  en conocer como es aquella superpotencia que manipula y vigila constantemente a las ciudadanos  llamada Oceania Tanto la historia como los personajes resultan sumamente complejos y completos  En ningun momento sentimos que los personajes son desechables o incongruentes  Orwell se encarga de mostrarnos aspectos tan correctos y completos de la psicologia de cada uno  que logra construir unos personajes muy memorables que perduraran en nuestra memoria durante una gran cantidad de tiempo  Lo mismo sucede con la historia  Tiene bases firmes y no tambalea en ningun momento  Explica absolutamente todo lo que necesitamos saber  y un poco mas  para entender el mundo en el que viviremos mientras leemos  Al acabar el libro nos sentiremos satisfechos por la gran complejidad y minucioso cuidado con el que el autor desarrolla la trama  sin necesidad de dejar cabos sueltos que nos den la impresion de que el libro pudo dar mas de si Ademas la misma da giros imprevistos  sin resultar inverosimiles  que alcanzan a sorprender mucho y nos hace querer seguir con la lectura hasta el fin  Junto al ritmo agil que mantiene  gracias al estilo que tiene el autor  y una perfecta ambientacion  1984 nos sumerge de lleno en un mundo desolado de humanidad  realista  crudo y desmoralizador  Es increible que un libro tan viejo resulte siendo tan innovador respecto a los libros actuales que tienen la misma tematica  Sin aferrarse a esos cliches clasicos de la accion  nos logran dar momentos trepidantes donde el corazon se nos acelera a mil y nuestros sentidos literarios se ponen alerta a cualquier inconveniente que pueda perjudicar al protagonista  Con una historia rompe esperanzas  un ritmo endiablado  unos personajes solidos y una profunda critica politica y social  1984 se vuelve un libro imprescindible para todos aquellos que se consideren lectores asiduos o para las personas cansadas de la simpleza de las distopias actuales  Con plena certeza podemos asegurar que Orwell nos dio uno de los mejores libros de la historia  el cual sin duda marcara un antes y un despues en la vida de quien lo lea PD  Si tienen la oportunidad  lean el manga  que tampoco tiene desperdicio alguno  There I was  at the pub  No pints  points for challenging the credulity  is there  Trust me  I was at the pub  Some nice enough gent was talking about the barbecue place he had opened up the street  I was half listening and half thinking  I NEED to try this man s brisket  That isn t code  He glanced down at the bar and saw 1984  He offered  oh  you re reading that again  Everyone at the public house assumes I ve read everything  Jesus  I hadn t  I was a Winston Smith virgin  in fact reading it in tandem with my wife  While I never accessed the brisket  this encounter proved to be a corner of affairs  I doubt a week goes by when I don t think about this novel  I ve read it twice since then  i think about Room 101 incessantly  Here s to victory gin and my favorite opening line ever   It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen   I read this book coz it was mentioned somewhere as one among the top 50 books of must read  And also because I loved Animal Farm  In nutshell  I opened it with lot of expectations  It turned out to be much more than My expectations The story revolves around few vicissitudinous years of Winston Smiths life  in totalitarian world  Winston works in the Ministry of Truth  in London  in the nation called Oceania  Ministry of Truth alters the history of events and everything happened in the past which doesn t hold true today  or is not beneficial for the Party  The leader of Party  the omnipotent Big Brother is watching everyone  everywhere  People are being spied by their own children  monitored 24x7 by cameras and even the raise of heartbeats can be picked up which is enough to raise suspicions of conspiring against the Party  in alliance with the Emmanuel Goldstein  the leader of the rebellion against Big Brother  Every act of individual is perceived as threat  The routines of people are drawn such that they are left with no time to spend on themselves  on expression of being someone different  well  we call as freedom  Though the party members are governed this stringently  the common ones  called Proletarians  or Proles  are left without any control  They are the masses  Authors explanation to this lack of governance on Proles is that they are incapable of decisions and acts which can bring revolution enough to cause downfall of Party  Among lot of parallel facts between our civilisation and Orwell s dystopian world  Winston Smith  who is thoughtful and has left with enough brains to acknowledge individuality  is though timid  breaks as many rules as possible  He purchases diary and pen  has illegitimate relationship with Julia  rents a flat on old antiques shop  Julia  another party member  from his workplace is  in contrast to Winston  is bold  confident and sharp  She s the one who initiates the relationship between them  She seeks hideouts for their meetings  gathers black marketed stuff  hates Party and dares conspiracy with Winston and O Brien  O Brien is a party member who might have been a rebel once or maybe a spy who plays against rebels  one never knows  But he is the one who helps Winston to commit crime against Party  Crimes more than the thoughtcrime Winston already committed  He hates Party rules and Big Brother and when message arrives  meets O Brien  O Brien takes them both to his apartment and indoctrinate them to Brotherhood against Big Brother  But before than Winston read the manifesto of brotherhood he is betrayed to capture by thought police  in his rented flat  The owner of flat is a spy of Party  Comes in between the journey of Winston and his fears in the jail of Party  At last he is taken to the Ministry of love and then to the much dreaded Room 101 and meets O Brien  in the room of light  He goes under severe physical and mental tortures but it s the mind hack of Winston what makes user cringe  In the end he betrays Julia by saying  not to me  do it to Julia   The love  loyalty is given up  the morals are broken  the hate is converted into love for Big Brother  There is reason why the book is banned in Russia  The totalitarian world imagined by Orwell did not come into existence in 1984  We are not yet sure how much control of human mind can be gained by tortuous procedures  I wish it s better if we never know  The control today s media has on masses is itself enough to tackle with  We lie in Proles section of Orwell s world  The twisting plot  the strong  well developed characters  sequences and the complete inexperience in such world keeps reader going on  At some times it becomes racing while others it s exploring a possibility of our scary future  One can t stop wondering can it happen  What will I do if I d be Winston  That s mark of every successful story  of course  But we can relate easily is due to the fact that Winston is nothing but every one of us  We love freedom  We want freedom so what if to surrender to our believes  The analogy to current world is superb  the epitomes are wonderful and even the little facts are worked upon to apex  The example being Ministry of love where torture takes place  the truth hiding ministry of Truth etc  the repressive ways of freedom among many of them  Yes  it s must read for everyone who think of himself as an individual  who d hate such totalitarian world  I mean everyone  I was not well when I read it and there came few incidents which weighed to much to tire me  The thoughts could be so draining  I never had imagined  The rat incident   I rushed through it  not able to bear  Not everyone will experience it same but the book enters your mind  that s for sure  That s for my five stars  1984 is as devastating  as stimulating  as simple and complex  as thought provoking  as when I first read it as a teen  The final chapter  a small essay on Newspeak  which I undoubtedly skipped with the impatience of youth  has interesting implications  Rather than being written from George Orwell s perspective  in his present  it is written from an historical perspective  from a not too distant future in which the all seeing  all controlling all powerful totalitarian Party  which seemed a psychopathic state so implacable and unstoppable to Winston Smith  has been defeated I want to read that book  in which the Party and its seemingly unrelenting  psychopathic  true believing functionaries like O Brien  are defeated  I want to know how  I want to know why The implications of a Newspeak that enriches  that expands vocabulary  rather than destroys it  that generates ideas  rather than limiting  also has intriguing possibilities If there is one book that must be read  this is it   Superb  thought provoking  and worrisome  Overall much better than I imagined it would be    So it ended     He loved Big Brother                                            This is my 2nd read to this Master Piece   First in Arabic  10 years ago  and now in its native language After reading it very slowly this time   contemplating on every few phrases    making mental comparisons of how the world is becoming so close to the nightmare that Orwell has imagined    trying to feel all the type of horrors   tortures that Smith went through until he changed completely and loved the Big brother    to care less about anything    both Smith   Julia met but to express their hatred and betrayal    that was deep  heart aching and at the last few pages I wished it never ends Describing Orwell as being a genius is not an exaggeration at all  He didn t manage only to illustrate his deepest fears of the future and how the world will look like  but he also managed to write it very early in time  written in 1948  and considered one of the early novels in Political Fiction literature genre and one among the best 100 of all time novels    I couldn t help but comparing it to  Fahrenheit 451   Which needs another re reading   at least Ray Bradbury managed to give us HOPE    his novel s characters survived  each one representing a complete work  i e  The Bible  the Iliad   etc    But ofcourse the objectives of both novels were different as Bradbury wrote it in the McCarthy era where censorship was a sever weapon  while  1984  is a legend in its own Are we going to live in 1984 world  or we are living it everyday without even realizing it                      2 2  5Freedom is Slavery I betrayed you   she said baldly  I betrayed you   he said He loved Big Brother                    In honour of tonight s performance of Star Wars  So this is how democracy dies  with thunderous applause  1984 is a chillingly dark  dystopian novel  terrifying in its edgy visionary portrayal of a warped and sadistic utopia  Given it s bleak and harrowing theme  I should have been depressed and disillusioned but instead I found this to be one of the most gripping and thought provoking dystopic novels I ve read  yes even more so than Huxley s Brave New World  with Orwell s resounding message overcoming my initial reaction  to stir to life a gradual awakening  This novel  set in post WWII Europe  has three main states called Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia and although they have the same ideologies they remain perpetually at war with one another  The population of each of these states are constantly controlled  monitored  manipulated and where necessary eradicated  This novel superlatively demonstrates how psychological and physical manipulation is utilised perversely by these states to control the populace effectively  Within the novel the universal language of   Newspeak   has dramatically replaced English  with Big Brother restricting the amount of words permissible and therefore preventing the population from raising their voices in dissent  The significance of freedom of expression is emphasised by Orwell to outline that any modifications of language by governments can inevitably result in a loss of civil liberties  Control is the overriding theme which flows from beginning to end  through every chapter  and Orwell prompts us to ponder how we ourselves are gradually being dominated and controlled and in turn how we now implement those same ideologies on others  In this distorted utopia  every aspect of an individual s life is disciplined by the state  eating  drinking  speaking  marriage or even thinking  This to ensure infinite compliance so that all individualism is oppressed It may be argued that in our democratic  modern  western and laudably civilised society  this dystopian ideology will never be able to gain a foothold  and therefore  1984  is one man s paranoid vehicle of dissent  However  I would counter argue that the world depicted in this novel is already one which we inhabit today but the irony is  much like the people of Oceania  we have become gradually too brainwashed to liken the people within its pages to ourselves  The three main pivotal quotes from this novel     War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Stregnth    although contradictory statements  are nevertheless appropriately true when applied in context to the core of the state s dictates  The first quote  War is Peace    is a cogent tool administered by Big Brother to steer the populations anger towards an unseen enemy rather than towards the state  The focus of the masses is then pinpointed away from the squalor of their reality  and their personal frustrations and anger are then redistributed and vented towards an unseen enemy This similarity is prominent today in the manner in which our governments have deviated our attention towards the troubles abroad  rather than focusing on the internal problems of our own  Entire regions are now destabilised  with propaganda and fear galvanising us in to actions we may well have erred to implement  Conflicts against nations   who posed unreal threats previously to our national security  have now resulted in entire regions becoming hot beds of terrorist activity The phrase the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few is personified in the quote  Freedom is Slavery   and signifies the need for the people of Oceania to relinquish their will for the greater good of the parties goals  In so doing they are then part of a collective rather than individuals with the ability to question the states moral  social and lawful rights over them  which then permits it to command and subjugate one collective group rather than individuals with differing perspectives  therefore nullifying the possibility for change  This is relevant more so now than ever before  for when we have governments who are only willing to deal in absolutes and the world around us becomes an every permanent canvas of only black and white  I must question why I am not able to choose a wonderful  less threatening grey  Finally  in the quote   Ignorance is Strength    lies Orwell s incredible genius in highlighting how the masses of Oceania genuinely believe their happiness and strength remains in being ignorant of Big Brother s activities  both internally and externally  They are happy to accept the lies and manipulations exercised against them  as this then ensures a lack of action required by them to challenge the status quo  thus ensuring the states overall complete autonomous control  Orwell magnificently opened my eyes to the dangerous nightmare that we  as a society  are sleepwalking into  We have permitted our governments to feed in to our emails  and our phone calls   We have CCTV cameras on every street corner in every town in every city and yet we remain mute because  much like Orwell s dystopian society  we are allowing for the erosion of our civil liberties to live under the cloak of a protection  which is a fallacy  I will further add that the elements of  Newspeak  present within this novel chill me  as I find great similarities between that twisted elimination of words to control the masses  is no different than the politically correct ideology we are forced to adopt today and how words are used artlessy to twist and manipulate us all  Another worrying facet is the perpetual war that is used to hold the people in fear and yet at the same instance elevate them to feelings of accomplishment  after all their greater sacrifices and poverty should be a burden they should welcome  shouldn t they  In their poverty lies their success and their devotion to a greater good  yet look around  isnt that what we have at present How many of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fight a religious rivalry which has spanned over years  decades and a milenia  What is the end game  And why have we stopped questioning  I ll tell you why  because we are all plugged in  Willingly to our ipads  laptops  and just in case those failed in fixating our attention  we have our hand held mobiles  to stream us every useless  extraneous piece of drivel in case we awake and decide to pull the plug  Its lunacy but this book has become the byword by which we are being controlled globally  yet ironically  I sincerely doubt that was ever Orwell s intention 1984 is a cautionary tale and one that we should heed  as it forces us to consider the dangers of giving anyone total power and control over our lives   otherwise democracy shall die   Hands down  one of the best dystopian novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading You won t understand this really unless you ve read the book  There are tons of reviews already  so   high school reminiscence time  To Myself I just finished the last work of the day  It seems that there is always more and more coming now that Hate Week is on its way  The fiction department is a nice place to work at  but so hard to keep track of sometimes  I have to be the perfectionist and this is the only way to outsmart them  I have to continue being one of their little  pure  women  It feels like everything is spinning out of control and I have to maintain my balance with a letter or journal of some sort  I ve managed to steal some paper and ink from my department  so I hope that maybe one day  someone will know my story I have not been able to contact  W  in a while  it s been a week and I really need him  I need a release  because all of these activities are overwhelming  He s such a dear and I feel comfortable in our hiding spot  I still feel the need to change it seeing as how we go there so often  but he seems to adore the place  We treat it as a home rather than a hiding spot  I ve been with other men before  but never one to be so against the party  I actually think that he believes in the Brotherhood  as if something like that could ever exist in this world  The only think they spread is lies  I bet there isn t even a war going on  just rocket bombs for the sake of frightening others Sometimes he gets boring   W  I mean  He was chattering no and on about his mother one time and I tried not to fall asleep  I like him when he s not talking  less talk  more action  He may be a little on the older side and he may not be physically attractive  but he s good enough to make me feel good  I ve exceeded pleasure before  but it s so hard lately to find a man that doesn t abide by the rules  They are such cowards and yet I know that they can t help their human nature  Some men can t go on living with the thought of just human sexual contact  I say that as long as you re safe and have many hiding places  then it s okay  The thing is not getting caught in the situation I ve always been good with planning and making sure that everything is done the right way   W  leaves me to do all the work because of my dedication  He keeps talking about the future and such  but I don t really care much for it  Though  I m starting to believe in what he says  I m starting to believe that time is running out and it s quite frightening  I m not sure if anyone will ever read this  but I felt that I should express my feelings slightly  Anyway  I won t mention much except for how I feel  I ll probably end up destroying this anyway Sincerely J This novel is doubleplusgood   l  lrGm mn qsw  lrwy  wZlm lstbdd bd  wrwyl ym bd  fy wSf wtHlyl l nZm  lshmwly  lmstbd  wk nh yrh r y l yn   rwy  ry    bHq Sono passati parecchi anni dalla mia ultima lettura di questo libro  ma ricordo di averlo preferito assai a La fattoria degli animali  e nonostante il tempo trascorso la mia opinione non e cambiata Lessi La fattoria degli animali per la scuola  e di quello non rammento assolutamente nulla  a parte l idea netta della cancellazione di ogni speranza  che  ricordo debolmente  da un certo punto in avanti mi disgusto  Mi diede una sensazione orribile  Parlo di sensazioni fisiche  dopo averlo letto capii come si deve sentire un insetto inghiottito da una pianta carnivora Anche 1984 cancella ogni speranza  intendiamoci  a meno che non si tenga conto di una mia piccola teoria che comunque e completamente esterna alle intenzioni dell autore  ma questo l ho letto due volte  e penso che prima o poi lo rileggero una terza  Le ultime pagine sono spiazzanti  ma in 1984 trovo qualcosa che mi attira   Alla fine del libro  l unico barlume di speranza mi veniva come dicevo da una teoria tutta mia e che quindi era un intervento del tutto esterno alla volonta dell autore e non derivava da cio che avevo letto  e cioe che tutto e possibile fino a che qualcuno sa cantare Certo  anche la donna che stende i panni  che pur sembra libera  in realta non fa altro che cantare le canzoni create dal partito Pero canta  Il che significa che prova il desiderio di cantare Questo era il fulcro della mia teoria  non tanto che cosa cantasse  Lo so  e una teoria stramba Ma e una teoria  Mi spiego  di teorie in La fattoria degli animali non sono riuscita a formularne  Il che significa che non sono riuscita a intervenire nel libro  E per me intervenire nel libro  anche solo come spettatrice che si muove per il paesaggio che si dipana nella narrazione  e essenziale  In La fattoria degli animali ero spettatrice  ma in ceppi  in 1984 scivolavo inesorabilmente lungo la corolla del fiore  ma in La fattoria degli animali ero intrappolata in una sostanza vischiosa che mi impediva di respirare e mi entrava in gola Comunque sia Tolte le estremizzazioni distopiche  1984 non rispecchia poi cosi male la societa odierna  almeno in potenza Se si considera solo per un momento la cosa  non si puo fare a meno di notare quanto sia semplice controllare chiunque di noi  telefonate  e mail e conversazioni possono venire facilmente controllate  cio che io sto facendo ora  mentre scrivo questa recensione  puo essere controllato con una semplicita estrema Qualunque cosa puo venire facilmente controllata  in effetti  e si puo ascoltare una conversazione singola in mezzo a una folla  ci sono punti o a volte strade intere dove le telecamere possono registrare ogni tuo singolo movimento  anche se il piu delle volte non funzionano  soprattutto quando vengono commessi crimini proprio sotto il loro occhio elettronico   basta aprire Google Earth per vedere se il tizio che vive a due strade da te ha messo un altalena in giardino Pubblicato per la prima volta sessantaquattro anni fa  1984 ha la terrificante proprieta di poter fungere ancora da monito  e credo che continuera a farlo ancora per molto  molto tempo  stopped reading this book for a while  but as soon as I got back at it  I couldn t stop reading  it is fascinating  an incredibly and scarily detailed dictatorship that can change the whole world  controlled masses  no freedoms  but again  what do we mean about that philosophically       what is impressive    G Orwell was a visionary  is this book was ahead of its time  maybe not  because maybe the world somehow always took a cyclic road  events that occur are similar  the changing is in the decor   more or less    it s crazy to see that a lot of paragraphs that I high lighted  I can apply them today on societies   well   societies    around the world today  including mine  I encourage anybody to read it   After reading a classic such as this novel  I find it of the utmost importance not to make a mess of reviewing it  Not for any particular reason  since a total of one  maybe two people will probably even read this   It is for that reason that I ve waited until the book has passed into my long term memory before beginning The first thing I feel I must get out of the way  is that this book is not a happy book  It is a dull  dreary book  more akin to a nightmare than a fairy tale  Beginning from the first page I was left with the impression that there was nothing good in the world in which Winston lived  But as the pages became chapters  I began to hope   A dangerous emotion when it comes to this book  as all who have read this will surely know  Without giving any of the plot away  I will just say this  This was a delightfully devastating book  Upon finishing this book  I felt like someone had dipped his hands in molten steel  plunged it wrist deep into my chest  and then ripped out my heart  arteries and all  And as far as the world George Orwell created goes  this book was next to divine  This was indeed one of the most masterfully constructed books that I ve yet had the pleasure to read  This man  may he rest   hopefully far away from Oceania   in peace  has managed to make the world that he lived in blend seamlessly into this version of reality  of the superstates  of Oceania and Eurasia and Eastasia  who were in a perpetual state of warfare  If there ever was a book to be considered perfect  albeit perfectly depressing  might I add   this would come as close as a book could get    Te observan desde arriba o tu permites esa observacion   Una Pregunta conspiradora  una pregunta desvariada  molesta o simplemente maniatica  para algunos  El regalar tu libertad publicando la vida en redes sociales o dejando que otros manejen tu vida financiera  dejar que el Estado tenga psicologicamente el regimen y el poder  permitir que tu vida sea controlada por sistemas masivos  o aceptar que el mundo necesita del oprimido  Una realidad distopica  O tal vez una inocultable Observamos dia a dia como un primer capitulo  de una novela inventada por George Orwell en los anos 40  es el equivalente a la sociedad enganosa que nos venden  Creemos que somos seres razonables por el simple hecho de firmar un tratado  en el que nos organizamos como sociedad  porque supuestamente en el fondo somos individuales por naturaleza  Clamamos por libertad  pero nos cuesta renunciar a nuestra vida social  a nuestros aparatos electronicos  a los elementos que controlan nuestro pensamiento  Vivimos con la guerra en nuestras cabezas pero sabiendo que es algo que no nos pertenece  algo de lo que somos terceros  Observamos la injusticia y la comentamos por medios de los que no se tiene control ni se sabe la veracidad de ellos  Reducimos la moral y la lengua a su mas simple expresion  Se pensaria en que la unica manera como podemos empezar a invertir nuestra caida libre  es sacar el dogma de que el regimen  el poder o el Estado  es algo exclusivamente de politicos  mas bien todos podemos ejercerlo  tenerlo y construirlo  renunciar a las instituciones financieras para que dejen de una buena vez de controlar nuestros ingresos  permitirse el gusto de conocerse y conocernos no exclusivamente por las redes sociales  hablar mas y teclear menos  Aumentar nuestra capacidad de critica y dudar de todo planteamiento  incluso de este   dejar de permitir la influencia de medios masivos de comunicacion y derrocar todo aquel dirigente que no busque como fin unico el bienestar comun  Seria lo correcto y lo ideal  pero es desviado pensar en que si tengo a mis padres lejos utilice el servicio postal y no el telefono o la red social que me deja hablarles instantaneamente  al no tener un contrato con el Estado que defienda mis leyes y mis derechos  robarian mis propiedades y tendria que buscar la proteccion de mis bienes por mis propios medios  al mismo tiempo se desatraian guerras interminables por el control de las propiedades  nuestras finanzas caerian enteras a nuestras manos permitiendo la abstencion del pago de impuestos y de prestaciones sociales  que son fundamentales para mantenerse como sociedad  y para nuestro beneficio comun  volveriamos a las cavernas al renunciar a nuestros aparatos electronicos que tantas facilidades han proporcionado  hablariamos y actuariamos de manera tan perfecta que se juzgaria fuertemente cualquier pequeno error cometido  Y que pensar Cambiar desde nosotros y esperar como poco la sociedad se disuelve en pequenos individuos considerando asi la perdida total de nuestra libertad y la observacion de un sistema al que le importan unicamente tres grandes premisas de la sociedad Orwelliana La guerra es la pazLa libertad es la esclavitudLa ignorancia es la fuerza qr  f   fkr rwy  19841   rwy  lmD  llmstqbl  tSwr hdhh lrwy  dykttwry  jdyd

ini  Namun setelah membaca ulang dari awal  ternyata bukunya bagus banget  Masih agak mengernyitkan dahi sih  tapi semua penggambaran dunia yang direka oleh Orwell ini berasa banget  Kota yang pengap  berdebu  gersang  bau apak  itu serasa menempel di sekitar saya selama membacanya Ngeri  Ngeri  Ngeri  Kata itu tampaknya tepat untuk menggambarkan kehidupan di buku ini  Bagaimana sebuah kekuasaan Bung Besar mampu mengubah apa pun  Masa lalu dihapus  sejarah diubah sesuai kehendak kepentingan Partai  sehingga orang orang yang hidup di masa kini tidak tahu menahu soal sejarah atau masa lalu Selain itu  di dunia ini  orang tidak boleh merasakan jatuh cinta selain kepada Bung Besar  Tidak boleh ada hasrat apa pun  tidak boleh ada perlawanan atau pemberontakan pada apa pun yang tidak mereka kehendaki  Jika tidak  maka bersiap siaplah ditangkap oleh polisi pikiran dan diuapkan  dilenyapkan  Sebab tidak ada yang bebas di dunia ini  Setiap gerak gerik  bahkan pikiran dalam kepala  diamati dengan cermat  Di mana mana ada perekam suara dan teleskrin  semacam kamera pengintai yang bisa ngamuk ngamuk kalau ada pelanggaran   Brillante analisis de un sociedad distopico gobernada por el totalitarismo  la censura y la opresion  Solo espero que nunca llegemos a la situacion que describe este libro ensayo  Aunque no estamos muy lejos en algunos aspetos de eso   lw fy ktr mn5njmt knt khdthmmmkn tqr  kdh mr  This book is a classic for a reason  It makes a very good argument and the scary thing is that one can compare some of the thing in this book to real life  The ending was bittersweet  but it is very appropriate  If anyone were to ask me about this book I would say   your library isn t complete without it    Anti  utopian novel  In my opinion the main purpose of the book is to show us that no matter what you do and where you live there is always be people who will always watch over you from the other side of the screen  And no matter how hard you try you will never be able to fight against them  as they read your mind and can control it  Sounds creepy huh   This is the book 1984  It is about a normal man who thinks quite like all of us and has similar problems that we may have  except he has got it bad  This is the fictional dystopian story of Winston smith s life  Winston Smith is a man who lives in a world where the government is severely corrupted and is an oligarchy on a mission for full power  A mission to control life and nature  Throughout the story Winston finds himself struggling to keep his thoughts of hating the government to himself for since he works within the party the government  he is constantly watched and spied on by telescreens  TV  s with hidden cameras in them  hidden mics  He believes that a coworker Brotherhood   th alongside e resistance against the Party  him works for the and little He finds himself constantly hating th e Party because Winston knows that they have controlling the minds of millions  corrupt the world and are They literally can snap their fingers and change history like that  He knows this because he alters history every day  His job is to erase all the old history and replace it with history of the Glorious Big Brother who is th e leader of everyone in there continent of Oceana present have Uncle Sam for America  Winston   Just as we  in the finds out that a female coworker that he mistakenly thought was a spy  loved him  They both hate the Government so they go to the coworker that Winston thought he could trust and say that they want to join the brotherhood and fight against the corrupt par ty  Later Winston and  Julia   was her name  Were turned over to the Thought police by the man who let them stay in his home   he turned out to be a spy   Winston and Julia were sent to prison where Winston underwent the most horrendous of tortures  Eventual ly the untrustworthy coworker  O Brien  ends up being the man to torture poor Winston  In the end of were   and the end of this long story himself Loving Big Brother  T or shoul the   long mental hate against the way things and the long torture sessions Winston found he Government successfully won  They had brainwashed him like the millions of other poor innocent people out there  The end d I say the beginning  This is the future if we are not careful This book is a dystopian book  It is all about the corrupt future and the horrible world that is to come  Anyone who enjoys bit of controversy  conspiracy and rebellious behavior  or if you like stuff about the governm ent  I think anyone who has heard of how the government and can listen to you talk thr a g o ough your phone or your smart TV  od prediction of what is to come  This can look at you through your phone s camera would like this because I think that this book is book is meant to be taken as a warning to us and The ability to see people through telescreens in the story quite frankly relates to the ability of our government now looking through people s phone cameras  I think anyone who is interested in governmental issues would love this book I loved this book  I will Give it a 5 star rating  I thought that the whole idea of a corrupt government on a mission for total control was really cool and sounded very interesting  And it was  The book was long and was definitely a hard read but it was a good read  There were parts in the book that I would have to reread to really grasp what it was trying to say  So yes there were some confusing parts and there were some parts in the boo that were very long and never I think you will too k ending boringness  But in the end it is all worth it  It is a good book  I liked it and I think you will too  This book literally changed my life  Literally  I can t even explain it  and I didn t even realise until weeks after I finished reading  Absolutely insane  I recommend it to anyone who s life needs a little shaking up  Prepare to become an incredible skeptic     ntbh   l kh

nostalgia  if you ve ever seen the first edition of Nineteen Eighty Four  you d know why Eric Arthur Blair AKA George Orwell s timeless classic will forever stick in my mind  For how can you forget his formidable  dystopic take of a country with a government out of control and the people without  when so many of the same questions addressed in 1948 are still prevalent even in today s society While grim  this novel will always provide a bit of food for thought  so to speak  for all generations  now and forever  rwy  sysy  bmtyz   slwb slsl fy Glb ljz m d ljzy  lthny mnh dsm qlyl  l  lrGm

terrified to the point of panicking  Panicking in the sense that your mind became alert with the inconceivable yet threatening situation of Katniss from The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins  Beatrice  Tris  from Divergent series by Veronica Roth  Kathy H and her friends in Kazuo Ishiguro s Never Let Me Go and many other characters from Dystopian Novels  Think Read again  I never felt the same way in George Orwell s 1984  This novel is much more frightening  threatening  thought provoking and dreadfully powerful dystopian and satirical novel  You will unbelievably run from your sleeves because the visuals almost seem to seep into the pores of your skin  intoxicating you with dread and ache  This another novel that will stay with me forever  especially the words  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  These words keep haunting my head since I read this book 1984 should not be read for fun  but with utmost curiosity and seriousness  The plot is amazing and  just like I always say from the moment I write this review  Frightening  If you learned Political Geography from your school then this would be easy for you The world in 1984 is divided into three states  originated from the remains from World War II  Oceania  Western Hemisphere  the British Isles  Australasia and Southern Africa   Eurasia  Continental Europe and Russia  including Siberia   and Eastasia  China  Japan  Korea  and Indochina   also described as the rest of the world   Imagine the scenario  The story began with the  Atomic War boy   Winston Smith  he grew up as a middle aged man who endures a filthy existence in the totalitarian  superstate  of Oceania under the constant surveillance of the Guards they call  Thought Police  He became a low Political Party official in the Ministry of Propaganda   If you think that sounds okay  think again   Despite of his Pro Government position he still lives in a dirty and mini room  and works in a small office cubicle  Their job is to rewrite history and  erase  anyone who has fallen afoul of the government in accordance with the dictates of the Party State and its oh so supreme figure head  Big Brother  yes  he rules Oceania  Winston fate changes when he met an overt  rebel from the waist downwards  who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti Sex League  Julia  It turns out that they are both fed up with the whole system of tyranny the totalitarian system  I m going to skip some scenes and give you the ending After Winston and Julia are separated and taken away to be detained  questioned and brutally rehabilitated because they were caught in the night of June 1984 with a small telescreen hidden behind a picture on the wall   And I will stop with their journey in that precise moment  Let the curiosity move you to read this novel The slogan WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH War is peace because of the continuous warfare between the three states that exist in the world of 1984 who hold different and similar ideologies  They have to keep the society s order and peace  If you remember the slogan  If you wish for peace  prepare for war   usually interpreted as meaning peace through strength  a strong society being less likely to be attacked by enemies  That explains the first slogan The second slogan  Freedom is slavery  simply means in order to gain freedom  freedom of speech and anything else  you must first allow yourself to be included in the Party  in other words  letting you to be part of the slaves  because that way  the oppressor doesn t have the means to destruct you Last but not the least  the slogan  Ignorance is strength  I think it is about the division of social classes  Big Brother atop  The Party in middle  the Proles at bottom  in 1984 or simply the  Proletariat  Middle Class and the Bourgeoisie   Ignoring it will be your strength because in 1984  those classes do not seem to change because the poor will still do as they are told in a very  very irrational way and the rich will keep on loading for more and they will still uphold the law  The state will maintain its structure by torture  exploitation  violence  and brainwashing      In a sense it told him nothing that was new  but that was part of the attraction  It said what he would have said  if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order  It was the product of a mind similar to his own  but enormously more powerful  more systemic  less fear ridden  The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you know already  Aside from the devastating end that I found was very exaggerated it was a Genius book that holds a great sense of reality between it s lines  the author had me experience what  Doublethink  really is by the conversion of what Winston thought was true to a complete delusional scheme and finishing the book feeling overwhelmed with so many questions like what is the secret that is beyond our power and who really controls it   1984 by George Orwell is a novel that is one of a kind  Whatever book you happen to be reading put it down and start reading this novel  1984 tells narrates the story of a utopian government ruling over a certain part of the world  In this so called utopia the government calls itself The Party  and it is divided into three different classes  The first and richest being the inner party  the second and the one that is considered the middle class is called the outer party  the third and poorest call themselves the proles a class that has no business or interference with the party  The proles live alone and do as they wish  The party members however live in houses appointed to them by the inner party  These houses contain tele screens that look over their each and every action all the time  In this community the party members worship big brother  a man who is the founder of the Party  but who is never seen even though he is said to be alive  The party has a crime called thought crime which was created to protect the party  Whoever the party believes to be guilty they take in and either torture or hang the so called criminal  The main character of the novel is Winston Smith  a man who secretly hates The Party but acts as if he loves everything about it including big brother  Winston meets a girl that he falls in love with and he starts meeting her at secret hideouts  in order to make love  One day a member of the inner party slips Winston an inconspicuous note with his address on it  that tells him to meet him at his house  He goes to the house with the girl he is in love with called Julia  There the member of the inner party called O Brien makes him confess that he wants to conspire against The Party  then tells him that there is a secret organization that is fighting against The Party called the brotherhood  Two weeks later while Winston was in the hideout with Julia the inner party patrols got hold of them and took them away to an unknown place where they take all thought criminals  There Winston is kept for several years and tortured by O Brien until he was convinced into thinking that everything the party says is correct and that all the lies they feed them are true and are not lies  Years later Winston leaves The Party s hostage into the real world a totally different man  he is now the Party s  ideal  citizen  This novel which was written in 1949 shows us a small glimpse of where technology may be leading us  George Orwell reveals the scary truth that may be awaiting us in the near future  mn lS b jdan ktb  mrj

Utter brilliance This is such a classic  and so often referred to in other works  that I felt like I must have read it but couldn t remember the specifics of the plot so I decided to re read it  It made a profound impact on me   I can t believe a book written so long ago could have such application for the world we live in now   Newspeak  Reminds me of how we ve started adjusting our language based on texting and tweeting   of course it s not backed by the political reasoning in the book but still an interesting parallel   Big brother  We may not have big brother per se but through social media we as a society are almost starting to act together as a sort of big brother  Think about people getting fired for Facebook Twitter update  Or the  Flesh Search  trend in China  http   www nytimes com 2010 03 07 mag     where people use the internet to find  and punish  people for morality crimes that the community has deemed  illegal There are more of course but those two stand out to me  If you haven t read this book since high school I recommend picking it up again and reading it in the context of our daily news  for example  in the book they defend the  war is peace  line by explaining how beneficial war is to keeping society running   then consider our ongoing war with dubious beginnings and see how your perspective shifts  I think you ll get a lot of insight out of it  LA GUERRA E  PACE LA LIBERTA  E  SCHIAVITU  L IGNORANZA E  FORZA Chi controlla il passato controlla il futuro  Chi controlla il presente controlla il passato  Il potere non e un mezzo  e un fine  Non si stabilisce una dittatura nell intento di salvaguardare una rivoluzione  ma si fa una rivoluzione nell intento di stabilire una dittatura  Il fine della persecuzione e la persecuzione  Il fine della tortura e la tortura  Il fine del potere e il potere Se vuoi un immagine del futuro  immagina uno stivale che calpesta un volto umano    per sempre Bastano questi spezzoni per capire la grandezza di Orwell  Una denuncia degli autoritarismi dal carattere cupo e crudele  Un grande romanzo per capire un po  il mondo  La storia e inventata  certo  ma fa riflettere Ho tuttavia preferito  La fattoria degli animali  perche a volte il libro diventava troppo opprimente  forse il mio inconscio si e rifiutato di accettare questa realta  che e esistita ed esistera di nuovo Capolavoro  Bringing fear  sharp chill on the back of your neck and also desperation  Great classic that s still relevant and will always be relevant as it approaches politic and power through human nature  very basic and universal  The more you read  the more you are disappointed by the circulation of ideas and recurring themes represented through different genres and in different times  As it turns out  the book I read recently  and loved   V for Vendetta   is based loosely on the concepts in 1984  Both set in London  describe an oppressive regime that monitors people all the time  Asleep or awake  working or eating  indoors or out of doors  in the bath or in bed   no escape  Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside you skull     1984 I shall die here  Every last inch of me shall perish  Except one  An inch  It s small and it s fragile and it s the only thing in the world worth having  We must never lose it  or sell it  or give it away  We must never let them take it from us     V for VendettaI ve just started this book  but I hope there are portions of it that have not been taken and twisted and wrung and endlessly reused by other works  I ve read  since its publication  What has been will be again  what has been done will be done again  there is nothing new under the sun  In 1984  the government spends a lot of effort in  rectifying  the past by deleting or adding to the vast amount of information but the protagonist finds a photographic evidence of a cover up   the wrongful conviction  and hanging  of some rebels   It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now  when the photograph itself  as well as the event it recorded  was only memory  Strangely  Milan Kundera s Book of Laughter and Forgetting begins with the same motif   a photograph taken of two prominent Czech leaders one of who was later erased by the prevailing government after he was accused of treason and hanged  After the Prague Spring  a lot of these doctored instances of the country s history under communism were uncovered  Communist leaders who had been purged  imprisoned  or executed were systematically erased from history  Sadly  this isn t a work of fiction that drew inspiration from 1984  On the contrary  it s likely that this  erasing of history  was a prevailing practice at the time and it inspired George Orwell  Ena biblio to opoio se aphenei aphono me to poso mesa tha mporouse na pesei kapoios gia semera graphontas to 70 khronia prin Pose gnose    Anamphibola to kalutero biblio pou ekho diabasei pote kai ekhei epereasei ton tropo skepses mou oso kanena allo      I was not assigned to read this in high school  I had a few friends and even more class  and teammates that were  because they took the fancy smart advanced English class  I was  however  one of those nerdy kids that actually liked reading  and hoped that I would get that assignment   but I never did  For some reason  that kept me from reading the book all through high school and a year or two after  When I finally did get around to checking it out from the library  I found myself struggling to become immersed in the storyline  I finally did  read  it when I found a cd recording  I no longer had to find time between work and my small child  I could  read  while commuting  This worked beautifly  almost too well  because I d get my headphones on and listen at work  without further ado  the actual REVIEW Like Brave New World  this dystopian novel has managed to take an accurate prediction of the future and scare all unassuming citizens who read it  At first  I thought   Well  that s ridiculous  That would never happen here   And then I realize  Are we at war with Oceana East Asia  Or Iran Iraq  The Patriot Act and Homeland Security can also be derivatives   what else did you find  So incredibly influential  This book scares me so much because as much as I like to think it is complete fiction that could never happen  every once in a while I see a news story and an Orwellian phrase will lurk into my mind   BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  And when I watch C Span  which I try to limit  really  I constantly think of Orwellian Doublethink  or Sorel s  vital lie    This changed the way I looked at any person or group that wants to control other people since I first read it in 7th grade  hence my crazy government paranoia  In the beautifully crafted 1984  a novel by George Orwell  Winston Smith struggles in a lost battle with the controlling party that rules everything about his low ranking life in the conquered city of London  Oceana  A society where mere thoughts which denounced the ruling party caused the punishment of death sets the gloomy  dark  and oppressive mood which comes with Winston s dull life in his dim apartment  This sets up to reveal his job at the government ministries  where he is to re write history in favor of the all powerful leader   Big Brother   At work he meets an extremely attractive girl by the name of Julia who  despite its  illegal nature  had sexual relations with  These acts are discovered by O Brien  a high ranking government official and he quickly reveals himself to be part of the  Brotherhood   a union to rebel against the controlling government and inducts them as rebels  However  it s revealed to the reader that O Brien isn t who we think he is  he is actually a government spy whose job was to catch Winston as a rebel  Eventually  he gives in to the pressure of the government and accepts his fate to be a slave to Big Brother My favorite character in 1984 is the main character  Winston because he is a thorough thinker and his wisdom forgoes that of almost every other character that is controlled by the government in this dark time  He feels hopeless against the power of his leaders who will effectively re write history in their own favor   He who controls the past controls the future  and he who controls the present controls the past   35   This really is an incredible bit of insight given as it tells us that we have the power to change the future  but we also have the power to change the past to what suits us  an act that Big Brother uses to bend his popularity and crush hopes of rebellion  Additionally  Winston is a character whom it s extremely easy to sympathize with as he struggles so much internally with the fact that he will never be able to overthrow his leading power  He acknowledges that the damage Big Brother has done to his society is much too monumental to undo   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious    54  he writes into his journal to contain his increasingly disgusted attitude towards his leaders to whom he can t directly defy  This is extremely significant because it shows that he knows rebellion is impossible  to rebel at this point is not even an option and he is to sit in this dull society for life  This can t help but bring you to feel sympathy for such a sad and wizened character as Winston who will never again feel a free life since his vague memories as a small child Overall  this book is masterfully crafted and it is clear that incredible bouts of thought were poured into its creation  Many books I ve read use heavy details which describe the scene or characters  but it s also very often that I am bored with the unnecessary details that it provides and 1984 almost never allows me to be bored with the details for one spectacular reason  all of the details provided give an incredible moral lesson and are important to story development  Each piece of unrelated dialogue adds a great deal of characterization to Winston and is incredibly clear and easily interpreted  I personally was so inspired by the these lines within the book  that I jotted them down in order in order to make meaning of them and learn from Orwell s obvious expertise on the topics which he writes about  Besides this  I have never in my lifetime taken any form of notes on a book that weren t mandatory for an assignment  In all  1984 is beautifully written and idea filled book that everybody deserves an opportunity to read and learn from in their lifetime  Oof  There is so much I missed on my first reading of this as a teenager  This book is often upheld as a sure bet for society s downfall  I realized that it is so much more sinister and familiar than that  Big Brother is not an evil dictator who can be overthrown  Big Brother is an ecosystem  Winston s knowledge of his fatefrom the first time he puts pen to paper is eery in its authenticity  The most familiar eery part of the book rests in the concept of doublethink  We re all so confident in our versions of universal truth  even when faced with others who hold true to their own truth that is just as plausible  We love Big Brother Sidenote  this edition has a forward by Thomas Pynchon  Highly recommended  This is a very good book despite the fact that the moment I closed it I was so disappointed  During the first and second parts the author got my hopes high  but in the third part he crushed them with a war hammer  it certainly felt so     Of course  this also happened because of a general idea of films and similar stories where the oppressed rise and rally towards freedom  and I expected such a turn  But  alas   He loved Big Brother  I remembered Clarice Starling in the end of  Hannibal Lecter    she got off lightly When O Brian asked Julia and Winston if they were ready to never see each other again for their cause  Julia said  No    but Winston hesitated  I thought  Ugh  men     But his loyalty and love for her lasted longer  and that says something  I need to correct my judgement The Newspeak language is very interesting  I want to read the Russian version of the book to compare Room 101   significant number  because self preservation is the first basic instinct of any living thing  and all moral and social factors aside   it is the human nature  We should not deceive ourselves There are a lot of interesting thoughts  I certainly recommend to read this book   Pretty good  Character development was not a very large part  but the connections between this hypothesized future  and today s world is mind blowing   Orwell managed to entirely predict North Korea  based on the books I ve read from people who was born there  and some French animators   This book killed any hope for humanity  but it was very well written and accurate  You can see some of what he  prophesied  come true  Reading the book  you get a sense of despair about what he wants the world to be  He is no capitalist  but does not believe in communism  This book crushes any hope you have for the future  Humanity always suffers  always makes the same mistakes  cannot reach a happy medium  plans everything out diabolically  and festers in wisely concocted delusions  Thank you  pseudonym  for the warning  but now I fear you bred a spawn of conspiracy theorists  I kept thinking about the way we write today  How we shorten words to mean what we say instead of typing them all out  This book reflects what s going on in our society  not just in terms of how language changes  but how we manipulate our history and how those in power choose to change what we view as true   La historia de Winston Smith es una alegoria en donde los arquetipos de los regimenes totalitarios desembocan en la mas perfecta tirania  Una en la cual se niega inclusive la existencia de los martires  y por ende  la libertad del pensamiento desde sus propias raices  el control del mas insignificante ciudadano implica no solo su supresion como persona  sino tambien  y acaso principalmente  el abandono total de las esperanzas y de las creencias individuales  El lenguaje  reducido hasta menos del hueso y depurado de ambiguedades  solo puede acrecentar el poder del partido  y eso  a su vez  derivara en la perpetuidad de la tirania  Un ejercicio infernal de como seria un mundo permanentemente controlado por una burocracia sin escrupulos  every time I mention this book the word  genius  comes up in my mind my mind cannot fully comprehend every single idea but I cannot ignore the fact that it absolutely changed the way I see the world at the beginning I thought the author was exaggerating too much but then I realized he is describing real life with precise detail I cannot begin to describe this book  Every time I try to write something it sounds stupid  So just go and read it  It s absolutely remarkable  I think the book itself was great  The fact that it exploited the themes of totalitarianism and manipulation made for a very interesting and essential read  However  I think that although the message is great  the story line was lacking  The book served as a cautionary tale which he tried to integrate into the life of Winston and Julia  Through this simple plot  Orwell explains in explicit detail every aspect of the society in order for us to truly understand it  Nevertheless  the story of Winston wasn t necessarily interesting  What kept the reader going was the way in which every detail of the society was slowly revealed  The role of Winston was simply to give his opinions on society which we can relate to because like him we see it as completely extreme  Therefore  I gave the book 5 stars because I think this was the best way for Orwell to pass on his views of society and warn us of the dangers of totalitarianism  This book changed my life  I read it in high school and I ve never trusted government since   How much do I love this book  So much Interestingly  I followed up this  the classic tale of a future dystopia  with Ender s Shadow  a more current prediction for the future  Not that they lacked parallels  Oh  but Orwell is such a master of the futuristic cautionary tale that this book defies the title of science fiction  I mean  ever heard of Big Brother  Orwell defined the concept Okay  I ll try to be a bit more articulate  The first two parts of the book were pitch perfect  Orwell paints a vivid picture  then lets us watch as Winston and Julia get a taste of the freedom they are being denied  I understand why they had to be caught in part three  It puts the caution in cautionary tale  The only detail I would change is the very end when Winston is truly brainwashed  The Party conquers his thought  and he loves Big Brother  I would want to leave readers with the idea that their minds are the one thing they can always keep for themselves  Then again  the disturbing ending might be part of the book s power  Orwell  I bow to your genius  There is a shocking resemblance between George Orwell s 1984 and our society today  In 1984 we saw many instances where Big Brother was slowly dumbing down the knowledge  memory and language of the society  These instances are seen in reality with common core and the lack of vocabulary in the current generation  Also an eerie correlation between the present technology and the feeling of being watched as if Big Brother is slowly creeping into our lives without fanfare or protest  1984 was a thoroughly captivating book  Definitely a great read  I can t believe I didn t read this earlier in my life  WOW  However  maybe my appreciate is only because I am older and more interested in the world and how it works  My deepest thoughts as a 16 year old was how to get the attention of a boy I liked or some other pedestrian  pubescent worry  As a teacher  I see that This book would be great to use in a study of oppressive governments   l ymknny wSf lrwy  b kthr mn mbd      Hqyq  nh tnTq blsn lwq  tj lh  kthr bw san War is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength What is there to say about this famous book other than you have to read it  I feel like every year when I hear about this book mentioned  someone makes the comment that it is as relevant as ever  I m not sure how that s the case  but it really is true  every year  Orwell s genius shines through as his vivid images of Oceania conjure up feelings inside your head that make you feel as if you re walking alongside Winston through the slums  into his hiding spots  and especially all through his movements in the last third of the book  Oceania s presence feels as real as anything else I can think of  and if it feels so real in the mind  is it not real after all  Orwell especially succeeds in creating a terrifying universe  while at the same time somehow being oddly comforting in the brutally honest description of the Party s intentions and heinous visions I read an eBook edition with an introduction by Thomas Pynchon  author of Gravity s Rainbow  and appreciated his insight into the themes and context of Orwell s writing  I especially liked his theory that Winston is meant to represent Orwell s son  who had recently been born at the time of writing  with the idea that this was the world Orwell was afraid his son was going to be living in soon  Was he right in his predictions  Thankfully  not completely  I hope   Either way  Orwell is clearly a master of writing  If you haven t read this book and for some reason you re reading my review to find out if you should  you should  Even though it gets said again and again  I still feel obligated to say   the book is so relevant now more than ever  Not to mention that it s an extraordinary literary accomplishment   It has been many years since I last read this  having read it in high school and then again in my twenties  It is still an excellent book  and one of the more chilling dystopian books  although the likelihood of it being a possible future seems much more remote than when I previously read it over 35 years ago Many of the methods used by the Party will seem familiar to modern readers   media manipulation of the public  occasional outright denial of facts by political and business leaders   especially to those in Australia who have just lived through two years of a government that seemed determined to reshape the country in their image  However  while the book never really gives an explanation of exactly how Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia came to be  and it s not really that important   it seems unlikely these days that three totalitarian governments would be able to gain such power Orwell was clearly in a dark place when he wrote this  with much of Europe having suffered nearly a decade of conflict between the Spanish Civil War and World War II  and the complete lack of hope throughout the book can be oppressive Still  this is an excellent book  one that everyone should read at least once in their lives  jwrj wrwl twy yn rmn jm h y rw twSyf mykhnh khh dr wn mrdm z

temas politicos 1984 explora la posibilidad y la facilidad en la que el poder puede exterminar el pensamiento y promover el manejo de masas Excelente y altamente recomendado  What did I think  What do I think Well  I should have known that the story was going to take such a dark  cynical turn  after reading Animal Farm  But I m a fluffy  dreams are revolutions  kind of kid  so obviously I expected Julia and Winston to join the Brotherhood  and the reign of Big Brother would come to a dramatic end  with the People standing over the smoking ruins of the system like traditional conquerors  staring into the sunset   While no perfect new system would be in play  the future would be theirs   I should have known It was such a powerful story  wasn t it  The two ideas that struck me the most were the concept of Newspeak  and the alteration of the past  Limiting ways to express yourself so that certain feelings and ideas couldn t exist anymore  and how nothing is really static and we take so much news for granted    The power of words and all that jazz    This book has left me terrified  paranoid  and haunted  Completely serious stuff I take one star off for the  romance  between Winston and Julia  I just    I know it s supposed to be more political than anything  but it s just so hard    to take in    a romance without schmaltziness    It s supposed to be warm and fuzzy      DAMN  I can t take that star off  It makes sense  WHYYY  ORWELL  WHYYY   _   This book was  for me  extremely engaging  As I read about all the elements and implications of this time period  I was both horrified and fascinated at the same time by the aspects and ideas that are presented in this particular society  The setting as a whole is extremely engaging  and the messages that are portrayed are a great exercise of the mind  Winston Smith  Julia  and O Brien really put me on a roller coaster ride of emotions through their actions  decisions  and what they need to put up with throughout the book  In this sense  I quite like them as characters  I had very few gripes with reading it   the book  that Winston reads was rather dull and I felt I was reading more of a political essay rather than a novel  I also found Winston to be particularly annoying around part three  In the end  I would absolutely recommend to anybody who is easing themselves into the classic novels  especially in the dystopian future category  The book really catches the readers attention especially with the structure of the environment and on the mechanics of this totalitarian government of 1984   Second addition to my bookshelf  because this is the best book I ve read in years  Julie has been harping on me to read it  so I picked it up for the China trip    how very appropriate So often lumped in with  Brave New World  as the pinnacle of early 20th century dystopian prophecy  In the spirit of Beatles vs  Elvis  I ll say that I much prefer  1984  I see no sense in trying to summarize or review the book  so I ll just share some of the more profound impressions that I felt while reading it For starters  the disturbing amount of seemingly familiar motifs  phrases  and ideas in the book caught me off guard  While reading  1984   though possibly due in part to immediacy  I was hard pressed to think of any work of fiction that has been so consistently aped  imitated  or unconciously evoked in subsequent film and literature  1984 is everywhere    from Big Brother to  Brazil  ian bureaucracy to blind sloganeering  let s play Word or Not  with that one  I expected to find Orwell s writing a bit dry  anachronistic  and difficult to relate to  Could NOT have been more wrong  The prose is remarkably savvy and accessible  All of the stylistic hurdles that I typically find I must bridge when reading fiction from a different era were surprisingly absent  The book  reads  like it could have been written yesterday  And I mean that in a good way Also  I m not trying to break on older books    I m just saying that the evolution of the English language can very often throw up communication barriers when reading novels from a bygone era  Not so with this book In the case of 1984   prophetic  would be an understatement  The accuracy of 1984 s assumptions about modern and recently modern society evoke an inescapable gravity  For a book written about the future  it feels remarkably familiar and immediate    and  even though a fantasy  1984 s relevance borders on timeless and universal I ll dispense with the hyperbole  You know this book  and you know you re supposed to have read it  But we re not talking about fucking  Pride and Prejudice  here  where you can acknowledge that everyone thinks it s a classic  while still avoiding it because you know it sucks  This book is far too frightening and far too relevant  If you haven t read this book  then please make it a future  must read   Mark my words  it will blow you away  MOTHERFUCKIN AWESOME Just excellent  Gros choc  effrayante vision du futur  qui se revele tres proche de notre present  Extr me sur certains aspects  et finalement plutot realiste  et surtout horriblement  ou delicieusement  pessimiste Un chef d oeuvre  je le dis haut et fort   a lire a tout prix  Not everything has  but this one has stuck with me since high school  This is my favorite book  Amazing  When I started reading it I didn t have a clue what it was about  It is frightening how something written in 1948 for a future 1984 became a reality for many Eastern Europian countries  And what makes it even more frightening is how you can see parts of it even in today s society  Do not imagine that you will save yourself  Winston  however completely you surrender to us  No one who has once gone astray is ever spared  And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life  still you would never escape from us  What happens to you here is for ever  Understand that in advance  We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back  Things will happen to you from which youcould not recover  if you lived a thousand years  Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling  Everything will be dead inside you  Never again will you be capable of love  or friendship  or joy of living  or laughter  or curiosity  or courage  or integrity  You will be hollow  We shall squeeze you empty  and then we shall fill you with ourselves   I dare say that what Orwell wrote to be  fiction  turned out to be more than true in the days we live and are to live  at a time of deceit it was a revolutionary act to tell the truth    to be an insane minority of one   to keep HUMAN     Com certeza esse entrou para o meu TOP 5  Sao tantas coisas a comentar que prefiro emudecer  spoiler alert  rs   Recomendo a voce que nao se contenta com a atual sociedade contemporanea  a voce que nao e acomodado e pensa reflete age de forma diferente  George Orwell  vulgo Genio  foi um critico com culhoes  A ele  meu respeito Reading this book was like finding out all the crazy conspiracy theories you have ever heard of WAS true in a different life  IN THE FUTURE    I love this book because its concept was larger than life  but still very in touch with reality  The book is well written  evocative  and insightful  It shows vivid images  and it shares raw emotions  It demonstrates deep understanding of a number of human attitudes and existential issues  It s been a page turner to me  but I do not share in the general feeling of fear expressed by many other readers  nor do I find the dystopian picture a convincing threat  Winston  the main character of a very sharp mind  at times fails to understand implications that seem obvious even from his perspective   like when he talks with  the proles  about the old times  and  despite his usual wit  he fails to understand the information conveyed in their accounts  The whole concept of Newspeak disregards the inherent quality of every language to evolve spontaneously and beyond any control in any group of humans  whether they are family  neighbours  or co workers   The proles  are shown on one side as having been left to their own devices  and on the other as being successfully cleansed of all dangerous element  which is not plausible  especially in the population of 300 million   1984  is a great and skillfully written story  but there s no prophetic quality to it  which I have come to expect after hearing so much about it  The vision of the world under the governance of the Party is interesting  but too detached from the reality to be scary  I added this book to my  to read  shelf a long time ago and kept meaning to read it  without ever making the time to pick it up at the library  Finally after much persuasion from my dad  and various other parties  I decided to finally make a move   one that I probably won t ever regret  This book was amazing  I started off expecting to read a couple of chapters   no more than 50 pages at the most  Turns out I read 200 pages in my first sitting  This book looks intimidating but is not  Would recommend to anyone and everyone    this is something that you should read in an afternoon and remember for a lifetime    WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   George OrwellI got into Orwell s works after reading Animal Farm as part of a class assignment  Listening to my teacher s recommendation  I began reading 1984  Never would I have known that this would be my favorite novel  1984 is a scarily grotesque yet realistic depiction of what the world would be like under totalitarian control  Set in a totalitarian superstate of Oceania  the audiences are introduced to the lives of its suffering citizens  Monitored at all time by telescreens  any acts of disobedience are recorded and punished  Rations of inedible food are passed around  The news changes according to the Party s belief  And the worst of all  Big Brother is always watching   1984 was  as other reviewers have said  heavy handed  but still excellent  I do not agree that the characters are bland or that we don t care about them  I cared very much Animal Farm was a lot better though And my Fav Orwell is Down and Out in Paris and London  which is an essay   and a very long essay   What causes me to view 1984 with unique fondness though  was that a bunch of science fiction writers got together and published  in 1984  1984 Re visited   each writer s  take  on 1984  the novel So long as I breathe  I shall remember fondly the story which began       looked around his grey little room  with its grey little walls  grey little     and the grey little blonde beside him   Come OFF IT Big Brother  screamed the Headline  Winston knew that this was not the story the government hacks had handed out  but no disciplinary action could be taken  for the printers always blamed the shortage of typeface  claiming that they could only make words from the letters available  I laughed until I cried  And y know  I have lost count of how many times I ve told that type setting joke verbatim   and NOT ONE person I told it to ever got it   Orwell  kitabi 1947 49 doneminde yazdi  ne var

depressing books i have ever read I will never read it again i reckon  An extensively deep book that kept my mind busy and kept me overwhelmed for a couple of days  Living through the 2011 Libyan revolution  I was completely overwhelmed while re reading this book  The concepts of thought police  thought crimes  contradicting ideologies  etc   all this was present in the Gadhafi regime The first time I read this book  at 17  I understood that there was some profound statement Orwell was trying to give  but being oblivious to the real horrors of authoritarian regimes  it just didn t resonate with me Reading it now  at 20  after living through the uprising  it was like reading an entirely different book    War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength  A must to read and to re read book  It gives shivers and a lot of food for thought I wonder if Mao Tse Tung had read 1984 because what he made in China is exactly what Orwell described in 1984  thought crime  members of families spying each other  permission to get married  brain washing  labour camps  and so on   The same Chinese language is a kind of Newspeak  there is the word good but not bad because no good is enough Unfortunately  ignorance really is strength and nowadays there is a different kind of brain washing with overconsumption and a 24h Telescreen of stupidity   A book like no other  an experience that one won t forget soon  Not a dull moment anywhere  Learned to treasure our individuality  ert  ert i z lieri cignia  romelic  bolo dros camikit xavs  n jwhr Hkm lql  lys wrth  lbn lbyh nm hw

way of looking at things   In 1984 by George Orwell  the storyline is complex  Basically  the year is 1984 Supposedly  and London is just a former shell of it s old self  The world is divided into 3 major continents  Eurasia  Oceania  Eastasia  The protagonist of 1984 is Winston Smith  a forty something year old man who works for the party  the governing dictators of London  All of London has to bow down to the famed leader of the party   Big Brother   who may or may not be even real  as the Party is infamous for censorship and altering history  Winston s every action is watched by the party through the Telescreens all around his home and the city  The story begins with his affair with a woman named Julia  Winston s frustration with the party leads him to commit  thoughtcrimes   which were punishable by death  Through a series of plot twists Winston ends up a completely different person from the beginning of the novel  Through these plot events  the reader sees Orwell s message of the dangers of totalitarianism in a country  We understand this theme through the entire novel with the actions of the party  An important quote that reinforces the theme of the dangers of totalitarianism is  He loved Big Brother   This is significant in that the government had managed to change the way in which Winston acted and thought  which was one of the powers of a totalitarian government  For me  this book was an eye opener into the style of government of past  I am thankful for the time and government I live with now  though it may be moving in the wrong direction  It is eerie how many things Orwell had predicted would exist in the future  like televisions and nuclear weapons  This proves that we humans have the foresight to see things like this happening in the future and that we have the power to prevent it from happening   It is definitely worth reading 1984 as it is not only an extremely good story   but also the fact that it s message is clear as day and how relevant in our society it is see bad things in our lives and work to change it for the better   I remember this being an assigned reading book in my junior year of high school  I was never one to like to be told what to do  so had I picked this book out on my own I probably would have really enjoyed it from the start as it falls in direct line with the style of writing that I enjoy  but making it required made it distasteful to me  However I read the book because I always completed my assignments whether I wanted to or not  but once I got through about two thirds of the way through with the book  I read three simple lines that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end  It s in the tenth chapter of the second part where Winston and Julia have just finished making love in their secret apartment  I did not find anything interesting in this scene because to me it was just like two teenagers sneaking around behind their parent s back  This is something that was the topic of conversation at every table in the cafeteria no matter the clique of kids the table happened to occupy  But then there were these words   We are the dead   he said  We are the dead   echoed Julia dutifully You are the dead   said an iron voice behind them   I vividly remember sitting back down on the edge of my bed and letting out a  Whoa  and suddenly becoming very interested in the book  I then chuckled at the next like that said  Winston s entrails seemed to have turned to ice   The combination of the hilarity of frozen entrails and the creepy iron voice telling them they were dead from behind a picture frame demanded of me to start the book over While the beginning seemed to lag to me  and there is a lot of repetition about policy and the monotony of life  I was really jarred that this very well could be a depiction of the types of censorship we could experience in the future  And the just weeks ago it feels like Big Brother materialized from the pages of Orwell s book and into the mainstream media in the form of the new Facebook messenger  I am sure apps like this have existed since all of our technology has begun to advance  but this one has been chosen as the poster child  Maybe Big Brother has decided it is time to start watching us  or maybe still  just like with Winston and Julia  Big Brother has been watching all along  he was just always hiding underneath the other side of our screen  Pretty crazy that they chose to have the voice come out from behind a screen isn t it  Since it seems we all live our lives in front of or hid behind screens at all times these days  Just something to think about This book changed the idea of forward creativity for me  and without it I don t think I would be as intrigued in the development of new creative frontiers as I am for having read this  1984 very easily may have been what started it all for me  and I am so very grateful  2 2 5dh rdt m rf  kyf yktb l bqr  fqr 1984lyst rwy   dy  bl tHf  mn ltHf lndr   fy khDm

understand why 1984 is devastatingly genius  worrying  and proof that this type of world exists and can exist in even the most unlikely places   1984 is the best 20th century book that I read until this moment In 2013 I am experiencing in many ways all that Orwell write in 1984 Although of this amazing warning  the humankind continues regressing to a state that only have fear and obey to a State is the major law  It s not like the dictatorship  it s not a person that wants to rule the world  it s a State that wants to rule the people  with fear The manipulated media is also a true that exists until today  to benefits the State and let the people blind to the real happens in our World  shocked  and disappointed disappointed not in the novel  nor the author  but it is that disappointment you have when you see your world in the novel and you hope that it ends well because that would give you hope for a better ending to your own world  but it doesn t end well  and that s the point But  at the end of the day  i realize the disappointment is due to the view of the novel that there is no GOD  no after life  and that winning in life is the ultimate winning  which does NOT align with my beliefs  so it feels better after modifying the novel to match one s beliefs Finally  i ll mention one of my favorite versus of Qur an bismi llhi lraWHmni lraWHiymi wala tay asuw min raWwHi llWhi

to be read in once lifetime and has rightly been listed in 100 Books to read in a lifetime  Highly Recommended   It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen   so 1984 begins     A very interesting read  Considering it was written in 1948 given how far technology has come if anything it makes 1984 more believable in how easily this could happen  I d not read this for a number of years and like a lot of the books read during school and college years it was made a lot better by not having to pause to analyse every sentence and discuss Orwell s thought processes and meanings but be prepared for the book to make you stop and reflect  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER I am in awe of george orwell holy shit  what the hell did I just read  WOW I was hoping for a happier ending   but there are no happy endings to something like thissave yourselves  Beginilah kalo negara totaliter terbentuk Semua hal diawasi Kamera pengintai dimana mana Novel ini juga mengilhami novel

book  every time I read it  only gets better I am captivated by Winston s choices  some of which are terrible and stupid   But I am  everytime  crushed by the end  Reading about Big Brother  censorship  undying loyalty to the Party sadly reminds me too much of our own society  Specifically  I think to post 9 11  when the government was able to lock up citizens and non citizens for as long as they wanted  without the right to a lawyer or judge  just locked up  I think of US citizens who were encouraged to report  suspicious  behavior and actions of their neighbors  I think of citizens and celebrities who  if they dared speak against the war  were astrocized and labeled unpatriotic  Reading this book makes me sad for our society  It makes me wish we were better than we are  SPOILER Every time I read this  I am absolutely devastated that he is captured  that he is tortured and gives everything and everyone up  I am haunted by the last words in the book   I love Big Brother  This is one of the first dystopia books I ever read  and unlike some  it ends with such a lack of hope that the reader is left feeling that the current situations of the people will never be altered  This sense of hopelessness is one that leaves the reader chilled  which is what I think was the desired purposed  ktyr jd mn ll  byHSl dlwqt  byfkrn  blrwyh d    Nineteen Eighty Four is a book that completely destroys the reader s perception of what a good book should be like  All other books previously deemed  good  seem dull and cliche in comparison  Nineteen Eighty Four is a dystopian novel set in  predictably  1984 and written by George Orwell  Unlike recently popular dystopian novels The Hunger Games and Divergent  Nineteen Eighty Four was not written with a younger audience in mind  Nevertheless  anyone can appreciate this brilliantly written masterpiece to the fullest extent for its relatable characters  wonderful plot  unusual writing style  and intriguing setting   Nineteen Eighty Four begins with the protagonist  Winston Smith  going about his daily routine  The reader is introduced to a dystopian world of telescreens  a means of constant government surveillance  Thought Police  and the all seeing eye of Big Brother  the leader of the Party  Winston lives in London  the  chief city of Airstrip One   5   Airstrip One is a province of Oceania  one of the 3 superstates  the others being Eurasia and Eastasia  Winston  being a Party member  works at the Ministry of Truth  the other 3 Ministries being the Ministry of Peace  the Ministry of Love  and the Ministry of Plenty  Curiously enough  the Ministry of Truth spreads lies in its newspaper  the Ministry of Peace oversees the war with Eurasia  the Ministry of Love holds prisoners  and the Ministry of Plenty reduces the rations frequently  Winston himself spends every day changing newspaper articles to reflect reality  or whatever is claimed to be true  The reader is thus shown a dreary world of 3 totalitarian superstates engaged in a never ending war  where freedom is a soon to be forgotten concept  and where even thoughts against the ruling Party is a crime punishable by death  Horrifyingly enough  most of the population follows Big Brother and the Party out of blind loyalty  Winston  however  secretly hates the Party and defies them numerous times  He visits the proletarian area  proles being the lower class and thus Party members are not allowed to associate with them  and also writes in an old diary denouncing Big Brother  He takes it further by starting an illegal relationship with Julia  as both love and attraction are strongly discouraged by the Party and celibacy encouraged  As their relationship progresses  Winston and Julia share their traitorous thoughts with each other  However  they know that it is pointless to resist until one day  they are approached by someone from the Brotherhood  a resistance movement against the Party  From there on  Winston and Julia pledge to help spread the Brotherhood s message  However  their journey is full of obstacles  Will the Brotherhood succeed in their revolution  or were they doomed from the start  The characters in Nineteen Eighty Four are completely the opposite of what the reader expects  and that is exactly what makes them so realistic  Whom Winston believes to be a Party zealot and whom he believes to be a rebel switch places  he erroneously judges them  Even Winston himself  the protagonist  becomes disillusioned with his beliefs  This is completely realistic and quite common in real life  Not everyone  unlike the traditional hero  changes the world around them to cater to their beliefs  Realistically  many people do not have the will to go against the world  and Winston reflects the many people who accept the stronger will imposed on them  in the end  The plot is quite realistic as well  but also absolutely captivating with a shocking plot twist  When people think of dystopian novels  The Hunger Games comes into mind  an oppressive regime  widespread hatred  people flocking to join revolutionary movements  and  finally  the overthrowing of the regime as the revolution reaches its peak  but Nineteen Eighty Four is quite different from the popular dystopian novels today  and thus employs a much more unpredictable plot with less action  There weren t all that many subplots save for a few flashbacks to Winston s childhood  Overall  the plot is actually relatively straightforward and simple  but still interesting even with a slight lack of action compared to typical dystopian novels  The writing style in Nineteen Eighty Four is markedly different from many novels  and definitely not what a reader would expect  Foreshadowing  a very common element in most novels  is almost conspicuously lacking in Nineteen Eighty Four  This  however  does a very good job of lulling the reader into a deceptively calm mindset until the plot twist is unleashed upon the reader  Additionally  there are fewer action scenes than what the reader would expect  as previously noted  Instead  the author settles the conflict in subtler ways  mainly  explaining in detail how the conflicting beliefs of Wilson and the Party are resolved  As for diction  Nineteen Eighty Four was written in 1948  where such language would have been commonplace and not considered  sophisticated   In fact  Nineteen Eighty Four can be quite blunt at times  but also gives off a queer sense of detachment  It is these aspects  of a lack of foreshadowing and physical action scenes  and of blunt language with hidden meanings  that make the writing style of Nineteen Eighty Four wildly different from any in its category   The setting and notions stated in Nineteen Eighty Four are arguably the highlights of the book  as they are incredibly interesting  The world created by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty Four is a work of creative genius  At first glance  many things seem to follow the work of previous  real life dictators  However  as it is a fictional novel  it is the fictional aspects that are the most fascinating  For example  the fact that Big Brother may not be a real person is a most intriguing aspect  as is the fact that an overwhelming majority of population is blissfully unaware of the oppressive methods used by the Party  The concepts of doublethink and Newspeak  however  are the most riveting  That the author makes it seem like the power to control reality is plausible is a testament to the genius of the author  In other words  the creations of doublethink  Newspeak  thoughtcrime  crimestop  and many other ideas presented in Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell are what make the book amazingly awe inspiring   Nineteen Eighty Four is a book that will blow all other books away by the sheer brilliance of it  The characters are realistic  the plot full of twists  the writing style uncommon and the setting and themes endlessly fascinating  This book is the complete opposite of what the reader would expect a typical book to be like  and that makes it almost ironic  to the point of being darkly humorous  In this day and age where some people believe Twilight is wildly popular because of merit  Nineteen Eighty Four deserves more than just 5 stars and a glowing recommendation  It deserves readership  even if it does take a government surveillance scandal to get it   This is almost a frightening story  Written in 1950  the prophetic  futuristic ideas are just so amazing  This is a class book you won t forget  and must read   Magistral e abjectamente desolador do inicio ao fim  Mesmo os seus raros e curtos momentos de alguma felicidade se lhe podemos chamar assim estao intrinsecamente manchados pelo horror que lhes antecedeu e pelo horror que lhes seguira  Sao como o pisa papeis ai descrito uma miragem de beleza numa redoma fragil e rara que num sopro e brutalmente estilhacado  Mais do que uma viagem literaria  1984 e um pungente e atemorizante ensaio sobre a humanidade  Nele condensa a heranca da evolucao e do progresso do trauma das duas Grandes Guerras  da ameaca e dos efeitos dos totalitarismos da maldade e corrupcao face ao poder  E um retrato tragico e extremo  mas em certa medida quase assustadoramente profetico  e se nao um desabafo um aviso grave e convulsivo ao futuro   O Grande Irmao esta a vigiar vos     a verdade que assombra Winston Smith  e a engenhosa e perversa supremacia de controlo sob os seus cidadaos  Se tudo e visto e analisado como se pode ser livre  Se nem a ideia nem o pensamento persistem num espaco privado do individuo como pode este ser livre  Se os seus actos e ideias sao copiosamente formatados em inconsciencia e ortodoxia desde o berco  como se pode ser livre  A descricao do  como  e agonizante e temivel principalmente pela lassidao e subserviencia da generalidade dos elementos do Partido Externo a revelacao do porque embora nao totalmente surpreendente  e deveras miseravel  Orwell e notavel e contudente e imperdoavel na construcao desta distopia nao existe verdadeiramente esperanca  A maquina do poder e omnipresente e omnipotente e o seu trunfo vasto  o continuo reescrever do passado a perpetualizacao da guerra o obliterar do pensamento livre da emocao do belo e do admiravel  da convulsao do amor e do prazer sucedem copiosamente no proposito de degradar a humanidade a servidao a ignorancia ao conformismo  a adoracao cega e inflamada da propria propaganda que os destruiu  Leiam 1984 e reflictam  Voltem a le lo e reflictam novamente  E o que eu irei fazer  Mesmo com aquele final insuportavelmente desolador  Havera melhor manifesto que este para estar consciente vigilante e informado    Liberdade e a liberdade de escrever que dois e dois sao quatro    muitas outras me ficaram  mas penso que esta citacao traduz de forma ate curiosa parte da mensagem do livro  I don t care about politics nor do matters regarding censorship  privacy  and the general deterioration of the American psyche interest me  Regardless  a good dystopian novel makes me happy  I also love offbeat  unexpected romance  The kind that makes you gasp and giggle in your chair amidst a sea of all the placidly impoverished and deprived people not reading what you are  Socio political issues  although important  I guess   especially if rendered with a hefty thrust from a dusty pulpit  are not fun to read about  Try as I might  my taste in books remains largely shallow and exhibits a pattern that is markedly one dimensional  Yet luckily  on many occasions  my preferences for the undeniably ancillary aspects of books are eclipsed by the more stately tastes of wiser readers in pursuit of genuine literary artistic fulfilment and I can pretend that I liked 1984 because I am truly concerned about our shrinking privacy rights and am disgusted by everyone s vapid acceptance of media spiel  Really though  the totally unanticipated  I love you  note slipped into Winston s hand  is what compelled me to like 1984  George Orwell s writing is often labeled mediocre and although I don t agree  I believe a good story can redeem anything and this novel boasts a great one   Celebrity Deathmatch Review  1984 vs  The Annotated AliceAlice was sitting next to her sister  who was absent mindedly gazing to the ground  They were sitting on a huge rock  in a drab and gloomy place once known as Hyde Park  What are you staring at   asked Alice abruptly  Staring  What is  staring    asked her sister without moving her gaze   Staring means looking continuously at something without moving your eyes away  just like what you are doing now   said Alice   What is  means   What is  continuously   Why are you talking ungood again   said her sister reproachfully   When last year father was talking like this  I told the thought police about him  They took him away for a long time and when he came back  he was talking doubleplusgood  Do you want me to tell them about you   No  no  I don t want to go away  I was just asking what you were looking at  said Alice fearfully Her sister didn t reply and seemed not paying attention to her  Once  when Alice was on her way home  she stumbled upon a very old blue book upon which was written  Oxford Concise Dictionary  in big letters  She took the book home and showed it to her father  The latter seemed very interested in it and kept it hidden inside one of the old unused pillows  He told her not to tell anyone about it  and when she asked him why  he told her a silly story which Alice can t even remember now  Only Alice and her father knew about it and she used to look up words every couple of days  which her father taught her to do Sitting in the gloomy place  Alice felt very bored and started looking around  Some ten yards away she saw a huge brown rat  which was moving its mouth and seemed to be making some noise  When Alice came near it  she heard it saying   I m late  I must hurry   These words were very familiar to Alice  When the rat began running and went behind a huge rock  Alice followed it and as she reached the place  she saw a dining table on which dozens of ugly rats were eating and drinking while chatting very loudly  Long live Big Brother  said one of the rats suddenly  raising its glass of Victory gin  When the others heard this  they all raised their glasses and shouted at once   long live Big Brother  Alice scowled  She used to hear these words at school for several times each day  She hated them  Every time she had managed to start a conversation with a friend about toys  candies  or Imaginary places  the teacher used to shout  Long Live Big Brother   and they had to repeat the words after her  One of the rats  who seemed to be taking interest in Alice  came near her   Hello my child  What are you doing here   said the rat with a familiar tone  Hello  I followed the brown rat   said Alice   I once dreamed of a talking white rabbit  which I followed into a very beautiful and curious place  There  I used to grow and shrink in size  and saw talking animals which played games with me  There were even rats there  but not as ugly as you_  she regretted the last sentence  but the rat didn t seem to pay attention to it   And   said the rat  And that s it  It was a very nice place  Much more beautiful than here   said Alice with a frown  Hmm  Now tell me about the way you speak my dear  said the rat  with a malicious grin Alice suddenly realized that she was inadvertently using words from the dictionary  and the rat understood them  She remembered that every time she accidentally used words from it with a friend or a family member  her father told her not to do so   they didn t understand what she was saying  Tell me my dear   repeated the rat   how do you know so many words  She tried to think about an answer  when the rat suddenly took out its hand  which was holding the very dictionary  from its pocket  Is this the reason   said the rat pointing to the dictionary Alice didn t understand what was happening and how the rat had the dictionary  She suddenly realized that dozens of rats were rushing towards her and began taking her away  She started crying and tried to free herself  asking them to be taken back to her sister  but no one paid attention to her  All the rats disappeared except the one with the dictionary and another fat and extremely ugly one  Both took off their disguise and turned out to be members of the thought police   Good job comrade  said the fat man  who seemed to be the chief   Let me know your name once more   Smith  Winston Smith  said the man  who was now burning the dictionary with the same malicious grin Matchpoint  1984 Dystopian future at it s finest worst  I was surprised at the pessimism of this book  Yet  that pessimism is fitting  I m used to the YA dystopian books of late    where the hero is the hero  This book is so negative that one might argue that there is no hero and  in arguing that point  that a future so bleak is devoid of heroes  But again  that may be the point There are parts of the book that seem way off in terms of prophesy and other parts that are spot on  I doubt it was written as a prophetic book but rather a cautionary tale to raise awareness of what might become of us if we do not pay attention  nh rwy  tuqr     thm tuqr  mn

stifling  where people are constantly observed  judged  and controlled  It s a society where private loyalties between friends and family are destroyed thought is interfered with  and our basest instincts for power reign supreme  I found 1984 terrifying  What is so scary about the Party in 1984 is not its physical control over people  but the way it interferes in the realm of thought  It tries to create its own truth  Orwell s words are bare and meaningful  and his main character s heroism and vulnerability are deeply moving  This book is a book for any society  any time  any person  Highly recommended   1984 es una obra maestra del genero distopico  asi de plano  disfrutar ahora por gusto su lectura 15 anos despues de haberla leido por primera vez y de forma menos interrumpida fue una experiencia a ratos terrorifica  en particular la descripcion inicial de la  Airstrip One  y luego con las torturas  las cuales leidas en una sola  sentada  las hacen tan envolventes  tan veraces que aterran  Orwell transmite las sensaciones de manera magnifica  haciendo que a ratos quieras renunciar a la lectura  el discurso de O Brien te deprime  genera terror Inicialmente basada en la URSS de Stalin  1984 describe un mundo que en muchos aspectos simpatiza con el actual  cada dia somos mas vigilados  las noticias son manipuladas  existe una agenda de temas que hay que poner en la palestra para generar emociones en la poblacion  educacion  delincuencia  inminentes crisis  etc    la forma de vida de las clases sociales  el partido disfrutando la vida de siempre  el partido externo contenido  estresado  pero miedoso y sumiso  incapaz de rebelarse  y por ultimo los proles  rebeldes  iracundos  pero incapaces de organizarse y derrocar el regimen  fiel reflejo de nuestros dias  En este mundo la prole constituye la unica esperanza de cambiar el destino  pero nunca lo haran  y si lo hicieran seria para instaurar un regimen identico  pero con otro nombre  Como bien lee Winston en los principios de Goldstein  solo los medios  partido exterior  pueden derrocar a los altos para convertirse ellos mismos en altos y asi sucesivamente Impresiona tambien el concepto de neolengua  hoy dia vemos como el lenguaje se simplifica cada vez mas  sin embargo nadie lo impone  somos nosotros mismos quienes anquilosamos la lengua  quienes reducimos nuestra capacidad de pensar reduciendo todo a su minima expresion  sin ir mas alla  huevon  puede ser adjetivo  sustantivo o verbo y reemplazar a mas de 1 3 de las palabras que usualmente se deberian utilizar 1984 da para un analisis larguisimo  e impresiona como casi 70 anos despues sigue siendo todo tan vigente  al final la gente lucha por el poder como un fin  y no como un medio  Orwell tenia clarisimo como se comporta la raza humana como masa  entendia que la parte animal jamas se sometera por completo a la racional  Como se suele decir  1984 era una advertencia  pero se convirtio en una guia  One of the best books I ve ever read  It will never lose it s importance and it has never been more relevant  It is not just the perils of socialism which are so brilliantly shown but  most importantly  the ignorance of a human being  unwillingness to see and choosing not to think and just accept what is being dished out  It is a battle between simple existence and the life as a free conscious individual with thoughts and decisions  which is so much harder  It is about how easy it is to forget  to ignore and just live  just follow  The danger of losing yourself  1984 is a very unique book  and the so to say  king  of dystopian literature  We follow Winston Smith and his desperate  impossible struggle against the all controlling government  This book deals with all aspects of life  really  focusing mostly on love and loneliness  Orwell defies what most modern dystopia s have  which is a happy ending  This book will leave the reader upset and unsatisfied  as it should  a happy ending wound t have the same effect  While Orwell s view of human nature is a bit excessively negative  1984 still merits a five star rating  Ok  devo ammettere che generalmente quando i libri mi prendono non vedo l ora di finirli  ma mai avevo iniziato a piangere e urlare durante la lettura  mai avevo passato una nottata quasi insonne per la dannata voglia di finire un libro Ecco  1984 e questo  E uno di quei libri che inizialmente non riesci a concepire  ma poi ti cattura e anche tu entri a far parte di quel mondo  temi che intorno a te ci siano dei teleschermi e rimani sbalordito alla lettura di certe frasi  E costruito e curato nel minimo dettaglio  Tutto e spiegato e niente e lasciato al caso  Nonostante si parli tanto di politica  la vera base del romanzo e la filosofia  la capacita del Partito di aver strutturato un sistema invincibile capace di controllare le menti umane  Sono rimasta sconvolta dal modo in cui il libro va a finire  Solitamente e l amore a vincere  invece qui no  qui anche l amore viene distrutto  Winston non fa altro che ripetere  noi siamo i morti   personalmente avrei preferito che venisse ucciso con le sue idee in testa e continuando ad amare Julia  piuttosto che veder uccisi i suoi sentimenti e lui che  come un ebete  adora il Grande Fratello Qualcuno che controlla la tua mente fino a distruggere l amore  Questa cosa mi ha proprio distrutta  5 stelle sono comunque meritate  il libro e scritto benissimo  in alcuni punti puo leggermente annoiare  ma sinceramente ne ho trovati pochi pochi di questi punti  This is one of my favorite books ever written  It is an incredibly powerful look at what governments can become  made possible with the best intentions This book is similar in its warning to Orwell s other book  Animal Farm  I prefer 1984  however  It s also worth noting that this book was written in the late forties  which is INCREDIBLE considering his amazing foresight If you haven t read this book  do it  I read it several years ago  As someone from a  at least formerly  communist country I was really impressed by its interesting   rather accurate depiction of brainwashing  There s an interesting blog post on this   Brave New World  http   chiusse wordpress com 2013 01     I think it s especially relevant to self identified western leftists today as a reminder that progressive movements   causes can be  and often have been hijacked by chauvinism   authoritarianism   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four  You are the dead  Oh God  I got so many chills whilst reading this book  especially towards the end  Probably the most frightening dystopia I d ever read and it must really be an influential one back when it was published in 1948  It completely blew my mind away  And somehow it even managed to surpass my high expectations for this novel  It was that good  It was doubleplusgood in Newspeak  perse  I cannot formulate a proper review at the moment  my brain is fried  Up to now I can t stop thinking about it  so I apologize in advance if this review was kinda messy   Random Thoughts    This book has one of the most intricate and interesting concepts such as the dictatorship and totalitarianism of Big Brother  Newspeak  eradicating words to limit thought  concepts  ideas  feelings  etc  was fascinating yet frightening   the punishments from Room 101  I ve always wondered where the term came from   the love and lies from The Ministry of Truth and The Ministry of Love  Ingsoc  and more  I don t even know how Orwell comes up with this fantastic ideas  Genius  BUT FUCKING SCARY   The slogan always gets me WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  Although I wasn t attached to any of the characters  I actually found them to be quite unlikeable   they still managed to be original and engaging  They re certainly not cardboard cutouts  they were grey and flawed characters which really compels me to them  That is a good sign   Winston was a terrible character  this does not touch upon the characterization by Orwell   He was one of those cowardly bitches  if you know what I m talking about  You know  although he is a rebel against Big Brother and the Party  he used and he wanted the poor people to risk their own lives to sacrifice for the Party yet he never did a sacrifice of his own  He would think he s fighting against Big Brother by  view spoiler  having sex with Julie  hide spoiler   but that wasn t much of help at all because it was all private  And the reason he fought towards the end was to impress Julie   view spoiler  but if you examine the events of Room 101  he was tortured enough to make him plead for them to do it to Julia  meaning he only cared about her looks and not about what s really in her  Oh that bastard   hide spoiler     Oh and it also seems that he hates beautiful women for the sole reason that he couldn t have sex with them  Oh that misogynist  Oh that sexist   Every time I placed 1984 down  I couldn t stop thinking about it even to this day when I m reading other books  It was that thought provoking  It truly is a warning for us  just like what Orwell stated  Prophetic indeed    It was so sad realizing that all the children were taught and brainwashed to love Big Brother and the Party  Since they rewrote  reconstructed and changed the history in the past  it wasn t hard to convince them  really   He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past    The worldbuilding in this novel is amazing  Orwell was able to construct this horrifying  dystopian world which all came as a prediction from his mind  And the world was realistic  a warning of our future   the concepts surrounding it were pretty great  as I had mentioned earlier   therefore creating this visionary nightmare   To be honest  Parts 1 and 2 of this book were pretty slow  And that is not necessarily a negative thing for this novel because Orwell had to introduce us to his world  most of Part 1 consisted of worldbuilding   meaning there was a lot of description and monologue  a lot of showing not telling  So this book was world driven  you can put it  But after you get past that  Part 3 just blew it  It was amazing  It became extremely fast paced  it was more horrifying and frightening  Room 101   gripping  unpredictable  all those good adjectives  And that ending left me feeling awe struck and I just stared at my Kindle screen for a long amount of time  you can say  goes back to it being thought provoking   To put it simply  1984 is a gripping and frightening read  It twisted my thoughts  it made me think about things that I wouldn t normally think in real life  Oh yes  it really pushed me and scared me to the core  Do you realize that the past  starting from yesterday  has been actually abolished  If it survives anywhere  it s in a few solid objects with no words attached to them  like that lump of glass there  Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution  Every record has been destroyed or falsified  every book has been rewritten  every picture has been repainted  every statue and street and building has been renamed  every date has been altered  And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute  History has stopped  Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right  Oh  and remember BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  I put this book on my  horror  bookshelf  I found as I was contemplating my own review and thought of what I learned from _1984_  How is it different from today or how could it be written about today  commenting on the status quo of today  while projecting it in the future Well  the most popular Goodreads review of this book answered my questions  by putting it altogether   all the shit that we experience over time that makes you cringe  but then your attention is summarily moved onto the next  catastrophe  the  news  wants to distract you with  so you never have time to think it all the way through  Nor is it possible to pick a favorite cause to fight against because there are so many things that are just so plainly WRONG happening  the stuff that the people around you just let happen with nary a second thought  so much making you cringe  every fucking day  that it s overwhelming  Perhaps It s not the government holding us all back and in  but a huge part of it is the greed of the corporations who control the politicians  The worst is that its the people in our society and their insecurity and general sheepishness that makes it all stick  Social control comes from the people around you  who give the power to the government and give the money to the corporations  who in turn tell them what to do  The idiots do it with a smile on their faces because they wouldnt know what to do otherwise  Look at 1984  it was his neighbors who kept him most in line who he had the most to fear bc they had so completely bought into the system that they d become eager spies  with a mission to keep everyone in line  lest it upset their own meager since of security  wh nHn f   m 2015  wh h   Hdth lrwy  tq

believe whatever propaganda is served up by the Government Poor Winston Smith is the main character who dreams of a better world but knows in the end that only through compliance will he survive  ln

I read through it  A well thought of scenario of a future frozen at a particular time in history where the government is so powerful  totalitarian would not do complete justice to describe it  Wonderful book   Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere else   George Orwell did not miss a beat  By thoroughly establishing a world of shackles  the occasional yet significant introduction of Newspeak  the doctrine  and  the principles of Ingsoc  it makes it difficult not to doublethink  On one hand  as O Brien challenges our existing beliefs on certain concepts such as power  the power of the masses  etc   the understanding of the philosophy behind the Party s beliefs and methods deepens and even starts to make sense  Though in awe  one may catch oneself shaking one s head in disapproval or even in disgust to marvel at such a hopeless  dark world O Brien has painted to Winston  and  ultimately  to the us  the readers  Two opposites co existing in that specific moment  Our own doublethink moment Orwell did not only succeed in  cleansing  our minds  quoting O Brien   Intellectually there is very little wrong with you  It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress   Orwell definitely made sure that we have made progress emotionally too  Feelings of hatred  disappointment  shock  depression  and despair will surely seep through the pages and fill you up  eventually  leaving you with a feeling of worry  and  defeat  or  hope  if you are an optimistic one  As for the metaphysical discussions on politics and ideologies  I believe that is a separate discussion all in all  I now understand why this book is studied in literature or political science classes for a whole semester In general  a guaranteed contemplative reading experience that will push you to care and to be critical with the world you are living in  Enjoy this freedom now and let us always carry the hope that thoughtcrime and the Thought Police will never exist     He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   How is this so incredibly relevant today  How did George Orwell literally predict the future  This is unbelievably good political commentary and I LOVE IT a lot Potentially my favourite part was early on  when some good news came on and Winston immediately thought something bad would be announced  Immediately afterwards  it was announced that the chocolate ration had been decreased It s exactly how the current UK Government and Media work  Incredible   One of my all time favorite books   hdhh

The Party  the government  controlling and monitoring you at all times even to the point of your thought might have very much come true when the author  George Orwell  was writing the book in the late 1940s  Orwells interpretation of the totalian government that rules over  England  wants complete power over people not to use it for something  but just to know that they have such an eminence power of people  In the book its explained as believing 2 2 5  it represents the fear that everyone in that society hold due to the Party s power  The book follows Winston and Julia s hatred for the Party and love for eachother that grows as they come closer to finding the rebellion  rwy  k lf    fy kl SfH  mn SfHt hdhh lrwyh kn yswrny shk rhyb  n jwrj  wrwyl Hy yrzq    frwy  khdhh l ymkn  n tkwn qd

n tnts     This novel is legend already in its title  i will have to try collect my thoughts to write a short decent review that tells what i thought about this novel  I was lucky i knew nothing about it except the title  the kind of future it was and the story  themes wasnt spoiled beforehand  Its an immsense  profound novel that deserve every bit acclaim  legend status it has    1984 is one of the best book I have EVER READ  George Orwell has done a great job integrating political and social fear into a meaningful and dystopian type novel  The book starts with Winston Smith  a member of the Outer Party of Oceania  a fictional nation that annexed England and watches their citizens 24 7   But Winston is different than all other Oceania s citizens  His memory works and he can think  He works in the Ministry of Truth  where historical records are often changed so no citizen can learn from the past and no one can deny Big Brother s  a public figure who is advertised everywhere especially in posters saying  Big Brother is Watching You   predictions of the future and explanations of the past  Winston learns that he is not alone for he meets a women named Julia who shares his feelings and understand him  As the chapter go along Orwell incorporates romance  betrayal and fear into a great and fast paced read  I would say that this book has withstood the test of time because it s a warning of how one can use our fears and emotion to create a society in which the government has to keep to keep the masses ignorant in order to stay in power  Ilk Baslarda biraz okumakta zorlandim sanirim ramazaninda etkisi oldu biraz ancak sonra toparladim suphesiz simdiye kadar okudugum en karanlik distopia idi kitap hakkinda soylenecek o kadar cok sey var ki aslinda ama hala Kitabin etkisindesiniz ve dogru kelimeleri secemiyorsunuz kesinlikle okunmasi gereken bir kitap mutlaka okunmasi gereken kitap okuyun ki simdiki Cicili bicili distopia lardan kopup gercek bir distopia okuyun WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH1984   the world is divited into three parts   Estasia  Eurasia and Oceana  and Winston Smith seems to be the only one who despises the dictatorship of Big Brother  People are being watched  spied on and manipulated 24 7  and the Thought Police will have no mercy for you if you show any kind of emotions  However  there is no way to escape the madness  Even when Winston meets Julia  a young woman with no signs of fear and shares his opinion about Big Brother  he has to be extremely cautious because the government s moves are unpredictable   The reader fallows each step of Winston Smith  an employee for the Ministry of Truth in London  We learn about his fears but most importantly about his vision about a better future without pressure and force and get sucked into his hate toward Big Brother There is also Julia  a young  even if under cover  rebellious woman  we get to know about half way into the story  O Brien  a stranger that seems to think just like Winston is also part of the story and  of course the personalized character of the government  Big Brother  is omnipresent The story is fast paced and suspending  yet almost frightening and the writing style is timeless  I recommened this classic novel to anyone who is interested in dystopian world buildings but timeless morals of the human race I really enjoyed the read  lys kl m twq h jwrj  wrwyl qd Hdth wlkn t thyr lrwy  blqry  kbyr wblnhy  sh rt bHqd kbyr  l  lHkwmt wlHkm lty trhb lns bTrq mbshr  w Gyr mbshr  wt tbr Ht  ltfkyr jrym   w km  Tlq  lyh  wrwyl   jrym  lfkr    Brilliant  Mind blowing  This novel gave me much more to think about than  Inception  did  At first I wasn t sure I would like this novel since it was evident from the first page that it was literary political social science fiction  really  what could be a more boring topic to a pleasure reader like myself    But Orwell proved me wrong  His clear and unaffected prose  no Nabokovian air in here  and it 1984 was written about 8 years earlier than  Lolita   lured me in  and before I knew it  I was drawn in silent horror as the life of Winston Smith unfolded before my eyes  a kind of waking nightmare that is almost akin to death  It may be a literary work  full of ideas  but this does not detract from the enjoyment of reading  I was genuinely worried for the safety of Winston  surprised at the turn of his life and relationship with Julia  and even more flabbergasted when in the end things were not as they seemed  and everything was pulled inside out  Spoiler   Ok  the end of this book is amazing  Not only is it great from a literary perspective  but Orwell also added something extra that was completely genius As you re approaching the end  the action becomes more and more intense  and your heart is just aching for things to turn around  This whole time  however  you have hope  No matter how desperate things seem to get you can feel in your right hand  a whole stack of pages left unread  So you constantly have this feeling of hope  a feeling that roots itself in the physical and material aspect of the book itself  This can t be the end because you can physically feel more of the book that s left to be read Wrong The end of this book completely blindsights you  because as your hopes for Winston are dwindling  you still have that optimism  despite there being less and less pages to read  And then it happens  The book just ends  But what about the 20 or so pages left to be read  They re titled  The Principles of Newspeak   Brilliant  Orwell threw in that extra physical dimension into the book  and the end completely takes you by surprise  There s no time to prepare yourself for what happens  There s no margin of time for you to cope with the book s brutal reality  There s no indicator that things are going to happen that way  because the whole time you want to believe in something else  not reality  The reality that is created is just as real as those phony pages at the end of the book  Awesome  I don t know what end I like better this one or Candide s     y ktb ystTy  lktb   n lHDr   wlktb lmthqf ystTy  lktbh  n

like looming totalitarian regimens  it was a frightening story in many ways  As Winston  a rebel of a dystopian and discerning society in which a totalitarian regime named Big Brother watches his every move along with most all other citizens  makes his way through the limited world he must struggle with isolation  love  fear  and betrayal  One of my favorite books of all time here  Orwell was a glorious writer  and greatly concerned of a future without basic freedoms  It s quite amazing to tie in the book with what was happening in the real world during its writing and publication  which was the Soviets communist struggle against the Allies  Its amazing Orwell did not recieve more backlash for what would have been an amazingly controversial book at the time  But all and all  it reads slow and a I loved every word  Orwell is great at crafting a tale  I give a 10 10  would reread and reread and reread again   km hy mr b  hdhh lrwy  wlmkhyf Hqan fyh hw  n lqry  y lm whw ytnql byn

once you read you are never the same person anymore  it s amazing and overwhelming how a novel written in the 1940s could have that great influence on generation after generation of writers and film makers worldwide  it s not merely a political novel or a novel that s against suppression and dictatorship  it s much deeper  therefore I m just going to quote some significant parts of the novel  He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date  In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct   Orthodoxy means not thinking  not needing to think  Orthodoxy is unconsciousness    I really like this one   Everything faded into mist  The past was erased  the erasure was forgotten  the lie became truth   In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five  and you would have to believe it  It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later  the logic of their position demanded it    and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise  but that they might be right   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows   If you kept the small rules you could break the big ones   The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses  mere feelings  were of no account  while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world   They can t get inside you  If you can feel that staying human is worth while  even when it can t have any result whatever  you ve beaten them   The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world  Goods must be produced  but they must not be distributed  And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare   War is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent   Physical facts could not be ignored  In philosophy  or religion  or ethics  or politics  two and two might make five  but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four   that should actually be taught to school children   The masses never revolt of their own accord  and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed  Indeed  so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison  they never even become aware that they are oppressed   They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly   does that sound familiar   Because the inquisition kills its enemies in the open  and killed them while they were still on repentant  in fact  it killed them because they were unrepentant  Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs  Naturally all the glory along to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned him  and eventually  Now I will tell you the answer to my question  It is this  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake  We are not interested in the good of others  we are interested solely in power  pure power  What pure power means you will understand presently  We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing  All the others  even those who resembled ourselves  were cowards and hypocrites  The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods  but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives  They pretended  perhaps they even believed  that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time  and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal  We are not like that  We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it  Power is not a means  it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power  Now you begin to understand me   The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind  happiness is better   I like this one too   mn  fDl lrwyt lt  qr th lklmt ln twfyh Hqh   ltrjm  knt jyd  jdan    mn  fDl ltrjmtw lkn lnskh  lnjlyzy   wft lGrD bshkl  fDl   A favourite  A must for everyone to read                         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY 2   2   5 Say anything enough and it becomes true SLAVERY IS FREEDOM                         I finished this book a few hours ago  I don t think i ll be able to sleep tonight  I finished it at 8pm  after that I have no idea what happened to me for the next hour  I found myself lying flat on my back  staring at the ceiling of my dorm room  I don t think anything has ever affected me the way this has  I couldn t get out of bed for even longer than that  I struggled my way out of bed and eventually somehow let my mind switch to auto pilot to guide me to the dining hall so I could grab some dinner  I honestly don t even remember what I ate or how much it cost  It seemed that all I could think about for the next few hours was    nothing  my brain was fried  my world was shaken  my reality was being interrogated   Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood  It took me a while to get through this because I wanted to read it very carefully and absorb everything this had to say  I m sure i ll even need a re read to properly understand all that happened in this to get a proper feel for the subtle undertones Orwell threw in this  This book is hands down a spiritual experience  People told me I would get depressed after reading this  to which I would say that that s exactly the kind of feeling which tells me that I enjoyed a piece of dystopian fiction  This transcended depression  this overthrew any feeling I had ever felt before  I didn t know how to register what I had just experienced  Everyone I met after reading this thought I had smoked something or was under the influence of something  which I most certainly was    THIS    I don t know if anything else is ever going to make me feel like this again   If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  for ever  The content of this book is fairly simple to understand  the theme starts off like any other totalitarian dystopian novel  The interesting bits are in the little details Orwell changed to make this truly into one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written  The sheer scope of Orwell s thought process gives sends shivers down my spine  How he so coherently formed the arguments of Big Brother and the Party and the way the party practiced absolute domination of thought  action  feeling and emotion was not only brilliant  but mind numbingly terrifying to even fathom  Newspeak   Don t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible  because there will be no words in which to express it   Doublethink   The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war  the Ministry of Truth with lies  the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation  These contradictions are not accidental   nor do they result from from ordinary hypocrisy  they are deliberate exercises in doublethink The concept of Newspeak  Doublethink  Thought Crime  Thought Police  telescreens  all of it was so drastically different than what I ever imagined at first  The scary part was when I realized that all of that happened in there    wasn t really anything out of fiction  All of it    ALL OF IT  has happened  been happening or will happen in the not so distant future  I don t know how society is going to turn out to be  but I don t think if i m part of something like this  i ll even know if I hate it  How does one dislike something when the concept of liking and disliking has been eliminated from existence  The last few pages of this book were by far the most disturbing ones  All throughout the novel  the protagonist keeps convincing himself that his thoughts were his own  that no one  not even big brother could infiltrate them and that was according to him the party s greatest flaw  We all know how that turned out to be  I feel so much hate for the party to what they did to Winston  I feel all this rage because they even took that away from him  The hubris of the party was clear when they told Winston that they would not tolerate any form of insubordination  even in death  Even in death  Winston could not have his own thoughts  I think that was what brought all of what had happened in the novel home  That ending sentence  which in my opinion has to be the greatest conclusive statement i ve ever read   view spoiler   I loved Big Brother    hide spoiler   To die hating them  that was freedom  The thing that terrified me the most was how the party controlled even the most logical of facts and could easily condition anyone to believe that the most basic of axioms were false  They conditioned Winston to believe that 2 2 was actually 5  Not make him say it  made him believe it  When O Brien held up 3 fingers  Winston saw 5  Just writing that gave me severe goosebumps    I d rather kill myself than live in a world where even my thoughts aren t private  It s a beautiful thing  the destruction of words  There is so much in this book that I need to think about  It will probably keep me up for many days trying just to understand all of the things that happened in this  but I know one thing for sure    there will never be anything like this ever again  I salute you George Orwell for melting my brain from the grave   P S  What the fuck did I just readP P S  Seriously thinking about getting  WE ARE THE DEAD  tattooed somewhere  Another book everyone should read  Classic  And informative  And well done  a very nice experience     George Orwell Im not going to praise his novel as others did in the reviews    I have to say  I extremely enjoyed reading this Novel   That s All        And highly recommend reading it 1984 di George

fkrhm dkhl  qlk   lnhDwy This is one of my favourite books that we read at school  and it is one of my favourite books overall  George Orwell created 1984 as a futuristic dystopia where the government  or the Party  has control over everything  Citizens have completely lost their right to privacy  There are telescreens in almost every room  where the government can hear and see you  The Thought Police are almost everywhere  so you cannot talk about the Party  else there will be horrific consequences  Even something such as love is taken away from you  The government makes sure that no one has a passionate relationship with anyone  relationships are strictly allowed so the couple has kids  The government even has control over the language  where every so often words get wiped out of the dictionary  trying to make language simpler  All of the literature and news articles are re worded and re written  making it highly impossible to learn anything about the past  The protagonist Winston Smith starts to understand and realize the harsh rules of Big Brother  the speaker of the Party that no one has actually ever seen  and starts to revolt  The fist way he revolts is by buying a diary and writing things such as  Down with Big Brother   and all of his feelings towards the Party  At his job  where he edits newspapers  he runs into this girl named Julia  who takes him to a secret hideout where they talk badly about the Party  Everything they do together is strictly against the Party s rules  Winston Smith has an underlying desire to be in a group of other like him looking towards overthrowing the Party  that he thinks still exists  The day Winston and Julia both get caught is when you learn how the Party really works  and the plans for the future  You get an inside look at how it runs things  and how it changes people George Orwell did an excellent job at creating a simply terrifying futuristic book  I believe everyone should read this because it is just a completely new idea that I m sure most people haven t thought about before  This book made me realize how great it is to have privacy and many  many more things  Even things as small as loving a pet  that would be completely out of the question in this book  Some of the Party s rules are just so unfathomable that it makes this book exciting to read and learn about how things are done in George Orwell s version of 1984 I rate this a 5 out of 5  It was an extraordinary read and I found that once I picked it up I couldn t put it back down  I ended up reading the whole book in one day  It captivates you and makes you want to know what happens next  I think absolutely anyone would enjoy this book and find it extremely interesting  Words fail  Not because of the genius contained within this books pages  though it is there but because this book has meant almost everything to me  More in the life I have built around what it has done to me    what it has made of me  than what it contained  I hardly remember the begining    I do not think it was memorable  but the rest lives in every thought I have had since  All these years later and I still love big brother      1984 is a book about a anti Utopian world in which the government watches everything you do  and u can be arrested and tortured for something just as simple as thinking the government is a fraud  The book follow Winston Smith who dislikes this government and feels it is not as saintly as it tries to portray itself  This gets him into some trouble when he meets a girl who hes loves  love in itself in a thought crime not even counting the actions they commit  Both him and the girl by the name of Julie both are wannabe revolutionaries  At one point in the story Winston meets this man by the name of O Brally who he believes is a member of a group of revolutions know as the brotherhood  O Brain invites Winston over to his house and gives him a book by the leader of the brotherhood known as Goldstein  This turns out to be a trap though and the thought police catch and imprison Winston  for months they torture him  until finally using his phobia of rats they break him This book is a book that really makes u think  why should i trust my government Why would they do that what are they gaining what are they losing   It really makes you think about your spot in the world and how you can change and affect it 5 This book was so good  I loved it from beginning to end  The story is basically about a dystopian society  The book was written before 1984 and it the author wanted to  predict  what the world would be like in 1984  The world is nothing like it is today  The names of countrys are changed  everything is so different that I took me a while to figure out where the story took place  The story takes place in London and revolves around a man named Winston Smith  He knows that there is something wrong with the government but doesn t know what to do  The government watches you all the time and they control what you think  who you talk to  and every little aspect of your life  Winston seeks out people to help him figure out what to do with the government and eventually finds a girl  I can t say much without spoiling the book  One reason why I liked it was because it wasn t rushed  The book played out somethings and elaborated on thoughts so it wasn t very fast paced  I liked how it had details about everything basically because there was hardly and dialogue  Another reason why I liked it was because it let you see how things can be  It was a different world than what were used to and it was interesting reading how the world would work if it were like this  I really enjoy reading dystopian books so thats also why I enjoyed the book  I would most definitely recommend this to a friend    The best books    are those that tell you what you know already    This was one of my favorite books in high school  The intensity of it kept my attention from start to finish  a feat not easily done by a classic  As I read through this as an adult  I realized how prophetic Orwell truly was  Today  I read this book and found it anxiety producing because of how accurate Orwell s vision truly was  If you haven t read this and always wondered about it  read it now  It will impress upon you how valuable you freedom is  It will also illustrate why constant war states are destructive to the liberty and freedom of the world  Orwell knew the value of privacy  which is wholly under represented in today s political discourse  1984 is as important today as it was when it was written in 1948   Much has been written  said and discussed about George Orwell s novel 1984 and I highly doubt I will be able to contribute to the existing heap of reviews  opinions and analyses  But   to sum up some random thoughts that occur to me at present   I feel that 1984 masterfully extends beyond the boundaries of the diegesis and grasps the reader like few other books  I have read  have managed to do  Whilst I would not want to go as far as arguing that it delivers fear  I do feel that 1984 evokes a genuine anxiety  It makes its readers aware of the fragility of the human  in both body and spirit  This fragility is not exclusive to Winston  in fact  many of us   including myself   are weaker than him  We carry around smartphones  each linked to at least one social network and keeping our profiles up to date   and by doing so  voluntarily accumulating a database of personal information and handing it over to  for example  Google and Facebook  However  their  among others  intents probably  we assume  differ from 1984 s Inner Party  whatever they were in reality   For more on this  see Andrew Keen s Digital Vertigo The reason why I gave 1984 five out of five stars is because it is a timeless essay  arguably more relevant to the present than it was in 1949  thought provoking  especially in part two and three  and it provides a well written critique on totalitarianism  That s it   for now    To understand a news commentator s reference to  Orwellian  politics  read this expunged facts rewrite  of history classic  Full review at sff book review By far one of the scariest and most important books I have ever read  Thinking about it still chills me to the bone  Not only does it offer a great and thrilling story  vivid characters  and fantastic writing  but it is also as relevant today as it must have been for Orwell when he wrote it in 1948  This is not a happy read  it will not make you feel good  it will not leave you much hope  but it will make you think and question our society  And that may just be the most important thing  It all comes together at the very end with the last sentence  Creepiest line ever   Plot Summary Winston Smith is the main character of this novel and works for the government Party which is ruling over Oceania   one of the three nations that include the entire globe  Oceania is led by a totalitarian government which disallows all acts of individuality or any thoughts of individuality as well  The Party s leader is known as Big Brother whom we never see in the actual novel except for on posters and videos  The  Party   as it is referred to  is in control of absolutely everything  They control the past  present  and future  Winston himself works in the Ministry of Truth whose priority is to alter history in order to agree with the Party s present actions  All measures are taken as to eliminate opportunities for low ranking workers to have rebellious thoughts such as literally deleting words from the vocabulary that which allow them to do this  The Party is always watching everyone s actions on what they call  telescreens  so it s extremely difficult to get away with any crime  Winston fantasizes of joining a group named the Brotherhood whose objective is to ultimately overthrow the Party  An opportunity comes to him when he meets a man known as O Brien who pretends to be a member of the Brotherhood so he can set a trap for Winston  Also  in the midst of all this Winston has fallen in love with a women he used to despise named Julia  Julia also has the same ambitions for overthrowing the Party and meets with O Brien together with Winston  Finally  soldiers take Winston and Julia to the Ministry of Love because they have committed open acts of rebellion against the Party  O Brien reveals himself here as being a faithful spy of the Inner Party and from then on spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston until he finally submits himself to the Party  Winston s greatest fear is rats  O Brien sends him to  Room 101  to face his dreaded fear where he finally gives in to what O Brien wanted all along  Winston begs them to torture Julia and not himself  The Party has successfully cracked Winston and cleansed him of all rebellious thoughts against the Party so they release him into society once again where he has learned to love Big Brother  Personal Response to Book It was very interesting to read a book which concerned the future which is already in the past  1984 was written in 1949 about the future taking place in the year 1984  However  of course  it is now 2010 and 1984 has gone and passed  The story line itself was very easy to follow  but there were many parts that were hard to digest because of the complex theories that Orwell wrote about  I think that this story was written as a warning or a prediction of what the world could be in the future   the entire Earth ruled by totalitarian governments  I learned from the story that Orwell meant to say that no matter how hard we tried we would not be able to overpower the government that was in power  He was saying that everyone is getting brainwashed into following the governments rule without any individuality or freedom  First  Orwell presents a glimmer of hope when Winston thinks that if hope is here  it must lie with the  proles  who have the most freedom out of everyone  This hope is crushed when Orwell brings in O Brien who brainwashes Winston and brings everything back to  peace   This is obvious when Winston tries to rebel against the Party  but his attempts fail because O Brien was secretly a spy all along  1984 was very enjoyable and it completely opened my eyes to government politics  Orwell s style of writing was difficult to read at times  but it was necessary to get his point across by using elaborate words and phrases to express himself  Orwell s lectures on politics and the totalitarian government were not boring at all  however  they were quite fascinating  At one point of the story I felt the same way as Winston because of the way that our life is governed by School during the School year  Five days a week for nine months I have the exact same routine  The only difference is that his is much more drastic  The main characters made for a very exciting story  Winston and Julia were the humans who managed to rack up enough courage and stand up for what little freedom they managed to salvage  but in the end failed  I feel that Orwell is saying that totalitarian governments were going to take over and everyone would obey them completely without chance of regaining their freedom  O Brien played a great role of capturing and deceiving which is how much of the world works today  Overall  it was an amazing book I highly recommend it to everyone  Favourite Quotes 1  Here Winston is talking about an incident in the past when he had an opportunity to push his mother of a cliff if he d been the same person that he is now   Only because I prefer a positive to a negative  In this game that we re playing  we can t win  Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds  that s all  142    He further explains that it would not have mattered whether or not he killed her because she was insignificant  Either way it was a failure  just if he had killed her it could ve been a better failure  I think lots of people can connect to this because if you re in a situation where you re going to lose or fail you should still give it your all as to go out with pride 2  These is the primary slogan of the Party as it frequently repeated in the novel   War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  6    It took a while for this slogan to grow on me  but eventually it became one of my favourites because of the controversy in each of the three concepts  After learning what  doublethink  was I finally understood this slogan  The Party is able to force all citizens to believe whatever they wish with enough power 3  Next  these aren t really quotes  but they re titles given to departments in the government and are related to the official party slogan  This was really cool how Orwell showed that the Party could force doublethink on all the citizens  The Ministry of Peace being in charge of War related issues  The Ministry of Love in charge of torturing people like Winston for committing crime  and the Ministry of Truth in charge of alter historic events in order to agree with what the government is saying currently 4  This quote is from when O Brien explains what power truly is to Winston   Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing  279    I completely agree with what O Brien is saying here because I think that no one has true power over us until they are able to change what we believe and think  We can be forced to say things that we don t truly mean  but it s hard to make someone mean it 5  Winston writes this in his diary   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious  74    This is a very nihilistic comment and I think was a very key thought that Winston had in his mind at the time  He was writing this in reference to those who did not have the presence of mind to rebel and stand for freedom  Winston realizes that until the citizens snap out of this mind control they will never rebel  but they cannot snap out of it until they have rebelled  Basically  he s saying that there s no hope  I loved this book when I read it as a teenager Now the thing that annoys me when I read reviews about this book  is that a lot of readers assume that it is a science fiction novel and was Orwell s actual prediction of a future set in that particular year  That is missing the point  This is one of those dystopian novels that is set in the future so that the author can use ideas to reflect our own attitudes to politics of contemporary times  Having been involved in more than one war  including the Spanish civil war   Orwell s book was only named and set in 1984 because those numbers were a rearrangement of 1948  the year which Orwell wrote this  Orwell fully expected the novel to reflect the ideas and times he had experienced  and to explore the attitudes towards the individual s place in society after the past 35 40 yrs or more had seen Europe torn apart with wars based on some extreme ideologies  Nazism   the Holocaust  fascism  commnunism etc etc   For me  it was not the   Big Brother is watching you   thing that I thought was the most chilling about this novel  what I felt very strongly was that when it came down to it  an individual s love for another individual and their spirit is often dwarfed under the daily grind of the rest of the World that you live in  Love seems like a superflouos luxury  an ideal that can never really be attained  For the individual ideals can be betrayed in a heartbeat to save oneself and in order to gain happiness conforming to every other area of society as a whole As a teenager  when I read this  obviously exploring adult relationships including romance were of interest to me  I had high ideals  I felt I would die for my friends or a noble cause if I had to  But 1984 showed me that human beings are ultimately frail  and will and can betray   it is just a fact that even love is selfish  And it is often the nameless machine of  society  that presses down on any individuals who cannot or do not want to conform  Rather than being held up as heros for their individuality  people who are  different  are often chipped away at for years  until eventually  they would be capable of self preservation and the sort of betrayal seen in 1984    I still believe there are those out there with exceptional ideals  However  age has taught me  that the majority of humans will drop any action or cause in order to improve things for themselves  When they have a family  I think doing things for little beings is no less selfish  kids are really just extensions of our own bodies  People always opt for self preservation  and you see it time and again that folk are doing things because they   want a better life for their family    How often do we see individuals who truly sacrifice themselves for another s benefit  Rarely  People give money to charity   but they would not do so if it meant they really went without    I am not saying I am any better  but just that for me  1984 was a wake up call to the utter selfishness of human behaviour and the pointlessness of trying to stick out from the crowd  Avete presente i metdi oppressivi e tirannici del nazismo e del comunismo  Ecco dimenticateli  Con  1984  vi immergerete in un mondo  annullato   l umanita che conosce l Uomo come singolo  come persona unica e fisica  non esiste piu    Ora l intera umanita e il Partito  il Partito e il Grande Fratello  Tu  singolo  non esisti  esiste il Grande Fratello  Ma cos e il GF  Il GF e un entita fittizia  un unico concetto di vita  che spia e tiene sotto controllo  per l eternita   gli uomini  L oligarchia del GF e resa forte da paura  rabbia e odio  Questa e la filosofia del Partito e del GF La liberta e schiavitu  La guerra e pace  L ignoranza e forza  Ha detta di tutti questi tre principi  sarebbero stupidi   da ignoranti  e folli  vi sbagliate  Ci sono dei buoni motivi per il quale il GF ne ha fatto il suo slogan 1  Se invertiamo le parole e quindi La schiavitu e liberta vi accorgerete che e accettabile in un mondo come questo  descritto da Orwell  Se non esiste l uomo come singolo  che ve ne fate della liberta  Sarete liberi per fare cosa poi  Morire di profonda solitudine 2  L ignoranza e forza  perche se sarete liberi dalla scienza controllerete la realta  Controllando la realta potrete manipolare il presente e il passato  Il Partito  per esistere  vi vuole  annullati   privi di qualsiasi arte o impulso creativo  Se ci fosse il progresso allora si farebbe un altra Rivoluzione  che romperebbe l equilibrio raggiunto  Quindi sarebbe solo inutile 3  La guerra e pace  il mondo e stato scisso in tre grandi nazioni  Oceania  Eurasia  Estasia  e ha stabilito una guerra eterna che tiene in equilibrio lo stesso mondo  La guerra  in fondo  e come la pace  queste tre grandi nazioni potrebbero accordarsi e riappacificarsi per l eternita  Ma allora perche scegliere proprio la guerra  Per distruggere il consumismo  distruggere tutto cio di cui l uomo ha abusato in termini economici  Sia chiaro questa guerra non e una guerra  normale   ma solo d elite Un vero capolavoro  distopistico  che stravolge la realta  in cui vediamo come protagonista Winston Smith  l ultimo  essere umano   db ltnbw t  ns

powerful  deep  genius and enlightening Although I at times failed to comprehend what the writer implicated I still could sense the author s farsightedness  Reading it was not always  fun   it takes times  Probably due to its intricate language  So read it when you have a clear mind that s striving for something that would trigger it  Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious  First read in 2005If you haven t read this book  then you shouldn t be wasting time with this review  I know many people have to read it for school  but I didn t happen upon it until one long summer  This book is so powerful   it changes you  It will grab hold of you and never let go Updated ReviewI always tell people that 1984 is my favorite book  at least that s what I tell people that I can t tell the title of my actual favorite book to   Lamb  The Gospel According to Biff Christ s Childhood Pal   If I m honest  I d put 1984 at number two overall  number one in literary classics  so I figured I should reread it again for the third  fourth   time to have a firm appreciation of it It never fails to blow my mind  The fact that Orwell could have such insight into the modern age when he wrote this in 1949 amazes me  His predictions for technology were very insightful  as well as how monitored we are in these modern times  I m not talking about government monitoring though  I m referring to the choices we make when we live our lives on social media This book was meant as a wake up call  and I just don t think we really have ever heard it  If you haven t read it  do so  Attuale  tremendamente attuale  Con la sua durezza e la sua forza questo libro ci invita a riflettere su temi molto caldi anche nella societa moderna  Avevo letto e commentato alcuni estratti gia alle superiori  ma la lettura integrale di 1984 sicuramente non puo fare a meno di scioccare e turbare il lettore mettendolo davanti a una realta cruda  malata ma soprattuto reale o verosimile per quanto riguarda certi aspetti della societa descritta  Orwell ci ha fatto dono di uno strumento importantissimo per criticare la nostra societa e il nostro rapporto con essa  Lo consiglio veramente a tutti  invitando ciascuno a prendere il tempo necessario per leggero con attenzione sebbene lo stile dell autore lo renda anche molto avvincente e dinamico  This is my 2nd favorite book of all time   My first is Catch 22   I chose to re read it since I m going through Wil Wheaton s Goodreads list and because it had been over a decade since I last read it  I felt a sort of reminiscent angst while re reading this novel  I remembered how I felt the first time I read the novel as a teenager  angry at the injustices of the world and feeling powerless to stop it  except with the tiny acts of rebellion I could commit inside my mind and through peaceful demonstration  My main weapon was knowledge and I tried to educate myself in the problem that mattered the most to me  the preservation of basic human rights  Mostly I read novels  followed the news  and involved myself in organizations like Amnesty International  Thank you  Mr  Coraggio   In the end  I felt like I had deceived myself  The more I learned  the more I tried  the more helpless I felt against the unending onslaught of apathy I noticed from the general public  People were so content with handing everything over to God or politicians that they failed to take action themselves because SOMEONE ELSE WOULD DO IT  When I joined the Army  I felt a lot like Winston  I clung to my idealism and my beliefs  intent on not succumbing to the brainwashing and Stockholm syndrome I knew that was coming  Like Winston fending off the party with his rebellious thoughts while following the crowd  I harbored my counter culture thoughts with a righteousness that afforded me the opportunity to sustain myself when all I wanted to do was scream THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE at every other soldier I saw  Winston believed that hope lay in the proles  the Army showed me that hope lay in the average citizen  What I was doing before I joined  it didn t feel like enough  But it was enough  It s a start  it s a spark  and sparks turn to ideas and ideas turn to action and action can turn into change  Winston began to slowly believe the propaganda that O Brien was forcing on him  The only thing that kept him from fully embracing everything as truth were his feelings toward Julia  He fought until they eventually got to him  In the end he gave in and he loved Big Brother  I never gave in that much when I was in the Army  But some things definitely stick  I can t stand to see a flag folded incorrectly or improperly stored  Uniform violations irk me  I still use  male  and  female  as opposed to  man  and  woman   And yet  I still consider the source whenever I read information  When listening to others  opinions I try to decipher how they re influenced and remind myself that opinion is a basic right as well  even if there s a nagging in the back of my mind that tells me some have earned it more than others  It s like doublethink leaked into my head  Ben Pian Du Shi Zai Ju

lzmn  Twl thlth   shhr wknt tmny l frG mnh  bd  Probably one of the scariest books ever written  Nineteen Eighty Four  Orwell s dystopian masterpiece  I had high hopes for this book  and boy I m impressed  This is a blend of philosophy  psychology  and sociology in one essay  If one can imagine the ultimate totalitarian regiment that can possibly come to existence then it s The Party  I like the noir tone  darkest shit I eve ever read   the pale and colorless atmosphere  the unstable and at the same time stable psychological state of the Outer Party members  I noted some friction  a fight between Idealism  everything in the mind  vs  Realism  reality outside the mind   Orwell really struck some good arguments for Idealism  even now we can t be sure 100  that reality exists  but realism is favored for its practicality and appeal  I didn t expect a romantic tone  but its tragic end satisfied my hunger    Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere else  Not in the individual mind  which can make mistakes  and in any case soon perishes  only in the mind of the Party  which is collective and immortal   It was midnight  and I couldn t scrap the smile out of my face upon reading this passage     You re only a rebel from the waist downwards   he told her   To rebel  is to channel the fury against The Party not against an imaginary fiend that the Party created    I hate purity  I hate goodness  I don t want virtue to exist anywhere  I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones   In a couple of words  to control the masses you need to induce ignorance  brainwashing  censorship and surveillance  and after all  control by fear and terror  That s all it takes  and this book is a grand picture of that  What struck me most is how the Party conceals the truth  it s by making everyone believe the same lie  by falsifying everything and deleting any evidence  anything that disprove that lie and approve the truth  and when everyone believe without questioning what they are told  the high chance of conformity will prevail over the questioning nature of the conscious mind  by using this    Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously  and accepting both of them     He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past     Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one  At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the Earth goes round the Sun  today  to believe the past is unalterable  He might be alone in holding that belief  and if alone  then a lunatic  But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him  the horror was that he might also be wrong     War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength   Oh and the necessity to restrain language or invent one to limit thought  this was a brilliant point    But if thought corrupts language  language can also corrupt thought   Until now  this is the darkest dystopian novel I ve ever read  the chance of beating the hopeless setting of this false utopia is really hard  Orwell is really a smart guy  he incorporated some decent arguments  and implemented some catchy philosophical maxims about existence  the mind  reality  and the meaning of freedom  The complete analysis of this work should make another book  if not a volume                                                          April the 4th  1984  To the past  or to the future  To an age when thought is free  From the Age of Big Brother  from the Age of the Thought Police  from a dead man   greetings     George Orwell

is a member of the outer party  living under the authoritarian and totalitarian rule of the Inner Party in London  In this dull and bleak society individuality and independent thinking  thoughtcrimes  is persecuted  history is falsely rewritten  propaganda is slavishly believed and privacy is nonexistent with the party leader Big Brother supposedly watching your every move Consequently  Winston begins questioning the society and starts to intellectually rebel  furtively writing in a diary to express himself but to also warn future generations  He also starts an illicit love affair with Julia  another party member  If you want to find out what happens to Winston  you ll have to read the novel  This novel was particularly thought provoking as it deals with existential issues in society today  where authoritarian rule can be likened to North Korea s regimes and lack of privacy to online surveillance e g  the tracking of credit cards  GPS mobile phones and internet records  Thus I would recommend 1984 and it should definitely be put on your must read list  A grim but thought provoking read  I really enjoyed it   perhaps because I read it a second time for a bookclub discussion  Sometimes reading and discussing it with others adds another dimension to the book One of the things we discussed was rather Winston was a hero or not  He does not seem heroic   he is thin  not very robust  aging  kind of an ordinary guy  But  despite his weaknesses  he is rejecting the prevailing attitudes conventions   seeking answers to the slivers of memories he has  I certainly sympathized with him Could he be considered a hero because of his acts of revolution  the diary  his affair with Julia  etc   He is aware of the danger  the almost certitude  that accompanies these actions but he proceeds nonetheless This line from the book  last part  chapter 3  gave me pause  O Brien said  If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever Winston did have an amazing job  One thing from the novel that I keep coming back to was how everyone was watched everywhere  Even in their homes they had to be in view of the camera at certain times  Like Winston  I would have hated that The Ministry of Love was such a misleading name  You would think they were arranging marriages or love between people but they were just enforcing love and loyalty to Big Brother by fear  torture and brainwashing of people  And the Ministry of Truth was responsible for rewriting history and changing facts to fit party doctrine  This upset me so much when I read it in high school that I vowed to never read it again  I have honored that promise thus far  Ahh    I don t know  At the end of this review I will give 1 star or 5 stars to this book  I will try to figure out my feelings by the end of my review  view spoiler  To be honest I am quite disappointed  All my life I heard how amazing this book is  what kind of an utopia it is talking about  how it is similar to our own conditions as different countries around the world  I thought this is the solution then  we can end all of it as we want  I was expecting a book of rebellion  vicious victory  a way out of all the troubles of the world  Turns out it was not  I just  don t really know what to say  First you feel so fired up  like our man  Winston  will do something about it  maybe build an army etc  I don t know   But he doesn t  Turns out there is no way out of it at all  they have figured out how to deal with everything  And the way is brutal  and TOO perfect  Like there is not any choice he can take  it is all already set  No way out For me  it was really devastating to read all of this  I needed some more  spirit  in this book  more then Winston did  It was so disappointing to read how everybody accepted their situation already  and were fanatics about it  Maybe I was looking for a way out from what our world is going through right now  and in case it all gets worse  Now all I can say is I hope none of  this  goes that far   hide spoiler  All in all I want to say I just HATE this book  But  I can not stop thinking about it  and it has been a while since a book made me feel this way  It gives you a lot to think about  I hate how great it is  how much of an intelligence lies underneath  I don t usually write reviews about the books I read  the fact that I am writing this is enough to say how great this book is  Okay 1984  take my 5 stars I hate you  Never in my life have I read a novel which inspired such absolute hopelessness and inspiration simultaneously  I of course do not subscribe to the all too common rhetoric that we have already entered into an era of Orwellian magnitude  but the way in which he paints a picture of a world where the people are convinced to abandon freedom in exchange for  happiness   to acknowledge that it is possible for two conflicting truths to exist concurrently is beautifully tragic  I am slightly ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until now  but I am certainly glad for having done so  I appreciated it more as insight into the psychology of a man broken than a political work  as odd as that may sound   and the grim future of Oceania simply served as its background Anyone even remotely interested in linguistics will undoubtedly enjoy the development of Newspeak and the intentionally degradation of language  The idea of not simply reducing morality to strict black and white  but removing the concept of black so as to eliminate the possibility for gray to be reborn into public consciousness is not only terrifying  but brilliant  i e  from good vs  evil to good vs  ungood A must read for students of politics  psychology  literature  and truth   This article was first published in Catalonia Today magazine  March 2015  It s not easy for me to be objective about this masterpiece of a book  Whenever I write any non fiction  I always have one man  figuratively  looking over my shoulder and that man is George Orwell   he is nothing less than a literary hero to me  Despite this  I will try to be even handed  though I intend to ignore some of the main themes of  1984  because a thousand reviewers before me have written in detail about the wider issues behind the Orwellian world that he so skillfully sets out Of course  if we look at this book as a predictor of the future Orwell was certainly mistaken about some things  The state  for example  is shrivelling rather than being the all powerful monster machine that Orwell foresaw  Faceless international capitalism  rather than big government has instead become the central force of our time  I think where Orwell strikes closest to the bone is when he captures the touching details of humanity and then contrasts this with the cold indifference of an all encompassing system that is at every opportunity trying to wipe out the possibility of even a single rebellious individual  In the general society of  1984  the subtle points of daily existence are just as repressing as the strong arms of the state  Apartments smell like boiled cabbage and the food is barely edible  the furniture is uncomfortable  rooms are damp and under heated  the cigarettes are cheap and even the  Victory  gin tastes foul  For everyone  except those in the privileged realm of the Inner Party  there are no pleasures left except cruel ones like the collective  groupthink  of the vicious  Two Minute Hate  sessions  Even the act of sex is in the process of being wiped out With this as a part of the background  some of the other brilliance of the novel comes from the author s understanding of how the mechanics of totalitarian regimes work  Government propaganda runs through every facet of life  History is continually being rewritten  the official language is being shrunk and manipulated so that expression and thought are also shrunk and the working class population is subdued as well as physically isolated  Fear of invasion is also constant because Oceania  their great power is perpetually at war  Or at least that is what the populace is led to believe   On top of these perversions   child hero  spies denounce their parents  who often live in fear of the little brutes  Overall  Orwell deftly balances his political content with a love story and often returns to the motif of the human face  in all it s emotive quality  He has a warm fascination for objects and the history within them   how they have the ability to escape the censorship and destruction of so much else that tells of the past This book has the kind of mental atmosphere that was so poignantly developed in films such as The Lives of Others  a dramatisation of struggles in creative circles pitted against the  Stasi  secret police in Communist East Berlin  Tragically  Orwell was in his late forties and was slowly dying of tuberculosis when we wrote  1984   It is a fitting testament to a lifetime of physical and intellectual bravery and sometimes painful but always enlightening honesty  http   www bretthetherington net defa    I have been meaning to read this novel for quite some time  I am saddened to say this is the only novel  so far  I have read of George Orwell  My niece was assigned this book over the summer for school and I thought it would be great to read it along  I read it with  immersion reading  and the narration of Simon Prebble was excellent  I can t recommend enough the audio  I am convinced that without the audio companion it would have taken me over a week to finish it It is a masterpiece of a novel but it is complex  I really felt this novel challenged my intelligence  I was constantly wondering if I was understanding the underlying message of this novel  The storyline is a plethora of meaning  so many layers  This is a novel to be read more than once to grasp its full meaning  I am in my 30s and I really wondered if teenagers could grasp the complexity of this novel  It has a lot of symbolism  This novel is a denouncement plea against certain types of Socialism  at first  but later on we realized it s also against our society with the infiltration of extreme ideology and criminal acts committed against humanity  Author gave life to this theoretical extremist socialist society  Oceania  by boxing in a world disconnected from everything and amplifying the new value system  This micro world becomes universal  Every element of Oceania is extrapolated one by one in front of our eyes until we are completely submerged in it  The belief system layout is very detailed and covers most of the book Oceania is a distortion of our current established core values systems  accentuating the grave consequences of such endeavors  The dystopia setting makes us understand what could be the daily reality in an extreme socialist environment depriving humans of their humanity  eradicating our social structure thus creating a  powerful machine  of government controlling everything we do even what we think  There are no battle of social groups within the hierarchy but total submission  There is only one ruling class  There is no freedom whatsoever  no family relationship or any relationship  Love is simply not possible in that setting  The government become the new God  We are driven into the inner working of such mechanism through Winston s life  through his observation  Winston represent us  in a way  with his yearning to live a normal life and determination to live as a free man  His friendships  his relaxations  his behaviour towards his wife and children  the expression of his face when he is alone  the words he mutters in sleep  even the characteristic movements of his body  are all jealously scrutinised  Not only any actual misdemeanour  but any eccentricity  however small  any change of habits  any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle   is certain to be detected  He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever  Orwell  George  1983 10 17   1984  p  455   Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  Kindle Edition  I struggled at first because it takes a while for you to understand that world  I was lost in meaning because whatever we know today  in this world everything is reversed  eliminated  Nothing makes sens  no real purpose  no real agenda  However  I could pinpoint this ongoing dialogue that we have nowadays whether we are giving too much power to the government  Heath Care program versus Private sector  the salvage of the stock market crash in 2008   There are many truths about that world which applied to us in reference to war  for example  War is a vehicle of distraction for the population to forget their struggle  their miserable existence and reality  The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects   and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory  but to keep the structure of society intact  The very word  war   therefore  has become misleading  It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist  Orwell  George  1983 10 17   1984  pp  430 431   Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  Kindle Edition  Many other themes are explored such as   The power of thoughts  indoctrination  Debate of the totalitarian mind which O Brien impersonates during Winston s imprisonment   Definition of Power and dictatorship and it s madness which alludes to Genocide committed in the world   Philosophical questions on human nature  laws of nature  dignity  moralityThe party slogan are 1   war is peace Winston s life is the perfect example of such belief 2   Ignorance is strength Despite this world being estranged from ours  Winston s criticism echoes to our time as well If I have a complaint it would be about the underground revolutionary group   Brotherhood   which tactics of operation were not loyal  It seemed fake  like a false hope to confuse the people  Therefore  it is a fatalistic world  there is no escape whatsoever  no hope to hold on to  Everything that is good in life can t survive in that system  There is no belief of Heaven  It s impossible to enjoy the simple pleasures of life  no memory  no past  no History  no words  History is constantly manipulated by the alteration of events and a new dictionary is created with the sole purpose of eliminating meaning  Cut off from contact with the outer world  and with the past  the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space  who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down  The rulers of such a state are absolute  as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be  Orwell  George  1983 10 17   1984  p  429   Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  Kindle Edition  This is a harsh  unimaginable world that you couldn t possibly fathom and that s where you become so hooked  so tense and fearful for Winston  You hope that Winston will collapse this outrageous system  This is a masterpiece of a novel because despite being a paradoxical world to ours  Winston  criticisms apply to our current issues  This novel encompasses many aspects of human s purpose in society  The end was fatalistic leaving us wondering if the author s message could be how society and human dignity could come to an end under such extreme beliefs systems   Old thinkers unbelly feel Ingsoc  is Mr  Orwell s Newspeak for  Those people whose ideas were formed before the revolution can not have a full emotional understanding of the principle of English Socialism   I ve always been impressed with writers who are linguistically capable on top of being able to tell a story  To make up non existent languages  as Mr  Orwell s contemporary  J R R  Tolkein  did  or to recognize how social pressures will alter  shave and retexturize language the way Anthony Burgess did in Clockwork Orange  is a noble  remarkable talent  In fact  I m still shaking at how amazing this book is  Everything has been said about it  I have nothing new to bring to the plate  except to express amazement at how well Mr  Orwell synthesized the horrors of World War II  air raids  images of Concentration Camp survivors  illness  prolonged deprivation  rationing  Fascism  Socialism  Communism  in fact all  isms  that were being explored by the New World Order  Apparently  he wrote most of this book in a rush after the death of his beloved wife  in a cheerless  dank set of rooms on the Isle of Skye during particularly drear Winter  Despite the war being over  rations were still in effect at that time  He was dying of tuberculosis  His publisher kept at him to finish the book and his manuscripts were messy  illegible and sometimes hallucinatory  The end product was a book almost entirely devoid of hope  Would it have been different if his physical  emotional and climactic environment were different  Or was he driven to finish the book because he had experienced premonitory visions of the future  My copy of the book contained a lengthy appendix  fascinating with complex notes and examples from Newspeak  including the ultimate goal of Newspeak  which was by reducing the stretch of language to euphonic monosyllables  one subsequently strips a person of the ability to form complex ideas  Correlatively  if you pressure a child into suppressing her linguistic span you suppress her desire to reach for ideas  Point in fact  in the Merrimac valley mill town where I grew up  see Townie  my peers used to deride me  and periodically beat me up  for using words like  plummet  instead of  fall   So  I was a socially awkward kid who read too much  I read science  and once memorably made the unforgiveable mistake of sharing what I was thinking about  because I announced   Scientists are amazed that bumble bees can fly given that their wings are not aerodynamically capable of supporting their body weight   For the rest of my time junior high they called me  Bees can t fly  girl   My lovely  complex statement describing a dynamic mystery became a humiliating epithet  This town was filled with kids who didn t read  who got high  or who played catch with their parents  ate Rice aroni  watched the boob tube  beat each other up     who knew what they did  but they didn t read  and they distrusted words  The foundation of their language was based on a four word declaritive statement  usually the third of which was scatological in nature  My junior high peers said   that is wicked awesome   Later it became   that is fuckin  awesome   I know this is the correct rhythm because I recall hearing   that hurts fuckin  alot   a lot  Any reader or able bodied thinker would assume that s five words  because it is really  a lot  but nope   alot  here is a simple modifying adverb  and thus it s four words   For a wicked good insight into the  alot  please visit Allie Brosh s website  http   hyperboleandahalf blogspot com     My point is that because our language was restricted  our ability to express complex thoughts  feelings  emotions were similarly restricted  This is why we read  to expand our abilities to see  understand and describe the human experience  This is why for every time I see on hulu com a  top  commentator write   I love there theme song   I console myself with the fact that iPad s new commercial is a visual paean to creativity  over which a narrator recites Walt Whitman s   the powerful play goes on  and you may contribute a verse  For me  the most frightening image of the whole book was not the rat mask  but the thought that Shakespeare would be converted into Newspeak and then the original destroyed  That is a world I could not inhabit  Join with me  o fellow lovers of language  let us preserve words at any cost   It surprises me that a book written in the 1940 s which made a fictional prediction of the 1980 s have its essence almost coming into shape in this era of the 21st century  specifically  the year 2014  2 days left to 2015 when this review is written  One of the sub themes of this book is about mind control  So  how does one control minds  By using psychic powers  No  It s simple  really  As an educator  what s evident to me is that mind control is being done through education  Education plays a role in determining the future of the country and where the future of the country is concerned  there will be people behind it that will do anything to get the most out of it so that it goes according to their vision and demands  even if it means to alter historical facts in text books  The phrase  those who control the present  control the past  which was being mentioned repeatedly in this book finally made me realize how it s being done  One of the ways for it to be done is by altering historical facts  In the book  it is done by the ruling government so as to make the current ruling government look desirable in the eyes of its citizens  Any facts that were deemed undesirable    irrelevant  by the ruling government are to be exterminated and replaced with  new  facts that go according to the government s desires  ideology  visions  demands  etc  you name it  So  when the younger generation has absorbed and subconsciously accepted the  new facts  as being the ultimate truth  because the Big Brother says so   there is no denying that they will pass these  facts  down to the future generation  When this succeeds  Big Brother will have a big smile carved on his face Speaking of younger generation  the children of the Parson family represent this particular group in the book  Even at an age as young as theirs  their minds have already been controlled and they have already subconsciously siding with Big Brother  I can relate well to this situation stated in the book because it s slowly unfolding and taking place  Other than issues relating education  there are others that I noticed such as economic issues and such  I cannot say that I m lucky to be able to experience what Orwell had mentioned in the book  because I find this book so fascinating that it never ceases to make me feel ascertain  but I guess I can say that through reading this book I m more aware of how the social  political  economical settings are being allegorized and how truly enough that they coincide with the real world that we are currently living in  If you are into politics and it s underlying issues  then this book is definitely for you   I m not really into politics but this book definitely gave me a sense of awareness and a glimpse of information of the such  It s never good to be too ignorant  no  p s  I hope for a newer movie adaptation of this book   George Orwell did an amazing job of predicting people s choice of comfort over freedom  Some of the specific things mentioned in the book have not yet been made reality simply because of their mention in the book   Orwellian  has come to mean an undesirable dark future  Take away some of the trappings and open your eyes and here we are  Both London and Washington D C  are literally covered by surveillance cameras   Big Brother is Your Friend  is more than just a catchy phrase  A timeless work that is possibly more relevant today than when it was written in 1948  READ IT  Possibly the most relevant  impactful  insightful cautionary tale of all time  It s what happens when the people in charge get to rule the world  but the similarities to current systems in place are more than just passing ones  Ena biblio pou xeperase pera gia pera tis prosdokies mou  Anatrikhiastika entuposiako  prophetiko  toso mprosta apo ten epokhe tou kai toso apisteuta epikairo  Ena biblio pou me

While I was reading this  I immersed myself into it  I laughed  I teared  I felt like a crazy man and I even punched a pillow  because the wall would be too hard  just because the ideas in here are so outlandish  yet so terrifyingly within the realm of possibility  that I could actually felt them as something of a reality  during my time of reading   Anyways  enough about me  lets talk about the book 1984 deals with a tremendous amount of concepts  Many of those concepts deals with the human and society dynamic  how the former affects the other and vice versa One of the most interesting concepts is the language of Newspeak  Newspeak is a vessel at which the government the government uses to destory resistance  Most exemplified by the Newspeak dictionary which destroys words instead of adding new ones   the government here tries to wipe out people s capacity to protest and revolt by limiting the words that they can use  This further highlights the importance of words   how they are our vessel of communication  With them we can express the ideas and emotions that we feel  albeit to an imperfect degree  Without them  we are left with nothing  nothing at all  After all  how does one express or much less recognizes discontent without words    Read this book  That s really the only advice I could give anyone  I ve read quite a few books  and this is one of the three that have most heavily influenced my perception of the world    dr srsrtrykh mkhtwb wshyd z pyn  Sr nwsngy sh gwnh adm drdny bwdh ndbl  mtwsT  pyyn hdf hy yn sh grwh khml szsh npdhyr st hdf Tbqh y bl yn st

unfair  and I m struggling with how to review this book properly  now historically politically  I don t think this book and what B B represent are completely off the mark even now indeed   War Is Peace  you see it everyday  and the totalitarian methods are not exclusively totalitarian  they are well present here and now  in 2015 especially  in the 21st century even and what a genius prophecy that Orwell achieved  it boggles the mind  clenches the heart  and is absolutely important to recognize this  to remain aware  to doubt what we see and hear  to look for the truth and knowing full well it may be corrupted and twisted  probably is    and love  sweet love that struggled and failed to live freely in 1984  heartbreaking  because really  sometimes it feels as if love is defying everything nature life and even death sometimes  what an ache for Winston and for all the citizens of Eurasia  if that s what it s really called  genius genius  best literary achievement is this book  I cannot review it well enough nor encompass it I loved it but I can t say this type of book will always be on my shelves  but I m glad I gave it a shot  mn  jml m qr t   tkhyl km lthqft lmkhtlf

about a world that controls every aspect of an entire society s life  George Orwell is a writer best known as having a passion for language and democratic socialism   1984  reveals that the main idea of the book was to warn people in the present to not allow the future turn into what it is in  1984   Orwell s  1984  is a dystopian novel that addresses a society s totalitarian Government  To me  1984 is a novel that addresses several issues that are happening in our society and possibly in societies in the future  such as censorship   1984  is a story that follows Winston Smith as he struggles to fit in to Oceania  Winston is aware that his government  Big Brother and the Inner Party control every part of his live as well as every Oceania citizen s life  However  Winston finds comfort in Julia  a woman who works in the Ministry of Truth along Winston  Winston feels as if he can relate to Julia because she also despises Big Brother and everything they believe in  Winston and Julia revolt against the Inner Party by continuing think scandals  but little did they know that they were being watched the entire time by the Though Police  Julia and Winston are tortured until they betray each other and spill the truth about their relationship  proving that there love was not strong enough  Ultimately Winston becomes brain washed into loving Big Brother  Censorship was a reoccurring theme in  1984  Winston was controlled by Big Brother and the Inner Party along with other Oceania s citizens   The thought police would get him just the same  He had committed  would still have committed  even if he never set paper to pen  the essential crime that contained all others in itself  thought crime they called it  19   After reading this quote  I was left in shock  How is it possible that the citizens of Oceania are not even allowed to think their own thoughts or better yet right those thoughts down  I know that I enjoy having my 1st Amendment  Freedom of speech is a write that every citizen should have  It can lead to great things such as Social Movements that could help improve lives of citizens  In no way should it be taken away from the citizens of Oceania  although it does bother me that they do not speak up about it and defend themselves  Winston does a good job about predicting the future and trying to warn people about the future  while it might not all everything is possible  That is the message that Orwell it trying to get across  Proles make up 85  of Oceania s citizens while the Inner Party only has 2   It would with no doubt likely that if the proles where to fight against the Inner Party they could gain control over them  Unfortunately Orwell does not make it possible for Proles to revolt  since they are so unintelligent  The writer started off the book with such outrages unfairness to get the reader hooked  I know that as soon as I became more familiar with the unthinkable conditions these people were living in  I could not possibly put down the novel  I was always reading to see what the writer could surprise me with next  The suspense of what other unthinkable conditions the author would introduce next made it impossible to not read  Winston is the main character in  1984  that I saw go through a tremendous change in the book  Winston s character changed the most after his relationship with Julia was introduced   At the sight of the words I love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him  and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid  pg 87   I noticed that as soon as Julia handed Winston this note that his attitude changed  He finally had a reason to live  I also feel as if all those times he said he hated women was because he did not have one  All Winston wanted since his wife Kathleen left him was love and affection  I think that when he realized that Julia was the person that could give him that he finally had a reason for life  What made things even better for Winston was that Julia was the opposite of innocent  Since part of the reason that Winston wanted her was that she went against everything the party believed in just like him  He did not want the relationship he previously had with Kathleen  which was sex only to please the party  He wanted someone who could enjoy sex and take part in it not because they had to but because they desired it  Julia instilled hope and youthfulness in Winston  which is what Kathleen would take away  I believe that the writer incorporated Julia as a love interest for Winston because it made him a more relatable character  I know I was able to connect to Winston and Julia s character on a more personal level because of the love that they shared for each other  The writer not only made both characters stand out from anything that a reader had been exposed to before  but he also brought down them down to a level where they were incredibly relatable  Overall  1984  was a dystopian novel that followed Winston Smith as he embarked on his revolution against Big Brother  and through his love affair with Julia   1984  is a very strongly written novel because of George Orwell s remarkable writing skills  His writing style adds to the excitement and suspense of the novel  The way that his novel is written makes the reader not want to put down the book  Furthermore  I really enjoyed reading  1984  because of the strongly written story line and Orwell s writing style  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys George Orwell s writing style  and to anyone who enjoys reading dystopian novels because they can be related to each other   The big brother is watching YOU  The best about this book is that if you think a litle about our society  it s true  An eye opener  Este libro es GRANDE  en el sentido literario de la palabra Una obra tan vasta es dificil abordarla en un resena  pero he aqui mi intento de cualquier manera Es una distopia  una de las distopias originarias de hechos y desde un punto de vista practico era una suerte de critica a la Union Sovietica  pero el desglose tan detallado y profundo de la condicion humana  el poder  el control y el gobierno  que el contenido trascendio por mucho su epoca e intenciones iniciales Orwell crea un mundo post moderno  repartido entre tres super potencias en un nuevo orden mundial  Cada super potencia domina su territorio de manera extremadamente ferrea  controlando cada aspecto de las personas  pensamientos y sentimientos incluidos Es increible el detalle de esta sociedad creada por Orwell  los intricado elaborado de la filosofia del partido de gobierno y de los metodos de control  Fabuloso   y escalofriante  porque muchos de esos elementos se pueden extrapolar al mundo actual  a pesar de que ha transcurrido tanto tiempo y de hecho Orwell explica por que La narrativa es sencilla y el libro corto  pero el contenido es extenso y denso  Donde la moraleja puede ser muy desesperanzadora y el gran aprendizaje  para mi  es que lo que no sabes que no sabes es mayor a lo que sabes y lo que sabes que no sabes juntos  O A   Lo que sabesB   Lo que sabes que no sabesC   Lo que no sabes que no sabes A   B    CUna obra magnifica  maravillosa  de mis libros favoritos de todos los tiempo  que siempre perdura   This book is truly amazing in every way  It contained surprising plot twists and had an astounding plot  The plot was entertaining as it showed the horrors of a totalitarian government and its restrictions and rules of conformity  I rated this book five out of five stars because it is truly one of the best books I have read and everyone should be able to experience this astounding work of literature  rwyh tqr  thm tqr  mn jdyd   khsh   khsh  nn nmsh    lnhj ll  ywSwlnn lHb lkh

you a key to understanding the dangers we face today with political correctness   Oh  dear book    you ve left me speechless  I read this as a Teenager  and stayed up all night  This book is fascinating in it s plausibility  Although I have not read much of dystopian literature  I strongly believe that 1984 is one of the finest masterpieces of this genre  essentially because it is timeless  being as relevant and insightful in 2015  as it was back in 1950 The story acts itself out in a world divided between three superpowers   Eastasia  Eurasia and Oceania   with the protagonist  Winston Smith  gradually reclaiming his residual human instincts and thinking capabilities  A major part of the story revolves around Winston s attempts to rediscover and recreate his past based on vague memories and wild speculations  But it turns ugly when the reality catches up with him  Big Brother and his Party try their best to take down another dissenter by breaking through the inner most mental barriers and distorting the individual s mental core beyond recognition A great companion to Orwell s  1984  would be Huxley s  Brave New World  which  I have heard  is quite closer to the world of 2015  https   qph is quoracdn net main qimg    Also  Orwell s writing style makes it very easy for him to pen down some very harsh revelations and truths into painfully simple sentences  For me  that s the beauty of his prose  It s a good book  if not a great one  In either case  it is strongly recommended  wHdh mn  fDl lrwyt  l  lTlq  w rGm  nh mktwbh mn zmn b yd l nh tnb t bshkl  w

contemporary books  of more  now  stories  hoping to discover that one obscure gem that we can proudly present to our friends  But in doing so we miss out on masterpieces like 1984  that rightfully so have been declared classics  Everyone knows the premise of 1984 and thinking back to the time it was written we all understand where Orwell s fears come from  70 years later and the nightmare he is describing is still possible  Mankind hasn t learned from its mistakes and the book never stopped being relevant  A sad statement to make I know and I am pretty sure Orwell would have hoped to never be named a prophet  as he is called from many   A difficult read  if you are a person with a thinking brain that is  Difficult  not because of grammar or vocabulary  but because the society and human interactions he is exploring is hard to  watch   The universe he is describing is extreme but at times feels closer to the bone that we would want to admit  You can t help but feel for the protagonist as you follow him throughout his journey  As you approach the end there is no resolution and you are left with more questions than answers  A book to debate on and discuss with others  1984 is the one to make you say  Can we talk about this  Food for thought for many days to come   n msh  rf qwl yh mn ktr m jwy mn klm ywSf lHlh ly  shth m  jwrj wrwyl     H  Dwl mrh qr  Hjh kdh    ykhrb byt  Zmtk

pants off of me  I still remember that last line  and it sickens me no less now  than it did then  And for that  I love it  It s a true masterpiece and one of the best books ever written  I got more out of it the second time I read it  another sign of a good book  You can keep returning to it  and each time it will show you another layer to explore and enjoy I thought it was so unique  unbelievable  even   only to learn that a lot of what s in this book is what actually happens in present day North Korea  Ugh   X As walls of ceramic are closing around meI m hearing the gunman approach from behindI don t try to run and just whisper so softlyRelease me  my brother  of my humankind I first read this before the year 1984  back when the date was terrifying  Turns out that perhaps the most terrifying thing about 1984 was Wake Me Up Before You Go Go  and the emergence of Wham  as an international pop success This is a great book but not a very good novel  Thus  while it had a huge impact on me when I first read it  and while Orwell s ideas have stuck with me through the years  I didn t find myself liking it all that much on reread  The characters for the most part are cut outs  Charitably  you could call them symbols  Almost nothing actually happens  And Orwell interrupts the middle of the book  right before the climactic moment  with a forty page essay on political philosophy  All of that is ungood On the other hand  the atmosphere   the overwhelming feeling of tension and dread  is plusgood  And  with some modifications  the warnings are just as relevant today as they were when this was a diatribe against Stalinism  Newspeak and doublethink have pretty much become the norm in political discourse  where the way to win the issue is to shape the vocabulary around the issue  And it has led our Department of Defense  which used to be the Department of War  to wage a perpetual  unending war against  Terror   which is nothing more than a tactic  While at the same time  we have a president conducting this war on terror  who refuses to call the enemy  terrorists  or acknowledge that their own beliefs have anything to do with the terrorism  That s a lot of newspeak and doublethink going on  Or  for more doublethink  consider the One China policy  We recognize only one China  There was only one China  as a matter of official U S  policy  But we dealt with two different governments   Beijing and Taiwan The idea of newspeak is also extremely well done  but I wonder that he didn t take it as far as he could  One of the main ideas behind newspeak is to limit the vocabulary and thereby limit the scope of thought  As he explains  there s no need for the word  bad  when  ungood  does the job  He then adds the use of plusgood  and for even more doubleplusgood  But  double   Why would newspeak have such a redundant word  This strikes me as unhood  even twoplusungood  There s no need for a complicated word like double when two can do the same work The thing I liked best on this reading was a scene early in the book where Winston interviews an older prole to try to find out whether things used to be better or worse  What s great about this scene is that it shows how much Winston s mind has already been shaped by the Party  He is incapable of generalizing from details and sees the details that the guy tells him as being totally useless  He wants a formulated answer without the mess of life making things hard to understand  As a result  he has already lost a great deal of his humanity  Orwell makes this point subtly  for a change  I wish there had been more of this  I wish he had included more of this sort of thing  but like Big Brother  I get the sense that Orwell was more interested in ideas than in people  1984 has left an impression in my mind that I will never forget  The theme is haunting and sticks with you long after you finish the read  For some very weird reason any kind of institutional building  such as a nursing home  vividly reminds me of this read  The characters and plot were real to me and I was rooting for the main character  Winston  who was the underdog  A must read and one that should be reread and reread   This is the first time a book has succeeded in making me respond so strongly to its words  Towards the end  I felt physically sick  It was a struggle to finish because it was such an uncomfortable  disturbing read  A roller coaster of  what ifs   many which did not happen  though this didn t matter  because the possibility that they could was terrifying enough  and then the ones  the unexpected ones  that did unfold when unprepared  I don t think I ll experience anything like that again  This book both destroys and advocates the core of humanity  using psychology and intellect to construct such an intrinsic paradox that I still don t fully understand  Cok begendigim  Herkes esittir ama bazilari daha esittir  sozunun sahibinden bir carpici kitap daha okudum  Bu kitapta iktidarin arac degil bir amac oldugunu ogreneceksiniz  Guya insanligin menfaatine calistigini  sessiz yiginlarin sesi olacagini iddia eden gruplarin iktidari ele gecirince nasil bir diktatorluk kurabilecegine sahit olacaksiniz  1940 larda yazilmis bir kitap olmasina ragmen  ozgur dusuncenin suc oldugu  bireyselligin sapkinlik olarak nitelendirildigi gunumuz toplumunun nasilda guzel bir sekilde tasvir edildigini gorunce sasiracaksiniz  Mutlaka okuyun  okutturun  It just took three simple words on a small scrap of paper to make me fall in love with this book  Probably the best love story I ve ever read  To take an excerpt from another book I like that describes how I felt reading this   If you re going to read this  Don t bother  After a couple of pages  you won t want to be here  So forget it  Go away  Get out while you re still in one piece     Choke  Chuck Palahniuk I can t put into words how truly great this book is  The tidal wave of emotions you feel for the characters simply grows and grows  I m not one for the  and they lived happily ever after  type of endings and believe me this one won t disappoint if you feel the same as me  It s scary to think that a world such as the one in 1984 could be thought up let alone imagining it actually happening  This book brings out alot of fear in people  Fear of the government gaining too much control over our lives  Fear that big brother might one day take over while the world is asleep to it happening  Everyone should at least read this book once in their lifetime  George Orwell s literary masterpiece 1984 describes a totalitarian utopia in which the citizens are psychologically manipulated and brainwashed  It is a political novel written during the beginning of the Cold War to warn readers of the dangers of an autocratic government  Orwell uses the Party  led by Big Brother  to share his disapproval of the widespread inhumanity he saw in communist countries  and his worries about the development of new technologies that allow governments to monitor their citizens  The Party represents what Orwell believed to be communism taken to its most extreme extent  a society that promises equal rights and freedoms on the surface  only to instead enslave all citizens as if they were mere puppets  In this novel  foreshadowing and irony are used to further strengthen the theme  the dangers of totalitarianism Throughout the entire novel  Orwell repeatedly foreshadows Winston s submission to Big Brother  In the first chapter  we are introduced to Winston s beliefs against the Party as he sheepishly defies the rules by committing thoughtcrime  Even though he seeks freedom and wants to start a rebellion  Winston himself foresees his own demise because  the fact of impending death seemed  so near  151   The Party is able to gain the faith of the citizens by instilling fear and paranoia in them  Posters are placed throughout the nation with the mantra   Big Brother is watching you   demonstrating the authority the Party has over the people  2   This foreshadows Winston and Julia s arrest  because they are not able to find a secure hideout capable of hiding under Big Brother s radar The use of irony in 1984 also exhibits the injustice of a totalitarian government  The novel begins stating that  the clocks were striking thirteen   1   However  clocks do not ordinarily strike thirteen which shows that the Party s influence is so strong that it is even able to manipulate time  The official slogan of the party   war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength   introduces us to the idea of Doublethink  26   Although it is absolutely contradictory  the Party is able to force the citizens to believe it by impairing their sense of independence and individualism  The Party is able to psychologically manipulate its subjects  announcing that  two and two made five  and you would have to believe it   80     Nineteen Eighty Four    one of the best works of fiction ever written  And one of the most important pieces of writing ever published Really  I can t say much more than that  This masterpiece was George Orwell s last novel  and the first I ve read of his Historically  politically  and intellectually well thought out and stimulating  Usually this sort of thing should have bored me to tears  but it didn t  Sure  anyone can write a morality and cautionary tale  but not everyone can write interesting and human characters in a world made real by how he or she has created it  Not everyone can weave a story together with these things to keep in mind  Orwell achieves all story functions spectacularly  with the ultimate moral caution looming over the writing like an omen  Winston Smith  Julie  and others have realistic personalities  jobs  backgrounds and even habits in a society that forbids individuality  To date   Nineteen Eighty Four  is the most realistic and terrifying dystopian story I ve ever read or seen  It is a nightmare that sticks with you long after you ve finished experiencing it  It is a book where even the title is possibly misleading  as no one in the story is sure what year it is   as the past is being rewritten and it keeps changing  No one is sure of anything anymore  and yet they don t think that anything is wrong  The process of doublethink can make susceptible human beings believe anything at all  There is a reason why the two countries that Oceania is  at war  with   Eurasia and Eastasia   sound the same  leaders who want unlimited power keep changing who s at war with who and why  And no civilian will question it  It keeps the news and therefore the days going  Change what is written about the past  you effect the present   and you have a degree of control over people Truths are lies  lies are truths WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAnd no one is safe from Big Brother and the Thought Police  Thinking differently can get you killed  or tortured  which  as demonstrated in the story s tragic end  is worse still Even sexual thoughts   or any passions   are deemed bad  Big Brother is watching you  He sees you when you sleep  he sees you when you dream   dream of rebellion  and the Thought Police will come knocking at your door  Thinking differently from a universal  truth  is a crime  A Thoughtcrime  Risks of rebellion are destroyed immediately  You are insane if you are not a happy and mindless slave to the leaders like everyone else is Will it ever be possible to beat the regime with so much against you  Will such a thought even be dreamed of anymore in Orwell s view of the future  Nineteen Eighty Four  is a relevant and human cautionary tale  Fresh and evocative in levels I didn t believe a novel could reach  It teaches us to think  to think for ourselves  Don t let  progressive  technology or higher ups dictate your life   your mind   for you  Keep dreaming  Keep being an individual  Keep trying to seek out real truths Before it is too late Final Score  5 5Other reviews  The book of the twentieth century    haunts us with an ever darker relevance    Independent His final masterpiece    enthralling and

plus two makes four  If that is granted  all else follows     Page 93 Bon  deja c est une relecture mais j avais oublie pas mal de trucs et ca marche tres bien  C est oppressant et angoissant  Orwell ne laisse aucun espoir  J ai ete trouble par la distinction qui est faite entre le Parti et le proletariat  masse laborieuse dont finalement on se fout un peu   ils sont assez libres  le Parti s assure juste qu ils sont assez abrutis par des films journaux chansons crees specialement pour eux  Le controle permanent auquel sont soumis les membres du Parti leur est epargne  mais on suppose qu ils passeront comme les autres a la novlangue  la fameuse langue dont le vocabulaire est tellement appauvri qu il empeche d exprimer  et donc de concevoir    des pensees heterodoxes Au dela de l histoire  quatre idees marquantes a retenir    est ce que les evenements du passe ont une existence autonome   i e  si le Parti controle l Histoire telle qu elle est rapportee et la memoire des gens  qui peut dire que le passe ne s est pas deroule comme le Parti l affirme    la doublepensee  terme novlangue qui designe le fait de penser dire croire quelque chose  par exemple que 2   2   5  en sachant que ce n est pas vrai  et en meme temps de se persuader que c est vrai tout en oubliant qu on sait le contraire   je pense que China Mieville a lu Orwell  et j y vois la une reminiscence de l  unseeing  des habitants de Beszel et Ul Qoma dans  the city and the city   la novlangue   au dela de la recherche d un vocabulaire appauvri qui evite les nuances et les subtilites  l idee que dans la mesure ou la pensee s appuie sur des mots  simplifier la langue en faisant disparaitre des notions heterodoxes ou dangereuses empechera in fine de developper de telles pensees  et donc empeche la rebellion  la guerre permanente  qui permet de maintenir la population en etat de mobilisation permanente et surtout qui consomme l excedent de production industrielle  ce qui limite voire empeche le progres social des masses proletaires et maintient ainsi le statu quo social  le dernier element qui assure le maintien du Parti au pouvoir  Car  et c est dit ici clairement  le but unique du Parti est le pouvoir pour le pouvoir  et c est ce cynisme qui le rend a la fois dangereux et indestructible  Relatively short review  because short reviews are my kinda thing Even though I sometimes cringe a bit at how Orwell chooses to let his characters speak on the situations going on  I really do like the emotional side of this book  It s a very diverse book in theory  I mean  it s a politically tinted  real life events inspired fiction to me  It s Orwell s political stances immersed in a dystopian world  through the eyes of the main character Winston Especially the last few chapters really struck me emotionally  as those feature some of the strongest moments in the whole book  The last few pages  for those who know what I m talking about  are some of the most heartwrenching pages I have read through in my life   Not kidding at all The cringing I mentioned early on mostly has to do with the whole  Big Brother is watching you  thing and the whole Newspeak language    I guess those things each play their own part in the book to try and underline what the government stands for  I just find them a bit unneeded in the end  as the actions by the government are strong enough to depict them as absolutely ruthless anyway  Especially later on All in all I love what Orwell was trying to do  trying to keep people conscious of the fact that governments can be quite dangerous and that you have to fight for your own personal rights  The parts where Winston reads The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism written by the character Goldstein  which is not the case at all in the end   really shows Orwell s point of view quite well and feels very much like an essay weaved into the story The dystopian world itself is depicted quite well  just some of the inventions and catchphrases  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  for example  don t convince me of being worth the time  they feel a bit forced  Excellent characters  political depth and mood though  Worthy of the title classic  I avoided reading this book for a long time because when I was a kid  someone completely spoiled the entire thing for me  Not just the overall idea behind the book  but specifics about its characters  plot  and even its ending  After hearing spoilers like that  reading a book tends to not have the same impact that it would if you re going into it without any previous knowledge  This is actually one of the reasons why I tend not to leave detailed reviews  or any reviews  of books that I have read  I would hate to inadvertently ruin for someone else the emotional effect that certain novels can have  However  despite already knowing what happens in 1984  the book is so well written that it still managed to have a huge impact on me when I finally did sit down to read it  And I absolutely loved it Never have I been so simultaneously infuriated by and completely fascinated with a fictional society  The reasoning behind its function was amazingly well thought out  and the explanations for its existence were almost frighteningly plausible  Despite the unbelievable hypocrisy and completely illogical workings of the government  after reading the book within the book and listening to the interrogator s philosophy  one can almost believe how it might work Amazing  New favorite book  This is my third reading of 1984  The first was in the mid 1970s when I was 10 years old  for a school assignment   and the next was in 1984 when I was 20  Now in my late 40s  I knew the book would have a different meaning to me  yet I underestimated the degree  Without giving away anything  I can see the parallels between certain aspects of my life and the robot like existence of those in Orwell s masterpiece  In the Party s definition of power  I recognized several people with whom my path has crossed over the years  While I m not saying that this was any sort of premonition on the part of the author  it did help me identify with the main characters in the novel As a writer  I was also intrigued by the development of language described in the book  Certainly  the English language has not evolved to the same degree  yet I am now old enough to have observed changes in acceptable usage  On that note  I recommend highly that the reader start with the appendix that  in my copy  was called  The Principles of Newspeak   Doing so enhanced my understanding of 1984 as I read it  without necessitating interruption  What can anyone say about this book except that Orwell was wrong  Well  at least he was wrong about the date  However  look at the daily deluge of corporate commercials targeted to brainwash consumers with their claims and consider the world wide corruption in government  The best thing Orwell did with his book was open our eyes as to what can happen if we do nothing to stop it from happening  Great BOOK It s mindfuckingly awesome    And by that  I mean  there are moments when the author  the late George Orwell  gets so confusing  that I lost track of whatever s happening inside the book  Then I find myself thinking and re reading parts  just to have a clear view of whatever the hell is happening  and get back on track with the story This is what separates great writers  from bad to good enough ones  Bad to Good enough writers gives a clear view of a story  and it ends there  Great authors  somehow  and purposefully  makes you think you know what s happening  but then  you find out that you re wrong  Just when you thought you had it all figured out  they somehow hit you with a twist and all of a sudden your assumptions are wrong A GREAT BOOK indeed  An eye opener for the things to come  if we re not careful and mindful of the things happening around us  and of our own thoughts and actions DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER Well  well  well  George Orwell  you are what we 21st Century people call LEGEN     wait for it     DARY    LEGENDARY    2 stars   2 stars   5 stars  This dystopian classic is doubleplusgood  Alzo lo sguardo verso quel volto enorme  Ci aveva messo quarant anni per capire il sorriso che si celava dietro quei baffi neri  Che crudele  vana inettitudine  Quale volontario e ostinato esilio da quel petto amoroso  Due lacrime maleodoranti di gin gli sgocciolarono ai lati del naso  Ma tutto era a posto adesso  tutto era a posto  la lotta era finita  Era riuscito a trionfare su se stesso Ora amava il Grande Fratello  This is one of my favorite books  If you haven t been  forced  to read it in high school or college  I really History suggest you download at least a sample of it on Kindle or something  I guarantee you will end up buying it and reading the whole thing  It was written in 1949  so maybe George Orwell thought it was possible for us to end up in a dystopian fascist society by 1984  which really didn t happen  Still some of the things in his book  to a smaller degree are really accurate  Maybe he was more astute then we thought  His timing was just off  Winston Smith lives in a dystopian society where people not only don t have freedom of speech  but not even freedom of thought  You thought living behind the Iron Curtain would be bad  at least Stalin didn t have tele screens put into everyone s home  It s a device that constantly projects pro state propaganda  It also has a camera on it that keeps an on you  so it s a two way screen and it can t be turned off  This way the government can watch everything you do to see if you are committing thought crime  The idea is that your feelings will eventually come out in your behavior and if you hate  Big Brother   the government  then your behavior will betray your feelings and you will be labeled a thought criminal or a follower of Goldstein  the leader of the up rising  Big Brother wants you brainwashed  If they say 2 plus 2 equals 5  they want you to agree on it and mean it  not just pretend to agree  but really agree  You think  how anyone can really believe that 2 plus 2 is five  That just goes against math  Well  they torture and execute people  a lot  People literally get scared into loving Big Brother  Not only a political commentary  it is also and maybe essentially a love story  Winston meats Julie and they start an affair and fall in love  which is big no no  Love is frowned upon  Secret rendezvous are frowned upon  If they get caught  they will be tortured and probably executed  It actually is a cold war novel  if you think about it  It has nothing to do with the Russians  but some of it is very similar to what happened under Stalin s rule  History is not an exact science  so any projection of the future is bound to have many variables   The book   1984  by George Orwell  is about a dystopian future in which  one man   Big Brother  sees and says all  Winston Smith was an unimportant worker at the Ministry of Truth  His life was seemingly normal  But  he gets dreams and thoughts about his childhood  A memory which should have been burned  Instead of pushing it away  he tries to figure out the truth behind Big Brother and the past of London  He wants to know if everything that they have been spoon feed is fact or fiction  Will he be caught by the Thought Police  Or will he survive to find what was once real   I would recommend  1984  to absolutely everyone and anyone  It is a thrilling tale about a prediction for the future  published in 1949  that could still become our reality   1984  has amazing word choice  and is worded amazingly  It has amazing detail  each sentence is packed with action and powerful words  The plot is original  unique  and stunning   It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen  Winston Smith  his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind  slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions  though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him   Already  the first sentence is full of details  The book will make you think and look differently at everything in life   Chiedo scusa     per la lentezza con cui ho letto questo libro  Probabilmente la vacanza impegnativa ha contribuito  Cio comunque non mi ha impedito di apprezzarlo in tutta la sua grandezza  Mi sento piccola piccola a recensirlo  anche solo brevemente  Troppi sono i significati  immensa e la profondita del padre dei distopici  L uomo annullato  schiavo  fisicamente e psicologicamente  una societa non societa  stravolta in ogni suo aspetto  Angoscia  realismo  devastazione  Orwell un po  veggente   anche se in senso eccessivamente pessimistico   un po  psicologo  ha delineato i tratti di un mondo per lui futuro ridotto al non essere ed anche al non esistere  con una sapienza contemporanea ed apprezzabile anche oggi   1984 was one of those novels that say on my mental shelf of books needing to be read at some point in my literary life  I had honestly very little insight as to what it was  but was under the impression that it had become a classic  and therefore  had to be read in accordance to my morals  Thankfully  my dear friend and sister  was there to assist my in reading this book  In other words  she forced me to read it  all in good faith There is absolutely nothing wrong with being forced to read a classic because  as we see in this George Orwell novel  you are hardly ever disappointed 1984 is the novel that introduces the most frightening world one could ever imagine  And yes  no matter what you may believe  I know that this is entirely possible  This dystopia is not a fictitious idea we can avoid  and if you look with just an ounce of effort you can see a example of it in today s society  A world where there is power  you are loyal to the government  you do not freely think  and you are not an individual  You are a part of a machine that works the way the government says it must work  Think against the government and you vanish The book is written well on all fronts  but it s the plot that really caught me  It was terrifying  it instilled hope  but then betrayed me  I finished the book feeling extremely glad to have read it  thinking it an excellent book  but also frozen with its depressive reality and absoluteness  rwy   Zym  w bqry  blf l  ttHdth lrwy   n l nZm  lshmwly  lstbddy  lty tHkm bsm lshtrky  wlbrwlytry wtsbr   mq mnhjh wl slyb lty ttb

book again for the third time and I could not put it down as much now is the first two times I read  It almost seems that each time I read this book  Orwell s negative Utopia seems closer to a possible reality  I get cold sweats thinking about big government and the ever watchful eye of Big Obama    uh I mean Brother  relax just kidding Many readers will not like this book however  The devastating torture and perversion of human nature is too difficult for most readers to accept  It goes beyond readers who look for a  happy ending  there are many who believe that human nature is inherit  instinctual  and inevitably indestructible  The purpose of Orwell s book is not convince the reader that human nature is or isn t destructible but simply to presuppose what if it could be  At the beginning of the book you can easily relate to Winston  Everyone has experienced a varying degree of desire of rebellion and a feeling of oppression  The reader almost shares his paranoia in being exposed by the watchful eye of the telescreens  In th middle the reader is fascinated by Orwell s description of the politics  the thorough details on how this might come to pass  The reader is pushed forward by the drama of a possible rebellion  though all along reminded by Winston s experience that revolution is impossible and by Julia s youth that it is pointless  But it is in the third section of the book that many readers have problems  As the reader pushes on through the torture and brainwashing one is convinced that Winston can hold out  That in the end human nature will prevail  that it must  Orwell simply asks  what if it doesn t  The Party drags out the brainwashing eventually setting him free to allow Winston to finally give in to Party heart and soul before shooting him in the back of the head  One asks what is the point  Why not simply kill him and keep the herd moving  That there must be some evil enjoyment in torturing him like this  But it is in the end that Orwell reveals the true motive is not the enjoyment of power  but simply power for power s sake  To have power without emotion  To give power to an organization and not to people means that no one can enjoy the power and therefore cannot abuse it  Finally giving an end to absolute power corrupting absolutely and is thereby creates a new type of power that is eternal and pure In reality the idea of Orwell s negative utopia is no more attainable than Moore s utopia  The constant ebb and flow of power will most likely continue through the cycle of oppression  revolution  and overindulgence as long as humans exist  But the interesting point to me is Orwell s question of human nature  Can simply perverting the perception of reality actually pervert reality  If one believes it to be true does it in fact become true  Religious men would think so  many political leaders would lead you to believe so  But this question will remain unanswered as long as we retain the freewill to ask it   THIS REVIEW IS ALL OVER THE PLACE   CONTAINS SPOILERS       I am absolutely mindblowned by this book  This is definitely not the typical books I read  butI was recommend this book from one of my dearest teachers  Everything was great  The only part I didn t like as much was when Winston was reading from Goldstein s book  That part was too long  so I read someone s summary  I don t even know where to begin with this review    I m amazed by Winston s evolution as a character  and basically the fact that George Orwell basically predicted the future  present  I like the smarty things he would say  ex   about them having sex  he was saying how it was a political act blabla  That was cool  Also  I love how this book was soo real  It wasn t the typical fairytale love triangle B S The main characters were basic people struggling to fit in  I love how I one point Winston was like yeaah Julia s not actually pretty  and also the fact that Winston was like 38 years old  I ve honestly never read a book where the main character was an older man  Anyways  I think we all knew from the start the fate of the novel  but I did not except Mr Charrington to be the snaky spy  And  I was really surprised by O Brien s craziness  He s such a mad character and has no pity  it hurt to see him act so indifferent while torturing Winston  He truely believe s in the Party s madness is scary And can I also mention the part when Winston was in O B house and he said he would throw acid in children s faced  kill a bunch of people and all those things  That was very shocking  it should you to what extent he was ready to join the Brotherhood  and DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER  Also  I found Julia and Winston s  love  story so abrupt and unexpected  I wish it wasn t only founded on sex  And like come on Julia you  love  the guy but don t even know him  I feel like they didn t really love each other  it was only an act of desperation and loneliness I don t know  I feel like the novel leaves me with lots of questions  but I like that  I ll never find out if Winston dies  if Big Brother truly exists  if the Brotherhood exists  and if the Party eventually falls apart   I hope it does Okaay so let s finishing by recommending this book to EVERYONE This book is definitely worthwhile and it really makes you think in what kind of society you live in  In high school  my 12th grade English teacher had us read an excerpt from 1984  I thought that the excerpt was very interesting  and it intrigued me to want to read the rest of the novel  However  we never got the chance to read the rest of the novel  and I was too busy reading other books to set aside time to read 1984  Thus  it has always been one of those books that I wanted to read  but I tend to forget about it  This year  in the class that I am student teaching in  the teacher chose to read 1984  Reminded of my curiosity in high school  I decided that I too wanted to read the book and plan a lesson for it  I also realized that this book is YA and it would fulfill this assignment  After reading 1984  I wish that my teacher would have had us read the full novel in high school  This book shows an interesting perspective of a totalitarian society  1984 is about a dystopian society  The world has been seperated into three countries  Euroasia  Eastasian  and Oceana  In Oceana  the Party is in charge  At the center of the Party is Big Brother  the ruler  Winston  the protagonist  is in the Outer Party  This is basically middle class  The story tells the journey of his rebellion against the Party  The first chapter of the novel gives a lot of background information to the society  Oceana  I found this background information to be interesting  but I can see where it could turn some people off from the book  As the story progresses  the reader gets sucked in  Winston s transformation throughout the book is interesting to say the least  At first Winston keeps his opinions about the Party and Big Brother to himself  but by the middle of the story is actively rebelling against them  By the end of the story  Winston must make a decision about standing up for what he truly believes is right or abiding by the Party to stay alive  One aspect of the novel that I really liked was its terminology  The Party is trying to diminish the amount of thoughts that the public has by eliminating certain words from language  Because of this  the terms that they do use are very unique  To teach this  it would definitely be beneficial to go over the terms with the class  as well as the Party s rules  to make sure that everyone understands what is happening 1984 is definitely a great book to teach in an ELA classroom  As a class  we can look at the book from many different perspectives  We can use Social Class  Deconstructionist  and the Feminist theories to analyze the novel  We can also identify the contradictions in a dystopian society  Foreshadowing is very prevalent in the story  Thus  at the end of specific chapters  I would ask the students to make predictions about what they think will happen next  As well as compare the dystopian society to our society now and the media s role in our society  This would make the learning for the students meaningful  We can explore the themes of the novel  and have deep discussions about the novel  There are some aspects of the novel that could be controversial  The novel does not use strong language  It does not contain much sexual content  However  it does refer to sex quite a bit because it discusses how the Party is against sex as a pleasurable experience  Also  Winston has sex with a prostitute  but the description is not very explicit  There is quite a bit of violence in the book  Also  there is a lot of talk about the government being flawed   Mindfuck  1984 has to be one of the best  if not  the  best  book ever written  And easily one of the most depressing  crushing  overwhelmingly tormenting books ever written  It s so sad that it s scary  Worse than most horror movies out there  And what makes it so is how real it is  Orwell s perhaps brightest gift is his vivid description of events and  more importantly  thoughts  He described dead in a lively way  cold warmly  bleakness brightly  With every letter  you were sinking deeper   deeper  sinking in his world   sinking in your grief  Reading it  one s inflicted with 2 opposing but not contradictory emotions  You get the feeling that Orwell s universe is so bad  so wrong   twisted that it would never materialise in our world  would never come to happen  At the same time  there s that haunting fear that it will happen  At some point  That humanity is well going down that road   Orwell was only off by 50 years  a century  50 centuries  it s just a matter of time  Hell  sometimes it seems so close to reality that you worry if it  is  happening  In any case  be it properly picked symbolism or accurate prediction  the fear is there  And worse than fear is hopelessness  Helplessness  The nagging notion to give up on life   wail in a corner  or simply finish yourself off  Some say that 1984 is not a novel as much as it is an article  true  Throughout the book  I failed to feel any sort of interest or genuine compassion towards Winston as a person  He was just an object  a sample that Orwell chose to illustrate the practices of the Party and their effects on  Same for Julia  The only character that drew my interest was O Brien  When he talked  it was like listening to  or rather reading  Hitler talk  His engrossment   almost religious faith in every word he uttered  no matter how dogmatic or purely nonsensical it was  is fascinating  However  this does not in any way possible lessen its grandeur  On the contrary  it can be argued that this detachment from characters adds to the atmosphere of mishap   portrays a more faithful image of this dehumanized society  What strikes me most about 1984 isn t its politics  complex   mind boggling as it is  but its psychology  Orwell depicts human beings as evil   selfish at the core  not merely by the doings of the Party  He leaves you wondering   Would I do the same were I ever put in such a situation   As to the politics   It has been a topic of discussion for decades now  Yet  one can never say  All has been said   done   with 1984  It can always be viewed in different light  analysed  re analysed    analysed all over again  All I can say is that I am absolutely completely totally mindfucked right now to form any coherent thoughts  and the minute one question is answered  a 1000 new ones pop in my head  That is the beauty of it  Overall  1984 was an exhaustive  compelling  tantalizing read  Never have I been so deeply affected  in heart   mind  by a book  On a side note  1984 is arguably the most inspiring work for the music industry  I fail to think of a great musician who was not influenced by it at some point of their career  And I also fail not to appreciate Radiohead s lyrical genius in capturing the essence of the book in song throughout their albums  specifically Hail To The Thief   OK Computer   Depressing  and worrying  I read this first what feels like an awful long time ago    if I was in my teens when I first read it  I d be surprised  It s amazing how influential it is  how much our culture references it  And how little people actually know about it  if quizzed  1984 hy  shhr m ktb jwrj  wrwyl bjnb rwyth  mzr   lHywn  wlty tndrj Dmn rwyt ldstwby w lkhyl lsysy  tm nshr lrwy   m 1949m lttnb  bm stw wl  lyh l wD  lsysy

reader  how life would be if England were to fall into a regime jus as the ones pointed above  Winston Smith a worker of the ministery of truth is the main character who lives constantly hating and repulsing the big brother  the head of governament in secret though  for anyone against the governament misteriously disappears or is vaporized  The book is allways enticing and most of the times will make you think of some choices and even on the reality of human nature  With a closing that let me at least  flabbergasted  1984 is undeniably a must read  How is it possible that a person who doesn t give a damn to write correctly could have complex political views  And that happens in a society where you are not allowed to think on your own  What is it that makes Winston worth to write about Except of Winston s incomprehensible intelligence  this book was awesome  I couldn t avoid to think about it through the form communism took in my own country  I ve only known capitalism and that was a way to form an idea of what totalitarianism really was  not a great idea  as this book is a dystopia  The lack of food  the lack of information  the absolute truth and the total absence of freedom were things people in Romania had to struggle with  The worst thing about it is that it was not a dystopia  it was reality  Fortunately  people did revolt  things did change    tsh ru fj  an  nk thwy

basis for the Party which is responsible for the dystopia represented in this novel While it sometimes lacks decent pacing and seems to over emphasize some ideas and dystopian descriptions and explanations  it captures the reader with brutal narrative  which actually begins at the time when tragedy has already happened  rendering all the present and future happenings just a matter of course  a predestined and already known path  though one only finds that out later in the story  And yet  the hope of an alternate ending doesn t seem to leave one s mind  no matter how much weight is being stacked on those who try to oppose  dhhwl hdh m khrjt bh mn qrh hdhh lrwyh   rwyh tkhdhk mn  lmk wtqHmk GSb  nk fy mdrth wmslkh   br  lktb jd fy Hbk lqSh  tHky lqSh  n lnZmh lshmwlyh wkyfyh lHkm fh

down  Having read so many YA dystopian books   some good  some not so good   it was refreshing to go back to the roots of the genre  Rather than a Girl Who Is Different From Other Girls who is able to Overthrow The Repressive Government Using Her Super Skills Of Being A Good And Moral Person  we met Joe Bloggs   who  in this instance  is called Winston Smith  He s your average  dull person  and that s what makes this book so chilling  Unlike all those YA books  its purpose is not to empower you and make you feel like You Could Be Katniss Too  We can all identify at least something with Winston  and we feel everything he does As well as being essentially an essay on politics and sociology  it s an essay on human nature  The things we will and will not do  the things we re afraid of  the things we re willing to fight for  and how far  in this case  there being a limit  we re willing to go for them  How easily we believe things  forget things  persuade ourselves that something is true or not true  And honestly  that is the most terrifying thing about this book  1984 is defiantly one of the most frightening and depressive novels in the scifi alternate history genre I was reading to this point  George Orwell creates and throws the reader in a totalitarian state system that is unbearable in its inhumanity  horror filled in its strangeness but somehow instinctively understood and familiar    total surveillance  no privacy in public but at home alike  everyone may be a spy even your own kids are bound to betray you to the party if you deviate from the norm in the lithest and the socalled Thought police even controls what you are thinking and does many more awful things to manipulate and control the masses but even they are a thiny fraction of the might apparatus that seems to control and manipulate everything  even such natural things as love  sex and emotion are banned without permission of the party and in persecuted and but to trail    its awesomely written as awe inspiring and makes you think twice of the fictional world of 1984 and what we have now in present 2012  such things ATCA and the PATRIOT ACT comes to mind    I defiantly recommend this novel but in my opinion the reader should be educated and probably not frightened lightly it s a really gruesome picture George Orwell is printing on the easel of his book    Many of you guys had to read 1984 in school at some point  but I hadn t so I decided to make myself read something useful for once Hands down one of the best dystopian novels I ve ever read   It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen  Nineteen eighty four is about totalitarianism  It basically means that you ll find a story about a government in which the ruler is an absolute dictator  In this case  the government even tries to control what people think and therefore came the concept of  thought crime   Big Brother Big Brother represents the face of the party  The citizens are told that Big Brother is the leader of the party but our main character Winston can never determine whether or not he actually exists  He symbolizes reassurance for most people but in fact the face of big brother is an open threat  one cannot escape his gaze   Are you a thought criminal  The psychological manipulation is taken to a whole new level in this book  People seem to be brainwashed  They believe whatever the government tells them even if it s something as stupid as 2 2 5  To commit a thought crime means that you start having some rebellious thoughts against the party and it is severely punished  You d think that no one can have access to your thoughts  but the truth is that anyone can report you to the thought police even your own children  There s also the telescreens that watch each and every one of your movements and gestures  and if you as much as breath in a suspicious way  they will catch you   If you want to keep a secret  you must also hide it from yourself   Room 101 The room where you ll meet your worst fears  Room 101 is the proof that any human being can be completely and utterly broken to the point where he would be willing to agree with anything you tell him  1984 was kind of a creepy read for me because it has a realistic vibe to it  I would highly recommend it to everyone   Este libro tiene de todo Es muchas cosas Yo soy de Venezuela  Y ya varias personas han dicho que es como si George Orwell hubiera vivido aqui actualmente  y regresado a su epoca y escrito el libro Hay mucha relacion  y la verdad da algo de miedo  no se  te perturba  Y es desalentador el final Algo que yo vi es que el titulo del libro  no es solo el ano en que el protagonista del libro esta  Para mi  es como para ocultar el libro  darle menos importancia no se  De todo lo que es  de la realidad que lo pueden hacer  a mi me parecio que es para ocultarlo  por asi decirlo  Hay partes que tuve que releer  es un poco pesado  casi nada  pero hay que darle mucha atencion Cinco estrellas Que mas puedo decir  no puedo expresarlo bien  Speechless  Chilling  Terrifying  Gripping  Unforgettable  I have no idea what I feel after that  Or think  Que preciosidad de libro  Ha cambiado mi manera de ver muchas cosas  y esos son los libros buenos  los que te hacen parar de sorpresa  porque te acabas de topar con una verdad  y el mundo no es igual de ahora en adelante   It s brainstorming    iA novel that we experience in Arab societies   1984  was written 1948  so it s a kind of prophecy which is applicable till the time being    I couldn t write anything about it  but it s so deeply and alarmingly true    Now I will tell you the answer to my question  It is this  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake  We are not interested in the good of others  we are interested solely in power  pure power  What pure power means you will understand presently  We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing  All the others  even those who resembled ourselves  were cowards and hypocrites  The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods  but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives  They pretended  perhaps they even believed  that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time  and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal  We are not like that  We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it  Power is not a means  it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power  Now you begin to understand me   How do we know that two and two make four  Or that the force of gravity works  Or that the past is unchangeable  If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind  and if the mind itself is controllable   what then  http   www youtube com watch v 3eTjft     Reading this book was like being held captive in a world where you experience both the fear of an hostile and depressing environment and the desire to stay and see what happens next  However  the latter is more prominent  The totalitarian society in 1984 functions a bit like the super ego  that is the seat of conscience  The ID resides completely at the unconscious level of an individ  satisfying its inborn biological instincts  This appetite is considered to be all that is wrong with individuals  thus the need of overpowering it with the super ego is necessary  The Party manipulates the individ s super ego  telling him what is right and what is not  The Thought Police catches all that the super ego cannot conceal    The smallest thing could give you away  An unconscious look of anxiety  a habit of muttering to yourself  anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality  of having something to hide   Nechapes  jaka krasa je v niceni slov  Vis  ze newspeak je jediny jazyk na svete  jehoz slovni zasoba se kazdym rokem zmensuje     Tento uryvek me fascinuje  Nevystihuje sice knihu a prilis ani nenaznacuje  o cem se jedna  presto me neuveritelne fascinuje  A ke knize Nemam slov  Ja proste nemam slov Ten konec byl    dechberouci  Emotivni  Smutny  Kniha me dokazala vtahnout do deje  dokazala ve mne probudit opravdove silne emoce  a ja nejenom sledovala dej  ale opravdu zive pribeh prozivala  Bylo i par situaci pri kterych  navzdory tomu  ze jsem vedela  co se stane  ve mne hrklo a ja se vydesila  nechtela  aby to tak bylo  citila  jak mi srdce poplasene busi v hrudi a    1984 je opravdu dobry  propracovany roman  ve kterem autor vytvoril svuj vlastni svet   ne svet  ale budoucnost    a promyslel jej do vsech detailu  venoval se kazde malickosti a vytvoril jej tak uveritelne  az se mi jezily vlasy na hlave  Je to desivy svet  zkazeny a zvraceny  A ja se bojim  opravdu bojim  aby nase spolecnost jednou nedopadla stejne  Vymyvani mozku  slepa poslusnost  desive chovani deti  nekonecna  zbytecna valka    a dalsi slova v podobnem duchu  kterymi bych knihu charakterizovala Co me na knize fascinuje je neuveritelna realisticnost  s kterou autor popisuje situace  sokujici sceny  ktere se me doopravdy dotykaji a ktere desi  Fascinuje me i kazdy neprilis vyznamny detail  ktery autor pridava a ktery dodava pribehu na opravdovosti  I vystihnuti postav zvladl Orwell velmi dobre  Nedokazala jsem se do hlavni postavy uplne vzit  jelikoz byla o hodne starsi nez ja a k tomu jeste opacneho pohlavi  ale dokazala jsem ji pochopit a chtela pro nej jen to nejlepsi  Jako pro dobreho pritele  Mimo hlavni postavu se duleziteji vyskytuji jen dve dalsi  ktere byly stejne dobre popsane  a pak ikona Velkeho bratra  tvare Strany  ktera svet ovlada  Byl vsude  A stejne je pro me tak zahadou Orwell ve sve knize uvazuje nad budoucnosti  Ne tou popsanou v knize  ale tou  jaka by mohla byt  A ja pred nim smekam  jelikoz budoucnost takova opravdu je  Neni dokonala  ale v mnoha ohledech se doopravdy shoduje s Orwellovym odhadem  Stejne tak me ohromily filozoficke myslenky  ktere Orwell v knize rozpitval Muzu knihu jenom doporucit  Orwell umi psat a jeho styl se mi zda poutavy a dobry  kniha je na povinnou cetbu opravdu skvela  Soucasnym trendem je dystopie  ze  Myslim  ze timto romanem mam svuj deficit splneny  K ostatnimu   me hodnoceni mluvi samo za sebe  Pet hvezd davam jen kniham  ktere si to doopravdy zaslouzi  A tato kniha mezi ne bezesporu patri      It strikes me each time I read this book  particularly the opening chapter and certain of the more pivotal scenes  how well it is written for what is essentially a polemical tract  The point isn t really whether Orwell s vision is realized or realizable  the point is that  while you are in it  he sells it so well  It is also important to remember that 1984 is not a warning about a possible future  but an exploration of Orwell s contemporary present  magnified to horrific proportions 1984 is a story about relationships  It is the story of Winston s relationship with Julia  but also and even more importantly  his relationship with O Brien  It is O Brien that represents some kind of fantasy comrade in arms to him at the beginning  he even says that he is writing his diary to O Brien   and it is O Brien that brings him back into the fold by the end  Ultimately  of course  it is a story of the relationships that build up a conformist state  Simplistic political analyses will mistake the State  or  the System   for a monolithic object  while slightly more critical perspectives will note that it is  made up of people   A better analysis of oppression realizes that it is based in relationships  and discusses methods for altering relationships in order to reduce oppression  In Orwell s bleak world  of course  it is impossible to do so  because the relationships are defined within a context which provides no opportunity for new relations to form   all relationships ultimately lead back to the State  in the culmination of the totalitarian dream  Again  this is probably more useful as a reminder of what is possible in a different context than as a warning of a realizable end to freedom  I just finished reading 1984 and it is now officially one of my favourite books  Orwell s writing style is modern  minimal and easy to follow  as a result  it never gives you the impression that you are actually reading a book that was written in 1948  66 years ago One of the most popular dystopian future novels that were ever written  1984 presents the reader with a world in which everybody is a slave to the leading party  even the members of the party themselves  People have been turned into beings with no feelings or original thoughts  have been stripped down from all of their rights and are just used as a means to an end  In Jo Brand s words  1984 is  more relevant to today than almost any other book that you can think of   However  even though some of the techniques described by Orwell have been are currently being used by political parties all over the world  making 1984 look somehow prophetic  I really disagree with the overall message of the book  I am actually a strong believer of the fact that you can control people s bodies and you can try control their minds  but you can never smite neither their feelings or their never ending strive for freedom  1984 is the first dystopian future novel that I have ever read and even though I m not a huge fan of fiction  I really  truly loved it  This book is bound to make you think  debate and discuss and that s good enough reason for everyone to read it  This book resonates even today  and Orwell s fictional world warns of the totalitarianism that is pervasive in regimes across the globe  A timeless and unforgiving look at the subjugation that can occur when an apathetic populace grows complacent in its duty to protect freedom  An extraordinary novel that immortalized its author  Stalin s Russia in England  One of my all time favorites it tells the story of the struggle on one man against an oppressive system  It is also a powerful metaphor of the struggle of freedom and sanity over dictatorship and insanity  The Golden country referred in the book is a never land that is accessible to every author in his her dreams even if he she does not knows it  1984 is a grim portrayal of social control in totalitarian societies   from widespread surveillance to the control of language  It s a powerful  terrifying account of one man s attempt to resist by maintaining his freedom of thought    And his ultimate failure to do so Newspeak   the official language of the dictatorship   has crept into our own language in the years since publication  I read the book to understand the ideas of doublethink  crimestop  doubleplusungood  crimethink and duckspeak  The book itself is as relevant today as its ever been  Totalitarians are always with us  even as totalitarianism itself mutates into new forms  If you haven t read this book already  do so  I heard that 26  of people who claimed to have read 1984 had not  I resolved not to be one of these people  The book is so woven into the cultural and literary consciousness that it was impossible to know  even upon completing it  whether I d read it before or not  Regardless  I got a great deal out of reading it  or re reading it   The book is a terrifying master work  made more terrifying by the obvious parallels to reality  Reading 1984 acutely demonstrates the fact that we are marching headlong and willingly towards the kind of surveillance state that Orwell warns us about  That at every opportunity we gleefully trade our actual freedom for illusory security  That we allow ourselves to succumb to demagoguery  And that we support and fight in wars which we have no hope of winning  But  through the process of double think  it is easy to be both aware and unaware of these facts  to suppress them from one s consciousness as soon as as that twinge of worry about the current state of politics arises  And that is why reading 1984 again was worthwhile  It forces us  even if for only a moment  to see the state of the world sharply  as the horrifying place that it truly is  1984 is a dystopian novel which basically trumps all over any and every other dystopian novel I ve read  The world that George Orwell created seems to familar and too real  It is something that could be happening right now and if not I could definitely see happening  This chilling novel depicts society and sticks with you long after reading it Plot  contains spoilers   In the nutshell this book follows Winston Smith who works in the Ministry of Truth which just basically changes any past articles which may have been wrong or contradicts the current political situation  He does not agree with the system and see s the flaws of that society but one can t just rebel the system and be seen as a martyr  The Thought Police would have caught him because they have screens everywhere and even the wrong facial expression would get them killed  Winston meets Julia  a beautiful young girl who also does not agree with the system and they fall in love and carry out a sordid love affair  Winston assumed that a co worker of his called O Brien was also a rebel and O Brien confirmed this as well as confirming the existence of a rebel group and handed Winston a book about the details of the society and how it works  Winston then gets caught by the Thought Police and it turns of that O Brien works for them  Winston then gets tortured and broken down and continues to say that he will always hate Big Brother ect however the most chilling part was right at the end and Winston s last thought before he got shot was that he loved Big Brother  That showed me how there is enough power to break you down until you believe what they want you to believe which is just haunting  That was a very large nutshell sorryMy book review does not give it justice  but i deeply recommend this book  lHrb hy lsWlmlHry  hy l bwdy  ljhl hw lqw    khdhny wqt Twyl l fhm hdhh ljml  l wryl   rwy  1984 mn wjh  nZry   Zm  ml l wryl w ll db lHdyth bshkl  m

mums favourite books  It wasn t until a friend of mine pointed out that the Muse album  Resistence  was written about this book that I decided to give it ago  I wasn t sure what to expect and at this point I hadn t read very many books at all so had little to compare it with but I was blown away  I think the connection with Muse added another level to it for me which heightened my enjoyment of reading it but I was genuinely impressed  Its very advanced for its time and very accurately predicted the society we arguably now live in even if some of the more extreme aspects aren t yet present reality  much of it is  I was throughly impressed and this is now a firm favourite on the shelf  I really enjoyed reading 1984  I had some idea what the book was about but not the details  The first part of the book is mostly about Winston Smith living life in a monitored world where he feels completely alone in knowing that everything is a lie  The 2nd part is about him defying the government for love sex and joining a underground organization that was dedicated to taking the government down  The third part is the most impressive  it s revealed he was set up and monitored more closely than he thought  he is brainwashed into loving the government only to be killed once his brain is  pure  he thinks he can hold onto his sanity and have the final laugh but he doesn t  I felt part of the book was predictable  the secret organization was a set up by the government  what I didn t expect was for him to be brainwashed into loving big brother the ending was the most shocking and different from what I expected because I did think he was going to manage to do his last minute laughs at big brother and corrupt  but he didn t and I loved it   I do not have the audacity to  review  what is  in my opinion  one of the most important books of the 20th century  Even beyond the nihilism and political commentary  the story itself has exceeded my expectations by far  Doubleplusgood

the same time  It s really good book about cruel world  I really hope something like this won t happen  It might be the best book I ve ever read  It is so powerful  it takes you to the guts  and won t let you indifferent  I would definitely recommend it to anybody who seeks reflexion on society and human nature  War is Peace  freedom is Slavery  and Ignorance is Strength  This is the slogan for the Party that runs Oceania and the horrible future that it is in  George Orwell s masterpiece showed what will happen if the people of Earth don t stop fighting and trying to destroy each other  This novel effectively displayed a foreseeable future in which the world is ran by three major powers constantly in a struggle for power  Although that was major point in the book  Orwell was also effectively showing how fragile the human society is and how easily the people as a whole can be changed  without them even knowing  He uses Winston to show how people can have different views than the government  but when they are shared they are quickly squashed and never heard of again  He also uses Winston to show how easy it is to have your mind altered  like when he was made to love Big Brother when in his heart he knew he hated it  This can be seen throughout history  like in Communist Russia and Nazi Germany  Overall I would give this novel 5 stars  for the challenge that it was to read and that it had hidden meaning for the readers to uncover as they went through the book  ry  h ry  h ry  h l  b d md     lshy  lmr b w l bqr  bq    h  z  Hdthh mTbqh tqryb ll  byHSl f  m Zm dwl l

developing  It was chilling also as that was when gene selection as getting popular  2008  in modern culture  so we saw how Wells predicted this  Thankfully  child bearing is still  usually  about love  This book gave insight into a totally different society  that isn t too far from what ours could become   DECADES before it was even a thought to doctors  Great read   I started to study the 20th century totalitarien regimes at the same time I started to read 1984  You could say that what happens in the book is completely fake and we could never have such a regime like the one in the book  but what it seems to me is that this is book is a loyal representation of those regimes  They say on the story that their current regime is better than the previous but it is exactly the same Nineteen Eighty Four is the perfect insight of how nazism  stalinism or fascism happen and worked Highly reccomended for people that love history  I found 1984 to be quite a revealing read in regards to what can happen to a society that is too controlled and oppressed to the point of not even being allowed to fall in love  In this regard  the book is quite depressing at times  but at the same time  it makes me so glad that I don t actually live like this  and hope I never have to    In the future  the three super nations fight for control of the control of the earth    These three nations are Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  I the midst of all this  Winston Smith works for the English Socialist  or Ingsoc in the government s new language New speak  Winston hates Ingsoc  so he and his new lover Julia plan to rebel    The book dwells completely on the understanding of politics after World War Two  This is the core of modern politics as we know it  Orwell cautions the earth that sometime in the future  the nations will be obsessed with orthodoxy as Syme describes  orthodoxy will be defined by one word  unconsciousness   The world will be too obsessed with being perfect  realizing the brutal foresight of the Orwellian dystopia  When reading books in a grade 12 English class you tend to hear a lot of different opinions   most biased due to a dislike in reading  The one thing I noticed a lot was a very basic love vs hate opinion on the book  You re reading 1984   I loved that book  or the more common   I hated that book  Personally  I loved it but I can see why people who don t care for reading would hate it  It s not exactly an easy read  though not overly difficult either  There are a lot of paragraphs in which it seems like the author is trying to add his personal opinions on life and matters about society  Though in this book it works  provoking thought  A lot of people in my class obviously dislike thought provoking books and so dislike this book I think many people are missing out due to their biased   I don t like reading   You probably don t like reading because you ve yet to find the right book   l  dr   y klmt  ktb rwy  Sdm  wmw thr  tj lk tnZr thny

in places agree with the present  The irony of falsifying history in the name of truth is ignored due to the attitude known as Doublespeak in the official government language of Oceananna  This is a dystopian story of what life is like in a totalitarian future in which the government controls every aspect of the people s lives   especially their thought I first read 1984 in high school sometime in the 1960s  and it stuck with me forever  giving me a fear of big government that has colored all my political decisions since that time  I read it again in 1984 to mark the year  and noted that although the year had arrived  the oppression was  thankfully  holding off  So  now I have read it again  The year is 2013  and although it has been almost 30 years since 1984  we are closer in spirit today than we were 30 years ago  We have the NSA spying on everyone in the country  we have the IRS stifling free speech  we have a  seemingly  endless war half a world away  and we have a president who seems determined to obliterate freedom and impose socialism   technology has only made the possibility of a government like we see in the book even more possible  and more intrusive Unlike other dystopian stories  this one ends without a shred of hope  there is no revolution  and Winston is waiting for his execution knowing that Big Brother is right  and loving him for being right  This book does not offer any reason to think things will get better   Animal Farm   Hayvan Ciftligi ndeki akici ama sade dilini gelistiren George Orwell in yine ayni akicilikta ama bu sefer usta bir dille

bolumden itibaren baslayan politika dersi niteligindeki soylemi bile  1984 un neden basyapit oldugunu ozetler nitelikte  Tek kelimeyle inanilmaz bir modern klasik 16 01 2015Istanbul  TurkiyeAlp Turgut I think this book effected perception of humaninty  I write this after my second read through  The first time I read 1984  I was either 13 or 14  and I didn t gather everything I should have from it  At that age  I really only understood that  life sucks for these people because their government watches everything they do and censors everything  Essentially  that is the main theme of the book  But it s saying something much  much more than just that  This book is such an amazing example of how easily power can be twisted by a governing body until it holds full control upon its citizens  It s often labeled as science fiction  and sure  some of the content featured in the book is a little out of this world  but it leaves you realizing just how deadly power can be and how easily the circumstances in Oceania could become reality in the world  and how they already are Orwell had something important to say with this  I encourage everyone who hasn t to read this more than once  There is a lot to gather from this book  a lot that you more than likely will not absorb from one read  This book might start out a little bit slow dry  and might seem uninteresting  But a couple of chapters in and you will get hooked  This book will make you question everything you ever believed and thought of your government  it will send chills down your spine  And towards the end  YOU WILL FEEL GOOSEBUMPS FROM THE TWIST OF EVENTS     Scary stuff    The book  When basically stated  shows a totalitarian government at its worst  It teaches many lessons both philosophical and moral  It illustrates how the basic function of cognition or in other words  thinking  could be manipulated and distorted  The government uses wordings  naming of things in a way to alter the perceptions of its citizens  for ex   Victory gin    Big Brother    Ministry of Love  Peace etc   all these words bring a quasi feeling of prosperity  progress and superiority  Other methods used to control its citizens include  1 Imaginary war or imaginary enemy  The Party bombs the proles and says its Eurasia   Proles look at the party as a protector  and remember  desperate times call for desperate measures  is what the party uses as an excuse   2  Erasing anything historical and killing the elderly  so the people won t have anything to compare their current society  living standard to  thus not realizing they are living like shit  3  the government uses war as an excuse to make people work hard  Keep them busy  produce more  and instead of distributing the products made  using the military and war needing supply excuse the party manages to keep the inner party members living in luxury and everyone else   not   4  The party takes away the pleasures of the citizens  ex  Sex is made into a disgusting thing  ppl don t have sex  unless want to have loveless brainwashed children who will snitch on their own parents    and throughout the book you could see how men are always twitching which is b c the are so suppressed etc    have so much energy    The party uses that energy to put the citizens  Not the proles  at work  5  The party destroys language since language forms thought    the party wants to control people s thoughts   Other methods are used such as constant surveillance and whatnot   But what really gave me the chills were the convincing distortions of rational thought and how different perspectives  Don t want to spoil  although clearly are false  could be believable  if you were living in oceania   if you were brainwashed by the party      The book has too many twists in it and deep thoughts  that I can t even start listing   Reading this you will start questioning your own morals  Is it okay to do bad for the greater good    Is it okay to do good for bad    confession is not betrayal    Would you kill to save a life    Would you demoralize to revive humanity      OKAY I M GONNA STOP HERE   JUST READ THE BOOK  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON MANY THINGS     I stared at the blinking cursor for a the longest time  trying to come up with a way to sum up my thoughts on 1984 and I honestly don t think I can put into words what it made me feel Throughout the whole book my beliefs kept being challenged  my feelings played with  As things get progressively darker you keep hoping from the bottom of your heart that they improve  though it never gets to the point where you re just hopeless  because the book is written in a way where you feel like you live in this dystopian society and you can t just stay put and accept it as it is I generally don t care much about politics  but I think it d be impossible not to feel involved with the politics present in 1984  Very few books made me feel as angry  as sad and as hopeful as 1984 did at various points  Some of the exposition is a bit long  but it never felt like it was slowing the pace down or like filler One of the hardest things to wrap my head around was the fact that the book was written over 60 years ago  yet the vast majority of it remains remarkably up to date  Sure  a bit of the technology feels a bit silly  but pretty much everything else is spot on If you want a book that ll leave you thinking for hours on end after finishing it  I honestly can t recommend 1984 enough  Whether you re into politics or not  I think everyone owes it to themselves to read 1984  I couldn t possibly hope to do it justice  but it s definitely one of the best books I ve ever read and it s almost embarassing it took me this long to actually read it  mn  jml lrwyt lsysy  lty qr th fy Hyty ktb  skhr   n lnZm ldykttwry  wTryqth ltGyyb  qwl lbshr  I still can t wrap my head around the fact that the protagonist didn t prevail  What is survival under oppression Furthermore  what is obedience in oppression   the worst  I d say  Of course I didn t expect the story to make this sort of turn  It s absolutely unpredictable   especially in the modern literature sense  where you get this array of dystopian novels where the characters more or less survive after a series of hardships  It gives you a different edge to the whole theme of a dystopian world  and makes you wonder why or how George Orwell was initially moved inspired to write in the first place  I d definitely have to do some research  as I almost always do right after a good book  On a completely personal note   have I grown old and emotionless that I didn t really feel  anything  after this book  Which also happened with  A Visit from the Goon Squad  by the way  I m trying to be positive and conclude that it s only because I just enjoy happy endings  Back to topic  though  It is terrifying to read about a character such as O Brien  and that from Winston s perspective  It leaves me with an eerie feeling of being deranged  The beliefs of the Party  or philosophies if you will  were just bizarre   and more so because I do not think it is impossible in the realistic world at all  Twisting someone s mind isn t entirely that difficult  I ve seen it being done all the time   and how do we keep the integrity of one s character  mind and soul  It seems impossible in a world of cruelty and thirst for power  Honestly  aren t we all partly brainwashed already at this point  All these aspects are what makes 1984 worthy of five stars  It isn t just that Orwell is a wonderful writer  it is how he form his thoughts and deliver his story that makes this read one of the most unique experience I ve had  I wouldn t say it s the best  but I didn t feel like I was robbed off of anything  like what happens with most  less than good  books   I definitely recommend this one if you like a brain teaser   La guerre c est la paixla liberte c est l esclavagel ignorance c est la forceApres quelques annees a me dire qu il faudrait bien que je lise ce classique  j ai fini par le lire  j ai souvenir de l avoir commence il y a plusieurs annees et de ne point l avoir lu plus loin que le premier chapitre   Ce livre est magistral par sa capacite a etre toujours d actualite et ce  plus de 50 ans apres son ecriture  Il requestionne les questions de pouvoir  de guerre  de liberte  etc  Il est un puissant outil de reflexion sur notre systeme politique actuel et sur la facon dont la societe est organisee  Un livre a lire et a relire  car les sens caches sont multiples   Definitely a must read   My favorite book  Brilliant  visionary  work of a genus humanist and philosopher  that is my first opinion All my previous 5 stars rating give me no room for this one  Should I change all my previous The feeling of inadequacy of my writing is overwhelming me once again  I wish I have the ability to voice my opinion of this    Great  wonderful  horrible  eye opening  self examining    Insert the appropriate word  because my vocabulary is too poor  Book It felt so real that it is frightening The  telescreens   the book is from 1948    I remember affair when pupils at school received free computers to learn lately  that had spied on them transmitting video to principals of the school The Physical Jerks   forced exercise   nothing to do with todays obesity problems   Come on comrades  put a bit of life into it      Winston     succeded in touching his toes with knees unbent  for the first time in sevaral years  From real life Corporations   increase of 50   of work load didn t so far cause a strike of working class  bad economy excuse  I do not want to believe it is self fulfilled prophecy for human kind  but    It is very very scary even now  Unlike a lot of people who were told to read this in High School  I didn t learn of it until a few brief years ago  I d heard of it  but didn t really  get  why so many people were blown away by it  Then I read it and have since made it a point to get my hands on everything this man had ever written  George Orwell was no doubt a genius  visionary  prophet and a definite priceless gift to all of humanity  1984 written in the late 1940 s   I see 1949 in my book  but I don t want to nail down a date as there have been reprints   someone else here has stated 1948 which if so  is still incredibly beyond remarkable because what he describes is something that sounds so much like the world we currently live in today  and the potential for it to be this world which he describes  Well  unfortunately the means are in fact all present now  We can be observed pretty much around the clock from when we leave our homes until we arrive  With what can be done with cell phones  GPS etc but I won t go into what should already be quite obvious to all  The fact of the matter is he foretold with pin point accuracy just how things could be and the frightening thing is many of these things are in my opinion in affect  New Speak  Thought Police  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  Big Brother and countless other things he writes about ring with such an eery realness one has to wonder if he time traveled into our present day and perhaps slightly beyond and then returned to his time to write about it to truly warn us what was at stake  I won t tell the story  as George does that exceptionally well to the point where you feel as if you are seeing this  World  he paints through the eyes of the main character  Winston   So much so that even though it was written years ago  it reads as if in many cases it could have been written today  or yesterday  Like Gene Rodenbury s Star Trek  George Orwell s 1984 is definitely light years ahead of its time  I don t think this book can be recommended highly enough to those who have not yet read it  Nor do five stars even remotely come close to giving this Master Piece it s due credit  Your Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak  hw lktb ldhy ywDH lk  l  wjh ldqh mfhwm

And was really runs in my thoughts were the notion and the collaborations of this book  Can it ever come to reality  And if it does  who could possibly imagine how it is going to be like  This dystopia has two mingled factors totalitarian government along with history  As I quote   Big Brother   this concept is already building up in out current society  Furthermore  the book was aggrieving  yet utterly intellectual    1984 is at once an incredible tale of the past  present   future  It takes moments of the now  makes them the yesteryear  and turns the now into the future  To control the past is to control the now  You do not need to work to control tomorrow because you already control yesterday  The past is fluid  The past changes  There is no physical time  Love is subjective  and there is no such thing as bad  Hate is love  War is peace  Slavery is freedom  __________________If you haven t read this book and don t want to be utterly confused  don t read it  But if you want to read something that will make you think every minute of every page  read it now   because tomorrow it may be a different book entirely   I recently read the book 1984 by George Orwell a wonderfully interesting book displaying a possible future from a 1949 perspective  The main character Winston  is deeply troubled by the current society and government  which is ruled by a single party and controlled by the ominous Big Brother  that hides the truth from its citizens  redefines reality  and imposes rules that prohibit independent thought  When Winston is betrayed by someone he formerly thought of as an ally and brutally tortured  he resigns himself to believing the lies of the singular party and begins to find comfort in the totalitarian figure of Big Brother  One of the reasons why I loved 1984 unconventional plot line  Most dystopian novels begin with a general dislike of the government that then morphs into a deep seeded hatred for it and ends with a successful large scale rebellion  1984 did no such thing  Winston s attitude at the beginning of the book began as a hate for the party and their policy  Now while there s no doubt that his feelings become more complex and nuanced throughout the course of the story  the ending is very much the opposite of a successful rebellion and rather a broken acceptance of defeat  Another reason why I loved 1984  was how relevant it was to modern day society  We antagonize many of the major elements of the world in the book  like the lack of privacy  which is an issue we face today in our society  This made it incredibly interesting to read and to later discuss as the problems of the fictional world aligned with those of the real world Overall  I loved 1984 because of its uniqueness and relevance  1984 is the dystopian classic about a parallel universe in which despotic autocracy has seized absolute control over society  the personification of what would have happened if another party joined WWI against the Triple Entente and the Central powers  resulting in a quandary stalemate that would last for decades  The book guides the audience in the perspective of Winston Smith  a forlorn bourgeoisie serving the totalitarian Oceanic government as he slowly dissipates into obscurity and duress  There  one would witness him as slowly begins to unravel the truth behind life  adapting and challenging the very poison that reduced the world to the callous state of deceit and corruption  of war and suffering Personally I would recommend this book for fanatics of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury because its cunning and intriguing  and it brings perspective in a unique way  Yet I wouldn t recommend this book for those who crave for action and war  for this book details the quaint yet miserable life of common middle class savant as he strives for survival in an inhospitable world of stark despair and death  I adore this book because of the suspense and paranoia it instills amongst its readers  Every moment  every paragraph of every chapter  there would be aspects of enigma and curiosity  of moments where the reader questions the  what   It is this impalpable understanding of the  next  and the spontaneity of the narrative that truly makes this a must read novel for all  George Orwell describes the year 1984 in his novel written in 1948  The future he describes is based on a totalitarian regime and ruled by the Big Brother and the party  Simply  individualism is suppressed and the party is in charge of every aspect of people s lives  All media  education is controlled and even more people are being watched through telescreens constantly to make sure they are behaving as expecteed  Beyond these  social engineering is in place and people s thought are redesigned  Individual thinking and questioning are banned  There is no certain past but only present and and written history  Our main character tries to question his system and goes over all the kind of issues George Orwell makes an amazing piece of writing and imagines a period in human life which might hold through in its some aspects some time in the future  His analysis of his current time and projection into future and his complete storytelling makes this book a must read  mind blowing experience  Towards to the end of the book  you cannot know how the main character will end up being and his terrifying experience connects you to this book  At the end of this novel  you will definitely add to yourself and you will definitely have many phrases  propaganda lines  scenes stick to your mind forever  Magnificent classical work    BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU   These words got under my skin as I read 1984 by George Orwell  In this book  the author goes in depth about a totalitarian society  where information that is transmitted in any way to the public is intercepted through governmental strategies and forces  The governmental party or  big brother  as it has been continually referred to throughout the story  is  always watching  the society it govern s to make sure that they are not breaking any of the laws that are set in place  The main character Winston Smith develops a strong hatred towards this system as the story unfolds  leading him into a state of defiance and law breaking  In the book  Winston has a forbidden love affair with his girlfriend  Julia  The affair is forbidden  because the government forbids two people to be in love  There are leagues of men called the thought police  who are able to read the thoughts of the citizens in the city where the book takes place  Oceania  This disturbing tale of the extreme invasion of privacy  goes places that most book s I have read to not tend to go for the simple reason that at times  it feels like real life  Overall  the story is about the fight against the sending and receiving of information  and the interceptions that may occur to deter one from hearing the whole truth and nothing but the truth  It seems that primary  secondary  and tertiary sources do not consistently exist for the main character s to gain new knowledge  Every time Winston seems to grasp a new concept of how things are and how he can get around it  he is intercepted by the government to ensure that he doesn t know too much  Orwell really goes in depth about the accessing of information and the way that people can perceive things  while also letting us take an even closer look at the way that interception of important information can occur to individuals all over the world  There is a sense of an anti governmental stance  It seems that Orwell had a personal issue with the way his country was ran when this was written  and he just simply will not let it go  I found this plot to be extremely tightly constructed  with no holes to be poked in its plot at all  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who feel s like they have at one time or another been betrayed by something or someone that they put their trust into for the simple reason of   thats just the way it is   1984 made me take a closer look at the things I deal with each day of my life  and the information I am given  I feel like Orwell s main objective in this book was to make the people of the world to examine everything a lot closer than they previously had been in the 30 s and 20 s  Truly a first look at radicalism towards government and gaining facts on our own through our own experiences   n tzyyf lHqyq   n tGyyr ltrykh  n tSdyq lsTwr   n t lyh lshkhS  n tnmyT lmjtm       n tjrym lfkr  ndm tSbH dhrt lhw mrqb  wySbH

the opportunity in the middle of my post secondary career to pick it up  but I was much too busy to be reading novels then  Finally  as a full time working member of society  I decided to pick it up and read it  graciously loaned to me by a colleague  I am ashamed to admit that it has taken me so long to read it  but after picking it up I could hardly put it down  Granted  the Penguin Books version is rather small in terms of dimension  but the flow was astounding The book tests what we know about modern life through Newspeak and the basis of government  As a reader  you have to decide whether it is a utopian or dystopian society  That is one of the best questions to ask yourself as you are reading it   What a fantastic book  Every high school should pursue this great writing in its classrooms  But the question is would they  This is an eye opener  It reveals the controlling world that we live in and schools are just another institution  According to Aldous Huxley  schools are institutions that are in fact prisons  Indeed  Huxley and Orwell meet at many crossroads when the way of thought considered  But  this is not a Huxley book  This is the best of George Orwell  From  newspeak  to mind control  Uncle Sam will break you down until you have no personality left  I think a large amount of people would agree with that statement  In this book  Orwell predicts life in the year 1984  It is about us becoming zombies  robots  clones  etc for the powers of B  These powers you will never really get to know  They will torture you  torment you  and brainwash you until you become what they want you to be  Genius isn t it  This book is a must read for anybody who wishes to liberate their mind from mental slavery  What a great start  Open your eyes and see what is happening in the world and you will be seeing  1984  each and every day  Can pleasure exist without pain  To the powers that we will never get to personally know  the answer is  no  Although pleasure is just an agreeable sensation  the other guy insists the introduction of pain  We must resist and that is what the main protagonist  Winston Smith  of this novel did  How did he do it  Well you must read the book to find out or else you would have known if you have read it  However  it is one of those books that need to be read a few times to be fully understood  Certainly  there are many doors of perception hidden in this story  Rereading this book will open some more of them and enlighten you about the path humanity is following  Which is the ultimate self destruction we have ever seen and that is losing our character as human beings to what  We exactly will never know but thankfully  Orwell is here to open our eyes and help us understand that we are falling apart to a grand master  a small group of people that can do whatever they want and control us like sheep  5 star book  guaranteed pleasure for the begging right to the very end  A haunting  timeless novel that offers us a very real warning about where society could be heading  I finally got around to reading this classic after having read several other dystopic novels by authors such as Zamyatin and Burgess  Of all the books I ve ever read though  this may be the most truly harrowing  and not in the classic suspense horror sense of the word  but rather because of the truth behind what Orwell writes and its relevance to our own society I found myself thinking about totalitarian regimes that have existed in the time since this book was published  The Khmer Rouge employed some of the most extreme methods of thought control by effectively eradicating the intricate Khmer culture Cambodians had improved upon for centuries  Pol Pot and his cronies veiled their crimes and efforts for a solid four years while the outside world looked on completely unaware to what was happening inside Cambodia  Sweden even sent their own delegates on diplomatic visits to the Cambodia during this time  where they were greeted with open arms and treated with the utmost honor by the regime  who of course never showed them the killing fields or prison camps rampant throughout the country  Obviously  Mao s cultural revolution was also similar in many ways  and can be paralleled extensively with the super bloc powers of 1984  At the risk of examining deeper some of these other repressive regimes I do not know enough about  I will just finish by saying that it does not take much effort to uncover such referenced regimes in parts of the world both western and not  Take for instance  some of the rhetoric being used today in the 2016 presidential race and relate it to Orwell s forebodings in 1984  Frightening indeed    This book was the first in the long time to have me shouting for the main character  Winston  It is truly  the  classic dystopian novel with a deeply fleshed out world and complicated but accessible political system  There was no distance between myself and the events of the book   when the protagonists were in trouble  I was feeling pure fear for them  Even in the very beginning where Winston begins his inevitable downfall  by his own realisation   I felt an overwhelming joy for this particularly ordinary fellow who decided to begin recording his blasphemous thoughts in a diary  A plain act built up successfully by Orwell to be utterly revolutionary  The only criticism I can make of this book is where  in the middle  things slow down quite a bit during the romance portion of the novel  Otherwise  the penultimate chapters more than make up for this slightly dull section of the novel and contain such wildly exciting yet terrifying ideas that I sometimes pick up 1984 again just to hear the chilling voice of O Brien in my head  It is a shame that Orwell died so young  but fortunate that he lived long enough to give us 1984 and Animal Farm  1984 is  quite simply  one of my favorite books  I first read it when selecting a book for a high school English class project  and have re read it every few years ever since  George Orwell s 1949 novel never fails to move me  scare me  worry me  or draw me in  This reading  I listened to it on audiobook for the first time  an experience I highly recommend As most know  1984 is a dystopian novel   the English language dystopian novel to many  one of these days  I ve got to read Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin s We  which preceded 1984   Set in the oppressive future of 1984 in London  the major city of Airstrip One  formerly England   the novel chronicles the efforts of everyman Winston Smith to defy the omnipotent ruling Party of Oceania  the principles of Ingsoc  English Socialism   and   most especially   the ever present  omniscient gaze of Big Brother  the symbol and embodiment of the system itself Smith begins to rebel in various ways  in particular with his lover Julia  Merely loving anyone but Big Brother is itself a crime  Winston and Julia carry on their relationship  both out of feelings for each other and to break the rules they despise  Eventually  of course  they are arrested by the Thought Police  since   after all   Big Brother Is Watching  Taken to the Ministry of Love for re education  Winston learns what the Party is really after Many of the elements of the novel have become concerns for modern times  especially with technological innovations that have made Orwell s science fiction science reality  Surveillance  censorship  perpetual war  manufactured patriotism  control of the language  exploitation of the middle classes  Orwell drew much of his inspiration from the Soviet Union  but it s easy to find examples of all these concerns in the front page of your local newspaper on a daily basis As much as the technology is terrifying  the truly disturbing part of 1984 is in the mind of our hero  Winston  His struggle to remain himself while being both figuratively and literally  mentally and physically  beaten down by the apparatus of the party is gut wrenching  as is the final result of the struggle  The last line of the book is one of   perhaps the most   powerful I ve ever read As I stated above  this was the first time I ve listened to 1984 as an audiobook  I listened to Blackstone Audio s 2007 production  narrated by Simon Prebble  Prebble is a favorite of mine  and he s at his best here  There s a certain gravity to Prebble s voice that invests his work with a power that  while enjoyable in other books  is vital here to reflect the spirit of the novel  Winston s struggles  hopes  sufferings  all are brought to vivid  grim life by Prebble s strong narration  I highly recommend Prebble s reading to anyone looking to listen to 1984  The production runs approximately 11 5 hours 1984 is a classic  I cannot recommend Orwell s masterpiece enough  Though 1984 has come and gone  Orwell s powerful warning remains timeless   3 This is the kind of novel that you don t really want to read when your teacher tells you it s required work  You read 20 pages and decide you hate it but persevere because you know you ll eventually have to write an essay on it  But then it really shakes you to the core when you finally get into it  It is brilliant  it is frightening  it is unbelievably relatable and the events are actually coming true  1984 is one of the books that I can honestly say changed me forever  Sure  Winston  the main character is a little flat  but that s the whole point  He has been rubbed raw by the insane society that Orwell created  This book is not character driven  so character lovers  beware  this book is not for you  It is completely society and plot driven and I loved every minute of it Brief idea of what this novel is about  Winston Smith is a regular guy living in the totalitarian society of Oceania   a place of consistent war  omnipresent government surveillance  Big Brother is watching     and public mind control  You can be punished for even thinking the wrong thing  thoughtcrime   the public lives in an eternal state of fear and blandness  Winston works for the Ministry of Truth  MiniTru  and is responsible for re writing old newspaper articles in order to make them fit with the Party  the government s  current views  He is a perfect citizen until he meets Julia  an undercover rebel with an agenda  Does any of that sound familiar  Because it s startilingly similar to what our current society is turning into Did I convince you  I hope so  Please don t think that just because it is a classic it s dull   it really isn t  And I wouldn t lie  even if Big Brother was watching    George Orwell wrote about his dystopian vision   an autocratic world where privacy and independence do not exist   with great detail and deep thoughts  This is a world where there is no free will and no real relationship  where past is manipulated  sexual needs are repressed  and people are brainwashed    Scary look of a  possible  future  as it borrows a lot from Hitler s regime in Germany  Simply a masterpiece  Man sagt dieses Buch sei nicht  eine  Dystopie  sondern  DIE  Dystopie  Dementsprechend traurig ist es  dass man sich bei manchen Forderungen einiger politischer Vertreter zunehmend die Frage stellen muss  ob das Buch wirklich so utopisch ist  Wenn wir namlich nicht aufpassen und uns nicht ab und an vor Augen halten  wie unser Alltag im schlimmsten Falle aussehen konnte  kann es schnell dazu kommen  dass wir leichtsinnig grosse Teile unserer Freiheit abgeben Meiner Meinung nach eines der wenigen Bucher  die man gelesen haben muss  Spannend von der ersten Seite an  Ein Buch  welches man zwar weglegen  aber nicht aus dem Gedachtnis loschen kann  Auch heute noch habe ich Gansehaut  wenn ich daran denke  y mshl fy lmDy  dwn hy sry yl l n sry yl hy lSdyqHms w

Orwell s dystopian vision of a totalitarian socialist regime makes for a terrifying read  The fact that I hadn t read it until I was well into my adult life is largely due to its reputation as an enthusiasm killing tickbox on the national curriculum  While I can t lie   it was hard going   it is still undoubtedly a must for any bookshelf  and I would challenge even the most apolitical individual not to reassess their interest in politics after reading it  1984 is at times confusing  frightening  boring and paranoia inducing  However  even though it seems like an unlikely possibility  it is worryingly easy to imagine our current society progressing towards this sort of terrifying future if we become complacent about politics  This is particularly with the dawn of the Internet  which feels very in keeping with the book s message that the written history is the accepted one  even though it can be altered over and over again  Despite having to put it down and pick it up over the course of several months  it would not be exaggerating to say that this book changed my life  One often comes across the argument that it is in the interest of the power holders to keep their subjects ignorant and busy in their limited cocoons  For if they become literate  intelligent and develops an understanding of the world  the power holders will no longer be required and would be pushed out of existence This book has dealt precisely with this argument  It is spell bounding to read how limited the sphere of independent thought had been reduced to  The people were transformed into machines with no escape to anything humane  It was horrific to picturize the character of Smith who inspite of having a rebellious intellect was finally made to succumb to the pressure of the party  His notion that  sanity is not statistical  was shattered by the physical and mental torture he was subjected to  The author made it look so convenient to keep the public busy with smaller issues while keeping them indifferent towards the bigger picture  Thus was done by not providing them with a reference to compare with  Restricting their vision  capturing their ideological freedom  treating thoughts equal to deeds  entering their very psyche  An analogy provided was so apt   ants were only able to see the smaller objects and ignored the bigger ones  A perfect book which would force a person to think whether he she is actually able to sense the flow of the wind or is just carried away unknowingly by its force  This book is a classic  and a must read  Some of it may appear dated now  almost 100 years from its inception  but other parts of it are still prophetic today  It is odd that the Big Brother is Watching you aspect of this story bothers me less than the concept of this entire society being based on human misery  On turning pleasurable things like sex  being connected to family and friends  language  anything that is good and makes like worth living into horror and hell  That drives me crazy  What is the point of making life so miserable for so many people  What does this party even have to gain from turning people into complacent sheep that allow this to happen and do nothing to stop it  nothing to rebel against it It s deeply depressing  Big Brother is still watching us  but in a much more efficient manner  and we still don t get that Orwell wasn t talking about the future  he was talking about the present  My only complaint with this book is that it was too metaphorical  His introductory essay explained it all  but it wasn t allowed into print  People think it is only about Stalin type dictatorships  Orwell didn t intend that understanding but that is what he got  I am sure if people knew what he really meant  they wouldn t like it as much  I would like it even more if people could somehow get the correct message from it  Still one of the best classic novels  and can be used as a stepping stone to trying to truly understand dictatorial processes I heard somewhere that some schools are trying to take it off the curriculum  Should never happen  this book is fundamental to western culture  Superior to Animal Farm  partly because it is prophetic about Western types of mass surveillance and historical deletion  It is however seriously depressing  In case you doubt about mass surveillance and historical deletion occuring today and how it applies to Western culture  read  Killing Hope  by William Blum  a history of the CIA since World War II    In a world administered by totalitarianism government  a man with the courage to break into his own suffers for freedom to live and love  Winston Smith  a feeble  observant man carries on with life being forced to abide by Big Brothers strict supremacy  In 1984  the world was divided into three  Oceania  Eastasia  and Eurasia with each continent war torn and weary against one another in the fight for total power over the whole world  Eastasia  AIRSTRIP 1 in England is the setting of the book where a single political figure that may or may not exist holds the entire country in fear to be anything other than brain washed zombies living in an ignorant bliss  In this world every face  sound  and move made is being monitored and recorded by the thought police The pressing thing is  any one wrong move can get you killed  Winston lives among the millions of compliant civilians in AIRSTRIP 1  He goes to work as a party member in the Ministry of Truth altering historical records to match the parties version of history  At work  or for that matter  anywhere that is directly related to the ministries there are monitors called telescreens that are used to convey messages to employees  They are also used for spying on ministry workers  waiting for them to display thought crime so they can be stolen or murdered during the night  Winston knows how he lives  he remembers from his childhood how things were before Big Brother was ever a forced life style  Before loving and laughing could get you killed and before the war had even started  His memory is worn from the repetitive life that he leads and he may be missing spaces of time but you can never truly forget the feeling of happiness Winston leads a repetitive life so when something out of the ordinary happens such as a fellow co worker named O Brien giving him a certain indescribable countenance  he notices  Day after day Winston and O Brien pass each other at work and exchange the same quick meaningless glances  If observed by the telesceen close enough  they would be guilty of committing organized conspiracy against the party  Are the glances really meaningless though  Years pass of the same behavior and Winston finally recognizes a furtive understanding being hinted towards him  It seems so ridiculous to try for years to convince another that your tendency to stare was something much deeper than what he could have imagined  Besides O Brien  there is also another character that has shaken Winston  Julia  an aggressive  enthusiastic Anti Sex league representative seems to always be around advocating the strict no sex policy He hated her with a passion  He hated her so tremendously that whenever she came around  the varicose ulcer on his left ankle would become inflamed and he would scratch it raw  The way she flaunted the fact that she was chastised and encouraged others to be lonely  detached people made him sick  He wasn t opposed to chastity  he was opposed to what the party had made the definition of marriage into  How they changed relationships into a business  They dont want you to love  they want you to make babies and train them to worship Big Brother  Winston felt that she was taunting him with her beauty  teasing the fact that she would never imagine to be with some one like him  He hated it all  everything about her  As time passed  he became intently interested in her and the unimaginable happened     Wow  where to begin  This novel was special in so many ways  and it is one of those books that you can never just read it once  Some things you miss and catch on your second  third  and fourth reads This novel speaks to many because of what we are seeing around us and what we have seen at certain points in history  Big brother is a scary thought  and an authoritarian government is a fear that people are always worried about  Some would say we ve already hit that point  Who knows Orwell captivates the reader by showing a character who finds himself trying to fight back against the regime  Little does he know his efforts are completely in vain  and the truly horrifying part of the book is the process in which he is essentially tortured and turned into exactly what the government wants him to be  In the end  he was a part of the machine all along  I think therefore I am   Thinking is central to the idea of man   the ability to discern and question is what sets us apart    this book is a dystopia  a peek into  Oceania  a totalitarian regime premised on total mental dictatorship of it s people   to the extent of reducing men to robots on an assembly line    where a man is deprived of the most important of his abilities   the power to think   The power to doubt  question and express  How the power to think is crushed and unremitting loyality by a dictator is brought about by skillful manipulation of history  Control of the past   to control the future  and re coding of language to muzzle dissent  The chilling portrait of the insidious STATE would send shivers down ones spine and and make one value a democratic state more than ever  It s sheer arrogance to go about life having not read this book     wqty shrw  bh khwndn khrdm SfHh hy wl khtb shdyd mnw yd khtb  myr ndkht wly yn khtb mwDw  wq y tr w mfSl tr w khyly qwy try

touched it otherwise  but I was surprised by how accessible I found it  or maybe that s just me not looking closely enough   Definitely one of the most powerful books I ve ever read  I still think the moment when Winston and Julia get discovered is one of the most haunting freaky plain awesome  for lack of a more expressive way to phrase it  moments in literature  though I m definitely not a qualified judge on that front  I don t know if Orwell meant it as a realistic prediction of where he thought the world would be towards the end of the twentieth century  or just a cautionary account of what could happen in the vague future if political conditions were allowed to escalate to such an extreme  but if it s the former  I think it s a testament to how wrapped up in the horrible present people can get when things seem bleak  so much so that all that they can imagine is more of the same and worse  kind of like a depressed person  It s encouraging to realize that the future almost always surprises us  sometimes pleasantly  Which is not to say that the world today is all rainbows and unicorns  but I think the we re at least in a better place than Orwell had predicted in 1948  nan 1984 by George Orwell  takes place in a dystopian future in which society is now ruled by a tyrannical government called  The Party  and their omnipotent figurehead  Big Brother   The world as we know it has been has been separated into three separate Superpowers  Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia  These three superpowers are in a perpetual state of war with each other  resulting in a society based on hatred and fear which is again divided into three separate social standings   The Inner Party    The Outer Party  and  The Proles    In current terms  these three can be looked upon as Upper  Middle and Lower class  with Proles being the latter   Winston Smith is employed as a productive member of the Outer Party  As is common  his parents and younger sister vanished at a young age  and it s assumed they were killed due to crimes against the party  The party controls all aspects of modern life  any attempts to act out against them is almost certainly punished by death  All communication and thought is monitored using two way telescreens which act simultaneously as both a monitoring and information system  Anything which isn t picked up by the telescreens is monitored by the mysterious  thought police  who are hidden as members of the public and charged with monitoring rebellious thought Winston becomes increasingly disillusioned with society and longs for freedom  he secretly begins writing his opinion of the Party in a diary away from view of the telescreens  Eventually he meets a girl called Julia with similar opinions and together they begin an illegal love affair  trying to keep it hidden from The Party and Big Brother This book is fantastic  It s dark  gripping  descriptive and tense  I wasn t sure what to expect when I picked it up  all I knew about it was of the notorious  Big Brother  which has now become a pop culture icon  representing a perceived loss of privacy  Considering 1984 was written way back in 1949  it has really stood the test of time and could quite easily have been written yesterday  The themes running throughout are a somewhat disturbing reflection of our current society in which technology has advanced to the point where  with the push of a button  it s not difficult to keep tabs on members of the public  Often these fictional futuristic societies in literature seem unrealistic or far fetched  but the Orwell classic does an amazing job of describing a time in the future  now the past  which seems almost grounded  believable  and now even 28 years later seems entirely possible  In a time when most computers and TV s have built in cameras  big corporations can hack phones and intercept messages  the government can pinpoint your current location from a satellite in space and the average member of the public  using the GPS built into their phones  willingly  checks themselves in  on Facebook two or three times a day    it s not a far stretch to say that we might one day lose our privacy altogether  It s a scary thought and it s really no wonder this book has achieved it s status as a cultural iconic classic I d highly recommend it to anyway  I loved 1984 by George Orwell  Is not an easy book to read I have to be honest and you need to be in the mood to read it otherwise  it will be in your bedside for a long time  I loved the story from the beginning but sometimes I wanted something easy for the brain because I was too tired and in those cases  this book is not a good option I completely lost myself in it  It is marvellously written and the story is fascinating  Orwell knows how to give descriptions without boring the shit out of you  Every detail is relevant and adds meaning to the story   As you can see I can t explain it very well but is an amazing book   It does not end well though  On the other hand  it makes so much sense  that you don t get upset about it  you were half expecting it  It really is a classic  a magnificent one  This is  a must read before you die  no doubt   bl shk lktb ldhy  thr  l  m Zm Tfwlty  qrth  shrt lmrt  Le livre qui a le plus inspire mon enfance  Prophetique   lmr l yqym Hkm stbdd  lHmy  lthwr  wnm ysh l lthwr  lqm  Hkm stbdd   If you think you know this book  because of all the cultural references to it  do yourself the favor and read it first hand  It s not what you think it is The book is broken down into three sections  and I felt myself drawn to these three sections differently  The first section is setting up the characters and the world  I didn t want to stop reading this  for Mr  Orwell has painted a fascinating  if not disturbing world to  play  in The second section is the most happiest of the three  But  just as the characters themselves knew  it couldn t last  I found myself not wanting to continue reading because I didn t want the book to become the third section   Ah  the third section   the most horrifying and grotesque of the three  Here s where Orwell shines in his accounts on how an individual can be broken down  and re educated  I found myself rushing through this section to see how it turns out in the end  The entire time I thought  there has to be an out  When is the salvation   it never comes   and the world moves on as it always has  An amazing piece of fiction  Chilling and dark  this really should be on everyone s reading list   I can sincerely say that this is one of the best books I have ever read  Being a daughter that escaped the communist regime in Romania  as I was born a few years after it fell I can say  from our country s historical point of view that every word that is written in this book could have been a reality in other circumstances  The book is amazing  It portraits a society of slaves  slaves of hatred  of ignorance and lies  Here  the state is devided in 4 ministries   The ministry of love   in the business of murdering party traitors    The ministry of truth   covering lies    The ministry of peace   coverig war  of course  as you may have already deduced  and last but not least  The ministry of abundance  which did not make any money for the prosperity of the state  all of them under the loved feared face of one man  The big brother  The last 150 pages of the book keep you on the edge  I could not leave the book from my hands not even to go to the bathroom  P  The action takes place in the horrifying basements of  The ministry of love   where  our hero ends up I will not spoil it anymore though  The hero s name is Winston Smith  An ordinary man who works in the exterior department of  The ministry of truth  and for the first few pages of the books appears  I emphasised on appears  to have been the only human in that entire society that realises what kind of world they are living in Hope you enjoy it as much as I did   This will certainly be a depressing reading since it tells you what you already know  but it has the guts to actually put it on paper  I can t speak about the plot  because the novel speaks for itself  I read it only knowing that it was about Big Brother and 2 2 5  expecting something similar to Animal Farm  Once I finished it  it became one of my favorite novels ever  Orwell s prose is brilliant and polished  The result will be a cynical view about society  but hopeful if the reader is able to see the glass half full rather than half empty  I love this book so much it seems like a found text  or one handed to me in stealth  like Goldstein s book was to Winston  In my fourth     reading now  I see small flaws I never noticed in my adolescence  why the hell did he take Julia with him to see O Brien for the first time  why did he spill his guts so quickly to O Brien  in that same first meeting  some of the love y dialogue needs a rewrite  does the Goldstein book section need to be so long  and so redundant   interestingly  the superb Michael Radford film adaptation improves many of Orwell s dubious decisions   but if Orwell made 10 000 decisions  he nails 9 990 of them  And I noticed some fascinating sub plots that I didn t fully appreciate on previous readings  namely  the degree to which Winston  while rebelling against the system  was a violent by product himself  His fantasies of killing Julia  early in the novel  of celebrating the killing and maiming of the enemies of Oceania  including mothers and their small children  in propaganda films   show the degree to which he  among the most sensitive subjects of the state  has also been desensitized and ruined  He is ruined several times over in this book  The wallop of this book  the grit  the imagination  the dream and warning of the collective dehumanization make it unforgettable  arresting  and oddly beautiful  Depois de passar quase um mes apos a leitura deste livro  senti que devia alterar a classificacao para 5 estrelas  Este foi um livro que realmente me marcou  Dei 4 estrelas no inicio devido a estar um pouco cansado de partes enormes como os manifestos de algo  que nao vou mencionar para nao  spoilar  ninguem  que estavam escritos numa letra minuscula e dificil de ler Mas agora  ao olhar para tras  vejo que este livro e  realmente  digno de 5 estrelas e um dos meus all time favorites  Sempre que passo numa livraria penso que o deveria comprar  porque e um livro que vale a pena ter  eu requisitei numa biblioteca quando o li   O mais interessante deste livro e que acontece me bastantes vezes estar numa situacao quotidiana e recordar cenas do livro que me marcaram  Aguardo ansiosamente o lancamento do novo filme baseado na obra e espero vir um dia a reler o livro   This is brilliant  Go read it  I m going to go as far as to say it s a work of genius  Terrifying  but brilliant I ve read this book twice and it truly is mind blowing and is probably better the second time  Orwell is a fantastic writer  his prose is clean and his atmosphere is incredible  Small qualm  When Winston reads from  The Book     It can give the impression that Orwell wanted to write 1984 just so that he could insert this little  more like unnecessarily long  rant  I see why he wanted to do it  but it probably does get in the way because it s so long and so boring and so unrelenting  Orwell most likely got a little carried away  But it s ok  Just bear with it  take a break when read this part of the book  I don t advise you attempt it in one sitting  You could fall asleep  But everything else is flawless  Orwell teaches you that books  and even novels can be powerful weapons  they can be though provoking  haunting and terrifying The world is so well conceived and utterly disturbing  His stance on anti authoritarianism is perfectly transposed into fiction and is honestly one of the best books I have ever read  objectively and subjectively  WEEKLY PROGRESS  I read 49 pages  up to part two  and i ve extended my reading places to passenger seats in cars  and on grass under trees on sunny days  litteraly   GOAL SETTING  Well  i ve solved my issue of it being super boring to read by downloading the audiobook  My new goal is to make sure my group stays on top of their reading    though I have no idea how  I m only worried about one member  and I have shared my audiobook with this member as hope of allowing this member an easier time of staying on top of the reading  That sentence sucked  MEDACOGNATIVE JOURNAL  The reading has definitely become easier over this last week  and because i had a race for crew  this was the only thing i brought with me to do  and it started to get done whenever i had free time  this fact was quite surprising to me seeming as how i NEVER get work done at races  this was the first time i actually did  I m good at cliches  Anyway  1984 is really taking too long to get exciting  i m almost certain that it wont get exciting  Its kind of funny  because i read through the part where Winston tries to pull out past information from an old man in a pub  in determination of finding out whether life was better before or after the revolution of Big Brother  and Winston became very impatient with the old man s incapability of answering his question after shaving down all of the unnecessary details of his question and eventually asking as bluntly as he could  while the old man understood it as whether or not he likes life as an old or young person  Its funny because this is how i feel about the book at this point  There are all these airy details overflowing every page  tons and tons of unnecessary information when you are only able to find one or two things within the mess of water that actually get you somewhere within the book  A lot of the things talked about are like  Winston walking     OOOOO    A DIFFERENT WAY HOME  and he reminds the reader at every chance that doing anything out of the ordinary will disturb the thought police and you will certainly be given a definite date by which you will die  but before so you will be tortured into confessing the things you ve done  Every time Winston does something he reminds you of these things and this was only in the last part of Part One that I read    The same thing happens with everything  and i just want him to get on with the story  not a pageturner as such  but a scary portrait of power nonetheless  the world has changed wildly since I first read it in the 80s  the structures of power classes are unchanged  although the ultrarich has taken over from the party people  A fierce  breathtaking  relentless eye opener to some of the harshest of truths about human nature  politics  the past  the future  and  largely  the fragility of the man made system that we live in  This book was published in 1949 and is striking in how futuristic it is and how accurately it depicts lots of ideas and situations that exist today It is fair to say that very few people on Earth could righteously judge this book  and I am not one of them  This book surpasses the standard of most literary works that I am familiar with  Everything from the ideas to the technicalities of writing was overwhelming  As a novel I would have rated it as a 1 star  because part one was a bit boring and the plot itself is not that intricate nor interesting yet I rate it as five after I ve recognised it as a description of a miserable dystopia perfectly mingled with a series of professionally written long essays that lay bare the ugly truth behind the DIVINE communism socialism ideologies I can t still believe that George Orwell anticipated that dark future  which is unfortunately the reality in some contries now in 1948   jwrj  wryl wltwq  lm syHSl b d  rb yn sn  mn trykh

ldht  wy shy khlf dhlk sndmrh tdmyran     Born and raised in socialist China pre 2000s   I identified with the society depicted by the book more than I wanted to  All the propaganda mechanisms described in the book looked way too familiar that I couldn t help but wonder if party members of Mao s era actually studied the book themselves and implemented what the book had to offer  Although communism frenzy from 1949 1976 has ebbed  certain mindsets still exist today in my father s and my grandfather s generations  I d be elated if people from the Department of Education would add this book to Chinese high school kids  mandatory reading list  We don t want this part of the history to repeat itself  Normally books movies about future strike me as mere special imagination with intriguing factors  with overly developed machinery  extremely harmful or helpful technology  brand new form of living  human body are like chemical experimental lab  enhanced or transformed in every possible way  Kind of exaggerating  eye catching  ridiculous  unilateral  but fun  1984 warns readers of a tendency  describes a scary future of deformed society political system with extreme ways of mind control in order to fortify its regime  It s about totalitarianism and brainwash  about torture and being mind blind  The government amends the history and the language  Forcible infusion of political concept and intake of fake information  Citizens  or proles  are living out of privacy and capacity to reason  leading a life of which everything is lie and falsification  but at the same time feeling proud and at peace about their life  Social hierarchy stays inconceivably strong and stable  The suppressed remains suppressed  the superior remains superior  Peace it is  Each basic need is satisfied  Quite weirdly ideal in a way  but also undoubtedly pointless and infuriating to lead such life when it s put like that  however  the scariest part about 1984 is not even that   It s the fact that there is no obvious way that such controlling wouldn t work  especially under a circumstance same as the one described in the book  Feels like when given a chance condition  when there is no resource scarcity  no interdependence among countries  no law  no more pursue of advanced technology  even no human instinct demand  they are working on it   when all that is left for humanity to worry is gone  when stability is the only thing the government or the society is after  when power and regime comes first  when people s heretic mind is the only factor that would endanger such situation   1984  would be a very possible option PS  The book contains lots of classical and insightful sentences  perspectives and conclusions  So true that even after decades of different happenings  the world still accords with most part of them     ndm tsh r b n lrw y  mmk lm t d wDHh wb n lshkl tkwn Dbby   dym  lmlmH fn hdhh rsl  td wk lzyr  Tbyb l ywn wldhy sywSyk b d lm yn  blbd

everything else follows Winston Smith lives in post World War II era  where there are three super powers in the world  Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia  and most of the land of the world belongs to them  Winston belongs to The Party  which rules Oceania but only as a member of the outer body and works in the Ministry of Truth  writing  rewriting and re rewriting history as demanded by The Party  To be the member of The Party implies three things for him  1  Big Brother is always watching you  2  You have no power  thought  purpose or will as an individual  3  But if you consider yourself to be really a part of The Party so much so that you think you ARE The Party  you own everything in Oceania and you are as good as indestructible  Unfortunately for Winston  he does not consider himself to be really a part of The Party  Instead  he considers himself to be an enemy of The Party  Consequently  he regularly takes part in all sorts of  thought crimes  including remembering the past as it was and not as The Party says it was  falling in love with a woman  Julia  and pursuing the possibility of courting her  planning to join a rebel underground group bent on destroying The Party and believing that indeed The Party can be destroyed  However  there is only one outcome of such crimes in Oceania  a trip to the Ministry of Love  1984 is by far the worst book I have ever read  Don t get me wrong  this is still a 5 star review  What makes 1984 the worst book in the history of all my book reading is not that the book is terribly written  Instead  it is the exact opposite  George Orwell writes dystopia as it is meant to be written  haunting  disturbing and downright nightmarish  Reading Part III was especially difficult for me  I could not read more than a few pages at a time  because I was just so disturbed  The torture inflicted in the Ministry of Love does not make you cry out tears for Winston and it does not make you sad or distraught  Actually  you end up feeling nothing for Winston  but horrified at the possibility of such things happening to you  It the mother of all nightmares coming to life  where you are safe nowhere  not even inside your own head  because The Party  for its own safekeeping  will get inside it if need be  The Party will make you love who it wills and hate who it wills  it will make 2   2   5  even if you know in your head that there is no way that it can be anything other than 4  It will change the past because it owns the past  The Party doesn t only have the power to change the past in the records  but it even has the power to change it in your memories  because it controls everything  the records and your memory  Oceania is not just the epitome of totalitarianism  but it is a step ahead of it  By mastering doublethink  a process by which you can hold two contradictory things true in your mind  it has not only taken control of the land  the people and the resources but also has taken control of the course of history and the memories and emotions of the inhabitants of Oceania  The Party from time to time changes its allies from Eurasia to Eastasia and then back to Eurasia leaving the third its enemy in war  However  in the records of Oceania and in the minds of the people of Oceania The Party has only ever been at war with one of them  Whenever The Party changes its alliance from one to the other  it simply changes all the records to match the new enemy  Winston remembers that Oceania had been at war with Eurasia only about four years ago and had been in alliance with Eastasia  however  all  sane  party members know  remember and believe that   No  Oceania is at war with Eastasia  It has always been at war with Eastasia   If only yesterday  The Party again betrays Eurasia and declares war on Eurasia  all  sane  party members will remember that   Oceania is at war with Eurasia  It has always been at war with Eurasia   Only Winston s  insanity  believes in a reality that is physically separated from the mind of The Party and that needs to  cured  One of the most intriguing parts of the novel is the three slogans that arise from The Party s ideology   Ingsoc   1  WAR IS PEACE  The relevance of this slogan may be felt from the beginning of time to perhaps the end of time for the human race  War has been the only constant throughout history  Conflict has remained ingrained in societies no matter how much they try to curb it  As Plato once said quite wisely   Only the dead have seen the end of war   Mr  Orwell takes advantage of his dystopian world and looks deeper into the meaning of constant war  He insinuates that war is necessary to maintain peace  War is essential to ensure that all surplus production of a powerful country is not used to eradicate class structure in the world  War is essential to dump that surplus in the form of destruction and devastation  War is essential for constant power  whether it is for a class of people  a mindset  an organization or even an ideology  WAR IS PEACE  As Orwell says   A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war   Orwell understands that peace within a community can only remain when its people remain completely loyal to the ruling authority  To ensure that  there needs to be an enormous threat on the outside from whom the ruling authority is constantly protecting them through a never ending war  Only in such a state of affairs will the people be focused too well on the external threat that they will not dream to rise up to become an internal one  2  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  Nothing could explain this slogan better than O Brien who says that the truth is that  Slavery is freedom  Alone   free   the human being is always defeated   The individual can never be more than a body travelling towards its death  The individual is  doomed to die   and O Brien dubs that as  the greatest of all failures   Orwell is bringing out the truth in human need for submission  whether it is to a promise beyond the grave  their work before the grave  an ideology  a hobby or even another human being  Alone  a human being is nothing more than a forgettable entity that as good as ceases to exist the moment it drops dead  However   if he can make complete  utter submission  if he can escape from his identity   he can become something more  Nevertheless  as everything has a price  this is priced at the individual s freedom  O Brien reiterates the meaning of being a party member by saying that  if he  an individual  can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party  then he is all powerful and immortal   The Party believes its ideology to be eternal and everlasting  Any member of that ideology will consequently be eternal  However  they shall also be eternally enslaved  3  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  The simplest of the three  is perhaps also the most deep rooted of all the slogans of The Party   The Book   apparently written by Goldstein  begins with the ever known fact that  Throughout recorded time  and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age  there have been three kinds of people in the world  the High  the Middle and the Low   Goldstein gives insight into the true nature of the three classes  He shows us that the High always want to remain where they are  the Middle want to overthrow the High and take their places and the Low  whenever they are not so caught up in trying to survive  being at the very bottom of the Maslow s Hierarchy of Needs  wish for equality  However  the Low are also the only ones who are  never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims   They always end up being used by the Middle attracted to their so called slogans of  freedom  justice and fraternity   only to be  thrust  back down  into their old position of servitude  after the Middle have achieved their aims  This internal struggle ultimately leads to instability of power within a land and a never ending cycle of power switching results  In order to counter this The Party realizes that it needs to freeze the classes  The Party does this by learning from the position of the Low  The Low never have enough resources  time  will or energy to think anything through  They are always caught up in the acts of survival  The Party induces a state of ignorance in all the three classes in Oceania by thrusting them to the basest level of Maslow s Hierarchy of Needs  There is never enough of anything in the market  what is available is terrible to eat and almost always artificial  shelter has been transformed into a place of constant surveillance  sex has been made undesirable and forbidden  family lives have been poisoned with the children betraying their parents and parents afraid of their own little ones and security is a concept unknown to all  In such state of affairs  who would dream of thinking of equality  liberty  justice or anything apart from survival  Only a few  The Party ensures that those few are also taken care of  In order for anyone to rise against their current condition of existence  they usually need something to compare it to  If the comparison is the Past  The Party controls it to no end  with its ideology of doublethink and constant  fixing  of  misquoted  facts  The Past does not exist in Oceania but as a confirmation of the Present  Therefore  there is no comparison in the past  If it is a matter of comparison with another community then The Party ensures that the people of Oceania never lay eyes on any part or any person of either Eurasia or Eastasia  Lastly  if the comparison is in their heads  in their whims and their wishes  then The Party  cures  them in the Ministry of Love before annihilating their very existence  Ignorance is strength  because it ensures that no one knows any better than what is  because what is was always what was and what was is nothing more than what is  Everything in Oceania is diseased but Winston still realized in the midst of all the disease a profound truth   There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad   But with The Party you were not even safe inside of your own head  To get you to accept their untruth they would go to the lengths of ensuring you were mad  The Party would make you believe that their lies were truth  It would make you unknow what you know and know what you wish to unknow  The Party s disease plagues everything  not only the goodness of truth but also the sanctity of love  Winston tells Julia that betrayal would not be to confess  because everyone ends up confessing in the end to what they have done and more  He says that real betrayal would be that if The Party could somehow make him stop loving her  However  Julia naively states that they could not do that   They can make you say anything   anything   but they can t make you believe it  They can t get inside you   If only someone told her that not only could they do that  but they would do that  And so they both betray one another in the Ministry of Love and as that thought bleeds into Winston s mind at the end of his story  a voice sings in his head  Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold me   One might wonder the purpose of such extreme measures and they are simply this   One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power   It is true that 1984 is one of the worst things that I have ever read but  in the true spirit of doublethink  that does not prevent it from being one of the best as well  If it were possible I would have given it 6 out of 5 stars      I read this book the first time back in the year 1984  and saw the movie the same year  We laughed  we didn t  just couldn t  believe that any of this could happen in reality Thirty years later  this book is more relevant than it has ever before  There are more security cameras in a place like London than Orwell could ve imagined  The Snowden files have demonstrated just how far beyond 1984 we ve actually come This is really why I keep coming back to this book  over and over again  It s the darkest thing we have in literature  yet not even Orwell could foresee that we d be even worse off Have you ever read this book  If you haven t  read it  It s one of those books every human being who can read must read  I absolutely love 1984  the life of Winston Smith in a dictatorial regime is exceptionally scary and to me shows the dangers of the state and control over people s thoughts  actions  speech and even the history they read  Orwell wrote a book that had far more effect than he could ever imagine and has changed the history of the world as the story explains the dangers of living in a world where you are continually watched and your life is controlled  I love the ideas in the story Big Brother  Room 101  junior spies practicing on their parents to see if you betray Big Brother  Hate Week  the Ministry of Truth  Ministry of Love and the Ministry of Plenty  Overall the chilling thing about the book is that so much in terms of surveillance and control has come true  Political correctness we can even see as Newspeak  using language to control our thoughts  As well as the government reading emails  CCTV cameras and even the power of the media over our thoughts George Orwell  changed the world for the better when he wrote 1984  as he made us aware of control  rwy

posicion en donde me encuentro en mi pais vi tantas similitudes que la sensacion de desolacion y miedo me lleno en toda la primera parte del libro Lo mas triste es lo posible de este mundo  o la existencia de este regimen  Desde el principio de los tiempos el poder ha corrompido  y el poder absoluto corrompe absolutamente La forma de crear un regimen tan perfecto y escalofriante esta a un paso de distancia  ya que solo hace falta la oportunidad  la union y que la gente buena no haga absolutamente nada Es un libro que desde el principio sabes que no hay esperanza  pero igual quieres sentirla en algun momento  solo que en verdad nunca llega  Wilson es alguien comun  alguien que incluso veo a mi alrededor y en mi misma  una persona normal  sin ningun tipo de poder y que puede adecuarse a lo que sea que obtiene  como son los humanos  Quien siente que es rebelde solo por sus pensamientos  pero del pensar al hacer hay tanto que nunca llega a la realidad  Aunque el hizo su propia rebelion  con Julia y con OBrien  el resultado  como el mismo sabia  era el mismo Julia  es como es la sociedad misma  con poder o sin poder  en general somos ignorantes  en general solamente nos importa nuestro propio placer o lo que unicamente nos afecta  pero de resto no forzamos un sistema  porque sirve en la medida en que nos permite hacer lo que deseamos hacer  asi no le permita hacer a los demas absolutamente nada La vision que el libro presenta sobre el poder  sobre el sistema  sobre el analisis del pasado y de los distintos posiciones politicas tiene mucha profundidad y es como el propio Winston dice  los mejores libros son los que escribe las cosas que ya uno sabia  Ciertamente este libro no tendria nada que nosotros no supieramos  sobre el sistema totalitario  sobre la intension de los demas intentos de gobiernos totalitarios sobre el uso de los medios de propaganda para beneficio de una faccion  y sobre la idea de que al controlar el presente controlamos el pasado  tambien tendria que ver al controlar el pasado controlan el presente  ya que si bien ellos lo eliminaron por completo para el ser comun  ellos tienen recopilado todo el verdadero pasado  porque como muy bien se sabe  el hombre que no conoce su pasado esta destinado a repetirlo Lo asombroso de todo es la forma en como la verdadera premisa de Orwell es introducirnos un mundo donde el sistema reinante no solo conoce el pasado  sino que posee las armas para que nadie mas lo conozca  y que a su vez APRENDIO SU PASADO Y PERFECCIONO PARA NO COMETER LOS MISMOS ERRORES Casi me hace agradecer a esta sociedad ignorante  incluyendome  que vemos como una y otra vez la historia se repite en cada pais  con las modificaciones particulares del caso  y no se dan cuenta en realidad de que cometemos una y otra vez los mismos errores Otro punto maravilloso y agridulce del libro es la falta completa de justificativos  EL poder es lo mas importante  Todos sabemos que eso es verdad  todos absolutamente  en el fondo de nuestro corazon  comprendemos que cuando una persona dirige un estado  un movimiento  una revolucion  una contrarevolucion  el fin de eso es tener el poder  Puede ser escondido con falacias  con fantasias  con suenos de libertad  mejoria social  igualdad  Incluso la misma persona puede creer conscientemente que esos son los unicos motivos que los mueve  Pero en el fondo es el poder lo que los llama Es refrescante y aterrorizador ver como en Oceania  y sus colindantes se quitaron la careta y aceptaron que efectivamente ese era su objetivo  aclarando que es por ello que principalmente se diferencian de los demas  Ciertamente  la mayoria de los procesos totalitarios que se basan o se justifican con esos fines altruista terminan siendo derrocados porque los mismos sujetos quieren eso  sea uno que otro renagado del mismo partido o la sociedad Es un mundo gris  es un mundo desesperanzador  pero sobre todo  es un sistema que como el mismo Winston  Julia y OBrien bien dijeron  absoluto e infalible  lo cual es lo mas desgarrador  Nada es absoluto  nada es eterno  pero como bien dijo Smith  la prole tiene las llaves para acabarlo  pero dentro de mucho  mucho tiempo Muy buen libro  AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ   Mirrors current political crisis and implies the final destination of consequence   At times utterly disturbing to me   it is the reality of the present picture   torture and all   Dare to look at the truth    When I opened my eyes  I was tied to a pole  My clothes were in tatters and I could feel a wind as sharp as razor blades grating against my skin  What made me open my eyes was the heat and a glare in front of my closed eyelids  The sands stretched everywhere I could see and the heat wrapped me in its coils like a python  I tested the strength of my bonds but they gave no sign of being even a bit loose  I was so absorbed in that act that I never heard the man approach Even in the heat  he seemed the least bit unruffled and carried an iron rod in his hands which he kept rolling on his palms  The answer to my plea for help was a knee crushing blow and then it was a long drawn out ballet of pain    This describes to a small extent what Orwell s book made me feel  I have not in recent times been so disturbed or unsettled by a book  The climate in my hometown right now is of suffocating heat  The kind of heat that sits on your chest and beats the living daylights out of you and this combined with the stark portrayal of a totalitarian society in this book was enough to make me a great deal uncomfortable 1984 is a grime coated lens through which we look into an alternate world that horrifyingly reflects our own  A world that is divided into three super powers who perennially play war games with the world as their chess board  The most ugly of the fictional horrors are not the monsters or the psychotic killers but such an oppressive society  A society that destroys and alters beyond imagination history art literature sex  theology and even human memory  It is a void that swallows a mass of humanity and spits out a race of zombies  In a way  the theory that Ursula Le Guin proposed in  The left hand of darkness  is turned about on its head in this book  A society of people whose every sexual urge is repressed and brutally eliminated will spend all that energy hating and growing to be increasingly violent and war like Do not let any one lull you into the complacence of believing that this is a political novel or a commentatory  This is a horror novel and is extremely effective at it too  It hammers into your head  the fact that a soul that is broken could perhaps be termed the most ugly facet of mankind  What is more repugnant is the fact that another fellow human being can break the soul with much more finality than the celestial beings who are believed to live upstairs in the heavens  This book will remain relevant for generations to come and in my belief it will only go out of existence if we cease to be a war mongering tribe or if we exorcise the unblinking unwavering attachment to politics  The character of O Brien is someone whom I have seen and heard in the guise of many other names through news papers and TV Channels  He is an embodiment of what fanatical political belief can do to a human being  The article titled  The theory and practice of Oligarchichal Collectivism  is a master stroke and I do not think anyone but Orwell could have written such a beautiful piece of political dissection in his own style  I must read this book again but not any time soon lest it reduce me to a gibbering mess    Mas que una novela  es una advertencia  de la deformacion de los ideales revolucionarios de igualdad  Como dice Orwell  al final siempre existen tres clases sociales  los bajos  los medios y los altos  Y cuando se da una revolucion  los medios utilizan a los bajos para posicionarse como los altos  y al final  nada cambia  para la prole nada cambia  Esto ocurrio en Oceania  el pais ficticio donde vive Winston Smith  solo que esta vez encontraron la forma de perennizarse en el poder  mediante el control del pasado  los hechos y la mente humana  Incluso de los sentimientos  Winston Smith es un hombre cualquiera  en el sentido de que no es relevante para la sociedad  un simple operador en el Ministerio de la Verdad  Sin embargo  Winston tiene ideas en contra del Partido  Ideas que  como el sabe  significan su muerte tarde o temprano  porque el Partido no se permite una mente descarrilada  no puede haber una mancha en la mente colectiva  Y precisamente por eso  aunque se condene a muerte a los crimentales  antes se les regresa al redil  Porque la victoria no esta en vencer  sino en convencer  El morir hereje significa una victoria en contra del Partido  Y eso no es posible  porque el Partido es inmortal Una gran reflexion de Orwell  quien se revela como un analista socio politico de gran calibre  un critico de la condicion humana  y un pesimista lamentablemente   unsettling deeply disturbing and extremely melancholic Full of agony and despair Yet it is an masterpiece The climax is an antithesis to  and they lived happily ever after  Big brother ensures that even the devout are compelled to sacrilege to save themselves and this is what rips your soul I was in a daze after reading the book  I never felt you could ever feel that way after reading a book Its more than a year but I still remember the intensity of the emotions it elicited It is a must read for anyone for the sheer reason that it just extends the realm of emotions you would have ever experienced while reading a book If ever I wanted to know to the depths to which humanity can stoop I will start reading it again  would anyone care for a cup of

the circumstances in iran  and maybe an exact one  in about 20 years  This book is timeliness because it describes the methods still used today by totalitarian regimes to control the mind of individuals in the pursuit of controlling the masses  and how the mind works that allows this total breakdown of the self  Having read Nothing to Envy  Ordinary Lives in North Korea  the similitudes are astounding     1984 by George Orwell is a fine satirical work where Orwell speaks about how in future everything would be governed by hate and tyranny  He speaks about future where people will be callous and the only feeling permitted   sustain would be love for the Big Brother or the tyrant   Children would be devoid of love from their parents from the time of their birth  Although  the year 1984 didn t turn out to be what Orwell described but slowly some of the events he had described seems to coming true into our society  The thing I could relate the best was  Newspeak   which Orwell describes as the only language whose dictionary gets smaller each year  This kind of influence can very well be seen in the present day world  where people instead of saying  Happy Birthday  are writing HBD or other kind of abbreviations  Introduction of such abbreviations in our society is narrowing our thought process and our vision  We don t have telescreens today but surely our world is governed by cameras  Everywhere we have CCTV Cameras and personal privacy has reduced to minimum  Although  today we are using cameras for security purposes   In the near future  our computers will keep a watchful eye on us 24x7 and as for the microphones we will have our mobile phones Now  to protect our world from becoming a world as described by George Orwell some prophylactic measure need to be taken and the most important of all is to eliminate all sorts of rancor and discords from our society It is time that we promulgate peace for as long as abhorrence prevails our world shall only deteriorate Best RegardsNandini Goel 1984   big brother has become a catch all term for cctv surveillance  but its really about so much more than that  The lies they tell Winston Smith and the lies that he tells his readers are the still same lies told to us everyday  Long live Anon  A novel with which I had much suffering  Hope is the first to perish at the final page of it   The novel 1984 by George Orwell is the story of Winston Smith  a member of the revision section of the Ministry of Truth  It is Winston s job to rewrite the truth  in order to keep up the government s good reputation  Although his whole life is devoted to the government  Winston has a deep hatred for Big Brother  the icon that watches over civilization and invades the people s privacy  When Winston and his co worker Julia are recruited by and join the Brotherhood  a secret anti big brother agency  they find themselves in a lot of trouble  O Brien from the thought police is on their trail  Although quite different from a traditional science fiction book  it fits into this category because of Orwell s portrayal of a futuristic society where government controls everything and individuals have no independence  The story takes place in Oceania  one of three superstates  In Oceania  people live in high rise apartments in the central district or in surrounding suburbs where the government s monitoring efforts are lower  The themes of this book are serious and Orwell s writing style is complex  making it a very difficult read  Despite this  it is fascinating to think about what life would be like without freedom or privacy  It is well written and detailed  For these reasons  I loved the book  I m warning you  do not be surprised when your brain explodes  If you are under 14  I would recommend waiting to read this book so that you can completely understand and fully appreciate the meaning of the book  If you re over 14  however  and looking for something totally different and original  this is the book for you  I rate it 5 stars  Absolutely brilliant  rwy   bqry   i only recently read george orwell s classic and it scared me  you can see how something like that could easily happen  hell  half of it is probably happening right now  read some classics   it s never too late  A must read      Not a big fan of fiction  but this book is awesome   This is not the type of books that I would have read 5 years ago  Having said that  I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of it s seemingly simple yet bone chilling story line  This is a story which shows how in a dystopian future  everything which is taken so much for granted is challenged and people who dare to follow it are out rightly persecuted The story flows perfectly to give you hope for a bright beautiful future and snatch it away just as cruelly   This has been on my to read list for as long as I can remember  as with most classics really   what a pleasure it was  I can t say I was immediately sucked in  but once I did step into the story properly I was blown away  The world Orwell describes is terrifying and yet so believable when you really look around us today  You only have to look at David Cameron s current attempts to monitor all online activity to realise this  And I think for me its the mixture of science fiction and potential realism that really made this an absolutely brilliant book especially given the time it was written  I just love Orwell   Top 5 favorite book   One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship    lHrb hy lslmlHry  hy l bwdy ljhl hw lqw Zlt hdhh lklmt ttrdd fy dhhny Twl qrty lhdh l ml lfkry lDkhm  yktb  wrwyl hdhh lrwy lySf bshkl dqyq lm mkhyf mr b lm bl mDin wl

to this reality every single day  How Orwell had this foresight boggles me  But certain ideas in this book will give me nightmares for years to come   Its probably unnecessary to explain the plot for this one but here it goes  Winston Smith is a man living in a future totalitarian society in a country called Oceania  Oceania is constantly at war with its two enemies East Asia and Eurasia which are also at war with each other  These 3 countries include the entirety of earth and they are all equal in strength so that the war will never end  None will ever make a winning blow  The people in Oceania are constantly being monitored by hidden microphones and telescreens  Its forbidden to defy the party INGSOC  or even think about defying the party  hence the term  thought crime   Winston works at the Ministry of truth which controls the media and also makes constant changes to history  The book goes to great detail in explaining this strange world  How the people think and act  talk and what about  They have a new developing language called Newspeak which is supposed to be as efficient as possible and also lacks all the words that could harm the party  Its fascinating  The book is also a famous critique of totalitarianism and socialism but I think its more anti USSR then anti Socialism  Oceania is a gross bastardization of Communism and as such the book is more of a criticism of such bastardizations  like what the USSR became rather than Communism itself  At least thats how I see it  If it is indeed just a critique of Communism its just a huge ad hom  Totally excellent book in many respects  The drama is great  the story is great and its an amazing Sci fi with a good message  5 5  1984 is probably the best written book I ve pulled from the shelf to date  That there s an absorbing and urgent narrative here as well is icing on the Orwellian cake  The lessons of Oceania transcend era and have lasting value for those working to organize and uplift society  It s as if Orwell has reached into the future and touched the mood of the present  One can connect with ease Orwell s cautionary dystopia to the depredations of American privacy that have surfaced in just the last few years  Much of 1984 s quirky  Newspeak   terms like thoughtcrime  doublethink and Big Brother  have been absorbed into the modern idiom  Among the rarefied collective of the greatest writers the English language has ever known  George Orwell painstakingly crafted a penetrating  prophetic tale  a world within a world  a spiraling ideascape whose tendrils integrate seamlessly with the realities of modern life Here s a small sampling of the winged brilliance flanking the reader at every turn  He was a fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity  a mass of imbecile enthusiasms   one of those completely unquestioning  devoted drudges on whom  more even than on the Thought Police  the stability of the Party depended    p  22  She had a bold  aquiline face  a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it    p  66  Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious    p  70  But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness  something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape  like an object seen out of the corner of one s eye    p  122  To hang on from day to day and from week to week  spinning out a present that had no future  seemed an unconquerable instinct  just as one s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available    p  152  What opinions the masses hold  or do not hold  is looked on as a matter of indifference  They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect    p  210 Recommended companion reading    Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  1932   Amusing Ourselves to Death  Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business by Neil Postman  1985 Note  This review is republished from my official website  I had previously marked this book as  read  but I don t think I ever really read 1984  I believe I was confusing it with a Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  both great dystopian books  but nevertheless different within themselves  Anyways  I am so glad I can say that I have officially read 1984  This was largely perpetuated by the book club that was formed at my workplace  The beginning of 1984 can seem a bit slow to get into but trust me  it definitely picks up  Chapter 9 was pretty rough in terms of the jargon and density of what Winston  the main protagonist  was reading  but if you take your time and really decipher everything the concepts that are repeatedly brought up will come together  This book was handsdown written before its time  George Orwell  ahem Eric Blair  was revolutionary in his thinking  The words he brought to life  not only through 1984  but his other books  are extraordinary  MIND OFFICIALLY BLOWN  If you ve been meaning to jump into a good old classic or are in the mood for some ORIGINAL dystopian storytelling then look no further  this is the book to turn to    The world is divided into three  Oceania  Eastasia and Eurasia who are engaged in a never ending battle  In this war driven existence  Oceania is ruled by Big Brother by ideals drawn through heavy influence of the Nazi and Russian totalitarian regimes and have succeeded in pulling out all stops that had stopped the a fore mentioned to gain complete control over the lives of the citizens  Thus  the Oceania citizens  or rather comrades as they are to call each other now  live a life under constant scrutiny of the party  Their life  their mind is theirs no more  The man lives alone  he has no relations  preferably no emotions other than national fervor and no interactions other than ones that are absolutely required  In this forlorn kingdom  1984 is the story of a revolution built not through group revolting  flag waving or slogan chanting but a mere thought in the mind of a hopeful soul   I ve recently been scouring my mother s classic collection  And as is the ritual before starting every book  I logged onto goodreads and checked the reviews  And  Voila   the journey begins   BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU reads out the page in bold capital letters and my mind slowly draws the connection of the book to the popular reality show and a quick google search proves me right  As I commence reading  the book has a mysterious  ancient and intriguing feel to it    probably due to the dusty condition of my copy   I gear myself up but fail to quite prepare for what awaits me   Freedom is the right to say two plus two makes four  If that is granted all else follows   I could feel the chills and shivers running through my body as I read every line  Winston appealed to me  He was me  And his world was the world I feared  A world where nothing is private  nothing is unique  He spoke to the part of me that had nightmares of living as a drone  Basically a part which resides in all of us somewhere   view spoiler   The whole concept  Winston s diary  his job which loosely involves rewriting history  the paralles drawn about the functioning of the human mind  his diary  Julia and Winston s relationship  the proles  the purpose of Newspeak  Thoughtcrime and the chilling relevance even decades after it was published   hide spoiler  So pick up the book NOW   If you re still not convinced  here s a little something to get you over the edge    For  after all  how do we know that two and two make four  Or that the force of gravity works  Or that the past is unchangeable  If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind  and if the mind itself is controllable   what then   But if thought corrupts language  language can also corrupt thought    Of pain you could wish only one thing  that it should stop  Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain  In the face of pain there are no heroes    Confession is not betrayal  What you say or do doesn t matter  only feelings matter  If they could make me stop loving you that would be the real betrayal      George Orwell  1984  Quite possibly my favorite novel ever  A brilliant work of science fiction with a political philosophical message  In high school  I was too young to really appreciate this novel  Having read it again as an adult  I have to say that this is truly one of the best novels ever written  1984 is a fascinating distopian novel about a world where every aspect of life is completely controlled by the government  or  Big Brother    The date 1984 would have implied a futuristic novel when the book was written   The main character  Winston Smith  attempts to rebel against the constraints of Big Brother  starting out with the very small step of daring to own a personal diary  Interesting themes of the book involve language and history  what happens when people s ability to express themselves is taken away   In the novel  the characters speak  Newspeak   and the words for specific emotions and concepts like  liberty  are removed from the language   And what happens when media is so manipulated by the government that there is no way to know what is true and what isn t  and no way for the individual to feel him or herself part of a larger world community  1984 is a gripping read and provides social and political commentary that is just as valuable in our time as when George Orwell first wrote it  holy damn  h hw jwrj  wrwyl yqdm ln Swr   n lmjtm  lmGlq lmthly fy hdhh ldystwby

that it s written in  It s a great page turner and has many really interesting ideas  I loved it Still relevant  Scarily so  I am happy that I waited to read this book until I had ready the Everyman s book of Orwell essays  It contextualized some of the concepts that were present in 1984  I am also happy that I didn t read this book in high school  I think that I appreciate it more than I would if I was younger and didn t understand some of the complexities that exist  It is probably easy to equivocate socialism to totalitarianism or communism to Stalinism if one doesn t have some sort of historical  philosophical  or political context As far as the narrative goes  I found the writing itself and the philosophical themes much stronger than the plot of characterization  The plot isn t what drives the story as much as the description of the world and the philosophical underpinnings of the society  The one thing that I did find myself trying to predict was who would betray Winston in the end  It seemed like a forgone conclusion that Winston would be captured  it was a matter of who would capture him  With the length of the book  more space was devoted to the exposition of the world that the characters existed in rather than their pasts  I would have liked to have known more about O Brien s past and what led him to become what he was The philosophical and political elements follow what had happened in Orwell s life to an extreme  Such a society does not exist on the scale of Oceania in contemporary times  That isn t to say that the themes explored in the book do not stand the test of time  I feel like the technological aspects in particular were prescient  Imagine a television or computer instead of a telescreen  Imagine drones instead of microphones hidden in fields  We have even improved upon the technology of surveillance  I remember Winston mentioning that one could be unobserved in the dark  All in all  this book was a thought provoking and enjoyable read  I would recommend it to anyone and would encourage prospective readers to read some of Orwell s nonfiction before starting the book  Absolutely stunning  Terrifying  yet stunning  Best dystopian I ve ever read  I ve really only read the Hunger Games and most of Divergent   Let s see how Brave New World compares  tmnyt  n  jd l ml fy lnhy  lkn lnhy  qDt  l  wnstwn wjwly w ly  yD   mw thr  ldrj

underwhelmed because I had such high expectations for this  but no  George Orwell kept shocking and impressing me page after page There are many frightening themes and concepts in this book  Big Brother  telescreens  newspeak  thoughtcrime and the Thought Police    but the one that boggles my mind the most is doublethink  which is pure mindf     thinking about it literally hurt my brain at one point  It makes me question the validity of evidence  of facts  of my own memory  It makes me question what is the past and what is reality  For  if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind  and if the mind itself controllable   what then   What then    My goodness  I truly think I ll go crazy if I actually try to perform doublethink This book will definitely stick with me  there s so much to think about it  I have never been interested in political things at all  but reading George Orwell is really starting to change that  I don t think there s much more I can say about 1984 that hasn t been said already  but I do want to repeat this  it is truly a terrifying and haunting book    In comparison to Aldous Huxley s Brave New World   which I ended up spending more time with than the actual review hahaha Probably the biggest and most obvious difference between the two books is that the government in 1984 uses threats  lies and torture to control people  while the one in Brave New World uses happiness and pleasure  1984 is hell whereas Brave New World is heaven  1984 is a dystopia while Brave New World is a utopia   but both of them ultimately end with the loss of humanity and freedom  and it s scary how convincing they both are about how they re  right  Personally  I found Brave New World to be more unsettling  which is a plus for me  because it s told in a rather casual tone that implies that everything happening in the book is perfectly normal  Whereas in 1984  we have a main character  Winston  who from the beginning sees  or at least detects  the horror of the society that he lives in  We immediately have someone to empathize with in 1984  but not in Brave New World  Of course there s Bernard and the Savage  but they come in later  and are ultimately shunned  In addition  we see other people s perspectives in BNW that contrast their views  it would have been interesting if we had something similar in 1984   I thought it was very effective for Huxley s part  But that is not to say that the world of 1984 isn t unsettling  because it is In terms of which is more relevant  I honestly think that today s world is a lot closer to Huxley s prophecy than Orwell s  And if ever  though hopefully not  we do end up like one of those worlds  I believe mankind would be more willing to embrace the society of Brave New World as opposed to 1984  simply because humans prefer pleasure than    well  pain  And as Winston said   It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty     It would have no vitality  Reading the last two paragraphs  it would seem as if I prefer Brave New World over 1984  but that isn t completely true  I do think that 1984 is more haunting  more complex  and more thought provoking  and I think a lot of that has to do with the incredible writing  I love how brutal and straightforward Orwell is and I could not stop quoting his brilliance throughout the entire novel  A frightening  nightmarish plot  combined with great writing  makes for a truly unforgettable and impactful novel  I can definitely understand why many people consider this to be the one of the most influential books of all time Overall  I think that Huxley s prophecy is more fascinating and  disturbingly  believable  while Orwell s vision is more terrifying and mind boggling  Ultimately  though  they are both amazing books  People wrote some really good reviews here  So  I ll be content with writing my feels  The strange thing about this book is that it reminds me of somewhere familiar  some people whom I know  part of them control people s behavior in the name of the religion  claiming that they re doing the best for them  And the some other people like what Winston s said are okay with it  A second or a third reading for this book is a must  I loved the whole book but I can t quote it all lol So  one of my favorite parts is how this  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to  I do not wish to  because the Party does not wish it  You must get rid of those nineteenthcentury ideas about the laws of Nature  We make the laws of Nature   But you do not  You are not even masters of this planet  What aboutEurasia and Eastasia  You have not conquered them yet   Unimportant  We shall conquer them when it suits us  And if we did not  what difference would it make  We can shut them out of existence  Oceania is the world   But the world itself is only a speck of dust  And man is tiny helpless  Howlong has he been in existence  For millions of years the earth was uninhabited   Nonsense  The earth is as old as we are  no older  How could it be older Nothing exists except through human consciousness   But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals    mammoths andmastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of  Transformed into this  The law of gravity was nonsense   If I wished   O Brien had said   I could float off this floor like a soap bubble   Winston worked it out   If he thinks he floats off the floor  and if I simultaneously think I see him do it  then the thing happens   P s  I don t believe that BB symbolizes God  The curious ambiguity of Orwell s disturbingly distorted mindset  surreptitiously lingers underneath a darkly magnetic nuance  If no one cares for you at all  do you really exist  The visual elements which exude redolent representation  juxtapose profoundly the key contrapuntal themes of idealistic Utopias and dramatic dystopias  Orwell s visionary work of illuminative conceptual truism  is a forceful enunciation of both personal and historically societal realities of the times  As a literary satire of political propaganda  it certainly professes a markedly discernible stylistic expressiveness and clarity  The  logic  within the narrative cleverly breaks through the banality of a reader s humanistic expectations for free thinking   I e  when the conclusion shockingly flips  thus revealing the veracity of  Dystopia  as a genre   When we consider Thomas More  Utopia  1516  or the similarly naive idealistic ideas of visionary Utopias  such as  Garden of Eden  Tolkien s Grey Havens  Atlantis  Heaven etc  it s as though a dangerously subjective preconception emerges of stretched possibilities  The themes of nationalism  futurology  censorship  surveillance etc  all encompass our future world that s manufactured on the principles of  perfection   The tug of war between our innate human spirit   freedom  versus oppression   caged  restrictions   similarly to text  Yellow Wallpaper  Charlotte P Stetson  is omnipresent   Contemporary Dystopian fiction  i e  The Hunger Games  Suzanne Collins  or films such as The Matrix  The Adjustment Bureau etc  whilst quintessentially show how advancements in technology and consumerism growth lead to tyrannical revolution  they fail to remain faithful to the acute harshness of dystopia s bittersweet upshot  or intent   It is as though Orwell s literary masterwork is a justification to no one  as it doesn t intend to pleasure the reader by yielding to hopeful  illusive  or fantastical  notions  This less generic  singular work wherein the reader subconsciously falls prey to the credulous entrapment  conveys so much depth of morality   It is our sympathetic empathy and our compassion that s ultimately our own weakness  A synergism founded on love  hope and relation with another  sexual  that generates free thinking  to expand limitations of thought  questioning and ultimately liberalism  uprising  or revolutionary reform   Just look at the Young Adult novel Divergent for instance  or leaders such as Adolf Hitler  political figures and Suffragettes   everything is interlinked as we defy linguistic suppression   narrowing thoughts  individualism    Sow Utopian seeds to reap realities       my own personal Quote   I simply love the Quote   Vagueness and useless shades of meaning     for it is so reminiscent and indicative of how when FEAR can CONTROL  or denote all meaning within life itself  For when the narrative alters  skews and warps a perspective through deep focalisation the reader is acutely targeted as bait  Metaphorical embodiment of a certain character  i e the main protagonist   subconsciously gives rise to empathetic awareness of the tone of a work   Henceforward  with the additional use of  cognitive salience  Orwell discernibly draws his reader in  tugging at the strings of human sentimentalities and contiguously mocking our inhibitions  He is uncannily clever to cause disharmonious impaction through the use of autobiographical tones  as he  similarly to other writers  places himself  his experiences and convictions in the work  Never before have I encountered a literary wonder of such scope  depth and impacting implication of profundity as to shake me to the core  For it questions controversial authoritarianism  unveils the intrinsic link between seeming and being by defying integral norms with adroitness  Research  The Saphir Whorf hypothesis  a mould theory of language and linguistic relativity  Everything denotes parallelism with Marxist theorems  such as for instance J Berger s ways of seeing and the power of language  visual representation and linguistics    War is peace  Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength    Who controls the present  controls the past  Who controls the past controls the future   This is the fundamental assertion put forth in 1984  that the past is only a combination of our memories and what we are told it is  The challenge for the Party of course is the fact that it is much more difficult to erase memories than it is to build the past with new generations that can t remember it  As such 1984 is primarily a documentation of the struggle between the Winston and the Party for control of Winston s mind and his memories  Winston sees this as an epic battle and ultimately loses it in the end  It is left for us to decide whether the Party can ever be defeated  There are tantalizing clues   is O Brien really part of the Brotherhood and is there hope in just managing to stay in opposition until the Party gets you  The answer on its surface seems to be no  but it s clear that Winston has been permitted to remain in mental defiance of the Party for seven years and that O Brien has overseen those seven years before he orchestrates Winston s arrest and conversion  None of this is actually answered and instead the reader has to content him herself with an understanding of the mechanics of how the Party exerts control  primarily through a combination of manipulation of the past and an undercurrent of raw  overwhelming terror that is impossible to avoid  and compare it to the world we live in today  For me the book continues to show relevance as the trend of 1  facts in public discourse becoming less apparent and 2  the ambiguity surrounding what the government can do in a time of  perpetual war  to individuals and citizens  renditions  lack of public trials against enemies of the state  etc   each bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the Party  At this moment  I think  1984  is the book that made the biggest impression on me  At some points I almost felt brainwashed  It is at the same time an homage brought to all the humans ever persecuted and tortured and it can truly make you feel what they felt and think what they thought  It is a book that  in my opinion  every person should read  Tip  You need a little patience till you reach the second half  since it is a  hard to digest  book  The atmosphere is grey and dull  and the beginning is not very exciting  I didn t read the book all at once   wyk n  wrwyl qd ftH nfdh   l  lmstqbl ynZr mn khllh  l   Hwl lbshr  m 1984 fh hy thlth qw  kbr  ttHkm fy lbshr wmSy rhm    lqd br  wrwyl fy rsm Swr  lTGyn km ynbGy lh  n ykwn    SHbn wynstwn

books of all time It tells the story of Winston Smith and his life in a totalitarian country called Oceania  Smith lives in what we would today call London   We follow him in a horrifing story of how a mans life and freedom doesn t mean anything  the word free doesn t even have it s original meaning anymore   and the love for the Party and it s front figure Big Brother is all that matters A must read for everyone  considering that many of the things described in the book have actually really happened and are happening today  but we are often to blind to see it    The full and exhaustive description of a perfect despotic government led by a party only controlled by a few  but whose face is a semi unknown figure makes this book a must read for political science students  As an engineer  the amount of machines described in this book used to maintain the position occupied by the party in question shows the work conducted by the author to make this alternate reality as believable as possible  Gli occhi lo continuavano a guardare  anche da quella moneta  Sui soldi  sui francobolli  sulle copertine dei libri  sulle bandiere  sui cartelloni e sui pacchetti di sigarette    da per tutto  Gli occhi avrebbero guardato sempre e la voce avrebbe risuonato sempre  Da svegli o mentre si dormiva  mentre si mangiava o beveva  dentro casa o fuori  nel bagno  a letto    non c era modo di sfuggirle  Nulla si possedeva di proprio se non pochi centimetri cubi dentro il cranio La Storia era un palinsesto grattato fino a non recare nessuna traccia della scrittura antica e quindi riscritto di nuovo tante volte quante si sarebbe reso necessario Avevo pensato di scrivere il mio commento in Neolingua  ma purtroppo mi vengono in mente troppi aggettivi  troppe sfumature di significato che mi fanno capire che ancora riesco ad esprimermi solo in Archelingua  Italiana  per giunta  neanche Inglese     L undicesima edizione del Dizionario non sono riuscita a trovarla da nessuna parte  per

e impressionante pensare che questo libro e stato scritto nel 1948 la sua attualita lascia a bocca aperta sono sconcertanti le descrizioni della manipolazione del Passato per consentire al Partito il controllo sul Presente e quindi sul Futuro leggendolo non riesco a non fare paragoni con la nostra classe dirigente e i nostri media  giusto per guardare a livello locale e non mondiale  Il Partito riempie la testa della gente con le cose piu assurde  indirizzando l odio della gente sul bersaglio che fa piu comodo in quel momento al fine  comunque  di mantenere lo stato sociale gia esistente senza parlare poi del concetto di Bipensiero e cosa e il Bipensiero citando   il Bipensiero implica la capacita di accogliere simultaneamente nella propria mente due opinioni tra loro contrastanti accettandole entrambe   raccontare deliberatamente menzogne e nello stesso tempo crederci davvero  dimenticare ogni atto che nel frattempo sia divenuto sconveniente e poi  una volta che cio si renda di nuovo necessario  richiamarlo in vita dall oblio per tutto il tempo che serva  negare l esistenza di una realta oggettiva e al tempo stesso prendere atto di quella stessa realta che si nega  tutto cio e assolutamente indispensabile  voi non dite che oggi sta succedendo tutto questo io si  As this book has been around for decades  I ll not redundantly review its content  as others have already contributed quite well to that goal  not to mention that the book s notions have been seared into the collective consciousness of society  What I will say is that this is one of the best books I have read from the standoint of the writing itself   sentence  paragraph  and word construction  I think I salivated on my copy every other page  just reading and appreciating the ingenuity of Orwell s Newspeak that saturated the novel For anyone who is a lover of words  in and of themselves  if you haven t read this  then you probably should  I also found the 1984 film version with Richard Burton and John Hurt to be a particularly effective and uncanny rendition of the material   As I come near the end of this famous novel  I can easily say that it is one of the best books I have read in recent months or even years  1984 depicts a world in which a socialist government has erased all memories of the capitalist past and controls the everyday lives of citizens through constant surveillance  The law is enforced by the Thought Police  who will secretly vaporize anyone who they believe to be against Big Brother  the worshiped leader of Oceania  the story s setting  which is actually Great Britain   The plot focuses on the character Winston Smith  who has a constant feeling that the world he lives in is not the perfect world it is made out to be  He knows that there must have been something in the past that was better than it  George Orwell  who wrote during a time of fear of communism and countries that supported it such as the Soviet Union  writes a story that truly makes the reader wonder if even in a society such as ours all that is said to be true really is true  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story  especially those who are interested in history or politics   Wow  I decided to revisit this old classic  Given the current state of things  I thought it would be interesting I guess the best thing to say is  to condemn this book is to praise it  The book got me depressed and creeped out  The book gave me bad dreams  The book seemed all too familiar  But  this is all high praise for 1984  since what it means is that the predictive nature of the story has borne itself out far too accurately  Perhaps the timeline is off by a few years  but the ever more obvious presence of  Big Brother  in our lives is unmistakeable  Read the book   and be very afraid After reading the book I watches an old BBC interview with George Orwell  and the interviewers last question was  what can we do to prevent this world of yours from taking over our lives  His response was simple   Don t let it happen   Great book   This is by far the most disturbing book I ve read  It really makes me think about our individual intellect and the potential it can contribute to society as well as what happens if our ability to think for ourselves are taken away from us  All the while reading  1984   I feel like I m reading an essay more than a novel  There is a sense that Orwell is pushing a particular message to the reader through every portrayal of a scene or the protagonist s thoughts  I remember feeling like I didn t know what to expect from this book at all when I started reading the first few chapters  I felt like a traveler lost and Orwell my only guide so I didn t spend any time on predicting how it would all end  It s funny because after the climax there is more of a hint of how everything will end  There are moments that sucks me in so deeply inside the characters that I know only what they know and can see just as far as they can regarding their own end  This book is a struggle  It is a story about the characters  struggles  Orwell  when he wants to  makes you feel like you re going through these characters  struggle with them  Or at the very least  makes you worry if you re living in a world that is trying to constantly kill your individualism  Needless to say  I find that after putting this book down  I have a new perspective on the way I look at the world   and maybe how it looks back at me   jwrj  wrwyl j lk tnhy qr  hdhh lrwy  wnt mmlw bmsh r mn lkrhy  wlqhr     nt tbd  rHtlk m  wnstwn lmmlw

imagined  or has been imagined since  Orwell even took into account the effects of linguistic elements on the nature of thought  much less the nature of thought itself  It is evident that the general thought of most people after taking in this book is that its concept is still extremely relevant today  and should provide a valuable lesson against the encroachment on liberty by capitalism  media  intelligence agencies  the state  and the like  I couldn t agree more  However  I take a a more cynical approach by claiming that a greater attribution of the genius behind 1984 might go to the battle of super powers that was happening at the time this book was written  The Soviet Union s global presence must have made some impression on Orwell  as it did to most of  what we call  the West  Poor George  what a horrible world to conceive  There is reason to be optimistic  however  shown by the great effort that must be made to break a human being down into believing that 2   2   5  I value this book as highly as any other  and I am certainly happy that I finally decided to read such an influential piece of work   In George Orwell s  1984     it is filled and led up the suggestion that power is key to a strong society  In this case specifically  it is referring a dystopian society  The story is based off of a middle aged man named Winston  Winston lives by himself  is apart of the outer party  and has found himself to be a thought criminal  He over time  thinks and is always found with the thought of a different world  A world without the system of the party  This which leads to different discoveries and experiences all with a slight twist   This text overall  is a mere interpretation of a dystopian society  A society that harms its people and continues to do so without stopping  In this case  it reveals what power does to a government  and people in general  It becomes addictive  once used  it is wanted and craved more and more  As said before  it is really a true interpretation of the negative effects obtained from an overload of power that may be set forth or achieved in a society  How it reveals this message is many times in the story the words   WAR IS PEACE  SLAVERY IS FREEDOM  INSOLENCE IS STRENGTH    The Party lives by these words and does not stray from them  Another example from the text is   You will be hollow  We shall squeeze you empty  and then we shall fill you with ourselves   Revealing what the Party does to people to enforce and maintain its power  This book has been a mind changing experience  and I recommend it to anyone willing to open their eyes to new possibilities and ideas involving a different world   It must be not invented word yet which can fairly describes such literary work   Writing a review about Orwell is totally a daunting task   I will just say  Your big brother is watching you  is something or maybe somebody tracking me nowadays   This book  1984  was a book written by George Orwell and is about his prediction about the future  His vision of the future is a very chilling thought  because he feels that the whole world is going to turn into a communist place  He meets this girl at work named Juila  Winston becomes curious about Juila and thinks that she is the thought police  but finds out that she is not when she slips him a note with the words   I love you   They then begin a love affair  When they fall deeper in love his thoughts are changing about their government  Winston makes contact with O Brien who he thought is not a member oft he thought police but actually is  He arrenges for Winston to get a copy of the book  unfortunately Winstin was captured by the thought police and was eventually tortured  O Brien is the one that is in charge of how much and when Winston gets tortured  After all that ya s happened to the couple Winston is sent to room 101  where they give him the ultimate torture  Rats  Rats were the worst torture because they basically ate your body while your alive  Winston gives up and says do it to Julia  which was exactly what O Brien was looking for  It showed that he wasn t in love with her as much as he thought because if he was he would have take the punishment instead of making them do it to his girlfriend  It think that the eight and freshman s should be the level of this book  I believe that because people are starting to think more and more about their future as they are going into high school   No words for this amazing book by George Orwell  The amount of times that chills ran down my back whilst reading it is amazing  The things he predicted in 1949 is scary   so many things have come true and we don t even realise it  A definite suggestion if you re into all the dystopian future type stuff  Especially if you want to be freaked out as you realise how    we ve been intellectually reduced to slaves by the authorities without even knowing it 2 2 5http   aminaahmedsblog wordpress com     Pre Review review While everyone under the sun seems to have read this when they were in high school  I just finally got around to it now  Sure  I ve started it before and didn t finish  and I ve seen the movie  but come on   I m almost 40  I think part of me was reluctant   view spoiler  knowing that it didn t end well   hide spoiler   and knowing the basic gist of it besides A proper review is coming   RATING  4 5  Slight deduction from the full 5 stars for tediousness in the midsection when Orwell stayed on his soap for too long a stretch  Review IntroductionSince just about everyone has already read this or seen the movie or at least has heard of it enough to know the general story  I feel there s little point in giving my two cents on the book itself  What else could be said  Therefore I ll give you an encapsulation of the feelings I took away from it  Review Just because you re paranoid  doesn t mean they re not after you  The world is 1984 all over again  It has always been and may always be  We humans can and could do anything we want  ANYTHING  so what do we do  We enslave one another  If there s one universal truth among all homo sapiens  it s that we all want happiness  Instead of working towards that goal  we beat it out of one another  I will no doubt go to my grave having lived under this irrational  tyrannical self rule  still wondering why  Through the fruits of my own labor and personal struggle  I hope I m able to squeeze enough sweetness from my time here to lie down the final time with a smile on my face   Every so often I m reading books from the Rory Gilmore Reading Challenge and 1984 was one of them  I read this book in high school and  no real surprise  I  got it  better than I did back then  We re way past 1984 and some of the things that George Orwell predicted in 1949 have come true and some have not  Reading this the second time around I would say it s a  can t put down type of novel  and is definitely worth a reread or worth picking up for a first time   ntbh  l kh lkbyr yrqbk  nhm yttb wnk  ynm kunt  y rfwn m yjwl bkhTrk  ltstTy   n tHyd  n lTryq lmrswm lk  nhm alhtk ldhyn l tstTy  Ht   n tkfur bhm  wl mhl  w Sbr lhm  l  m tqtrfh mn jry

Orwell e uma alegoria que descreve um estado totalitario onde a individualidade e sistematicamente perseguida e oprimida  Londres  1984  Uma revolucao em marcha  o reinado do Grande Irmao  ditador e lider do partido unico  que tudo preve  programa  impede o pensamento e o direito a liberdade e individualidade A originalidade da obra de Orwell reside na aplicacao de um instrumento de poder para o dominio de um povo  a Novilingua  Syme era filologo  especialista em Novilingua   fazia parte da enorme equipe de peritos empenhada na compilacao da IIa edicao do dicionario da Novilingua   E lindo destruir palavras  Naturalmente a maior parte e nos verbos e nos adjectivos  mas ha centenas de substantivos que podem perfeitamente ser eliminados  Nao apenas os sinonimos  os antonimos tambem  Se temos a palavra bom para que precisamos de mau  A finalidade de criar essa nova lingua seria impedir que no futuro nao fosse possivel pensar de forma diferente do partido  pois nao haveria como expressa lo  Uma abolicao de palavras  mas tambem uma evolucao semantica das existentes  como se pode comprovar no lema do partido  GUERRA E PAZLIBERDADE E ESCRAVIDAOIGNORANCIA E FORCA E certo que no interior de uma lingua  todas as palavras que exprimem ideia vizinhas se limitam reciprocamente  sinonimos como recear   temer  ter medo tem valor proprio apenas pela sua oposicao  se recear nao existisse  todo o seu conteudo passaria para os seus rivais A lingua e uma instituicao social  um codigo  que evolui naturalmente  e a fala e a realizacao individual da lingua  mas Orwell concebeu um codigo de comunicacao restrito  imutavel e completamente hermetico  1984  1949  mantem uma enorme actualidade  De modo profetico  George Orwell abordou temas relevantes como a quebra da privacidade  O final nao e esperancoso  Ja nao corria nem dava vivas  Estava de volta ao Ministerio do Amor  tudo perdoado  a alma branca de neve  Estava na tribuna dos reus  confessando tudo  implicando todos  Ia pelo corredor de ladrilhos brancos com a impressao de andar ao sol  acompanhado por um guarda armado  Por fim penetrava lhe o cranio a bala tao esperada  Levantou a vista para o rosto enorme  Levou quarenta anos para aprender que especie de sorriso se ocultava sob o bigode negro  Oh mal entendido cruel e desnecessario  Oh teimoso e voluntario exilio do peito amantissimo  Duas lagrimas cheirando a gin escorreram de cada lado do nariz  Mas agora estava tudo em paz  tudo otimo  acabada a luta  Finalmente vencida a batalha contra si mesmo  Amava o Grande Irmao   Read  wait a few years then repeat 1984 is one of the saddest most depressing stories I have ever read  With that said let me tell you why it is a book everyone must read  It is the benchmark for dystopian novels and one of the greatest English language novels of all time  It is the story of a totalitarian socialist society   Oligarchical Collectivism   where the party is superior to any individual or group  I read it in High School and again in college then again as a middle aged adult  Now  I have read it again as a senior adult  Each time I read it I can see our society becoming closer to the reality of 1984  For instance  the Snowden revelations have come to pass since the last time I read the book   Can you say Big Brother is watching   While Orwell may have missed the mark in the prediction of time he was dead on target with the policies of the progressive movement  Consider the following passage   That it sought power because men in the mass were frail  cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth  and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves  That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness  and that  for the great bulk of mankind  happiness was better   That sounds a lot like the current ruling elite from both parties  Orwell s creations such as   Doublethink    Newspeak    Thoughtcrimes  are all examples of the modern political propaganda scene  Re education camps where they  cure  people of their  insanity  are probably not far away  If you read this book and do not see the parallels with the direction of modern government   then you are probably a  prole  or a staunch  inner party  member  msh qdr qwl ll  jwy  n lrwy  dy bSrH Gyr  ny sh r n lmkn Hwly SbH ql Skhb mn zy qbl There are books that one must read them many times so as to unfold the hidden meanings every time  1984 is one of those novels   it s a wonderful novel  It really and truly depicts the terrifying life under the umbrella of Dictatorial system  And for the sake the leader controls everything in the country and prevent any attempt for uprising or acts of sabotage against him  one can expect the leader to use any means to restrain his people  Some of these vicious ways for example  recruiting one s children to denounce their parents if they say anything bad against the BB  screens surveillance everywhere  in the offices  houses  and streets Everything is under the control of the BB of the country  the tyrant  their minds  lives and even the minute details of pple s lives  It s a painful novel  you feel like you are repressed and live a very big lie in your life by keeping glorifying the leader of the country and in your heart you hate him wish him the worst but you cannot express it        sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator     George Orwell  1984 In the post Snowden world there is very little to George Orwell s  1984  that seems unlikely now  but every time I re read it I am also struck by some of the non political aspects of his future visions made in 1949  This time it was about pop music being composed by automated means  Unfortunately that is what a lot of modern music sounds like to me  but maybe I am just dating myself    Anyway  this audiobook performance by Simon Prebble was outstanding and his narration suited all the voices very well  Re read it  Still so poignant and clever  Did not realize that Orwell died so young   This book terrifies me  and always has done Orwell gives light to a totalitarian regime in a dystopian world that makes the likes of Hitler and Stalin look like pussies  Everything is controlled by the government   working  eating  talking   and even the most minor unorthodox thought can be detected through a variety of different technologies or groups What scared me most about this novel is the idea that the past does not exist  All evidence we have of the past exists in only written records and memories  What if these are false  What if both of these can be controlled Although 1984 has now been and gone  I wasn t even a figment of imagination at this time   it is hard to believe that this novel was first published in 1949 as a projection of the future  Although there are clear nods to Stalinist Russia  anyone reading the book now could quite easily find stark parallels to life as we know it today  and I believe even ten  or twenty years on  this may still be the case  It s essentially about propaganda  how this affects society  and how powerful it can be when put to use by government The ending was quite surreal  although I feel this was intended due to our protagonist s experiences It s absolutely timeless  and will no doubt remain a classic for an incredibly long time  It s so influential  not to mention important  and I feel as technology rapidly progresses it s a novel that will become more real year after year  I d encourage people to read this  or even to re read it  I read it when I was in school and after reading it again I ve gained a much different perspective than I did years ago  It s quite the cultural point of reference  and along with Animal Farm  is a good place to begin your Orwellian experience  Una de obra de impacto  directa a la logica  miedo  esperanza  erudicion  climax y horror  ese ha sido el camino por el que me ha llevado el genio de Eric Arthur Blair Comienza a plasmarte un futuro logico con un personaje capaz  aparentemente  de tener una vision parcialmente distinta  con anhelos  El protagonista pasa del odio al amor y de la creencia lejana de rebelion a la consciencia de la existencia de un plan  de un modo de rebeldia Todo con un trasfondo de precision terrorifica El climax de la novela nos viene precedido por la escena mas bella de la obra  con los protagonistas viendo la esperanza de su mundo en los proles  justo despues comienza a desvelarse la triste realidad Los protagonistas se reencuentran despues del proceso  han instaurado en ellos los fundamentos de pensamiento del partido  son capaces de odiar y de amar al mismo tiempo y todo lo que se dijeron  las palabras de esperanza en lo mas recondito de su ser se despedazan a nuestros ojos  pero lo peor  lo mas espeluznante  es que lo entendemos perfectamente En la ultima parte  Principios de nuevalengua  el narrador nos educa  de forma erudita  en los fundamentos linguisticos del cambio  quizas haciendonos ver  por los tiempos usados  que despues de la historia  de algun modo  todo volvio a su cauce Es tiempo  siempre lo ha sido  de pensar en nuestros dias  que estamos viviendo  de que manera tan implacable nos estan controlando  como vemos los pasos certeros hacia la centralizacion y la sencillez con la que ya pueden controlar que pensamos y en gran media los medios por los que llegamos a pensarlo  O rasto repugnante da distopia nao me vai sair das maos tao cedo  Deixa uma pessoa de lagrimas nos olhos e com vontade de atear fogo a coisas  O que mais se pode pedir de um livro  Wow  Just  wow I ve spend a very long time thinking how I can explain what this book made me feel  I wasn t expecting a lot when I started reading  definitely because I read a very old edition with a lot of spelling mistakes  but once I got a few chapters into the book and was able to look further than the old grammar  it really got to me  It made me feel terrified and fascinated at the same time  It was a scary book  but not in the usual way  It really made me think about things  What if something like this actually happened  I can t imagine what it must be like to not be allowed to have your own opinion  Not only the entire concept of the book  but also the way everything was described made me feel very scared  I didn t like the characters in particular  To be honest  I disliked quite a lot of the characters  For example Julia  I thought she was very arrogant  and maybe even a bit narrow minded  despite her hate against the Party  She hated them  but she didn t seem to care for other things besides her own pleasure  I didn t really dislike Winston  but I just didn t really like him that much  I did feel quite sorry for him  At first I liked O Brien  but for obvious reasons that didn t last very long The most terrifying part of the book was the ending  There s a part in the book where Winston says that to be able to die while hating the party would be freedom  That s why the last sentence in particular really scared me  because he didn t die in freedom after all  Throughout the entire book  he had been able to keep his hate for the party alive  sometimes he hated them more  sometimes less  but it was always there  He was able to stick to his own opinion  despite everything they had done to him  he kept on being himself  But at the end  even he  Winston Smith  who had always hated the Party so deeply  wasn t able to die in freedom  He died as a part of the Party  not as himself  This scared me  because it showed that the Party can even brainwash the most self determined people I really loved this book  It was terrifying  but it was also so well written and clever that it s almost impossible not to love it  It s the kind of book that keeps you thinking  much more than just an enjoyable read   Srtu  Hb lkh lkbyr   m  n lbrwlytry fl khwf mn

street yet  1984 warns us against the psychological manipulation by totalitarianism control  The book reminds me most of North Korea  as we were studying totalitarianism countries recently  and this book is definitely one of my top used references  The oppressive force enabled the use of technology to control their citizens  as they altered history and manipulated minds  The most extreme  but imaginable society of the modern world from this book reflected the potential threat a communism nation could propose  This book really reminds me of the communism country we live in right now  a k a China   Apparently the government is now struggling in a series of  INNER FIGHTING   and Xi Jin Ping had control over the nation similar to how Hitler controlled Germany during WW2  I don t know if the people have noticed it yet  apparently they are too much  occupied   but anyways I really enjoyed this book so yeah  D Dang so deep and depressing though  Even though the ending was so predictable  Someone died  But still   Oriasi regeny  Nem is tudom mit mondjak  Zsigeri borsodzas es borod ala maszas  Nehez  nyomaszto  szaraz  de megeri Bovebben  http   pupillaolvas blogspot hu 2013    A huge  huge piece of work  I m out of words  because words couldn t explain this book crawling under your skin  making you shiver from the inside out  making you realize lots of things   A heavy  grim  prosaic novel  but it s worth reading   I honestly can t believe it took me so long to get onto Orwell  It seems that everyone in Britain seems to have studied either Animal Farm or 1984 in their GCSE English classes Except me So I know it s not an excuse  But it s the one I m using  To be honest  I m quite glad that I didn t read it within class  I think this is the kind of book that would have been ruined by studying it in classes  Although  Orwell has a pretty nifty page on Spark Notes   view spoiler   A website that I completely didn t rely on through my GCSE exams   hide spoiler  Even though I had never read anything of his   my first Orwell experience was my final year at uni when we read Coming Up for Air for my British Writer s in the 1930s module and I absolutely adored it  I knew the basic gist of what he was about  After god knows how many series of the reality TV show Big Brother  though  I hear it s the last series soon  yes  YES    the comedy show Room 101 and staring blankly at my lecturer when they described a book as  Orwellian   a quick visit to Google sorted me out     it has been impossible to avoid the effect of Orwell on our culture Jo Brand stated that 1984 was  More relevant to today than almost any other book that you can think of   Looking at the situation that Britain is at the moment  it is eerie how much of this Orwell actually predicted and I can t help agree with Ms Brand The 24 7 surveillance  the greedy men in power who rely on dirty tricks to remain where they are  the shocking class division and the pointless constant wars that no one understands  remembers why they were started in the first place  Like Brand says  1984 remains relevant as all these factors are plaguing the Britain we live now I found that 1984 read more like an essay because if you think about it  in the first part of the novel    nothing happens  At all  And I don t mean that as a bad thing as Orwell s writing is mesmerizing and his descriptions of the inner workings of the dystopic Oceania are nothing short of genius  He relies on realistic descriptions of things that could feasibly happen like the telescreens that have been installed into every citizens house  With all these CCTV cameras and traffic camera are we  in 2010  really that far away from having cameras placed in our home 1984 is such an important novel  especially when you consider that it was written 40 years before it was set  Orwell died the year after 1984 was published and so never really got to see the effect this novel had on British culture  I would like to know what he would think of the government now  especially in regards to the state of the politics of Britain at the moment I would also like to know what he would think about Davina McCall  Or what he d put into Room 101   I m going to take a guess and say Spark Notes      and Channel 4  Es una de las novelas mas tristes que he leido  sin duda Me llama la atencion como la gente se queda unicamente con la vision de que la vigilancia continua de los ciudadanos por parte del gobierno es lo mas importante de la novela  Quizas se deba a que solo repiten lo que han escuchado en medios de comunicacion ad infinitum A mi me parecio muchisimo mas interesante lo que El Partido pretendia hacer con el lenguaje  y como modificando el lenguaje  se puede modificar el pensamiento  en el largo plazo  Esto ademas  tiene bases cientificas solidas  recuerdo que lei un articulo sobre como algunos pueblos eslavos  creo  podian percibir mas colores que los que vemos los occidentales  por el simple hecho de tener mas palabras para describir los colores Lo siguiente que mas me gusto  es el estado de paranoia que genera el no saber nunca que es verdad y que es mentira  por el control de los medios y la verdad unica  o peor aun saber que no se sabe que es verdad y que es mentira El final es terrible por toda la implicacion de la destruccion de  view spoiler  Winston  y francamente pense que terminaria de otra forma  pense que la invasion que estaba presenciando en la telepantalla seria real  derrotarian a Oceania  surgiria un nuevo poder  pero seria igual  Sin embargo  es mas consistente con la historia pensar que lo que estaba ocurriendo quizas ni siquiera estaba ocurriendo y no era mas que otra manipulacion de El Partido  por lo que el final termina siendo desgarrador  hide spoiler  Otra cosa que generalmente obvian nuestros medios de comunicacion es la durisima critica que se hace al sistema socialista comunista y es un reflejo de las fantasias con las que  se dice  vivian en la Union Sovietica Con todo lo anterior  creo que 1984 se coloca entre mis novelas favoritas  For some reason  I ve always been partial to Brave New World in the very defined genre  also containing We  This Perfect Day and Kallocain in my opinion   more suggestions welcome  But Orwell is undoubtedly a masterful author and very ahead of his time  in more ways than actually shows in this novel  And  no  I m not going to say a word of what s it about  If you haven t read it already   congratulations  you have a great experience ahead of you  lw n fy lslT   wl ktb h mr bjm h mn lns w Hrqh w Hrq  y Hd byqrh hybq  lktb dhlly  yz yshwf jmd dbtshn adaptation llrwy  dy ytfrj  l  fylm equilibrium This has got to be the best book I read this year  It has just the right number of pages  words and ink  Precisely to get the plot with all it s messages to the reader without any excess baggage of empty words or shallow conversations  The story is saturated with complexed ideas  So keep an open mind and delve in its realm  Even if you get depressed  that s what happened to me  in spite of the melancholy world  I was so immersed  I savored every word to its fullest  to the point where I didn t want to read it all at once  I kept reading and re reading parts that I loved  like  their embrace had been a battle  the climax a victory  It was a blow struck against the party  it was a political act   I couldn t help but wonder how smart the author must ve been  He keeps creating worlds parallel to our world in his novels  Imaginary  Futuristic world that was so set backed  He was foreseeing the future of communism and other similar political parties  He Never failed to get his message through even after sugar coating the whole truth  You d bite into it and taste what the author wanted you to taste and feel what he wanted you to feel  But most importantly  To make you see and understand what he thoughts and understood  His own truth  A piece of himself has been embedded within these pages   George Orwell s 1984 captivated me with its powerful and astounding novel  I found 1984 to be a classic book on the shelves of political issues   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   Can you imagine seeing those bold words everywhere you go  Having a government with complete control on every aspect of your life and even thoughts  Whatever you are doing whether it be sleeping  eating  writing  talking and even thinking  you are being watched by the leader and dictator  Big brother  may I add  more harsh than Hitler  Individuality is not a choice for Big Brother The main theme of the book is to warn the people of what can happen when the government is given too much power  Power can sometimes be too much that it can be abused  The book is set in the ruling Party in London  in the nation of Oceania in 1984  The main character is Winston Smith a frustrated thirty nine year old man  Winston s frustration is clearly shown throughout the novel  as he secretly goes against society and purchases a diary in which he writes all his criminal thoughts in  Winston secretly hates Big Brother which is the face of the party  Winston too craves love so much that he meets Julia at his work and begins a hidden affair that causes them too always have to lookout for Big Brother s monitoring  As you read  you will get to know a lot about what goes on in Winston s head and feelings even though it is outlawed to express yourself and of how it is the worst human society imaginable As I had just previously mentioned  this is an astounding novel about demonstrating the most extreme realization of a totalitarian society  So  I clearly gave this book five stars because the author has a very unique way of giving his characters life and leaving you constantly on the edge of your chair  just craving what was going to happen next to Winston s rebellion against society and his feelings that are monitored by Big Brother  Just how Big Brother had the power of controlling personal rights  the author too has a way of  controlling  you to keep on reading  This book is great for those who are into the political authority  If you re the kind who reads one book a year  read this one  If you read 2  read it again The Sheer evil portrayed in this book in the dystopic future shown to you by Orwell will Shake you to the bone like  The Exorcist  never could  Power  corruption  surveillance  trust both found and broken  survival  this book has it all  Once you re done with this book Your life will never be the same again   Still brilliant on a second read through  I had partly forgotten some of the finer elements in the art of tyranny  but the completeness of the process when compared to real world examples is what sets it apart  When the ideal is absolute power  then power will be utilised absolutely  I still find myself thinking of  and agreeing with  a picture I saw with a CCTV camera and a caption that said  1984 was supposed to be a warning  not a guide   Oh so true  This book is a frightening portrayal of a society in which people give up their individual freedoms to the government  It is also a perfect example of why we must not become complacent and content with mediocrity  and of why individual thoughts  feelings and ideas are all equally valuable   WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Those words keep sounding in my head since I started this book  George Orwell s style of writing is impressive and unique in its own way  1984 describes a utopia  Working  eating  drinking  sleeping  talking  thinking  procreating   all are controlled by the state  Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police  the telescreen  or even your children  who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities  The past is controlled  rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler  Who controls the past  controls the future  Who controls the present  controls the past  There is no real truth  The  truth  is what the state says it is  Black is white  1 2 4 if the state says it does  There is no arguing  The world in 1984 is divided into three states  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  Continuous warfare between those three is required to keep the society s order and peace  The second slogan  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party  That way  you ll be indestructible and immortal IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  means the division on high  middle  low classes in society will never be changed  The middle wants to be the high and they ll act  on behalf of the low  to dethrone the high  Afterwards  a new middle class arises  all will change except the low  The high and middle make and uphold the law  the low  proletarian  is just too stupid to revolt  The state maintains its structure by torture  intimidation  violence  and brainwashing Orwell s Animal Farm might be depressing  but 1984 gives  depression  a WHOLE new meaning  I m currently on Chapter 2 of this book  which is about 1 3 of the way in  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a captivating and somewhat  horrific  read   A work of fiction that is frighteningly like non fiction  Orwell s negative utopia compels you from the first page all the way to the last   Doublethink  Cognitive dissonance as an actual  perceived and understood thing We have always been at war with Oceania What can I possibly say about this story  about this writer  about the style and delivery that can do it justice  I would need to channel whatever genius Orwell himself tapped into  This is a timeless story about the evils of control and ownership in society You can compare and contrast this against any governmental body anywhere at anytime  It is majestic in its scope and flawless in its delivery  Doubleplusgood  newspeak  and doublethink are real things that have been named and defined here in this tome  The very concept of limiting free thought by dissolving language itself is unbelievable  It is true evil  And done so well here I haven t even mentioned Big Brother  the most ubiquitous and reused concept coined in this piece  Nor did we bring up the societal references  from the definitive Apple commercial to the reality CCTV show This dystopian nightmare is a fundamental political and sociological tome that is important  Simply it is one of the MOST important books on the subject and genres that has ever been written in the modern day  I am very thankful they force average high schoolers to dive into it  and again  and again  in the underclassmen years  It is vital to the education of an awake and aware society Orwell teaches us what happens if you fail to watch the watchmen  A  one of a kind  book  Extremely well thought  it initially rather reminded me of Dominion by C J  Sansom  which was of course written after 1984    but about 2 3 in  it took a completely different turn  A more realistic one  I dare say  This book questions reality at its very roots and its thought provoking ideals will make a mark on you  Mostly as it is not very far from the truth in some countries  The way the population can be suppressed and constrained  without them even knowing  is truly mind blowing and  honestly  frightening A book everyone ought to read to sharpen their minds and open their eyes  This book is a modern masterpiece  I probably do not have to mention that  it s a given with a book like this  I appreciate it so much more because it took me almost 2 years to actually find it in a bookstore  Recently 500 teachers have rated it No  1 on the must read book list  It is that and much more  I doubt I can say something about it that hasn t already been said  but I would like to believe that each person appreciates this book differently  The values it preaches  the frustrations Winston expresses is all so palpable  I became so involved in this bleak idea of a civilisation  so obsessed with the whole thing  I was having vivid dreams about thoughtcrime and life in Oceania  I guess that speaks more for George Orwell more than it does me  There is a lot to this book that would probably take me some time to truly understand and take in  It is without a doubt one of my favourite books now  possibly the best book I have ever read  Winston is not a particularly heroic or special character  he doesn t even have any real emotion for anyone  I think that makes the character all the more realistic  His one and only true passion and feeling is his heretic views  which made me love this character fervently  He is different from almost everyone else  he is able to see his world for what it really is and that made this book a winner in my eyes  My two favourite moments in this book would be the time he read  Goldstein s book   He felt almost felt  happiness  then  I also liked the lady  a prole  who sings and dries clothes   in Winston s hiding place  These two moments in the book are almost anomalies when compared with the tone of the rest of the book  The ending is not something I liked very much  but I am trying to come to grips with it  I felt as though he lost his very identity  which I think is the purpose of the world of Oceania  Maybe in years to come I will understand that aspect of the book  As a whole  this is a great read and is ever relevant and will never lose meaning  It is the embodiment of our worst fears  1984 will live on  for hundreds of years to come   ah

politcs  Granted this book was written in 1948  the insights that occur in it were definitely ahead of its time   Based in an extreme socialist society Oceana   the protagonist has to find his individuality in a society that frowns upon such thoughts  Along the way he finds a youthful women to aid in his journey  Everything seems to be going well  until the couple is caught for breaking one of the worst laws in this society thoughtcrime  This only leads to further problems and a twist ending that is obvious  but only if one pays attention to the foreshadowing  Orwell does an excellent job in engaging the reader with his language and style of writing  One aspect that helps is the language that is invented specifically for his fictional society  He develops a plethora of simple words that are  made up  by the Big Brother in the book  The idea of this language  within the story line  is to make it so that the citizens of the society are not able to formulate their own interpretations of different words  Some of the words that are made include  thoughtcrime thinking of ideas that aren t given to you by Big Brother  doublespeak the name of the language that is developer  and thoughtpolice  the most feared people in this society  Overall  this book is tastefully written  and keeps the reader invovled and feeling symapathetic for the protagonists  On the downside  when one peruses this book  if not totally involved it is very easy to become perplexed by what is occuring  I definitely recommend it to any interested in any type of politcal fiction  This is again one fo those books one can never forget  Original and terrifying plot  with twist where you don t expect them  and an even more shocking and tragic ending  This review and rating comes from my high school mind because I did my research paper on this book and loved it  Another masterpiece of SF  Dystopian tales are meant to disturb us and make us look at our society with new  more critical eyes  Here  Orwell shows his disillusion with the dictatorial systems that have ruled and  at the time of writing  do rule large parts of Europe  I feel that this book has to be read at the same time as  Brave New World  so that we can appreciate how the world we live in is a sort of synthesis of the two  It is interesting how disfunctional Orwell s world is  and how that reflects the disfunctionality of the old totalitarian regimes of Eastern Europe   Such a world can only exist under very tight controls  with no outside forces pressing against it  There will always be Winston Smiths who start to lose their faith in the Party and the system  especially when  like him  they are part of the machinery that creates it  1984 is a book that can be called a classic unchallenged  Many of my classmates who read the book complained of it being dry and uninteresting however after finishing the book I felt like that was farthest from fact  The book had a certain fluidity to the characters and plot that are only paralleled in very few books  The story took awhile to fully set up due to the intricacies of George Orwell s Oceania yet he skillfully captured the monotony on life in a way that made Winston s reality seem feasible The book follows Winston  a government worker who is highly disillusioned with the government  He struggles to choose to rebel against the government who constantly watches it citizens or remain quiet and never be killed  However  he finds his voice when he begins to have a relationship with another government worker  Doing that alone is a crime there  I liked how the book did not contain a plot on the surface level but it was carried through on the scenery and imagery that Orwell produced  I also thought it was brilliant to have the enemy of the state had the possibly of being fabricated by the government the enemy opposes  After reading this book I and hooked on George Orwell s books  It is a 5 5 book  Baglilik  dusunmemek demektir

determined to get around to it at some point And damn am I glad I did 1984 follows a middle aged man named Winston through a dystopian world of extreme totalitarianism  The government controls absolutely everything and monitors its people to prevent any of them from revolting against the Party in control  And by control everything  I do mean everything  They even re write the past to suit their efforts Before I get to the lessons in this book  which surely everyone is mostly interested in  I want to address the novel s storytelling  world building  and pacing  I just want to state that all three were fantastic  with the world building being especially deep and detailed  Orwell did a fantastic job of paying attention to all the finer points of living in such a society he imagined that I had no troubles at all immersing myself in this man made hell  Really excellent stuff and it helped me to get into the story and see the messages he was trying to send Mostly  1984 is a warning about power  particularly the power of thought  The government in 1984 is aware of how dangerous it is for people to think independently and so actively tries to control thoughts and actions  going so far as to dumb down speech so that people will one day be incapable of expressing revolution  It s truly ingeniously wicked stuff  though  as the Soviet Union proved  doomed to fail in a real world application  Despite this  many parallels in our own society can be drawn and lessons can be learned  In particular  I saw a lot of examples with organized religion  Thought police sound a lot like the religious police of the Middle East these days  and of course the NSA seems less like a tool to stop terrorism and more like a weapon to silence those who disagree with the government SPOILERS  I want to take a moment to address the fact that 1984 doesn t offer a point of view we haven t heard before  There s the movie Enemy of the State and V for Vendetta for example  but 1984 is particularly interesting because the protagonists lose  The government is not overthrown  the people are successfully controlled  and although the novel doesn t mention it  one day the sun expands and swallows earth whole and all of humanity perishes because of the pursuit of power over itself But do I think any of this will happen  No  Not so long as the internet remains a free and open platform for speech  1984 will always remain a work of fiction  Knowledge and communication are the great unifiers or our time  allowing anyone to instantly connect and talked with people all over and learn things they might never have known  The internet is the ultimate free speech platform and should remain that way  Thanks to the internet  humanity has become aware of how ignorant it is and is slowly working to change that  Some governments  in response  have attempted to control the internet such as Russia s recent banning and then un banning of wikipedia and reddit so long as the two websites agree to censor their data  Terrible stuff  and I fear we have a great battle ahead of us that I only hope we can reign over But I m totally getting off subject here  Damn 1984 book  making me think  Anwyay  yeah  read this book if you haven t yet  It s some intoxicating stuff  Cok uzun bir ara birakmama ragmen sonunda kitabi bitirdim  Ama nasil bitirdim gelin birde bana sorun  Kitabin sonunda gicik oldum

   If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  for ever   Hay tantas frases y extractos de 1984 que es imposible poder elegir una sobre otra y probablemente esta sea una de las mas poderosas  al ser directa  realista y certera  Por otro lado  releer una de mis novelas favoritas  ocho anos despues  significa siempre sumergirse nuevamente en toda abrasividad  el nihilismo y la desesperanza que se sienten en cada una de las paginas de esta obra maestra del siglo XX  Es encontrar nuevos significados  interpretaciones mas coherentes  actitudes en los personajes con los que el lector logra empatizar e identificarse  y llenandose de total impotencia ante el inveitable destino de estos  e incluso con los devaneos filosoficos y por momentos metafisicos de O Brien  una de las piezas clave de todo el engranaje orwelliano  Demas esta decir que la tercera parte siempre es la mas angustiosa  reflexiva y poderosa de toda la novela  y  a mi opinion  uno de los puntos algidos de toda la literatura universal   The father  or dare I say it   big brother  of all contemporary dystopian novelsI read this at 17 when studying A Levels  and seeing it recently adapted at the theatre I had a hankering to revisit it  half my life later  It only grows more impressive with age  it really does  It s a classic for a reason  it s shattering  powerful and absolutely unforgettable This audiobook  narrated by the excellent Samuel West  gives us the voice of not only Orwell  but the lowly yet rebellious Winston Smith and those of his oppressors   the Party  A very effective way of accessing the book In what may be the dystopian fiction that all others since either build on  imitate or pay homage to  Winston Smith works and lives in the dreary and oppressive world dominated by the Party  who control rations  leisure time  and watch each citizen constantly through state sanctioned TV screens  Trying out his own small acts of rebellion  WInston is our eyes and ears on this horrendous world  one only a few steps away from our own  The whole creation of Winston s society in Oceania  forever at war with one of the other two great powers  is exquisite  We even gain access to inner Party literature that explains how the officials have organised their systems to oppress and maintain control  And of course  Orwell is a modern Shakespeare in adding cultural reference points to the language that everybody will know but knot necessarily know the source of   Big Brother  Room 101  thought crime  One of the most important books you ll ever read  and be thankful it s  just  a fiction    MY MIND IS BLOWN  Those who would give up privacy for security deserve neither  tmt ktb  hdhh lrwy  khll  rb ynyt lqrn l shryn  ldhlk kn  thr lHrb l lmy

how I see the world  Unfortunately  not really in a good way  The most frightening book I ve ever read  Orwell s 1984 is about as perfect as a novel can be   dystopian science fiction     political thriller  romance  psychological thriller and the horrors of man more frightening than any typical horror novel Of course  we re told it s a warning  not a prophecy   yeah  right   but with Big Brother  Room 101  Doublethink  Newspeak and that infamous slogan    War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength    we must not forget how subtle and prophetic the final element is  For after brainwashing  Smith finally submits to the  system  himself   a form of acceptance Related to today   how so much seems to have come true   I must conclude that if we give the sheeple enough comfort and incentive  we become Big Brother  and Sister  ourselves  which makes 1984 prophetic  indeed And hark  A clock strikes 13  lnjm  lkhms  bsbb lnhy lry    llrwy l mlk l n qf mdhwsh mm tfSyl

books are prophetic and coming to fruition       an unfortunate  rotten fruition  This is one of the indispensable books every person needs to read in their literature classes       right next to Fahrenheit 451   Dalam novel ini  menulis buku harian dan berhubungan seks bebas dapat mengundang para polisi rahasia mendobrak pintu kamarmu  Mereka akan menyeretmu ke bilik bilik penyiksaan

Jika ada angin perubahan bagi negara yang setiap gerak warga dipelajari  setiap kata disadap  dan setiap pemikiran dikendalikan  tentu itu dihembuskan oleh kaum kelas bawah  Sayang  mereka terlalu disibukkan dengan minuman minuman murah  cerita cerita kuno  dan rumus menghitung nomor buntut  1984 merupakan salah satu karya George Orwell yang penting  yang mana membacanya membuat tidur saya tidak lagi nyenyak  Menawan  I read this book around a month ago and did not think myself to be in possession of a mental state which might enable me to say something about this  I can still remember my reaction when I finished this and the way that my roommates were worried for my sanity because I was so upset over a book  BUT what a book A totalitarian government where people are taught to be feelingless  heartless  devoid of the right to use their own brains has been a subject of many books now  The Giver  mention because I Just finished reading it  spoke about this and many other contemporary novels have adopted the idea  but none   i believe NO ONE of them spooked the bejeezus out of me like this one did  I grew to care about this character  I was almost happy about the way his life was panning out  But his defeat against the system depressed me to bits  as did the fact that  view spoiler   the one person he had trusted  broke him  And the one person he had loved betrayed him as he betrayed her  Not to mention the intense torture he went through    hide spoiler   This one  made me pull out my hair  upset me  Yes 1984 has long been gone  yes we have  precautionary  institutions that shall not let this become a reality  but the possibility of such a world ever existing is something that might give this girl a heart attack Of course  any one who reads a bit does perchance come to read this book and this review will just be lost in a sea of thousands  but I felt a dire need to say something about this and so I did  Also  stranger who is reading this  i d relish any and all book suggestions  Limitarse a considerar que este libro es una satira de la Rusia estalinista es no haber comprendido la novela  George Orwell s 1984 is a telling story about how the power of the state overcomes the inner power each individual holds  Individuality is crushed by The Party and the haunting image of Big Brother by taking away individual freedoms through hatred  terror  fear  and the destruction of love  peace  knowledge  and the natural connections that human beings have for one another  Any meaningful connection one human being has with another is never realized due to the scrutiny and harsh laws of The Party  A thought provoking read  this novel unveils how those in power exercise authority to the detriment of individualistic people  Those few who do not conform are broken into believing everything The Party wants them to believe  The minds of strong people such as Winston Smith and Julia are broken into dust  only to follow what The Party directs  The novel shows how people in power will manipulate others  destroy their beliefs  their knowledge  and ultimately the freedom to think for oneself  This is a brilliant story of how those who want to gain or remain in power try to brainwash those who defy their authority  P  269   We shall squeeze you empty  and then we shall fill you with ourselves   A must read for anyone to understand the deceptive  manipulative  and scrutinizing ways of those with authority  No one can tell you what you should think  otherwise they are trying to implement what they merely want you to think which enhances their control over your mind  The constant fear Winston has for the Thought Police  and his ultimate downfall makes this novel suspenseful and interesting until the very end  Having not really heard much about this book before buying it  I wasn t really sure what to expect   I had no idea that such a small book could have such a huge impact on me and that I would still think about it long after having read it  It s hard for me to describe the book without giving too much of it away  but suffice to say that it is very well written and hard to put down  Even though it s set in a dystopian world  it didn t make me feel bad  just a little depressed  Make sure you read the appendices  they will set the story in a new light One small annoyance  as I was close to finishing it I was watching some breakfast show and one of the presenters used 1984 as an example of something  spoiling the end for me  I was quite annoyed at the time but it was still a shock when I got to the end  Well  that was frightening Initial thoughts1  Seriously  It was scary  IngSoc  Big Brother  newspeak  the Ministry of Love  the Minsitry of Truth  room 101  EVERYTHING  SCARY  AHHH 2  Thought provoking  Even though I was extremely disturbed by this dystopian world  I thought it was a powerful  insightful observation and commentary on our soceity 3  Didn t like or was particularly attached to the characters  However  I did empathize with Winston A LOT towards the end of the book You can check out my video review here  l kh lkbr yrqbk   mrj   rwy  1984 ljwrj wrwylktb  wmrj

George Orwell  pseudonimo de Eric Arthur Blair   a par de Animal Farm   O Triunfo dos Porcos  ou  A Quinta dos Animais   titulo de uma reedicao recente da Antigona  O livro apresenta nos um mundo dividido em 3 super potencias  Oceania  Eurasia e Lestasia  O seu protagonista  Winston Smith  vive em Londres  que se encontra sob dominio da Oceania  A sociedade caracteriza se pela omnipresenca do Estado  personalizada na figura do Grande Irmao  Big Brother   que controla a vida dos elementos do Partido ao minimo detalhe  atraves dos telecras colocados por toda a parte  Winston Smith trabalha no Ministerio da Verdade e a sua funcao e alterar os arquivos historicos para que o Partido tenha sempre razao  Para alem da constante reformulacao do passado  somos tambem confrontados com o surgimento da Novilingua  que reformula ou elimina todas as palavras que impliquem o pensamento livre  a ideia era que se as palavras nao existissem  o que elas representavam tambem desaparecia O livro encontra se dividido em 3 partes  na primeira  somos confrontados com a descricao da sociedade perfeitamente controlada pelo Partido e com o aparecimento das sementes da revolta em Winston  na segunda parte  somos confrontados com o fruto dessa rebeldia  na terceira e ultima parte  as consequencias da mesma A primeira palavra que me ocorre para descrever este livro e  assustador  Trata se de uma especie de metafora para os regimes totalitarios que dominavam o mundo em meados do seculo XX  em especial o estalinismo   mas leva a premissa muito mais alem  O que pode a partida parecer uma sociedade inverosimil  transforma se  pela pena de George Orwell  numa coisa absolutamente real  Apesar de termos consciencia que estamos perante uma sociedade imaginada  a extrema habilidade do autor leva nos  a cada momento  a temer a ideia aterradora que ela algum dia possa vir a existir  O livro pinta um retrato muito negativo da natureza humana  mas tambem revela a espacos a importancia da liberdade e da opcao de escolha  O seu final  apesar de inesperado  pelo menos para mim   esta completamente de acordo com a visao do escritor e e  por isso  o final perfeito O livro e extremamente bem escrito  numa linguagem clara  e nem as partes mais descritivas alguma vez se tornam macadoras  O enredo e toda a imaginacao necessaria para o criar sao eximios  Resumindo numa palavra  genial  well this novel is a extraordinary one Orwell comes very close to the red lines with his philosophy  without touching any thing just he got his knife and cut off your heart I really got hurt by this one I like it and I guess I will read it more and more      wHd mn jml lrwyt lty qrthbkhtSr This book might start out a little bit slow dry  and might seem uninteresting  But a couple of chapters in and you will get hooked  This book will make you question everything you ever believed and thought of your government  it will send chills down your spine  And towards the end  YOU WILL FEEL GOOSEBUMPS FROM THE TWIST OF EVENTS     Scary stuff   The book  When basically stated  shows a totalitarian government at its worst  It teaches many lessons both philosophical and moral  It illustrates how the basic function of cognition or in other words  thinking  could be manipulated and distorted  The government uses wordings  naming of things in a way to alter the perceptions of its citizens  for ex   Victory gin    Big Brother    Ministry of Love  Peace etc   all these words bring a quasi feeling of prosperity  progress and superiority Other methods used to control its citizens include  1 Imaginary war or imaginary enemy  The Party bombs the proles and says its Eurasia   Proles look at the party as a protector  and remember  desperate times call for desperate measures  is what the party uses as an excuse   2  Erasing anything historical and killing the elderly  so the people won t have anything to compare their current society  living standard to  thus not realizing they are living like shit  3  the government uses war as an excuse to make people work hard  Keep them busy  produce more  and instead of distributing the products made  using the military and war needing supply excuse the party manages to keep the inner party members living in luxury and everyone else   not   4  The party takes away the pleasures of the citizens  ex  Sex is made into a disgusting thing  ppl don t have sex  unless want to have loveless brainwashed children who will snitch on their own parents    and throughout the book you could see how men are always twitching which is b c the are so suppressed etc    have so much energy    The party uses that energy to put the citizens  Not the proles  at work  5  The party destroys language since language forms thought    the party wants to control people s thoughts   Other methods are used such as constant surveillance and whatnot   But what really gave me the chills were the convincing distortions of rational thought and how different perspectives  Don t want to spoil  although clearly are false  could be believable  if you were living in oceania   if you were brainwashed by the party      The book has too many twists in it and deep thoughts  that I can t even start listing   Reading this you will start questioning your own morals  Is it okay to do bad for the greater good    Is it okay to do good for bad    confession is not betrayal    Would you kill to save a life    Would you demoralize to revive humanity      OKAY I M GONNA STOP HERE   JUST READ THE BOOK  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON MANY THINGS    Who Teaches You What You Mean  I am a poet and therefore obsess about language  How language is constructed and what those constructs mean and imply occupy a lot of my thinking  Because of this obsession  the novel 1984 strikes me as the greatest book written about the abuse of language  True  it is a novel about political power and oppression and is a warning of a kind to those of us who take a free society for granted  But the way that political power asserts itself is primarily through the power of language  The abuse of language in the novel comments inevitably on the right use of language and ultimately has something to say to the role of the poet in our world 1984 shows through a claustrophobic world of political oppression how the ability to articulate is controlled by the scope of our language  how we are always subject to the limitations of the language at our disposal  The whole point of Newspeak  the official language of the Party  is to reduce the available range of meaning and comprehension  to make it impossible for people to think something that is not approved by the doctrine of the Party  This language coupled with an endless rewriting of public records means both that it is impossible to know the truth about the past and that the individual is incapable of articulating the meaning of his individuality  Inevitably  the Party defines who and even what an individual is  In only the most limited sense does any individual exist in 1984   To contradict the impulsive thought that this is merely science fiction  something futuristic and beyond reality  one only has to look at a poem by George Oppen in which he shows us that it is something we battle every day  In  Of Being Numerous   a figure      wants to sayHis life is real No one can say whyIt is not easy to speakA ferocious mumbling  in publicOf rootless speechOppen here distills the competition between language used as a means of the most profound existential realization and language used as a means for commercial manipulation  When we acquire our language  our expressions  our definitions from corporations and the commercials they make  then the language we have for expressing our deepest feelings or insights  our ideas about who we are or want to be  is shaped by them  at least to the extent that they   excuse the word   repurpose language to manipulate us for quite specific ends and in so doing  distance us from other associations  One of the primary ways the Party in 1984 controlled language was to diminish the number of associations related to any given word  This was attained by various methods  But this same diminishment is  in Oppen s poem  what causes the man to be unable to find the words to express his inner being  the reality of his life  As I said in a previous essay about Oppen s poem   The man trying to speak the meaning of his life has no language to speak it  It is unreal because politics and public life have appropriated it for ends other than an existential dialogue   This is precisely what the Party in 1984 does Another of the methods for controlling thought through language is to reduce the number of words  The Party eliminated the word  bad   They used  instead   ungood   This sounds farfetched but even today it isn t uncommon to find an attitude of relying on a limited vocabulary for expression or assuming the superfluity of the abundant synonyms in English  However  in reality subtle denotative shades and deep connotations make words like  evil    miscreant  and  villainous   though synonyms  all different from each other  Additionally  meaning is not merely semantic or intellectual  but is also emotional  The many associations and feelings a word or series of words evokes make even the closest synonyms still different from each other  Then consider there are many words in foreign languages that signify feelings and thoughts for which there are no English equivalents  What do we do with those thoughts and feelings  To assume they will be expressed in some way in the existing language is to make a dangerous assumption  In fact  I would guess that most of those feelings and thoughts go unarticulated  because it takes more than an act of will to find the right words to give them shape  it takes knowledge and the willingness to take risks  to sound foolish or even crazy  But if  as Jefferson said   the price of freedom is eternal vigilance   this holds true also for safeguarding language and ensuring that its growth and change is for the expansion of articulation  thought and meaning Newspeak also attempts to reduce ambiguity  Here especially I see the playground of the poet because it is precisely at the edge of linguistic clarity that poets live and breathe  We have all had feelings we couldn t put into words or thoughts that we just couldn t express  That s because the range of human imagination and experience is greater than the range of our existing language and this is likely always to be so  That s why there will always be poets and other artists trying to give shape and articulation to those very feelings and thoughts  those human experiences that haven t come into the range of our history because we haven t been able to document them in any way  That s why poets are always toying with the obscure  not to be evasive or sound smart  but to get at something that s just out of reach  to extend the light of articulation just a little farther into the darkness  This is the worthiest use of language and one that opposes other uses such as TV and magazine ads  billboards  the news media  and all other forms of mass production or corporate manipulation  It is not a self righteous call to arms  it is simply the natural consequence of two opposing uses of language vying for control of a singular consciousness    The book 1984 follows a man by the name of Winston Smith in the particular year of  you guessed it  1984  As the book was written before the year 1984  it is a dystopian novel from the standpoint of someone who could imagine a totalitarianism future  And that s what exactly what Winston lives  every action  word  and thought is more or less recorded by the government  with the reminder that BIG BROTHER the heavily worshiped leader of Oceania  IS WATCHING YOU  Winston is completely against the society he lives in  He fills his life with forbidden things  like an intimate partner named Julia  a private room over an antique shop  and a diary  He and Julia join a rebellion against the Party  only to find that they had been tricked and are then arrested  They then are individually tortured  psychologically and physically  into devotion to the Party  eg  consciously doublethinking  loving Big Brother  not loving one another   In the end  they die loyal to the Party  which was exactly what was wanted all along This is a game  changing book  I have never read a story with the perspective that Orwell gave  It s commonly accepted to end a book with some sort of neutral or good moral  and it should be apparent now that that is not present here  It s almost backwards how the book is written  the way Winston under develops as a human being is like a reverse character arc  What I find the most interesting is that this story is not about itself  This isn t a book about Winston s last year alive  Winston is merely a plot device used to magnify the world George Orwell had imagined  One could even claim that it is not a story  but rather a recollection of a moment  and the real story is what can be uncovered from the bits of information given  Orwell paints a fantastic setting  which I believe is the real story  if that couldn t already be assumed  that many books since have tried to mimic  Maybe the scariest part is the audience involvement  in the sense that the reader is able to see how aspects of the book are in our daily lives  NSA  anyone    It is a perfect portrayal of different methods and sorts of power  I didn t realize how little I knew of the themes presented in this book until I had read it If you are someone who enjoys dystopias about revolution  this is a really good contrast in terms of realism  as 1984 is pretty much the opposite of revolution   I d say that anyone over the age of 12 would be able to grasp the concepts this book presents  and I really advise adults who are immersed in the  real world  to use this book to really shine a light on the one we live in now  This is a fantastic book that requires a lot of speculation  so be warned  It s worth it in the end   A gem from George Orwell I bought the book from my friend once i started it  From very beginning i know this going to be exciting  The book keeps you engaged or more than engaged through his various plots and characters and maintain it magnificently throughout   Winston smith   the protagonist is in search of the past tries to fight with his present in the fear of future  The dystopia created by George Orwell has created is haunting view of the world   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH keep the whole story intact and nobody can escape from the eyes of Big Brother This one should not be missed    2 2  4rwy  tuqr    thm tuqr  mn jdydyqr h wysTrh kl Zlm wZGy  dhlk l kh lkbyr ldhy yby  lwhm llns   whm lstqrr  w lnftH  w mHrb  lrhbhw mjrd str lHfn  mn

picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever  George Orwell  1984 1984 is a shattering and incredibly captivating novel George Orwell personally speaks to my soul  his writing deeply resonates with me and I could not get enough of 1984  The writing is beautifully simplistic yet subtly embellished The plot is rich and although the book is not as fast paced as modern dystopian novels  it did not fail to grab my attention  I absolutely love Orwell s writing  I found myself nodding in agreement while reading certain passages  I love the descriptions  the foreshadowing and symbolism is so cleverly done  the shattering of the paperweight is forever ingrained in my memory  I love the complexity of the concept of this book  and how it truly reflects Orwell s beliefs and thoughts about politics  I feel like I took away a lot of knowledge from reading this novel alongside some essays Orwell wrote that I am obsessed with  The characters were complex and vibrant  I felt that O Brien was such a powerful and intense character  I also love the novel s narrative  while I was reading I felt that the omnipresent narrator was Orwell himself This exceeded my expectations and I am so thrilled to read his other work 1984 is one of my favourite books of all time   including Animal Farm by George Orwell too    quotes and phrases are constantly reverberating in my ears  1984 is a very powerful novel and I feel privileged to have read yet another brilliant work of art by Orwell  I most definitely recommend this book   Freedom is Slavery  Two and Two make Five  God Is Power    still ringing in my ears   Well I can see what all the fuss was about  As much as I enjoyed it  I was taken aback at just how bleak it actually was  certainly much more so than I had anticipated With three parts to the novel  all of which paced differently  come together in a way that is cohesive  and conducive to any plot as misanthropic as this  Although it s my first time reading a Dystopian novel  I can say with relative certainty that this is the standard by which all others are judged  There s a number of existentialist ideas  and philosophies to be be recognised from reading this most notably Solipsism and Marxism in Part 3  not to mention the imagery in Orwells pros that pretty effortlessly translates his purportedly innate sensibility to semiotics  It s no wonder Nietzsche caught on the way he did Fantastic book  a must read in my opinion  Sil na knizhka  dumaiu kozhen povinen yiyi prochitati  shchob rozumiti tsinu svobodi  Tsinu iaku

delightfully working order in disorder  edged beautifully to accommodate a supremely intellectually challenging  thought  provoking read  1984  where Winston begins to question his place in the grand scheme of the world he knows  or to his knowledge he has been taught to know  he is controlled by pure  dictatorial  raw power  This future dystopia is something that is scary because it could be so real  A vision of world peace  love and utopia  Or the reality of a society based on farming the masses towards emotionless  mentally weak  blindingly  loyal abiding citizens of higher power authoritarian states discerning what you do  how you think and any actions you partake in  based on refraining you from any grasp on rebellion  impurity or ownership of any sort  which if even dreamt of  will result in indisputable death of your entire being through means of mental  physical and soul crushing torture in prisons  until guaranteed acknowledgement of your absolute inexistence  lack of free will of thinking and inexplicable ineptitude in governing any gram of control over anything in what little remains in your ultimately pitiful life  at all  Coincidentally  this book builds on thoughts I ve had already  only displays it in a much more darker  cruel  distastefully wicked future  A truly mind  sculpting read   Apologies if this made no sense  my brain is thinking too crazily at the minute   nhyh wq yh llqSh lm yqm lktb btGyr lmwzyn bTryqh mstfzh lwD  nhyh Hyth yksb fkr wnstwn  ly lshr Is it coincidental that I should be writing this review after the events of acquitting Mubarak and his associates of all charges  It probably is  1984 is definitely a masterpiece  a book that every single person should or rather must read  It is a political encyclopedia for when it comes to how to establish a dictatorship  with even the most vivid details  What strikes and scares me most about this book is that the future Orwell has written about is already here  bit by bit it is turning into a reality  And As long as the people are unaware  as long as ignorance and illiteracy prevail  there will be no change What I thought was most implemented in the real world was the symbolism of Big Brother  He is the face of the party  the face of the leadership  He might not even exist  it is the idea itself that is more powerful  The faces may change but what the face symbolizes and whatever ideology behind that face will never change  But there are other concepts and elements already implemented and manifested in many different countries of the world I fully agree with Orwell that the world of 1984 might really begin to manifest some time in the near future but I really hope that at some point it will all change  I really hope that the  proles  will rise up against leadership   If there is hope  it lies in the proles    The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake  We are not interested in the good of others  we are interested solely in power  pure power  What pure power means you will understand presently   Power is not a means  it is an end   One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship  You have been warned  If I were to meet George Orwell  I would probably give him a big  fat  wet  sloppy smooch on the cheek  and that s coming from a straight man    Seriously though  1984 was absolutely amazing  I have never read such a fascinating and authentic novel 1984 deals with a man named Winston who lives on Airstrip One of the continent of Oceania  Oceania encompasses the United Kingdom  North and South America  and all of the Atlantic Ocean  given its name   Oceania is at war with Eurasia  Eurasia is Europe  the Middle East  India  and part of Africa  Oceania s ally is Eastasia  Eastasia is China  Russia  Eastern Asia  and the other part of Africa  Oceania is a dystopian society with a totalitarian government  Citizen s every movements are heavily scrutinized by telesrceens  cameras and microphones  Their movements are not their own  The Party is what governs Oceania  with Big Brother at the head  Winston is a member of the Outer Party and works in the Ministry of Truth  or Minitru in Newspeak   Winston s life is no different than any other citizen in Oceania  despite the fact that his memory is still intact  He can remember what is was like before the Party came to power  However  he comes to a shocking realization when a girl named Julia hands him a slip of paper that reads  I love you   In addition  he comes into contact with a powerful member of the Inner Party named O Brien who tells him  We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness   Winston comes to learn the true power of fear and ultimate betrayal in this gripping dystopian story Are you ready for this  No  really  ARE YOU   Get ready  because this book is practically dripping with symbolism  connotations and other literary nuggets First off  1984 was written in 1948  When Orwell was thinking up a title for this book  he simply switched the last two numbers of the current year  This novel was actually Orwell s hypothesis of what the world would look like 40 years down the road  Although Orwell s Oceania seems like a far stretch from 2012 America  there are actually more similarities than you think  According to the novel  the Inner Party consists of 2  of Oceania s population  The Outer Party consists of about 10   The proles  88   According to recent statistics  the American elite consists of about 2  of the population  the middle class occupying a rough 12   and the lower class filling in the remaining 86   Dangerously close  eh  No  scary close is more like it Now we move to the monitoring of Oceania s citizens  How would you like to be under constant scrutinization and have your every move  thought  and sound recorded at every waking moment  It would be enough to drive you insane  wouldn t it  The Party does this in order to keep a watch on each individual at all times and looks for undesirable actions  Thus appeared the immensely popular tagline  BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  Having someone watching you at all times would cause paranoia and insanity  In effect  it would strip you of your humanity and reduce you to nothing more than a hollow shell doing what the government orders you to  In a sense  your life and movements would not be your own  Rather  you belong to the Party  This reminds me of the widespread Fascism that started in Nazi Germany in 1939  Fascism is strong devotion to one s country and placing everything  including family  business  and education  second  Germany embraced Fascism and proclaimed   You were born to die for Germany   That is pretty much what the Party has instilled  You are not a person  you are the Party  You may think to yourself   How crazy  Our government would never monitor me without my permission   Big Brother is indeed watching you  Many companies and organizations have special branches of security that monitor employees  e mail  internet usage and phone conversations  Plus  many of today s cell phones are embedded with a chip that is monitored by satellite and can be pinpointed  How would you like to know that someone could hack into your iPhone and be able to see through your front facing camera without you knowing it Almost always  those who set out to create a utopia usually end up creating a dystopia  Oceania is a dystopia  There is no society  there is only the Party  The Party has attempted to destroy individuality and humanity by erasing all traces of the past and controlling the future  The party plays on the present  claiming that there is no past  The Ministry of Truth  where Winston works  is dedicated to finding imperfections in newspapers  magazines  books  and other written materials and correcting them  This is the Party s attempt to be perfect and prophetic in the citizens  eyes  Such an appearance allows for the masses to trust them and embrace them  so that they may ultimately control them  Also  there is the new language known as Newspeak  Newspeak is meant to replace Oldspeak  or modern English   Newspeak s aim is dramatically cut down word usage  effectively limiting our range of language and eliminates personality  For example  Newspeak dictates that since the word good exists  there is no need for the word bad  To resolve this issue  they simply place the prefix un  in front of good  resulting in ungood  Newspeak brought forth the cornerstone of Oceanian society  doublethink  Doublethink allows a person to forgo logic and is able to understand paradoxes  The three slogans of the Party are  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  and IGNORANCE IS POWER  Let s look at these for a moment WAR IS PEACE  Clearly a paradox  However  you don t need doublethink to understand the Party s reasoning behind such a statement  Under what circumstance do a people truly become united  When they face a common enemy  By Oceania going to war  the citizens become caught up in wartime frenzy  According to Goldstein s book  there is an underlying curriculum  consumption of goods  During war  certain numbers of supplies must be shipped to the warfront  By engaging in war  the Party is able to eliminate any surplus of goods  Without a surplus amount of goods  the Party is able to create three distinct classes  the High  the Middle  and the Low  This class distinction helps keep the status quo  Think about it  whenever there is a surplus of goods  more goods become available to everyone  When everyone has access to the same thing  in a sense  everyone becomes equal  When everyone is equal  senses of individuality become apparent  This is fatal to the Party  so they must  go to war  to eliminate that possibility and keep the  peace  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  Another paradox  When you are free  you are able to choose for yourself and do whatever you want  Of course  such freedom enables you to pursue good ends  or bad ends  With freedom  there is no one to tell you not to job off that bridge or not to eat those poisonous foods  The Party uses this view to  enslave  the citizens of Oceania  playing that they will act as a  Big Brother  to the people and protect them from any harm  Only be becoming a slave can you ensure your safety IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  I love this paradox  I don t think it s good  but its good brain food  When I see this  I think of the Middle East or Communist Russia  Both governments attempt to stupefy the masses keeping them illiterate and uneducated  The goal  make the people so ignorant and passive that they won t realize right from wrong  With the people ignorant of the government s transgressions  they are free to gain all the power they want and commit every abomination they want  This is evident in the Middle East  Many countries there are forced to live under strict dictatorships because they aren t smart enough to think for themselves  They simply adapt to their surroundings and conform to survive  Such is the Party s cornerstone to power This novel is one of those novels that just keeps you thinking  My copy is full of notes and connotations that its value has most certainly decline  Throughout the whole novel  I kept seeing visions of Communist Russia  the Middle East  and even America  Big Brother s mustachioed face brings images of Joseph Stalin  The limiting of humanity and elimination of history are both equally horrifying and interesting  Although Orwell s vision of 1984 is vastly different then the real 1984  it could simply be a late vision of the near future  If you have kept up with recent records and events  our society is certainly headed down a road toward a place that could very well resemble Oceania  In a way  1984 serves as a warning that if we don t get ourselves into shape  we might just fall under the Party s spell and fall in love with  Big Brother   1984 has some very interesting depth and width to its pages  There were many chapters to which I had to read and reread to comprehend the politics  concepts and philosophy of the book  Yes  we can say this is yet another book on English Socialism run by an oligarchical dictatorship  but in this case it causes me to wonder to what point man gives up his freedoms  his will to the  greater good  of the State or Society  And as the Fox to the Crow   at what point do we finally realize that we no longer can fly because we have given our primary feathers to the Fox 1984 is an extreme version of Socialism  but gives me pause to evaluate our own society and those of other countries and compare and make judgment over the wealth happiness growth and well being of the individual State  There cannot be any right answer as each culture and individual is different in every way   yet arguably power is held among the select few in each country and how it is administered  whether by force or by the voice of the people The questions that each individual needs to ask oneself is this   Where is the balance of my freedom and happiness given to the laws of those that govern me   and  How much of that power ought I give to my rulers   No matter what civilization  the governed do have a choice of being ruled or governed simply by the masses of election or by revolution  Failure to do one or the other is simply an acceptance of that government 1984 is a great book to ponder on where one stands on his own freedoms and values  MARVELOUS  this is brilliant and im speechless i wasnt imagining to like 1984 better than animal farm but WOW this book is absolutely amazing  the society s description he does fits so so well back in 1949  when the book was first released  and now in 2k15 and that fact alone shocks me and even with his ups and downs  i liked Winston in general but the genius work comes with g  orwell s criticism of totalitarianism governments and how they control us  i thought the new language he created was the perfect way to demonstrate that control the thing that actually surprised me the most is that his writting style on this book is so easy to read and understand that you can forget about anything else while reading im thinking about doing a proper review on this because i simply cannot express my feelings without spoilers loli ultra super highly recommend 1984 for everyone that loves history  and political stuff and for those who doesn t at all because this book is just every good thing you can imagine in the world  lbd n tqr  wtqr  wtqr  wf  kl mr  stsh r nk tqr h llmr  l

young  and now that I ve reread it  i realize that the impact it made on me then is nothing to now  Our brains work differently when we age  and we interpret things differently  As a young person  it was a dystopian fantasy  something that made me aware of how a future like this could become real  but not really  The totalitarian ignorance was inconceivable  Now  with a better understanding of human behaviour and motives  it s chilling how very easily our society could actually allow itself to be run this way  It doesn t happen overnight  its the little steps we take every year that remove our freedom  our responsibility  and our drive to be better  I m now in the mood to reread Ayn Rand      Many people will say that it s an anti comunist novel  In fact  Orwell was an anti comunist  But I think that 1984  besides the clear reference to socialism  takes concern about the human being loosing his humanity  It s not even far to  democracies   like USA  By the way  USA government totally looks like Big Brother  and that s not a brand new criticism  I should recommend 1984 for everyone who have an open mind to absorb the socialism references and make your own judgment about humanity in the book and nowadays  great book for great minds  Otherwise  if you just like to hunt comunists  if you are that stupid people who claims against all social politics or say that capitalism is the best ever choice  well    Just look another rage book  because 1984 is more than a comunism hunt  It s a shame for literature that this kind of people use 1984 to be your political argument  This book made me pay attention to the intricacies of language  With a new tongue  Newspeak  the whole thought process could have been affected  As a reflection of the society  this book is very realistic  It is of course a depressing world  the imaginary world of 1984  and I was enjoying it when Winston was breaking the rules  The new kind of Politics in India  with every party having its propaganda machinery  photoshopping images and tweeting   the media sometimes twisting  sometimes blowing things out of proportion  makes this book strangely relevant  They all seem to be a part of the Ministry of Truth  It is a mercy that we have so many groups and parties in India that they balance each other out  more or less   but this book nevertheless makes one cautious as a citizen I would recommend this to anyone who is passionate about our democracy  to politicians and smart citizens alike  I don t know if this is considered a  classic  or not  but it s definitely one of those  books teachers make you read in school   Because of that  I went into this somewhat reluctantly  It s a book I ve always wanted to read  mostly because I just felt obligated to read  but I didn t think I d really enjoy it  I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it actually was  Maybe  enjoyable  is the wrong word  I mean  let s be honest  this is a pretty depressing  almost horrifying book  If you want something uplifting  don t read 1984  because you re probably going to walk away from it feeling pretty awful  But it was much easier to read and get absorbed in than I had expected  The characters are a bit bland  but I thought that actually fit very well considering the setting  The plot had little twists and turns that kept things interesting  but I think what really drew me in was just how thought provoking this book is  The world George Orwell has created definitely resonates with some of the things we see in our world today  and even though the year 1984 has come and gone  I think this is a book that will remain relevant for decades to come  Being a student of liberal arts  I had heard a lot about this novel and how it unmasks the workings of a totalitarian state  During the last few decades or so  we have seen the rise and demise of totalitarian and security states such as that of Soviet Union and then those totalitarian policies being implemented in the form of Patriot act and NSA in the United States of America after 9 11  So for me  a novel that was based on a dystopia found real relevance in the world that we are living in There were many point of contentions ii this novel  all of which were brilliantly portrayed  The one that attracted me the most was the whole idea of  double speak    believing in two contradictions at the same time  As the manifesto of The Party went in the novel   War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength The novel revolved around those aphorisms and after a point  finding the relevance of those aphorisms in our daily lives as a global citizen became sort of scary  So from the perspective of a totalitarian state  why war was peace  If we keep in mind the fact that George Orwell was a well known Marxist  then the explanation of that idea by the author makes a lot of sense  The surplus that is produced in any economy can be used to uplift the life standards of the proletarians or proles  as it is conveniently used by the author  But doing so would raise their intellectual ability and they would no longer accept the dictatorship of  The Party  or the nobility who are very few  They ll bring about a revolution which will bring chaos in a system that is so carefully and mercilessly being ordained by the party  So it is important to keep them busy and the best way to keep them busy is in war  War includes no construction so the surplus is not produced  rather destroyed  The same surplus that can be used to better the lives of those proles that make up 85 percent of the population  But that would of course  undermine the strength and power of the state  We find a chilling resemblance of that narrative with that of the military industrial complex of the United States of America which has spent trillions of dollars in the war against terror  half of half of which could have been sufficient to eradicate poverty from the entire world  So the utopia of a state fueled by the war as portrayed by George Orwell is materialized in today s world as the United States of America  The next notion   Freedom is slavery  indicates the idea that you can only be free if you are a slave to the state  Your state can use surveillance on each and every action of yours  restrict your movement and censor whatever it deems fit so that you can be free  The protagonist rebels against this notion by finding places where he can t be seen such as the room above the antique shop and the clearing in the forest  He rebels against this idea of lack of privacy  There is a certain kinship that exists between that protagonist and the people who denounced NSA when they found out about their illegal surveillance over the lives of other people  And of course  with Edward Snowden  The last tenet of the party manifested in multiple ways  The whole idea of double think  of believing in contradictions is the whole basis of the strength of that state  The ministries of love  peace and plenty were in fact the edifices of torture  war and scarcity  But a citizen had to believe in them or what the state told about them  If not  there always was a thought police that rounded up those heretics who denounced those institutions  even in their sub conscious and they were then brain washed before they were killed or released in the society  Another ignorance that the state used to propagate its influence over the minds of the people  especially children was its monopoly and the ability to change the past in text books  Children were taught to adore the big brother and the party and denounce the enemy with complete hatred  The same was accomplished by hate week  In my view  this was a brilliant critic on how nation states use jingoism and denouncing their enemies to create a negative identity  An identity that is based on who we are against and then the force of that identity is used to justify heavy military budget and bills such as patriot act  Another idea that I absolutely loved in this novel was the importance of knowing the authentic past  We all need to know the historical context in which our lives exist  We need to know the past in order to know the present  Unfortunately  the modern states mold the past  with the underlying idea that  He who controls the present  controls the past  and then that narrative is taught in public institutions  We have to see life in a continuum of thousands of years  before and after  in order to play a part in its authentic evolution  As Goethe said   He who cannot draw on three thousand yearsIs living from hand to mouth  If you enjoyed reading this book  I would not recommend watching the film  It does not do the darkness of Orwell s creation justice at all I felt tense  worried and fearful throughout this book  I thought it was absolutely brilliant Winston is a strong  but down trodden character whose spark is reignited through Julia  The society in which these characters live in is so oppressive and terrifyingly realistic  and the human emotion  love  attempts to challenge this  This story leaves you with questions long after you have finished reading it  Orwell is so clever  in his creation of such an extreme society he leaves nothing out It is exceptionally difficult to review 1984 as I still find it disturbing months on  However I would recommend it to anyone  just so that I can talk about  This past summer I fell in love with two men  Bob Dylan and George Orwell  This is why I fell in love with the latter It s been awhile  so I can t give a sufficient review on 1984  Maybe I will when I reread it   but just know that 1984 is beyond amazing  and you might have the incredible urge to dig up Orwell s grave and hug him after you finish it Or is it just me  George Orwell applied the past to the present in Animal Farm  and then four years later he applied it to the future in the subject of this review  1984  Both were heavily inspired by the Bolshevik revolution  but they differ in a few ways  Animal Farm is a  fairy story   it uses talking animals  It  truth be told  is not a very interesting read when considered independently from said revolution  Here s plot summary of it  without stopping to consider the revolution   Animals don t like their owner so they talk about him and then they overthrow him and then they are corrupted and it was just 200 pages of animals doing oddly specific things   The point I am making is that the book most easily compared with 1984 hardly stands as a book  Without researching  Animal Farm could just an odd experience  Its plot is too directly a mirror of the soviets  1984 explores more themes  completes the allegory just as well  and most importantly  stands as a book I read this book after reading Animal Farm and Fahrenheit 451  and read it because of purported similarities  as well recommendations   and I enjoyed it  I enjoyed the plot  I enjoyed the characters  I enjoyed the intricate language  I enjoyed them because they were fantastic  Somehow  though  they aren t what s most important in this book  I could write an essay simply on the thoughts raised by this book without mentioning the main character  Winston Smith  or any of the other characters  I could write about this book without mentioning that the language is beautiful  a citizen who succumbed to the propaganda of the government praises his country  to which Winston decides that  It was not the man s brain that was speaking  it was his larynx   pg  54   I could explain it without delving into the plot  I could skim over so much and still have so much to say  because Orwell leaves so much to think about If you don t know the gist of the book   then where have you been   it can be explained rather simply  a man named Winston lives in dystopian 1984 on an island called Airstrip One  renamed Great Britain  in a country called Oceania that produces endless propaganda  war  and famine  2  of the population are higher ups in the government  13  are lower down  Winston   and 85  are just about nowhere  starving and considered animals  Winston works for the Ministry of Truth  which deals in lies  When the government makes up a person to die a war hero in the interest of gaining loyalty  it Winston s job to go through records and creates evidence of them having existed  When two fake stories disagree with each other  Winston changes lies to reality so that the English Socialist or Ingsoc system doesn t appear flawed Winston knows what he s doing is wrong  Some of his co workers who do the same job believe that they re writing the truth and righting the wrongs  but he isn t fooled  He only does as he s told  If he is told 2 2 5  no matter how blatant a lie that is  he must either preach it or be called a thoughtcriminal  He hates the government  as do a few others  though they ve never shared that info with each other  disliking the government  if it is suspected of someone  means death  so confiding in anyone that he dislikes Ingsoc is practically asking for it  Big Brother  the icon supposed to be the leader of Ingsoc  is Stalin  he s Napoleon the pig  he s a concept  he may be real  he may be fiction So much goes on in 1984  I love it as a book  I love it as a warning  I recommend this book because of a fantastic story  fantastic writing style  fantastic supporting characters  and because of how relevant it is today  People describe the NSA as  Orwellian   Read 1984 to find out why  I leave you with a quote   Comrade Ogilvy  who had never existed in the present  now existed in the past  and when once the act of forgery was forgotten  he would exist just as authentically  and upon the same evidence  as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar   pg  50  After reference after reference to this book I finally broke down and read it  It was exactly what I expected  Not much in the way of character development  but that was not what this book was about  Everything you ve heard is true  It s more a prophesy warning than the great American Novel  So stop buying smart televisions and for the love of Christ  turn off the news  especially Fox   tHyty l  jwrj  wrwyl fkm hw ry   fy wSfh llthwr  wlslT  lHkm  wkm ttshbh l Swr  l

intensity of the dialogue  I have officially lost faith in humanity  1984 takes the idea of an arbitrarily repressive government to its ultimate form  and has the most uncompromising  bleak  depressing view of a possible future ever written  1984 boils down the principles of totalitarianism to information control   Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past  The Ministry of Truth has rewritten history and restricted even the English language  working to eliminate each word which could allow the expression of thoughts of rebellion or freedom  Even those in power have mastered the use of double think to allow the simultaneous cynical manipulation of others  and unquestioning belief in the principles of EngSoc The physical methods of control are not subtle  All members of the party are subjected to constant surveillance  and those who commit even small thought crimes are physically and mentally tortured until they love big brother in the Ministry of Love and are put to death  Perpetual  contrived war with the other two empires keeps the population in a whipped up frenzy of hate and patriotism  and excuses the persistent and arbitrary rationing and poverty Orwell has an incredible grasp of history and the methods used to repress and control populations  The positive influence of this book on the perception and practice of politics in the 20th Century can probably not be overstated  and even though the 20th Century dodged that bullet  this future is still possible  especially with the kinds of technology available today for surveillance and oppression   Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past  You need to be in the right mind to read this book  When I first tried to read it my head started swirling and I had to switch to a lighter book  but I came back to it later and was rewarded for my perseverance  1984 deserves the legendary status it has  My favorite part is excerpts from Emmanuel Goldstein s book  which  although only describes the world of the story more systematically and in more detail  is awesome nonetheless  What is more awesome is the concept of  doublethink   which means altering your mind to believe in something that is not true  while at the same time believing that the thing is true all along and has never been altered  But when deemed necessary  you can summon the altered memory and revert it to its natural state or alter it again to suit the desired purpose  Three words from me  WTF  mn lkhr rwyt jwrj wryl mn lHjt lly

favorite things about the book is that the interesting plot  setting and characters are all a kind of excuse to get people to read The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism  in which Orwell lays out the sad truth that humans have it within their power to use science and technology to give everyone a decent life  but largely fail to do so  He also throws in a clear explanation of the endless social class cycle  just as a nice bonus I think Orwell may have been somewhat irritated  had he lived  at how much attention has been payed to the aspects of the fictional totalitarian regime instead of his analysis of the ongoing reality of waste and evil  Or perhaps not  as he foresaw the reaction to his words  The programme it sets forth is nonsense  The secretaccumulation of knowledge  a gradual spread of enlightenment  ultimatelya proletarian rebellion  the overthrow of the Party  You foresaw yourselfthat that was what it would say  It is all nonsense  The proletarians willnever revolt  not in a thousand years or a million  They cannot  I donot have to tell you the reason  you know it already  If you have evercherished any dreams of violent insurrection  you must abandon them  Thereis no way in which the Party can be overthrown  The rule of the Party isforever  Make that the starting point of your thoughts    A must read  Cannot believe it took me so long to pick up this book Totally enthralling from start to finish  Mind blown  It was great to ready this immediately after having read Animal Farm  The two books compliment each other and made my experience very enjoyable  Incredibly relevant to my views on present society and government  Timeless piece of literature   No solo le dejo la maxima puntuacion  sino que ademas lo considerare a partir de ahora uno de mis favoritos  No tengo nada que criticarle  lo unico  deberia especificarse con claridad que tambien pertenece al genero de terror  ademas de ciencia ficcion  porque eso es lo que logra transmitir en cada pasaje de un modo brillante y sorprendentemente real  I decided to re read this book after first reading it in high school forever ago  I m glad it did  I see so many parallels between this book and modern society that it s scary  Rule through fear  ostracize the nonconformist   sound familiar  Orwell s 1984 is an important novel not so much because it is a brilliant and terrifying story  but because in visualising that dystopian future so vividly  Orwell gave us a language to deny it  Neologisms like  big brother    thoughtcrime  and  doublethink  have entered our vocabulary  and allow us to properly describe government and popular actions that threaten to take us down the road to 1984  It s proof that when an idea is given a human narrative  it gains an immense power to transform  Este  cu siguranta  una dintre cele mai bune carti citite de mine  Desi are o singura linie de subiect  cartea mi s a parut complexa  tocmai de asta ar fi indicat sa o recitesc  Imi plac

being a story  This is  while being a political in nature  the greatest horror story ever written  due to the simple fact that elements of the fictional society described in the books are reflected in real life  Throughout history  there have been examples that have illuminated the sheer brilliance of the book  be it the USSR under Stalin  or the current North Korean regime  they all show the quintessential characteristics of dystopia that Orwell foresaw in his writing  Nineteen Eighty Four is a modern classic literature  whose impact on the life and politics has arguably been the greatest  With introduction of many concepts into real life  such as doublespeak and thoughtcrime  the novel has defined the modern political thinking  creating what is called an Orwellian viewpoint  This is truly one of the books that can alter ones viewpoint on world and world politics   the ending of the book still sends shivers to me  when even the absolute truth can be distorted with enough torture and oppression  We may not have experienced  1984  in 1984  but it does not mean it may not happen in the future Freedom of thought must be continuously defended  Grande  como un sistema totalitario nos vigila  nos obliga  nos hace sus esclavos  nos tiene calladitos    cuanto vale el poder      Grande Orwell 1984 situa su accion en un Estado totalitario  Como explica O Brien  el astuto y misterioso miembro de la direccion del partido dominante  el poder es el valor absoluto y unico  para conquistarlo no hay nada en el mundo que no deba ser sacrificado y  una vez alcanzado  nada queda de importante en la vida a no ser la voluntad de conservarlo a cualquier precio  La vigilancia despiadada de este Superestado ha llegado a apoderarse de la vida y la conciencia de sus subditos  interviniendo incluso y sobre todo en las esferas mas intimas de los sentimientos humanos  Todo esta controlado por la sombria y omnipresente figura del Gran Hermano  el jefe que todo lo ve  todo lo escucha y todo lo dispone  Winston Smith  el protagonista  aparece inicialmente como simbolo de la rebelion contra este poder monstruoso  pero conforme el relato avanza queda cada vez mas atrapado por este engranaje  omnipresente y cruel  Un magnifico analisis del poder  Una de las novelas mas inquietantes y atractivas del siglo XX                                        These days the popular dystopias are written for teenagers  With the exception of Cormac McCarthy s The Road  the dystopias getting the most attention  and movie deals  are the likes of The Hunger Games and Divergent  These teen stories tend to focus much more on romance issues than they do on the larger social issues  Not that romance is irrelevant in a dystopia  but what should make it compelling is how such a romance is affected  or made dangerous by  the oppressive society the people live in  The Hunger Games only takes a shallow look at this  with poor Katniss moping over whether she should show more affection to Gale or Peeta  Despite being over 60 years old  George Orwell s 1984 manages to top the teen dystopias both in terms of social criticism and romance  It offers plenty of lessons not only for modern authors jumping into the genre  but also to modern society  as technology has advanced to the point of making Orwell s warnings come true Where Suzanne Collins chooses her heroine  Katniss Everdeen  to have extraordinary athletic ability and Legolas like skills with a bow and arrow  George Orwell provides his hero  Winston Smith  with varicose ulcers in his ankle  Winston has spent his adult life as a member of the Outer Party in London  in the nation of Oceania  which consists of the Americas and Britain  Under the watching eyes of Big Brother  Winston  like the rest of the party members  lives under constant fear that he will be accused of harboring thoughts against Big Brother  Telescreens keep an eye on citizens even in the comfort of their own homes  Thought Police detect rebellious thoughts by reading facial expressions  People often disappear without warning  Those who remain are left in terror Language itself has even undergone serious changes  This language is called Newspeak  Its purpose is to make speech more efficient by cutting out unnecessary words  Why have ten ways to say something is good when one will suffice  If you think your food is excellent  you would say it is plusgood or doubleplusgood  The purpose is to prevent thoughtcrime by eradicating the vocabulary required to think against the party  As one of the party mottoes goes   Ignorance is Strength   it is better that citizens are stupid in order that Big Brother stay in power  And as our government continues to make cuts to education spending  one must wonder whether some of our politicians haven t adopted this motto for themselvesWinston  as is required of heroes in the genre  despises the oppressive system he lives under  Nonetheless  he sees no choice but to continue to act as a tool of Big Brother in order to stay alive  He works in the Ministry of Truth  where  instead of truth  lies are told  And  ironically  Winston enjoys his work  He rewrites history to always make Big Brother look good  If Big Brother had made a prediction that turned out to be inaccurate  it s Winston s job to rewrite old articles so Big Brother was actually right  The ability to control history is a powerful one  One can turn the tide of opinion for or against a person by erasing a mistake or creating a narrative of horror  History  really  is only what is written and what is passed down  not what really happened  Nobody can go back and prove what really happened because the past no longer exists  It can easily be changed if everyone is convinced of an alternate version  Even in our internet era of surplus information  truth and fiction can easily become mixed up The novel s first third sets up much of the background on the society  It establishes characters  none of whom Winston is very close to  It s dangerous to be close friends with somebody because that person could just as easily turn you in  However  the novel turns to romance after the initial introductions  exciting romance because it is dangerous  It is also an adult romance  Winston and his love interest are physically attracted to one another  and they do more than just make out  Sex for pleasure is an act of rebellion in a world where scientists are working to abolish the orgasm  The portrayals of attraction in The Hunger Games are less realistic because they remove the element of sex  In its PG 13 world  the kiss is the major payoff  Humans have a biological need to act out on sexual urges  and in times of oppression that urge can become stronger because it is repressed While 1984 is certainly more for adults than The Hunger Games  it is  nonetheless  still widely taught in high schools  Part of me wonders whether its inclusion in the curriculum is due to a continuing influence of anti communist thought from the Cold War era  It has some important ideas to consider  to be sure  and is very imaginative and frightening  but at the same time it s not particularly great writing  Orwell spends large chunks of time wading through dull ideology  much of it anti communist  particularly as we read the sections from the book of Emanuel Goldstein  the leader of the rebellion against Big Brother  If Orwell had reduced or removed a lot of these passages  the book would be vastly improved  I m also concerned by the way the book is taught in schools  It seems less importance is placed on the ideas in the book and more on minute details  When a test question asks how old Winston and Julia are  our literature education is sadly missing the mark 1984 truly stands out in its feeling of hopelessness  In this world created by atomic destruction  power was taken by those who most wanted to hold onto it  at any cost  There s a sense that this lone man  Winston  can do nothing against such a power as Big Brother and the Thought Police  The reader has hope  to be sure  that he can  There s a belief that he can  Our culture perceives that the hero always wins  In movies  in books  in video games  the good guy wins the day  no matter how grim the situation  That s why 1984 is so terrifying  The best hero it can come up with is a man with varicose ulcers in his vein  As it begins to hurtle towards its conclusion the terror grows greater  While I do have some misgivings about the book in some ways  I can t help but admire the way Orwell mercilessly crushes our hopes  If society does go the way of 1984  a big  if   admittedly   there s no guarantee somebody will be able rise up and do the right thing  That s what s frightening  The heroism of the individual is merely a myth   1984 rwy  fyh bd  fy tkhyl Hl  stbdd wdykttwry  wl nsny  l qS  lHdwd lm  twq   n l ql lbshry ymkn  n ywSl ltkhylh lTrq llst mr wltHkm bHy  lns lhdhh ldrj  rwy  ky yb    tqd  n ldwl  lty ftrDh

was blown away  exhausted  depressed after reading this I have heard of many orwellian topics from the book but have never read it  Did not know what to expect and I was surprised with the ending I noted 80 percent of the pages i could draw direct parallelism to what is happening today Stage 1 complete   Lack of critical thought in place Edit anyone regardless of political affiliation thinks free thought is not be censored in america  needs to watch the totalitarian expose by Jon Stossel that just aired tonight  http   watchdog org 242019 john doe f   I suppose if there is one fault  it could have been longer https   i gr assets com images S phot    Chilling and  strangely  still very relavent  1984 is the most terrifying book that I have ever read  and perhaps the best and most thought provoking novel I will read in my life I didn t know what to expect  and I certainly did not know how to approach the book  Should I set my mind as if I was reading the book in 1949 looking into the future  or should I set my mind in the present day looking back to a man writing a book in 1949 about the future  To a certain existent I needn t have bothered  as it was clear that despite the title  1984  it was not important what year it was  as this was a nightmare not a year  a nightmare which succeeded in its function to terrify me In 1949 World War 2 had just left its ugly mark on the world  and the cold war had two nuclear superpowers on edge  This undoubtedly led George Orwell to his nightmarish vision of the future  less so a foreseeing more a warning  The scenario is so well thought out by Orwell  that you are in this nightmare together with the main character  Winston Smith   and it s hard not to actually put yourself in the actual shoes of Winston  It is that that makes the story a nightmare  especially the ending  You want Winston to succeed  you want the story to progress with the ultimate downfall of big brother but       no spoilers  I hate reviews with spoilers I both love and hate this book  which is hard to explain as I rate this book 10 10 and would recommend it to all  doublethink indeed 10 10JV Well what I am about to write is not really a review  I don t know what can it be called I am just disappointed by how the book ended  maybe it is realistic or maybe not I imagined that Winston would eventually show any sign that he is still sane  2 2 4   I thought that the book would end by Winston solving the chess challenge with the black rocks winning and thus challenging the authority and control of the party I refuse to believe that an individual will throw away his sanity  I strongly believe that any individual is willing to pay the highest price whatever it was in order to defend his freedom  sanity and principals    If I were is Winston s place  I have two options 1  Insist on 2 2 4  even if it kills me  I will allow the rats to eat me alive  I will keep on arguing  Life is worthless  life is not worth losing your sanity or losing your freedom 2  Act stupid  behave stupid  obey  and then break free and try to conspire against the party all over again I am not currently being tortured and accordingly I am not sure if those two options are realistic in Winston s case I feel like I am William Wallace  but this is genuinely how I feel  Utterly mind numbing  I will reference this book for the rest of my life Amazing  Just amazing  This book has stuck with me since the day I first picked it up   Amazing that this was written almost 70 years ago  Definitely the forefather of nearly ALL the dystopian fiction out there today  Orwell really had incredible foresight about how the world would become  even now in the news we are fed only what  Big Brother  wants us to believe   This was a book that I have been meaning to read for years  but somehow just missed  1984 was scary from the first to last sentence  I found it amazing that George Orwell was able to create a believable society   culture  politics  ideology and even language  The characters were hard to sympathize with and feel empathy for   I didn t feel they had much depth  which could have been how Orwell intended them   but even so  I felt afraid for both Winston and Julia when the telescreen repeats  you are dead    War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength    2   2   5    WAR IS PEACE   FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  These words are immensely powerful  one have to read the book to know why   and will remember it for rest of my life      Much better than  Congress ka haath  Apke saath   P This book is so intense that one would feel an instant hate and fear against the all communist parties ever existed on the face of the earth       atleast i felt so   Though his predictions didn t come true   but one cld see glimpses of such terror in countries such as North Korea       It was possible  no doubt  to imagine a society in which wealth  in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed  while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste  But in practice such a society could not remain stable    George OrwellI wonder what the communist parties have to say abt dis         Anywayzz overall a good book and everyone must read dis atleast once      George Orwell s 1984 is a literary political fiction and dystopian science fiction in which such things as full dictatorship  mass surveillance of the population  never ending war take place  It s nearly unbelievable how the work itself is almost like a foreseeing of some of our present s events such as the constant war between countries and the fact that governments gather more and more information about the population of Earth to fight against terrorism  The total control of the flow of information  the demagogy and the oppression of the people is clearly visible in the slogans of the Ministry of Truth or  Minitrue    War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  and Ignorance is Strength   This is the place where Winston Smith works  which is one of the four governmental ministries in Oceania  They change the historical records here to become the same with what the Big Brother says  The novel inspired many writers and works and in 1984  Orwell invented dozens of terms  which we use in our everyday life such as 2 2 5  Big Brother  doublethink  thoughtcrime  etc  We also use the word  Orwellian  if a current situation or an act of a company reminds me of what we can read in this book  What Winston would like to achieve and feel in 1984 is perfectly told in one of his sentences   Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four  If that is granted  all else follows  1984 will definitely make you think for days if not weeks about the similarities between the events of the book and real life and the brilliance of Orwell s predictions about what the world can become  Antligen har jag last denna klassiker och sa obehaglig den var sedan  Det kandes verkligen som om Storebror sag en medan man laste 1984  Det gick aldrig att riktigt slappa Jag fangades direkt av handlingen och huvudkaraktaren Winston  Orwell har verkligen lyckats med att skapa den ratta kanslan av att det ar en dystopisk utopi  For karaktarerna ar samhallet en utopi  det perfekta samhallet  men for lasaren ar det den hemskaste dystopin  Vi ser hur hjarntvattade alla ar men kan inte gora nagot at det  Det ar sa har som dystopier ska vara  tycker jag  Det ar sadana har romaner som satter sig pa hjarnan och sadant som man sent kommer att glomma Trots att Winston inte ar sarskilt trevlig ar det latt att gilla honom  Jag tror i alla fall att det ar meningen att man ska gilla honom  Det ar genom honom vi uppfattar handlingen och det ar ocksa han som star for var individualitet och var ratt till att valja sjalv  Han ar en intelligent karaktar och klarar av att diskutera och analysera Storebrors handlingar genom romanen  Han ar daremot rejalt paranoid och impulsiv vilket forsatter honom i flera jobbiga situationer i romanen Romanen haller oss pa tarna och tar flera dramatiska vandningar  Som lasare kan man aldrig vara riktigt lugn for da det ar alltid da man slappnar av som det sker nagot livsavgorande for nagon av karaktarerna  Det skedde en rejal plot twist pa slutet som jag vet att jag borde ha vantat mig men som anda kom som en overraskning Det var en klassiker vard namnet som jag verkligen kan rekommendera  Det ar en roman som alla borde kunna gilla  Terrifying  It s amazing and horrifying how malleable the human mind can be  The society outlined in this book has happened  is happening  and will always happen as long as there are people on this earth who are obsessed with power and control over the masses  In fact  our minds are easily washed just by our own media and even the people we interact with  Thought provoking  isn t it  Despite the book s negative ending  I firmly believe that love will always prevail   even though the cost is high  This is just about my all time favorite book  for many very odd reasons  one   I read it when I was nine  Okay  that s exaggerating  I was probably at least eleven  but in any case I was very young and just absolutely devoured this concept of controlling the past and living in an endless present  Sex as an uncontrollable instinct that could be twisted and diverted was also an image that stuck with me   I m a recovering Catholic  it was bound to happen  I think at that age though the idea that really stuck with me was Newspeak  At first it was fascinating to embrace the concept as a math problem   how many words could you really eliminate by using suffixes and prefixes    then it occurred to me how utterly fascinating that was  to control people s ability to think and imagine by literally destroying the words necessary to do so  I grew up a very prudish convservative child  and this brilliant book about totalitarianism broke my brain and made me the wonderfully liberal freak that I am today  I feel that i have no right to judge this book     But the only thing i can say is that besides the greatness its influences are everywhere   Remarkable  ktb ywD  fy rf mkhtlf  n bqy  lktb ktb

kai kathelotiko  eidika apo te mese kai meta       I have nothing to say but to acknowledge the sheer brilliance of this classic  This is my first book  definitely  not my last  by George Orwell  and I find that his writing is just amazing The dystopian world that he created was incredibly intricate especially its language  Newspeak  I found it clever and how much sense it made to build a society who thinks the way you want them to by inventing a new language system  Like  how can you think of something if you have no way of describing or defining it The world in 1984 was also scary and terrifying if you actually think about it  When you try to draw comparisons with the world we are living in today  the similiarities are definitely there  although very subtle  Although one of the things I felt to be a little extreme was the constant alteration of history  It a little crazy and hard to swallow  then again the whole Big Brother was crazy and that was what made it so interesting The ending was justified  in my opinion  In the end  we really are just pawns to the higher ups no matter how much we try to rebel  I am glad I read this as it had opened my mind and made me think

t TRY  This book  through all of its politics and frustrating elements of the future  was a great read  Although I was forced to read it through curriculum I would have enjoyed reading it on my own  Published in the 50 s  George Orwell creates a futuristic version of a place where the people are controlled fully by the government  Winston Smith is just another person in the world  working on a less than fair wage  eating food that can only fulfill one for a short time  drinking bad liquor and hoping to survive  Here  you cannot have absurd thoughts because Big Brother is always watching

not mad  I don t think that anything captures the spirit of the book better than the above quote  Orwell manages to convey the depressing atmosphere of the infamous totalitarian regime perfectly  In this world  even the most menial day to day experience becomes a tragic struggle   1984 is a shocking description of what life would be like under the complete control of the government  Its audacious amount of gritty detail proves Orwell s strength in his beliefs as he pleads with society to see the cons of large government  Though I wouldn t say I enjoyed the novel  I am happy that I ve read it  Orwell clearly states his message  and the first read is all it really takes for an audience to understand  I would not read it again  but I would suggest that others read it at least once   ndm bd t

explains to readers that just because you believe something to be true  that doesn t necessarily make it so  It changed my ideas of knowledge and challenged me to constantly ask myself what I actually know  The answer is very little  Some may debate whether this is a good or bad thing  but the ability to question everything  to research all  to revise your beliefs  to study and research and confirm what you think you know  is the entire point of this book  This book also raises valid and interesting points on media control  police state  surveillance  autocratic governments and class division  Overall  a thought provoking  culturally important piece  albeit confusing at times   Ne desem ne yazsam pek bilemedim  Soyle ozetleyebilirim belki   Savas baristir  Ozgurluk koleliktir  Cahillik

from Orwell  I attempted in vain several time when trying to get one in Vietnam  just to grab it nearly a year later when stumbling on a cramped corner of secondhand books in Harvard Bookstore  The version was quite old and tore and rather yellowish  but I like old books slightly more than those new   D   which I then gave up to one of my closest friends as a gift from US  Some months later  finally I got the firm hold by some book vouchers in Kinokunya  Singapore     Okay I am such a miserably poor undergrad  Now I can tell you 1984 gave me that first kinda funny journey to officially call it mine  DYet apparently my reading progress was sluggish like it may take forever  The whole part One appeared boring to me  which made me put the book down many times and pick it up again some weeks later  maybe it s because I had faintly known what to expect from the Ingsoc society  or because the author was indeed trying to paint a grey and dull picture  and he succeeded very much   But starting from Julia s appearance and then official position of O Brien  I can t stop devouring  The society s scenario with countlessly mysterious ways citizens are helplessly  unknowingly manipulated and suffocated stirs up inside the fear that one day technology together with cold blood of politicians and power will take us to that end  The nauseating  malignant indifference between people and people was portrayed blatantly and so convincingly that I tempted to think it had to happen somewhere  or it is just about to happen  And the last man of  Winston s kind   as O Brien put it  who was twisted  tortured  even brain washed was after all a skeleton hopelessly clinging in the verge of extinction  The ending still remains hauntingly unchanged  Even up until the bloody interrogation of O Brien  I had the inexplicable hope that O Brien was still in the side of the right  of 2 2 4  of Goldstein  At least he was co author of The Book  The hope was yet  fading  Another stunning point  maybe I am reinstating  is that the whole story stayed strikingly real and vivid  In each O Brien s conclusion  persuasion  threat  admonishment  I just can foolishly and feebly defend  Maybe I am too frivolous to take them all in  but I am telling you the truth  There was one sentence  roughly   What do men can really perceive from outside  saving through his own mind   sorry I m not able to find the quote now   And the meaning is still now hovering over my head  Anyway  I humbly admit I don t have much knowledge to interpret this whole story  and I believe that there is much much much more behind every words and details I overlooked  I am still thinking what the  greatest secret  is when Winston just put The Book down   As I am not lucky enough to be taught this novel when I was in school  hope I can find sometimes to see other reviews to learn more  and furnish this review very soon     Religion and politics are always appealing Last note  I may not get this whole things up my mind if I kept delaying my reading  Sometimes you will be  positively  amazed by what was waiting in the end  Keep going   This review is going to be extremely inadequate  no matter what  The fictional depiction of life in a dystopian society in this book is terrifyingly amazing  Lose yourself in this world created by George Orwell but not too much  it will give you the chills  Apart from the horror factor  this book should prove to be your Achille s heel if you love conspiracy theories  Human brain and nature have been stretched to their limit in Oceanic Society  It definitely nudges the reader to think about the world he lives in and that our lives are not simply for ourselves to live but also for co existing with other human beings In short  the 5 stars rarely awarded by me should speak louder than my review  Een bijzondere leeservaring om 1984 na meer dan dertig jaar te herlezen  Ik was vergeten hoe beklemmend dit boek is  Of misschien vind ik het nu veel meer beangstigend omdat ik steeds aan het huidige Noord Korea  maar vooral aan Cambodja onder Pol Pot moest denken  Het streven van Big Brother en de partij top om het individu tot in het diepst van zijn gedachten en gevoelens af te breken  is wel degelijk uitgeprobeerd in een nog niet zo lang vervlogen verleden  Pol Pot was dat in grote mate gelukt  Hij was een waarachtige Big Brother  die miljoenen mensen de dood in dreef door marteling en uithongering in zijn poging om de geest en levensomstandigheden van de bevolking van Cambodja naar zijn ideaalbeeld om te vormen  1984 is in heldere en duidelijke taal geschreven  Zo knap hoe Orwell de macht van Big Brother kan illustreren door te beschrijven hoe woorden  die abstracties als liefde  verzet  vreugde uitdrukken  uit de taal worden verwijderd  zodat men in de toekomst ook niet meer weet wat die begrippen inhouden  Dat is absolute macht  Ik hoop op een tijd dat 1984 een curiositeit uit het verleden is geworden  Helaas kunnen we dat nu nog niet zeggen   I think you have to be a certain age       or least have a certain amount of life experiences to really feel this book  I for one didn t get it at all when we were going over in school  But the post college struggle to start a career and make enough to live off of really put in the right frame of mind to relate the to the main character  This is another one of those books that changes the way you see everything in the world   hopelessness     Este e um dos meus livros preferidos  Vemos o mundo atraves dos olhos de Winston Smith  enquanto o autor nos descreve o partido totalitario que governa 1 3 do mundo e a maneira como a personagem principal se vai apercebendo de todas as tecnicas de controlo usadas pelo Partido  Separado em 3 partes  1984 e uma mistura entre um romance e um ensaio  sendo a primeira parte introdutoria  a segunda e a terceira com mais teorias e mais densas  O fim do livro nao e bonito  sendo dos mais tristes que ja li  Mas finais bonitos nao era o que o autor queria  alias  a historia parece que esta em segundo plano  em relacao a parte ensaio do livro  e e essa parte que assusta  pois apos se ler este livro  ninguem fica o mesmo  olhamos para o nosso mundo de maneira diferente e pessoalmente  fiquei com medo que algum dia o que esta escrito no livro possa vir a acontecer  que algum Big Brother possa estar ou vir a estar a olhar para mim  WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  Para leer la resena completa visita mi blog Perspecteva1984 es un libro que deberia ser de obligatoria lectura  En el se describe una sociedad sujeta al control absoluto de un partido politico socialista  que ha tergiversado su aparente proposito inicial de mejorar la vida de los pobladores hasta convertirlo en una dictadura ferrea donde la realidad se dibuja y se vive en funcion de lo que cree el Partido   En cierto sentido  la vision del mundo que tenia el Partido se imponia con exito a gente incapaz de entenderla   Orwell ha descrito un mundo distopico en el que existen tres superestados  Esteasia  Eurasia y Oceania  formados por la agrupacion de varios paises  sin consideraciones continentales   y que se mantienen aislados entre si  A pesar de ello  funcionan de la misma manera  tienen sistemas politicos totalitarios  controlan la vida y los pensamientos de los ciudadanos  y se enfrentan a una guerra constante entre si  El ambiente belico  la escasez de recursos  el aislamiento y el poco valor que tiene la vida hacen que los pobladores de los superestados dependan sin miramientos de sus gobernantes  considerandoles sus salvadores La historia se desarrolla en un Londres muy distinto al que conocemos hoy dia  El protagonista  Winston  trabaja para el Departamento de Archivos del Ministerio de la Verdad adecuando documentos  registros  publicaciones  y cualquier cosa escrita en el pasado a lo que dice actualmente el Partido  la intencion es que la realidad actual que describe el Partido sea la unica verdad existente    Quien controla el pasado  decia el Partido  controla el futuro  Quien controla el presente controla el pasado  Sin embargo  desde la primera pagina se descubre que Winston esta en conflicto  Cada vez mas le asaltan los recuerdos de una infancia junto a su familia en mundo funcional  libre y sustancialmente diferente al que conoce hoy  No esta seguro si se trata de recuerdos o imaginaciones suyas  e intenta por distintos medios corroborar lo que su mente sabe  Pero no se detiene alli  su creciente frustracion y convencimiento de que el Partido es el culpable de la vida miserable que tienen le hacen acometer pequenas y peligrosas acciones  rebeldes   que de ser descubiertas podrian costarle la vida  Asi  comienza a escribir un diario en el que registra sus dudas  pensamientos y sentimientos en contra del Partido  mantiene una relacion clandestina con Julia y entra en contacto con O Brien  un miembro del Partido Interior  grupo social mas alto  privilegiado y con poder de decision  el mas cercado al Hermano Mayor y al Partido  que Winston cree que pertenece a la Hermandad  movimiento social que se opone al Partido y que es perseguido  condenado y repudiado por la mayoria de la poblacion Como era de esperarse  en un mundo donde se controlan hasta los pensamientos de las personas  estas acciones no podian pasar desapercibidas por el gobierno  Winston fue  progresivamente  cayendo en la telarana montada por el Partido para conocer sus verdaderos sentimientos hacia ellos  y de esta manera tener argumentos con los cuales quebrarle psicologicamente cuando le atrapasen  Hacia el final del libro nos encontramos a un protagonista que ha pasado de ser un ser humano con criterio  aspiraciones y deseo de superacion  que cuestiona el status quo y desea cambiar su realidad  a una persona que ha perdido la chispa  parecido a un espectro  cuya existencia se debe a la naturaleza de supervivencia que todos tenemos  por lo que sigue respirando  comiendo y desplazandose  Winston termina convencido de su error  y con la certeza de que el Partido siempre gana  y que siempre ha debido y debe ser asi   A tight schedule  although I managed to finish this book within a week  here week ends in sunday smile emoticon  You dont need any adjectives compliments for classics like this  Being too good is their inherent feature Form what I could perceive  1984 is a more comprehensive  more elaborative and more philosophical  but less satirical version  of his other one  Animal Farm   Unlike animal characters and farm here he builds a fiction of future 1984  where world is divided into 3 superstates and are in continuous war with each other  War is peaceFreedom is slaveryIgnorance is strength George Orwell imagines a world where people are ruled by a single party for whom they work and get feed instead  A restricted world where people get thoughts and ideas implemented on them by party and any alternative thought is  thoughtcrime   Every word party speaks is a fact and rest is false  Anybody against this belief is vapourised Story revolves around a character in this scenario 1984 is basically alternative ideologial  negative utopiasm type essay fiction where writer repeatedly focus on theory  opposite to communism or socialism  to say creating a world without class or hierarchy is literally impossible It is a good horror novel with writers  doubleplusgood  skill to express political ideology by a way of excellent fiction A must read for people who have interest in sociology and political ideology  1984  by George Orwell is an incredible novel illustrating the effects that unchecked power can have on a world  When an authority controls all aspects of life by degrading basic human values  family  relationships  learning from the past  it can influence anybody no matter how resistant  Orwell uses the character of Winston to explain this predicament by making the reader understand his emotions  He lived a dull sorrow without a family  after his mother and sister disappeared  or love  yet only now does he realize the lies he has been fed  His path towards realization and rebellion slowly reveals the immense power that  Big Brother  and the  Inner Party  hold over Oceania  This ties back to the idea that  Who controls the past controls the future   No matter how sure an individual may be that his government is lying and abusing power  he cannot prove them wrong when they control all sources of information  Winston s hopelessness in the  Ministry of Love  is a key factor in illustrating how doomed humanity is if we allow such a government to prosper  Orwell s story serves as not only a warning but an insight into our own humanity  If what makes us human  on a philosophical level  is our values that we hold ever so close  then their elimination would leave just the shell of what once was    a programmable puppet that is unable to comprehend anything that defies the will of authority  Big Brother  Everything on Earth in 1984 is a ploy to keep nations in a constant state of fear and vulnerability without an end in sight  The novel claims that even if 2 3 nations ally themselves against the third  the lone nation could still not be beaten  This is similar to Goldstein s book and the  Brotherhood  because their existence only serves to weed out the traitors and anger the patriotic citizens  The novel in such a deeply thought out universe that it does not seem completely unreasonable to believe that a similar situation could occur in the future  and for that reason 1984 by George Orwell deserves 5 stars  With no doubt  George Orwell s 1984 is one my greatest influences as a writer  In my humble opinion  this is Orwell s masterpiece and a true landmark in world literature  A good book  but not a happy one  It s very thought provoking and makes you analyze everything in society now   What I like the best about 1984 was how realistic it is  In modern distopian books  the protagonist has either some unordinary super power or manages to save the world of the government s exploitations  But in 1984  the main charcter is just an ordinary man  He is middle aged   somewhat  overwight  and has a vericose veins  He isn t an obvious threat or even an obvous main character  It s not so much that he is a relatable level  I cannot relate to him very much   but that his flaws automatically set him up for failure  It s inevitable  which is real  Failure is imminent  Which leads to the plot twist at the end  The realness of the human spirit also made this book so wonderful  He finds love in a fellow rebel  Love isn t evem allowed making them rebellious in every sense  The fact that the romance isn t dramatized or romanticized is a whole concept foreign to modern distopians  While Winston and Julia relish in each other s company  they do not truely love each other  In the end  the human drive to live takes over  They chose to surivive than die for each other something that would never happen in a modern distopian  The ending of 1984 is what separates it completely from the other s of it s genre  Orwell ends the book with the protagonist falling into the graps of Big Brother  He does not win  he is no longer an individual  He is a product of society he dies loving Big Brother  He has fallen victim to the thing that he strived to detroy  What cause he was once willing to die for  he died in spite of  The eighties were effed up not only reading it    i m studying it from A to Z   so excited    very strong book  very dramatic  i believed the main hero will finally crush the system  let people free  but he failed and became part of the system i would recommend it to anyone  it is not like an american movie where good fellas kill bad fellas  it is a dystopia in the end the party and system make Winston betray his lover Julia  both physically and mentally  when they meet again   they have no feelings  they hate each other the system not only crushes your body  it crushes your soul  this is the hardest realization  it also has lots of philosophical claims on politics and nature of power 5 5 now i know why this read is recommended  Nothing has scared me more in literature than part 3 of 1984  Absolutely creepy     nthyt mn qr  rwy  jwrj  wrwyl 1984 w lty stnqsh lywm fy lq ndy lktb t ty hdhh lqr  lthny  bllG  l rby  w yfSlh m l yql  n 15

found out I was reading 1984 she made a comment that  Orwell always was a bit of a pessimist  Though this seems quite a stark description it is really quite accurate  It was written in the 1940s when 1984 seemed like the distant future so reading it in the 21st century runs the risk of completely destroying any suspension of disbelief  but  fortunately  this isn t the case  Though knowing any chance of the constant world wide war mentioned has no chance of happening anymore is re assuring  but Orwell creates a dystopian world quite different from our own  Though it is set in the  for want of a better term  future  it is not futuristic in the way of other sci fi s flying cars and space travel  it is more that society as we know it has been torn apart  It is written from the view of Winston Smith who works in the Ministry of Truth  which ironically writes propaganda and changes past records to suit them  in London  on Airstrip One in Oceania  Oceania is at war with  Eurasia  but Winston thinks that they were once at war with  Eastasia  and at peace with Eurasia  it is hard to say much more without giving things away  but in short Winston doubts his whole society and life It is indisputable that Orwell has had a massive impact on our modern lives  this is widely regarded to be one of his greatest works  written only years before his death and coining several terms  for example the enigmatic  Big Brother  and terrifying  Room 101  So to sum up  1984 is one of those books that everyone should read  it was made 13th in the list of 100 best British works by the Modern Library in 1998  even if it can almost completely destroy all your faith in civilization  Since it is a prized classic of literature  the moment I saw it in HMV for PS2 99  I had to get it  What is quite terrifying  despite being written in 1948  is that some of the issues in Winston Smith s world are happening now The year is 1984  Winston Smith works in the record department  a branch of the Ministry of Truth  In this world  everything you do is observed and controlled by Big Brother  Telescreens listen to your conversations  love is an emotion that is being stomped out and the very idea of the past being set in stone is a lie Like I said  this is happening now  which is shocking and really brings this book to heart  You have need to read this book   1984     rwy  mr b  mndh n nthyt

lh khDw  tm  1984 is truly one of the greatest books of all time  The story is particularly intriguing and the characters are three dimensional each with their own problems and own thoughts  The world feels like it is real and not written in a literature book  Winston Smith is the protagonist who is against the corrupt government along with his lover Julia  After meeting a man who is supposedly a member of a rebellion they become a part of it  What they do not know is that everything is set up  George Orwell makes you believe in the second part of the book that there is going to be a rebellion but it is all merely an illusion  Everything is great but the ending is simply breathtaking  perfectly written and chilling one of the greatest endings of all time  No other ending would be deserving of 1984  one of the best books ever written  Still remains one of my favorite pieces of literature  I love it more and more the more I teach it  and I am always finding examples of Orwell s predictions in today s society  If this book was ever relevant  today is the day  It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen That is the opening line of 1984  and it immediately gives the reader the sense that things are off kilter  It s a great first sentence  I first read 1984 in high school  My son is now in high school  currently reading it in his English class  so I decided to revisit this classic  There are so many things to say about it  I don t know where to begin  Besides being the most bleak dystopian view of a future in which the world s governments are oligarchies with a few individuals on the inside ruling through domination  and fear  I felt sadness at the plight of protagonist Winston Smith  Party member and simple cog in the bureaucratic wheel  He knows things aren t right in this world of cold  gray  bleakness where every thought and action is spied upon  known  and repercussions are certain  Winston gradually awakens to the notion that things might be better  that the world wasn t always dark and humans bereft of simple emotions  He begins to question the system of Big Brother s misinformation and the constant  as in daily  alteration of history  His awakening is hopeful in a sense where you feel yourself rooting for his hoped for revolution to move society forward  but on the other hand  there s the sense that poor Winston s got one foot in the grave Orwell has created this fantastic tension  I was riveted  turning pages  even already knowing the outcome  The book within the book  a supposed text created by the underground opposition  while maybe a little on the dry side  was still a fascinating study in human nature and society 1984 has had a profound effect on modern culture with many of its words and phrases becoming part of our vocabulary such as doublespeak  Big Brother  Ministry of Truth  Thought Police  among others Though quite depressing  this is a must read  The ending will stay with me a while  2 2 5In the world of 1984  there is no truth  Whatever the party says will be the truth  There is no way to verfiy the Party s claims  because no exteral evidence exists at all  Each person is strictly monitored and any expression of emotion other than loyalty towards the Party may make you seem suspicous   Comrades  who have committed  thoughtcrimes   having thoughts that doubt the Party and the Party s principles  will be tortued in the most brutal manners  until your mind becomes a blank sheet again and that you are ready to accept the Party and its doctrines fully and whole heartedly  George Orwell has spent nearly half of his book explaining the functioning of this dystopia and the typical routine of a comrade s life  As an impatient reader  I was surprised to find that I actually liked this kind of structuring  because the immense details had help me to get fully absorbed into this very believable world  Just when I thought I was having an idea of where the storyline would go  there would always be a twist that sent chills down my spine  Interestingly  since this is such a complex story  it was the afterword written by Erich Fromm that helped me find a way to understand this story systematically  Rather than telling us that there is no such thing as human nature  the author in fact had assumed that humans do long for freedom  love and justice  The question is   can human nature be changed in such a way that man will forget his longing for freedom  for dignity  for integrity  for love    that is to say  can man forget that he is human  One other aspect that facsinated me most was how Orwell had questioned whether the past was alterable  What is reality  Is there reality  I don t have an answer for that  but I think it is a good start to have these questions in mind  I have to agree with a lot of reviews  This book is as relevant today as the day it was written  I don t think we  animals  are capable of learning from history  We start out idealistic and never seem to understand that those  revolutionary  forces are most often the disguises put on by those who currently crave power to replace those who have it with themselves  No matter who ends up on top there seems to be total exploitation of those who work below them   Nine million people are now added to the list of individuals who have health insurance  Good   Health insurance premiums are constantly rising and the ones making all the money are not the physicians but the CEO s of hospitals and the insurance companies  The news is filled with stories that many covered by the ACA are soon losing it because it is not actually affordable  Meanwhile the red tape and regulations for physicians are increasing exponentially and physicians are filled with despair  There was some great quote by Orwell about the need to increase the number of technocrats to oversee the workers in order to justify their existence    etc etc  So this problem does not just apply to various governments but to the very policies that they create  Who is running the hospitals  Businessmen  Once upon a time in a land far far away called residency about twenty five years ago we were told by our program director that BIG BUSINESS looked around and saw that health care was the last frontier to be conquered in America  What is happening now to medical practices  They are being bought up by huge corporations    Come to us   they say   The government is coming to chew you all up and we will protect your lovely salaries and life style  Read Animal House my friends  Read it and be aware  It is about the history of the Soviet Revolution and about current events of today  The perfect dystopian book   often imitated  never bettered Winston Smith s struggles with the totalitarian rulers of Airstrip One  with the all pervasive technological snooping of the world he lives in and most of all with his own indoctrination and disillusionment are a story that hit the reader smack between the eyes Orwell follows his own rules of writing clear English as laid out in the essay  Politics and the English Language   and the result is a stark narrative which delivers its meaning directly and without any mercy  The novel is sufficiently short and compelling that it can and should be read in one sitting  If you haven t read 1984  set aside a lazy Sunday and take in one of the greatest political lessons of the 20th century It s also worth re reading 1984 after reading Orwell s memoir of the Spanish Civil War   A Homage to Catalonia   which reveals the impact of his experiences as a relatively starry eyed socialist volunteer at the hands of the Stalinists who were supposed to be his allies  Like all the best science fiction  this is not escapism or fantasy  it is a biting criticism of the things the author saw in real life  George Orwell s 1984John Merriweather George Orwell explores what would happen if a government were to control its people in a dominating fashion  He uses this intricate dystopian universe to show readers how easily government controls the people   In 1984  Orwell demonstrates this dystopian society s power using communism as a mold for their government  This civilization  in Oceania  presumably ruled by a single person known as Big Brother  lives in a state of ignorance so that the government can have total control  There are a few characters that aren t completely absorbed into it all  including the protagonist  Winston  Orwell effectively uses Winston  an inner party member  to show his perspective on communism by giving him this trait  and having him question himself about the questionable aspects of society  When Winston realizes the corrupt government s effect on everything  he rebels and searches for ways to destroy it  He ventures to the neighborhoods of the proletarians because he believes they are the only ones who might be able to change the ways of the government  There he finds an antique store  where he conducts several illegal acts in hopes to find the secret Brotherhood  but ultimately ends up being caught and transformed into one of the mindless and insane inhabitants of Oceania   All suggested criteria are found in Orwell s 1984  For example  propaganda  The figurehead Big Brother  another thing dystopian novels have  is seen on posters on buildings  walls  and everywhere you can fit one  Winston describes it as  never being able to escape the face of Big Brother   Another example of needed criteria is the use of surveillance of some sort  Orwell meets this condition by adding telescreens  These are basically televisions that the government can use to constantly look upon their citizens and also give them commands  Yet another example would be the lack of individual freedom  This is shown by the constant surveillance by the telescreens and by one of three sayings seen on a building known as The Ministry of Love   Freedom is slavery   An ironic statement used also to illustrate the total power of the government   George Orwell convincingly shows how detrimental a communist government is with this novel  He prompts readers to raise questions about the concept of a government as a whole when he introduces  The Book   a novel containing the reasoning behind the government in 1984 and solutions to destroying it  When I read this it made me personally question several aspects of the government s power and made me realize things that I usually just looked over  He does this all with a powerful and well written book  1984  Crazy and scary  A great story about the security state  society  inequality and becomes even more relevant as time passes  An outstanding book  and must read for students and fans of politics  What s there to say  It s a fantastic book  Well written  Well thought out  George Orwell had this unique vision that  strangely  seems to be popping up all around us  especially now  since the government is sticking their domes into everything we re doing nowadays  In any event  this book is dark  depressing and terrifying  One of the better horror stories I ve come across in quite some time  Lots more to say  but I won t bore you to tears  Just read it  And if you already did  congrats  Decidi comecar a ler o 1984 depois da minha professora de Teorias de Comunicacao comenta lo  persuadir me a ler pela grande qualidade e ja ha algum tempo que tinha curiosidade em comecar a le lo   pormenor que para esta critica nao tem muita relevancia  Publicado em 1949  o enredo acontece na Oceania  uma das super potencias a dominar o planeta em conjunto com a Lestasia e a Eurasia  E dado a conhecer ao leitor a historia de Winston Smith  um funcionario do Ministerio da Verdade na Oceania  terra que se encontra em guerra constante com um dos outros dois paises e mantem o outro como aliado  Basicamente  a guerra contada no livro assemelha se a um triangulo  a Oceania contem um aliado e juntos fazem a  base do triangulo  contra o outro pais  O governo retratado e completamente totalitario e controlador da mente dos cidadaos  de forma a controlar a vida de cada um atraves de  telecras   presentes nas casas de todos  A tirania deste governo e retratada atraves do chamado Grande Irmao  o  Big Brother   grande presidente do chamado Partido Interno  controlador da Oceania  Grande Irmao nunca antes visto a nao ser em cartazes espalhados pela cidade  em fotografias  em retratos  O trabalho de Smith e retificar artigos que faziam parte dos arquivos historicos do pais  alterar um pormenor ou outro de vez em quando dos jornais que seriam colocados a circular no dia seguinte pela Oceania  Mas apesar de ser um trabalhador exemplar de inicio  o leitor vai acompanhar a sua revolta interna contra o Partido e contra o Grande Irmao Nao posso contar mais da historia  foi uma delicia se querem que seja sincero  Orwell imaginou uma satira brilhante de uma sociedade no futuro completamente totalitaria  Se nao fosse tao boa nao teria servido para criar  depois dos anos 90  os programas nos diversos paises inspirados no conceito do Big Brother   o olho que tudo ve   Vemos a Historia da Humanidade ser alterada  os nossos conceitos basicos sobre a nossa vivencia atual a ser questionada  como viver com observadores a todos os minutos  Com tantas restricoes como  nao ser permitido apaixonar se por alguem  a nao ser pelo Partido  nao se pode questionar qualquer informacao dada  2 2 sao 4  Ou sao 5  Adorei a historia como a forma e contada  A ilusao que nos e transmitida ao longo das paginas de uma suposta revolta  o amor como uma forma de rebeliao  Achei fascinante e diria mesmo que com as tecnologias de hoje sera que nao estamos sempre a ser observados ou no nosso caso  escolhemos ser observados  Gostava mesmo de contar muito mais mas deviam ler voces  E tao bom este livro  ja sao dois otimos que leio este ano  Recomendadissimo 5 5 lrwy  ry  h lb d lHdwdttHdth  n nZmh qm y  wdykttwry  wbwlysy  r yn mthlh

 Cada ano habra menos palabras y el rango de conciencia sera cada vez menor Da miedo como las cosas relatadas en este libro son un buen ejemplo de lo que fue la dictadura militar en diferentes partes  o bastante parecido a lo que sigue ocurriendo en Korea del Norte Nuestro personaje principal  Winston Smith es un miembro del Partido  y el se encarga de  arreglar  la historia ya escrita para que coincida con lo que dice el Hermano Mayor  ente que si sabemos si existe   Basicamente  escriben las cosas para que los numeros esten a favor de ellos y desacreditando a los oponentes  Ya desde el principio ves que Winston tiene sus con respecto al HM y a toda la sociedad  No comprende como la gente puede pensar determinadas cosas y ser enganadas tan rapido Bueno    Yo sabia que su fe ciega lo iba a llevar a tomar decisiones tontas  Resulta que tenia razon En as primeras 2 partes del libro Winston intenta comprender que es lo que gana la sociedad haciendo determinadas cosa  como fomentar el odio y eso La tercera parte creo que fue la que mas me gusto  porque intentan jugar con tu cabeza para que piensen sientas cosas que son contrarias a las que vos sabesCon respecto al final  crudo  Bastante crudo  Pero    si te pones a pensarlo te das cuenta que sabias que iba a terminar asi  Se lee muy rapido  lo unico que me hizo para un poco fue cuando lei los capitulos de  El Libro  muchos de los terminos e informacion me mareaban un poco  Aun asi  es un libro muy bueno que sin duda releere en algun momento  No hay muchos personajes secundarios  pero los que hay son bastante interesantes  Creo que hay detalles que me perdi leyendolo la primera vez   Distopia in OceaniaLetto in inglese spontaneamente all eta di 18 anni  ne rimasi cosi positivamente colpito da decidere di far ruotare l intera tesina della maturita attorno al tema della propaganda  solo per poter includere questo fantastico libro  che rimane ancora il mio libro preferito IN ASSOLUTO    Alice nel paese delle meraviglie  e  Il giovane Holden  sono giusto dietro l angolo  ma il primo posto e ancora prepotentemente occupato    Di un attualita sconvolgente per qualunque momento in cui si decida di leggerlo e a dir poco profetico per l anno in cui e stato pubblicato  il romanzo piu famoso di Orwell cattura dall inizio e trascina fino all ultima riga dell ultima pagina  Considerato il romanzo distopico per eccellenza  e forse l unico romanzo finora che mi abbia spaventato e causato ribrezzo dal tanto che mi sono immedesimato e dalla maestria con la quale siano state scritte poche righe  Mi riferisco in particolare alla scena in cui Winston viene a contatto con il proprio incubo   La fattoria degli animali   diventa una lettura obbligata per continuare l opera di Orwell  Otimo livro  Trouxe uma otima reflexao sobre sociedade  politica  poder e liberdade  PS   eu seria um prole  facil  La calidad de este libro es directamente proporcional al sufrimiento que te hace sentir a partir de  mas o menos  el 70  del libro  Aunque mas o menos esperas el final  e imaginas como sera  yo no me esperaba en absoluto lo que senti  Simpatice tanto con el personaje que llegue a odiar a quienes le ponian las cosas dificiles Sobre el libro no tengo mucho mas que decir  Un libro que haga sentir un sentimiento de empatia y odio tan profundo debe ser  y es  considerado como una obra maestra de lectura obligatoria Chapo  lm n  lHqyq  lldkttwry     qm   t dhyb   zdwj fkr    Tms lHqy q   tzwyr ltrykh   ntz  l Tf  yh kmy  lshr ll  mwjwd  f  lrwy  d     h  rwy  tqr  thm tqr  mn jdyd     rftn   l

autores que consiguen maravillarte  a pesar de la dureza de la critica que hace en 1984  Desde que lei ese libro no he vuelto a creer en los porcentajes que muestran en los telediarios ni en la tele ni en los periodicos  y soy periodista hihi  Es sin duda uno de los grandes autores  con una convicciones que hoy en dia me cuesta ver en la literatura   Emotionally Powerful Gripping Read  A Classic  As I was reading 1984  I constantly was amazed it was written in 1948  I could have been convinced this was written in the  80s  The Big Brother nation that is presented in this book has real parallels to today  with the internet being the only technology not associated in the book  I half expected it to come up as I was reading the book because of how modern it seems   If Google were to align itself with the government  they would know what we are doing at all times  This book makes me want to get rid of my smartphone and not be on the internet so much  but I probably won t change   My goal in reading a book is usually to be forced to think about a particular topic or to get lost in a parallel universe  This one definitely gave me the former and unfortunately gave me the latter as well  I feared for my own life as I was nearing the end of the book  I loved this book  though there was a horrid stretch where a book was being read inside the book explaining what was already known   I definitely recommend this to everyone who is under the age of 40  no offense if you are older  but I see the amount of technology in the hands of adults and children today as a way for all of us to be watched by the big technology companies   It opens your eyes as to what is possible in the future if civilization was to take a turn for the worst  I know 1984 will rank as one of my favorite book since the first time I had heard it  I know this  But I keep postponing my intent to read it  since I feel like due to my age I will not be able to understand properly  and because I want to work on my English so that I can read it without much difficulty  But one day I was at my local bookstore  window shopping  and I happened upon a translated copy of 1984 in one of the shelves  I didn t expect it at all and I was so shocked and happy at the same time that I paced around the shelves for some time to calm myself  I was seized by the sudden impulse to grab it and stuff it into my shopping bag  before I saw the publisher  I ve read several books by this publisher  and most of them have shoddy translations  I even have to buy a copy of one of them in its original language to even remotely understand anything because the translation is that bad But the book haunts me even as I got home  I agonized about it for days  Should I or should I not buy the book  Am I ready yet  Well  I decided finally  if I m old enough to go to college I m old enough to read the book  So I placed an order in one of those online bookshops and wait  When it arrived a week ago  I promptly read it You must be wondering why it took me almost a week if I liked it so much  Well  because a book like this is like fine wine  you can t read it all at one but rather savor it slowly  And because this book is depressing as fuck  that s why  There were many times when I have to put the book down  draw a long sigh  then took a rest browsing for cute puppies and kittens pictures  The book gets to you  Its worldbuilding is so good that you can t help but get sucked into its world and feel the helplessness of the character  I was there  with Winston in London  trying to survive under constant censorship and squalor  despite the fact that we are separated by the pages of the book Orwell has a vivid writing style  He can make his character and his world come to life with mundane words  Every author who thinks that the only way they can write well is by using the most superfluous words needs to read Orwell  Sure  sometimes his paragraph is long and confusing  but like I said  you need to savor it slowly like fine wine  You can t speed read an Orwell  I usually felt bored upon encountering a wall of text in a novel  but with Orwell  the wall of text makes me feel excited  It doesn t bore me  not at all Wow  I really don t have anything to add anymore  What can I say  Everything that needs to be said has been said in this book  You need to read it  That s all I m going to say  Adapted from my blog  paquetdevie blogspot com  Doubtless this book is a classic in that most of its  predictions  as it were are coming true  There s doublespeak that exists  and ubiquitous surveillance a la Big Brother  Conformity is encouraged  Freethinking is admonished and in extreme cases met with vitriolic hate  sometimes leading even to murder  We are bombarded from all sides  especially screaming  news  anchors about what  enemy  to hate today and for what  And it changes every couple of days  We still haven t reached the levels of insanity as shown in 1984  but to my cynical mind  we are getting there Yet  it is not for its prophetic nature that I adore this book  Rather  I like this book because in its relatively short length it makes me care for Winston  A lot  To the point that upon finishing the book  I actually just sat there for about five minutes mentally mumbling  No  no  no  no  to myself and being completely heartbroken at the soul crushing and mind numbing defeat that Winston faces  It really moved me and is my second favourite book ever  And I can guarantee that it will move you  Memorable QuotesThe essence of oligarchical rule is not father to son inheritance but the persistence of a certain world view and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living  1984 should be read and reread over countless cups of coffee  until you ve grasped the sheer genius of it  Orwell s prose is as elegant as it is descriptive  for he sets the atmosphere so eloquently that the dread is almost tangible  And the fact that it s a timeless prophecy gives the dread a realistic edge that it s almost frightening  This is the kind of book that haunts you long after you ve finished reading it  I highly recommend it  Scared  cold  lonely and an urge for wanting more  This book is clearly a page turner  Though George Orwell makes the world cruel and have you see only in blue with its  Thought Police   you start to see a ray of light with his vision of love and how it really is  two against the world   His view on a world that doesnt tolerate family  love  friendship  kindness  or race for that matter  Everyone is the same  and everyone is being watched  forever  I doubt anyone could say that they ve had fun while having an anxiety attack  Reading this  you won t only have an anxiety attack  you ll have one while turning page after page smiling  frowning and sometimes just being angry   enjoying every minute of it Before I read 1984  I was reading MYSTIC RIVER  At the time  someone very close to me had passed and I was going through alot  I remember putting MYSTIC RIVER back on the shelf and thinking that I had wanted something new  No mystery  No thriller  Certainly no how to books either  I wanted to escape and George Orwell helped me do just that   I went into 1984 with an incredible bias  I was in a bad mood   against classics and particularly the shove it in your face moral style of George Orwell  This is only the second Orwell novel I have ever read  I thought maybe Animal Farm was just written for children and that s why the morals and metaphors were so    In your face  I read the first few pages of 1984 already pissed off  I could see where he was going  Don t trust the government  They re spying on you  Telling you what to think with media manipulation Then I accidentally loved it  In another review I said that no one ever fan girled George Orwell  I was so wrong  http   itsonlythree wordpress com 201    Finishing most books gives me a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment  I feel empty and hopeless  Maybe that s the point   Amazing book  a huge emotional impact is now scarred into my brain after finishing it  Everyone should read this   1984 is one of the unfairly underrated books that everyone   at least once   should read    This novel is simply not like any other   I don t think it fits well in the literary genre   No   it is way more bigger than that   It should be considered an exceptional case of literature marrying sociology to end up giving birth to a masterpiece on politics    If there is hope it lies in the proles  Imagine individualism being a crime in a world where working   eating   drinking   reading   sleeping   talking    In short  living is controlled  in every sense of the word   by the state   Imagine living under someone s eyes within a system that makes Hitler   Stalin and all of history s most notorious villains look like cowards   Imagine being lured into believing that black is white and that 2 2 makes five   Don t imagine much because the world Orwell portrayed in his fictional novel is much relevant to ours today   This book will always be relevant because governments will always seek to control their populations through fear   It doesn t have to be terrorism or something of the sort   but anything that keeps  the proles  afraid and concerned about their well being so that they put their trust into a governing body   The less you reason  the more they govern    You Are The Dead  This book is frightening   dark  horrendous and I just can t describe the chills it gave me    Definitely the best of the dystopian books I ve read so far in terms of how much it challenged and engaged me intellectually  As an avid reader and lover of words  I also really like the appendix in which Orwell spells out the mechanics  and more importantly  the philosophy behind Newspeak  I definitely see the relevance of this section given how more and more people are forgoing reading in favor of tiny snippets of text found in Facebook comments and Buzzfeed  articles   As language loses its richness and diversity  there is a parallel impoverishment of the mind   It would have been interesting to read Orwell s reaction to texting in the present day  in which language is reduced beyond what he imagined with Newspeak to mere strings of letters  like B4N  The constant fabrication and  correction  of news was also fascinating  since it already takes place in the present day   I m reminded of the movie  Wag the Dog  and the ridiculous antics of our government and the media for various political campaigns such as the  War on Terror  and  Shock and Awe   A definite must read for those who appreciate the enormous  and often misused  power of media  language  education and thought control   The kind of information I have been searching for  Strong phrases  I can relate everything to the current situation of the world  Helped me see the society in another perspective  especially the political

how much we argue   this book was a glimpse of a real world  I really thank all my friends who recommended me to read this book  though i have taken really long time to finish this book  taking gap and re reading it again after 2 month    it was worth invest of time   One of those books I ve always felt like I kinda knew even though I ve never actually read it  Reading it was certainly worth it  Every time I read some of it I d get in this funky mood  It definitely won t help me getting away from being super skeptical and cynical about things  I m still absorbing the book but I will say it is worth it and you should read it if you haven t  for sure  and soon Couple of side notes The book is very well written but for a period in the book he keeps using the word  vaguely  to describe people s actions or how they say something  I know it s trivial  but it really annoyed me that he always chose to describe people s actions that way and never used any synonyms  I literally jumped up and cheered when he used  indifferently  in lieu of  vaguely  after getting about 120 pages in Also Part 3 was far more brutal than I anticipated  It got pretty graphic and disturbing which was a pleasant  not sure if that s a good word here  surprise Lastly  I don t what s going on down here in Georgia but I can t believe how many people here haven t even heard of this book nevermind read it  I like a lot about this place  but even the supposedly more progressive part of GA has an immense amount of people who unfortunately don t seem to know what a book is unless it s got praise for Jesus and or contains voyeur snapshots of celebrities Now that I think of it  someone needs to combine scuzzy celeb mags with the Bible  It s be the ultimate compilation of what makes this country so great  And I

the Party exerts on information flow and how by controlling vocabulary the state limits free thought   the adjective  Orwellian  now makes a lot more sense to me   The Newspeak appendix at the end is also quite interesting  1984   0 679 41739 7Painful  frightening  horrific  What do you do in a world where your every movement  every gesture is watched carefully by the government  How do you live in a world where even the slightest departure from complete conformity will result in torture  dismemberment  death  What hope can you have in a world where there is no escape   there is no free travel  and nowhere to flee to since all governments are the same  You cannot even take the step of ending your own life  as the government which cannot supply the country with enough food  shoes  or clothes also fails to supply its citizenry with razor blades  1984  paints a picture bleak and terrifying  of a government that terrorizes its populace into quiescence  and of a populace that is too fearful  too hungry  and too uneducated to attempt the mass uprising that might save them  In a world where children are taught to spy on their parents and turn them into the police for the most minor  or imagined  of crimes  there can be no love  no one worth fighting for or protecting  How does it all end  Orwell doesn t believe that it can end    1984  is a reminder for eternal vigilance against an impossible enemy  ourselves    Ana Mardoll I just re read this book and was horrified by how directly applicable it is to things happening in the US in 2012  particularly the GOP s War on Women as a tactic to repress sexuality on the whole  Orwell is a genius  This book is undeniably great  I support its reputation as a modern classic  and encourage everyone to read it  and read it soon  It will widen your perspective  expand your thoughts  and alter the way you look at the world  our governments  and our own human nature  A splash of metaphysics  centering around the question of  what is reality   is probably the toughest concept included  And don t skip the appendix  I adored the concept and structure of Newspeak as a language and as an instrument of mind control  The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was  SPOILER  how Julia  such a fireball to begin with  settled into complacency once she   Wilson achieved their initial act of disobedience  If she s done this  hundreds of times    well  dozens at least   why is she so content to stay in one place with him  bh nZrm yn khtb wj blwG fkhry ykh nwysndh rw myrswnh     1  I decided to read this book because the teacher of my before school english class instructed the class to as part of our dystopian literature topic  I had only read one other book by Orwell   Animal Farm   and enjoyed it greatly and so decided to give this one a try 2  This book completes the  Classics written before 1950  category  as it was written in 1949  This category interests me because these books have been accessible and loved by generations  and are still well known today  A book that has survived for 64 years is undoubtably an excellent read 3  An idea in this book that I found very powerful was the idea of a society controlled by the government  to the point of loss of any sense of autonomy and free will  In this book the protagonist  Winston Smith  is forced to suffer through intense government surveillance and control  Society is built on a wealth of lies and systematic destruction of anything that might incite suspicion of the government  including humans  He then rebels  acting in secret to preserve his humanity and love for Julia  and is resultantly brainwashed through a combination of physical and psychological torture  I found this book  and especially the second half  immensely emotionally powerful and chilling  and was left in a state of shocked catatonia by the end of the last page 4  A quote I found particularly moving was the quote  HE WHO CONTROLS THE PAST  CONTROLS THE PRESENT   This was one of the slogans of a group called the Party  and refers to their means of altering records of past events in order to maintain their dignity and upstanding among the community  But in a way  its true  Altering the records of the Parties actions to convey them in a better light  does actually make them seem bigger and more important  and that s why very few people  as it seems to be  only truly Winston and Julia   find it in themselves to question the system they live under  And even they  too  get brainwashed in the end  5  Something I learned from this book is conformity is often destruction  Falling into the lines of what society expects of you  regardless of your own wishes  is the ultimate barbaric way of power and control over the masses  Although this is an exaggerated example  governments can influence people in ways we don t realise  and we need to have the sense to rebel when necessary and do our best to understand the reasoning  We all must work to provide a society not run on social expectations and oppression  but on our own free will and humanity  Oddly enough  this book was boring when i was a kid  but a bit scary now that I m an adult  George Orwell is indisputably the greatest didactic writer in the English language since Samuel Johnson  As an essayist  he is a nonpareil  and his insights    which he modestly characterized as  a power of facing unpleasant facts     are remarkable  original  and biting  The scintillating force of his pen shines most brightly in his essays and his memoirs The very power of his personal prose that gives such force to his essays and memoirs  however  leaves his fiction curiously flat  For all his insight  he seems to lack the ability to free his characters to lead independent fictional lives  A person reading Orwell s novels for their characterization would shoot himself Such is the force  clarity  and originality of Orwell s ideas  however  and the freshness of his candor  that it is easy to forgive the flat characterization and intrusive narration of the novels  And while each generation seems to find some pundit who dismisses Orwell s dark vision in 1984 as passe  fresh revelations of the octopus like stranglehold of the National Security Agency over the daily minutiae of the the lives of 300 million Americans gives proof daily of how prescient Orwell was  Big

complejidad del libro  los temas que se manejan son bastante complejos  Orwell definitivamente realiza una critica a los distintos sistemas de gobierno que perduran en el mundo  mostrandonos que cualquier tipo de gobierno tiene un toque de Oceania  La frase que mejor describe el tema del libro es la misma que Orwell menciona al inicio y en la mayoria de la novela La guerra es la pazLa libertad es la esclavitud La ignorancia es la fuerza  rbm kn mn nfl  lqwl n krr  Zm  hdhh lrwy   wrbm kn  yD mn lmkrr n shyr l  wjh ltshbh ltm fym yf lh lkh lkbr fy lrwy  w m yqdm  lyh lTGh wln qdm  l

longstanding monument of English Literature in the 20th century is an impossibility  It is didactic  albeit through negative example  It is moralistic  It is a novel of ideas rather than characters  It never once abandons an idea  never second guesses itself  never once makes concessions to some other side of an argument  It is out to make a very pointed point  and that point is a period ending a straightforward and intelligible sentence  the kind Orwell enjoys and employs Be free and speak the truth And yet  Somehow this marvel of an essay turned novel is lauded even now by the intelligentsia of the post post modern world  The kind that despise wisdom or truth  The kind that spit on ideas if they  not characters  become the focus of a work  The kind that love to contort and twist the English language in such a way as to make every point a not point  an unpoint if you will  so that no ideas can be spoken without trepidation or fear of the subjectivist thought police How in the nine hells did this novel survive in our time  Perhaps the academics never actually read it  Perhaps they thought the little snippets they had read   about reality being a conjuring of the mind  the dissolution of reality into solipsistic playfulness   were not mantras of the Party in creating Doublethink  That is one explanation  though doubtless it is more complex than that I want to talk about a few things here that are not concerned with any of this  however  I want to talk about the Three Superpowers  I want to talk about Oceania  In a weird way  I want to talk about Plato s Republic and how it may have anticipated Orwell  I want to talk about why 1984 is terrifying  And to do so  we have to tackle what essential elements this dystopia is made of  Namely Statism SocialismThought controlThese are the elements that define Oceania in the year of  is it   1984 STATISM SOCIALISM Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly  The so called  abolition of private property  which took place in the middle years of the century meant  in effect  the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before  but with this difference  that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals  So details Emmanuel Goldstein  if he ever existed  in his tract within a novel   The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism  which functions as the foil of the Party  The point is clear as crystal  The means of wealth creation  and the end of wealth itself  have become fully socialized in 1984  Necessarily they were used not to the betterment of individuals  but to the continued existence of the State  which I will get to shortly  This is an unavoidable mainstay of Socialism  and the central tenant of Communism  that  no member of the Party owns anything except petty personal belongings   This is the stated end toward which Socialism moves  to shift production toward central distribution and to let its people fuss over baubles It should be noted that the society of 1984 is achieved through a Party  not a Business  nor a Corporation  nor a Market  free or otherwise  In fact  free markets are alluded to quite positively in the book as remnants of a bygone age before the Revolution  This is a crucial distinction  Only through a political artifice could such a hell ascend  Orwell was no slouch   he meant to elucidate through word choice  and no word could be more apt for a totalitarian monstrosity than Party  By this  members are made obsolete  By this  the individual is unimportant  By this  any manner of evil can be performed because no single one performs it  The onus lies on the Party  and the Party is supreme But wait  wasn t Orwell a Socialist  Indeed he was  But he was also a great thinker and a man wholly committed to being consistent and truthful  by no means could he abide a Maoist or Stalinist state  no matter how faithful or unfaithful they were to the stated aims of the Bolsheviks  So if he is a Socialist  he is one with no teeth  Because by no means can a commune propagate except by the freedoms inherent to a freed market  by which people can freely associate and pool resources  By then  it is no longer Socialism  but a voluntary agora  If you want true abolition of private property everywhere equally  you must do so by the barrel of a gun  or more aptly the heel of a boot stomping in a face   forever  So in a sense I too am a socialist like Orwell  I desire equality of the classes  I want to uplift the poor  I want to dismantle the rich  I want to give charitably and love others  But those can just as easily come about through a Capitalist mode  and I would argue can only come about fairly  justly  and realistically through that same mode THOUGHT CONTROLThere is something interesting going on in 1984 concerning time and memory  I m still not sure exactly what that is  though  The control of the future through the past  and the past through the present  is inextricably tied up to the memories of Outer Party members and the time in which their memories are set  Do we even know what time 1984 is set in  Not even our lens character  Winston  is able to recall if 1984 is the correct year  This is the novel s brilliance  even its title is an act of Doublethink Really  I ve gone on long enough for a little review on Goodreads  but I will resume this line of thought at a later time  I read this a long time ago and when I am bookless I often load it to my iPod and listen to it  I love this book and get  something  different each time I read it  Its smart and daring and frightening and the messages carry through the decades  Stunned  How smart that guy  I mean Orwell  must have been    Cuando estaba leyendo este libro no podia dejar de pensar que la sociedad actual esta caminando  hacia un futuro muy parecido al que narra este libro Personas vigiladas las 24 horas del dia  como siempre no quiero hacer spoilers para que ustedes mismos descubran lo emocionante de este libro  Pero en el se encuentra mucha similitud con lo que vivimos actualmente La frase por la que el libro puede ser conocida es  El Gran Hermano te Vigila   La historia del libro gira en torno de una sociedad controlada en la que se intenta eliminar los sentimientos excepto el  odio  este se promueve se provoca se debe odiar a todo aquello que va en contra del partido  asi tambien se promueve el amor hacia el partido  existe el crimen de pensamiento conocido como  crimental  en el que te castigan por haber pensado en contra de la sociedad y en el que cualquiera te delataria incluso tus propios hijos Resena ampliada en  http   historiasdepaginas blogspot mx    It s clear why this is such a monumental work of literature and on every sci fi list out there as a must read  I would recommend not watching Citizen Four in conjuncture with this  just because you re paranoid doesn t mean some one is not out to get you  It can t be helped but to look at this story with an eye that has been raised on the the influence of the book  even though the actual content of the book was unknown to me  But it s unbelievably spine chilling the similarities between the dogma of EngSoc  English Socialism  and today s American bi partisan party system with a heavy influence of capitalism  Actually  the capitalism portion of 1984 was really the only part where Orwell seemed to miss the mark  EngSoc doesn t run on Capitalism  In fact  the idea is villainized  Industry continues  but it s based more on a need for monotonous production rather than an economic need  The citizens of Oceania still go hungry  wear uniforms for everyday life  and nearly half the population is without shoes  yet reports of surpassed production keep being published  Perhaps it s because the United States has no memory of war time ravaging our daily lives that I find this oversight so erogenous  but whatever  Perhaps Capitalism really didn t look like it would survive and flourish during the early 1940 s when this book was written  The constant presence of Big Brother and the forced propaganda feels relatable now more than ever  With the ever threat of terrorism  war is peace  and the willingness of citizens to forfeit their freedom of privacy to ensure their safety  freedom is slavery   it s upsetting to see so many comparisons between this book and reality  But that s not what a review is about  A review is to critique the work as a piece  and this is certainly a piece of work  Orwell is a master at folding his desired message he wants to broadcast into an engaging tale  Much like Animal Farm  1984 allows the characters and events tell the story rather than the protagonist  Perhaps save for  The Book   however it seems The Book s purpose is to clarify the subtle points the reader might have missed  which isn t really a problem with today s audience  as the pure essence of 1984 has been woven into so much of our existing media  All in all  this book is a must read  I would have blown through it if I had been actually reading the text  As it was  this was an audiobook  and for the life of me I could not stay awake when the narrator was reading  Seriously  middle of the afternoon and the next thing I know I fell asleep and missed a huge chunk of it and had to keep skipping back to find the last remembered spot  This is a must read  and I imagine I ll pick it up again in good time   Ultimately  I remember a book for how it makes me feel  1984 brought out so much emotion  I cannot forget it At times terrifying  At times heartbreaking  1984 is an amazing book  Terrifying because of the world that Winston loves in  a time in the future where Big Brother may be watching or listening to your every move  It is a place where life is fear  There is no outside world  no history  and a child may turn you in as a traitor  Heartbreaking because Winston is so alone in this world  Even surrounded by other people  I feel that he is alone  different  When he does make a connection with another like himself  I will abstain details here to avoid a spoiler   there is the impending feeling that it cannot last long  They will be found out in this place where there is no freedom  and it will be smashed to pieces I see 1984 as a precursor to so many of the dystopian  apocalyptic style novels that have followed in its footsteps  even to this day  It may not have been the first  but I find it to be the best of them  One blogger I read said that 1984 was not the best written of the classic dystopian novels  I disagree  It may not have the poetic verse of Fahrenheit 451  but it has intense prose  It s a book I will come back to reread because I found parts of it to be deep and complicated  especially the last half  So much so that I was often backtracking as I read 1984 s dystopian future felt more real to me on a personal level  than today s books of plagues  zombies and survival games  The book may be partial satire  but it was set in a reality of sorts  George Orwell experienced the World Wars  Nazism  Communism  Socialism and poverty  All of that comes through while at the same time giving us a main character we connect to  and a world we want to fight against  In short  the book has a point to make  It has a reason The last quarter of the book crushed me with emotion  I applauded Winston for trying to hold on  and then I wanted to reach in and save him of his fate  Simply one of the best books I ve ever read  lslT  mn jl lslT     Ht   l   qwl lbshr  nhm l ystTy wn ltGlGl l  kynk   jwlywfy lrwy  ystTy wn dhlk b d shhwr

in the place where there is no darkness   Definitely one of my favourite books of all time  A novel that needs to be read by everyone  whether you end up liking it  loving it or hating it  Experience it   This book was intensely brilliant  I admit that in the beginning it starts out a little sluggish  but that s only because the author was  setting the stage   Things started to happen more in part 2  which was slightly disappointing  There wasn t much action  it was more like reading an essay in fact  There s one thing that I wanted more of  and that was dialogue  I agree that this book is very intriguing mostly from start to finish  The author shows every aspect of this dystopian society  I believe his use of language creates a more powerful effect with emotional appeal  I love that this book does make you question our aspects of life  It s a real eye opener  This book is absolutely my top favorites  Endings like this are hard to forget    re read in 2016 in a way  it was even better the second time  it was much easier to understand  and less depressing  i love it just as much as i see things more clearly now  2014 I dont think i have proper words to describe the book  It kind of reminds me a little bit of  clockwork orange   because even though it is not a pretty book  it makes you think  judge society and people around you  question the things you think are true  You want to be different  you want to BE the difference This book is just amazing  That s the only way i can put it  So interesting  revealing  scary and realistic all at the same time  It s like it s said in the book  the best books are the ones that tell us the things we already know   but we simply dont have the intelligence or concentration  or creativity tu put in words  George Orwell acomplished something that i never though could happen  He made me see politics in a interesting and passionate way  Every single phrase of this novel has so much meaning and sense  it makes me mad Besides being a political book  i also see a lot of physicology and horror in it  Not what i am used to  but i find it an amazing combination Probably not a book for everyone  but if you have the level of maturity

about this book  After having read a lot of supposedly dystopian books over the last few years  George Orwell reminds me what a true dystopian should be  Hopeless  Because that s the ultimate feeling of this book  Forget a rebellion led by a beautiful  passionate young adult who frees everyone from tyranny over the course of three books  this is true dystopian where at the end you  and the main character  realise that there is no hope  It is impossible to overthrow a government that controls everything  That is willing to go to any means to hold onto power But that said  I will say that 1984 isn t really a novel in many ways  It s an essay about the dangers of big  powerful government  on either side of the political spectrum  What s often fascinates me about this book is that despite when it was written  so much of it still rings true even today    Resensi berasal dari blog saya  Resensi 1984 Penantian saya untuk membaca buku ini akhirnya kesampaian juga  Sudah dua tahun lebih saya mencari buku ini  karena selalu ada di puncak listopia Goodreads   Awalnya saya kira cuma ada versi Bahasa Inggris  Kemudian ketika keluar cetakan baru dari Penerbit Bentang  saya langsung berburu dan akhirnya dapat Rada basa basi nih  tapi saya merasa harus berterima kasih disertai rasa kagum terhadap Landung Simatupang sang penerjemah novel ini  1984 sama sekali bukan karya dengan bahasa gampangan  Bahkan di dalamnya terdapat kosakata baru sebagai bagian dari cerita  Namun beliau mampu menuliskannya ke dalam bahasa Indonesia tanpa mengurangi makna utuhnya  Sungguh hebat saya rasa  Walaupun beberapa kata menjadi lucu juga karena diterjemahkan  Misalnya Ministry of Plenty menjadi Kementrian Tumpah Ruah Mengenai isi novel ini saya pun angkat topi  Poster bertuliskan BUNG BESAR MENGAWASI ANDA itu terasa menjadi pembuka tabir atas latar dunia di novel ini  Kondisi distopia dimana Partai manguasai negeri secara penuh  Rakyat diawasi dan dikontrol hingga sedetail detailnya  Hukuman untuk pembangkang adalah diuapkan  Untuk melanggengkan kekuasaannya  Partai memberikan tiga prinsip Perang ialah DamaiKebebasan ialah PerbudakanKebodohan ialah KekuatanDi dalam sistem yang ketat itu muncul seorang bernama Winston  Dia anggota Partai yang merasakan ketidakpuasan atas kekejian dan kepalsuan yang terjadi  Pemuja sekaligus pembenci Partai  Orang yang berpotensi menggulingkan kekuasaan totaliter Partai  Dia menjalin kisah cinta  yang tentunya ilegal menurut Partai  dengan gadis bernama Julia  Bersama mereka memupuk kebencian terhadap Partai secara sembunyi sembunyi  Sampai suatu ketika sesuatu dahsyat terjadi   Saya hampir tidak percaya buku ini ditulis pada tahun 1949  Seolah olah novel ini pada masa itu merupakan ramalan dunia masa depan pasca Perang Dunia II  Deskripsinya begitu nyata  merasuk ke dalam kehidupan sehari hari  Perasaan terawasi oleh teleskrin  sulitnya suplai pisau cukur sementara berita mengatakan surplus  ketakutan dilaporkan menyimpang oleh anak sendiri  tuntutan pekerjaan pemalsuan di Partai  makan siang di kantin berkarat  dan sebagainya  Penceritaannya begitu mengagumkan sampai sampai beberapa orang khawatir kalau itu sungguh terjadi pada masa mendatang  Yah  walaupun akhirnya kita tahu kondisi sekarang tidak sampai sedemikian Sedikit spoiler  dalam novel ini Winston akan membaca sebuah  kitab  berisi dasar ideologi dunia distopia dalam novel ini  Bagian ini yang menurut saya penyambung paling kuat  Peletak teori politik baru yang cemerlang dari Orwell  Rasanya kalau iman tidak kuat  paham yang tertanam bisa menyimpang  Saya hampir yakin buku ini dibredel di zaman Soeharto  Alasannya dapat dimengerti kalau Anda sudah selesai baca buku ini  Pada akhirnya novel ini pun merupakan satir yang memotret kekerasan dalam pemerintahan dan perang yang terjadi pada dekade 40 an Secara keseluruhan  novel ini memang layak disebut sebagai bacaan legendaris  Tulisan yang visioner  kritik sosial yang keras  alur cerita yang kuat  fitur fitur unik dunia distopia  semua memadu menjadi buku yang layak dibaca sepanjang zaman  Bahkan ketika sudah lewat tahun 1984 sekalipun  2 2 5 tqd n bdkhly mywl ly rwy  tq

dwm  lty l thtm sw  blnwm wlT m wllhw You could say that 1984 is essentially about the concept of freedom being the truth of what makes us human  and that coercive power is a denial of that truth of humanity  This supports Orwell s identification as an anarchist but unfortunately so few people know enough about anarchism today to connect the dots  Like Newspeak appropriating the meaning of words  most people do not even know what Orwell was referring to when he claimed to be an anarchist  I ve heard it said that people blow this novel out of proportion  comparing a parking ticket to Big Brother  The thing that s sad about the parking ticket analogy is not that these people react negatively to a small instance of coercive power  it s that their privilege  and the political language of capitalism blind them to the larger coercive power being thrust on them and the rest of the world daily   Freedom isn t free  is not all that different from  war is peace  freedom is slavery   In 1984  you have no privacy  Your life  thoughts  hobbies  and love are monitored by the government  Big Brother is always watching you  For most people living in this dystopian society it s normal  they re used to it  they even like it  but many others  like Winston  our main character  are against Big Brother and would gladly stop him at all costs  But rebellion is a dangerous thing  and the price of getting caught is your life    Classics are usually a hit or a miss with me  Generally  I like them  but there are some that I hate the moment I read the first chapter  Luckily  1984 was not one of those books  It had a deep emotional writing style that conveyed more emotion than I was expecting  Usually the downfall for classics is that the plot is good  but the characters seem extremely static because they don t really have any feelings or emotions  This was no problem in 1984  hatred  love  sorrow  and pain were all emotions that I felt clearly while reading  There were few pages that weren t bursting with words that affected me deeply  The characters in this book changed  as well as Winston s opinion of the characters  You could clearly tell what he thought of all of them before he even said anything  They were perfect  well rounded  dynamic people who developed and changed throughout the novel  I could stay here and write about them each individually for hours  but I think I would end up spoiling the book The plot was another thing that I loved about it  Given that it s a classic  I thought that it would have some generic plot that I could easily predict because it s been recreated a gazillion times  That was not the case The plot had many twists and turns  every time I was positive that something would happen  Orwell proved me wrong  When I finally got to the point where I was reading it like it had just been written  not expecting anything unoriginal to happen  The biggest plot twist in the novel happened  It was something that I probably should have realized was going to happen  but I didn t  I was shocked and just in utter disbelief that something like that would happen  Just read this book  honestly  it s unlike any classic that I ve ever read  I ll definitely be reading more of George Orwell s work after this  I was hooked by the first page and I couldn t put it down  I should blame Orwell every time I get a bad grade on a test  Well  you see  if George Orwell wasn t such an amazing author  I wouldn t have read 1984 instead of studying  So    it s not my fault that I got this grade  right  If only that was how it worked  Anyway  this book was impossible to put down  Especially when I got to part two  It moved fast but in a way that was easy to see and understand  I moved through all of part 2 on one day  and all of part three the next  It just went so fast and the novel was so carefully thought out that if just one thing had changed  the entire book would be different Please read this book  I don t care if you turn into a paranoid hobbit living alone  it is amazing and this book is totally worth it  The book that s had the profoundest effect on me in recent memory  Quite simply mindblowing  A great mirror of our society  The most disturbing thing I ve ever read  I had nightmares after reading this book  I woke up terrified of losing everything I thought I loved   family  girlfriend  home  all of it  I know that sounds a little fake in today s  everyone s tough everybody s a badass  world  but it s true  A wonderful read made even more magnificent if you analyze the ending as the beginning  That is  perhaps Winston s capture and subsequent release back into society at the end of the novel has  in actuality  already occurred countless times before  In this way  the novel itself becomes an unending and systematic cycle of rebellion  capture  torture  release  and repeat  There are so many instances that allude to this analysis   a  nostalgic  adjective dropped here and there  a  familiarity  of a particular scene  etc  Winston s inability to escape this cycle and the grip of immortal Big Brother truly makes the work itself a brilliant manifestation of a complete and totalized form of power  Anumite aspecte ale acestui roman se gasesc si in Ferma Animalelor  insa intr o forma mai simpla  1984 fiind vadit mai complex si mai impresionant din punct de vedere conceptual 1984 este deci tot un roman distopic  cu acceptie politica  scris in 1948 si publicat in 1949  Este destul greu de descris si de explicat  de aceea recomand sa il cititi integral  De preferat ar fi sa aveti si cateva cunostinte despre socialism si totalitarism pentru a l putea intelege pe deplin Ca o scurta prezentare a continutului  pot sa spun ca actiunea se petrece  teoretic  in anul 1984  Teoretic deoarece  datorita opresiunii  nici locuitorii Londrei din aceasta perioada nu pot spune cu exactitate anul in care se afla Romanul are cateva concepte dominante  cum ar fi Fratele cel Mare  dublu ganditul  Politia Gandului  Soceng Dupa o presupusa revolutie din anii  50  lumea era acum impartita in 3 superputeri aflate in razboi  Oceania  Eurasia si Estasia  Taberele erau mereu schimbatoare  dupa cum era mai bine pentru Partid  Lucru care te face sa pui la indoiala chiar si existenta acestui razboi  Ambientul este reprezentat de Londra  principalul oras din Oceania Fratele cel Mare  Big Brother in original  a devenit o figura metaforica a regimurilor totalitare  datorita semnificatiei sale de perchezitie permanenta  Sloganul  Fratele cel Mare sta cu ochii pe tine   Big Brother is watching you  este extrem de des intalnit pe parcursul romanului prin intermediul afiselor cu chipul unui barbat  caracterizat de trasaturi aspre  ochi negri patrunzatori  aproape hipnotizanti  raspandite in tot orasul  pe edificiile oficiale  cladiri  sau in interiorul blocurilor  Reprezinta deci o imagine aproape obsedanta  care te urmareste la tot pasul si de ochii caruia nu poti scapa nicaieri Sloganul Fratelui cel Mare este reprezentat exact de opusul valorilor noastre   Razboiul este paceLibertatea este sclavieIgnoranta este putere  Edificiile oficiale sunt reprezentate de patru ministere  Dau impresia prin sugestivitatea numelor ca principala lor ocupatie ar fi asigurarea bunastarii poporului  insa este total opusul   Ministerul Pacii se ocupa de tot ce are legatura cu razboiul   Ministerul Adevarului era responsabil de falsificarea trecutului  a presei  a oricaror dovezi care ar putea contrazice declaratiile Partidului  de remarcat ar fi o alta doctrina a Partidului care sustine ca  Cine controleaza trecutul controleaza viitorul  Cine controleaza prezentul controleaza trecutul    Ministerul Iubirii era cel care se ocupa si de Politia Gandirii  o formatiune care ii tortura fizic si sau psihic pe cei care comisesera diverse crime  reale sau imaginare   ii omora sau  in multe cazuri  ii vaporiza  orice urma a existentei lor era stearsa    Ministerul Abundentei era cel care rationaliza toate bunurile  mancarea  tigarile  alcoolul  pana la sireturi si lame de barbierit  Populatia Londrei era reprezentata in proportie de 85  de proli  proletari   considerati niste animale si deci nedemni de luat in calcul  restul fiind membrii ai Partidului Intern sau Extern  Membrii Partidului Intern erau  evident  privilegiatii  iar cei ai Partidului Extern erau victimele opresiei la cel mai inalt nivel  In casele lor se gaseau tele ecranele  niste dispozitive care transmiteau si receptau in acelasi timp  Desi puteai da sonorul mai incet  nu puteai niciodata sa l inchizi de tot  Cat timp te aflai in raza vizuala a acestui tele ecran  erai supravegheat in permanenta si numai dupa ora 23 30  cand se stingeau luminile si orasul era invaluit de intuneric puteai fi cu adevarat singur O alta modalitate de control si de opresie era Politia Gandirii  care la orice act excentric sau cat de putin suspicios putea sa te aresteze  Teoretic  in mod oficial  nu exista nicio lege care sa te impiedice sa faci ceva  Practic  prin orice act catusi de putin neobisnuit Politia Gandirii te putea vaporiza Partidul inocula  deasemenea  un anumit tip de gandire copiilor  Desi sustinea ca incurajeaza familia si afectiunea in cadrul acesteia  la scoala erau instruiti sa si iubeasca Partidul si sa spioneze continuu membrii familiei  din dragoste pentru Partid  ca mai apoi sa i denunte Politiei Gandirii pentru infractiuni  sub acest pretext  Partidul ii impinge  deci  sistematic  sa si tradeze propria familie Infractiunile erau numite  in mod general  crimagandit  Cuvantul provine dintr o limba fictiva creata de Orwell pentru acest roman  novlimba sau nouvorba Aceasta limba  pentru un mai bun control al mintii  isi propunea sa elimine toate cuvintele considerate periculoase pentru Partid  adica toate cele care aveau un sens dublu care implicau un inteles politic  Limba veche era astfel curatata de orice notiuni nedorite pentru a nu lasa oamenii sa poata exprima si cea mai mica critica la adresa Partidului deoarece  pur si simplu nu ar fi existat termeni pe care sa ii foloseasca  Cea mai buna explicatie a novlimbii a fost data in roman de un personaj secundar  Syme   Nu vezi frumuse ea desfiin arii cuvintelor  Tu nu  tiai ca Nouvorba este singura limba din lume al carei vocabular scade in fiecare an         Nu in elegi ca singurul scop al Nouvorbei este de a limita aria de gandire   Pana la sfar it  o sa facem crimaganditul literalmente imposibil  pentru ca n or sa mai existe cuvinte in care sa l exprimi  Fiecare concept care ar putea fi necesar vreodata ori icui va fi exprimat printr un singur cuvant  cu sens strict definit  i cu toate celelalte sensuri secundare  terse  i uitate  Cum crezi tu c ai mai putea avea o lozinca  Libertatea este sclavie   cand insu i conceptul de libertate va fi abolit  Personajele principale ale acestui roman sunt Winston Smith si Julia  care se lupta pentru a pastra un gram de umanitate in aceasta societate plina de opresie si restrictii nescrise  dar care sunt totusi grav pedepsite  Diferenta dintre ei este ca desi Julia este constienta de minciunile Partidului  este total indiferenta acestora deoarece nu ii pasa de generatiile ce vor urma  Winston in schimb percepe altfel falsificarile puse la cale de Partid  viata mizerabila si opresia  dar nu poate face nimic pentru a le opri  Datorita epurarilor din anii  50  60  toate persoanele adulte din acea perioada au fost vaporizate pentru a taia orice ar fi putut face legatura dintre prezent si trecut  nimeni nu stia sa spuna daca viata era mai buna atunci  deoarece neexistand un alt mijloc de comparatie nu puteai sustine nimic Finalul este deosebit de socant  si anihileaza orice urma de speranta ar fi fost ramasa pentru aceasta societate oprimanta Oamenii sunt desfiintati psihic  spalati pe creier  iar Partidul este unicul castigator Este unul dintre putinele romane cu adevarat impresionante pe care le am citit  Are

reason you will think this is because the author  George Orwell  wrote this book in the late 1940 s  He basically shows life in the future from his present time  This is a book about obedience  and complete control  as the story is about a man living in a world with no privacy  The government controls everything you do  see  and feel  With cameras covering the whole city  you have no freedom  It is really a book similar to Anthem  but 10 times better  and with that classical literature everyone loves  The book s story is about a man  who decides that he doesn t want to feel controlled  He starts disobeying the law  and does something that nobody in his time has really felt  Love  Yes ladies and gentlemen  a story of how feelings never felt before can change your whole life  and lead you to do something insane  What s really interestng about this book is how George Orwell describes the politics so vividly in the books presentThere are only 3 different  superstates  now  due to an atomic mishap Since then  All three are at war with eachother  With war on the loose  and the government trying to keep control of all its people  they came up with someone to watch over them  Big Brother  You may have heard of this many times   Big Brother is watching you  This is where it came from  Unfortunaltely  I have said too much Read this book  Understand how the government can turn against you  and can take advantage of their power  READ IT  Took me a while to read but I m glad I stuck with it  A chilling and sinister story  the feelings of hope and enlightenment in the first half of the book give way to horror and brutality followed in the end by inevitable surrender to Big Brother  How many people in the world today are living under regimes like this one  The most terrifying  frightening  horrifying book of all time  The Thought PoliceI have now read the most terrifying  frightening  horrifying book of all time  a chilling prophecy of a future that is both impossible not to read once you start  and hard to keep going in a lot of place  I LOVED 1984 by George Orwell  I now know that there is nothing that Stephen King or anyone else can tell that can ever arouse in me the fear  the shudder  the horrors of The Thought Police and Big Brother and the unforgettably disturbing O Brien character I never read this book in high school  so when it showed up on Kindle Unlimited  I snatched it   lucky for me  the audio came along with it  Double the horror  the terror  the fright  First  I begin by saying that I find it mildly ironic that in 1984  I lived in a place that was a figment of Orwell s predictions  in the Islamic Revolution of Iran  and while reading this difficult to digest masterpiece  the memories that I was certain I had long forgotten only came back into clear view  Winston was not a character you fell in love with or madly cared about  but he was an unfortunate victim of a mad world running on mad logic  mad government and mad laws  It was madness  I kept thinking as did Winston Smith  how can they do this  And yet they did  The bleak dark dismal world that George Orwell painted will remain intact in my mind for eternity  because it touched on the thing I fear the most   and that is something you do not forget easily The writing is exquisite  superb  thunderous to the beating heart of the reader which has already slowed down a good amount  The story telling is so powerful that sometimes you just draw yourself out of the plot and just listen with joy   did I mention I was listening to it mostly    listen to the art of writing  the perfection in the craft  If only the story were less dismal  less bleak  more tolerable  and I admit I almost put it down  I almost couldn t take it when they were discovered and then I thought  I owe it to George Orwell  I owe it to him to finish what he set out to tell us  and I will not stop until the very last words Someone commented that she hated Julia  I found this intriguing  I do put down books when I hate the main character or even a major secondary character but 1984 was different  I did not read this book to love or hate any character    there were no heroes here  and although I hated quite a few  I don t think love for the characters was the emotion that came to mind  Connecting with them and feeling their pain more than anything was my reason for staying with them to the end I have to admit there is one section I did not like   and could not appreciate   and that was Goldstein s manuscript  It was necessary to the story  it was important to Orwell to write that I am sure  but it took away from the story and the plot both  and it was deeply complex   I was glad when Winston put the book down and the story continued      but as I write this  I realize that not being able to appreciate this part of the book makes me more like Julia s character  and I wish Julia cared more about the manuscript too  But then again  what difference would it have made  None whatsoever A recent book I finished  which had another most chilling effect on me from a dystopian future was Margaret Atwood s A Handmaid s Tale  and I can see so many parallels between the two and after looking it up  I m not at all surprised that Atwood was indeed influenced by 1984 to write the story of the Republic of Gilead  a state ruled by religious fundamentalists  So if you enjoyed Orwell s 1984   yes I do realize  enjoy  may not be the appropriate word  ooooh I wonder what the Newspeak term for it would be       anyway if you appreciated Orwell s work  you will appreciate A Handmaid s Tale Next for me  Animal Farm  I don t expect an upbeat story in that one either  Oh well  it shall be so as it must be done  Hope this review helps you decide whether to read or move on from the book  And on top of that  appreciate the fact that you indeed do have the freedom to CHOOSE  a priceless gift that you would miss sorely if it were stripped from you by the Thought Police  Just sayin   I just want to honestly say that I feel like I should learn this book by heart  Consume it  And remember every bit of it  till the end of my days  Having read already twice  I still feel the need to read it again and again  I don t know if it s normal  but I don t care   ly lrGm mn lrhq lnfsy ldhy sbbh ly t dhyb wnstwn  l  nh ry     tstHq lqr   lm  sh r blmll llHZ   thn qrth  Hq nh

containing countless more enigmas  At the middle of the novel I was convinced that I knew what was happening and I was enjoying it quite a lot  Then suddenly at the ending of Part 2 something unexpected happened  And the whole of Part 3 was just a confusing and puzzling mess  Everything that I thought I knew and all the development that the characters went through backfired  As the novel progressed I learned more and more about O Brien  but in the end I know absolutely nothing about him  I LOVE THE WRITING  Everything about it appeals to me  It is just wow Nineteen Eighty Four is pure

the needs of the Party  Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in  which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother  symbolic head of the Party  In his longing for truth and liberty  Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow worker Julia  but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal Written in 1948  1984 was George Orwell s chilling prophecy about the future  And while the year 1984 has come and gone  Orwell s narrative is timelier than ever  1984 presents a startling and haunting vision of the world  so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish  No one can deny the power of this novel  its hold on the imaginations of multiple generations of readers  or the resiliency of its admonitions  A legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of time Review  I ve read only two of George Orwell s works   the other one being his memoir  Down and Out in Paris and London   And he s already one of my all time favourite novelists  Orwell gives us a vivid picture of what  hell on earth  would look like in this terrifying dystopian science fiction novel  The technologies described are synchronous with quite a number of the ones seen in today s world and many words used in this novel have found their place in English vocabulary   Nineteen Eighty Four  is a book that will remain a great work of modern literature for generations to come  It is eerie how many similarities there are between the reality of Oceania  the totalitarian surveillance state  and the United States  Driving this distress is the reality that  even though it is not as bad in the United States as it is in Oceania  this is probably only because the United States does not yet have the ability  because of technological or political reasons  to put its citizens under constant surveillance  Everything from Oceania s ability to monitor everything someone is doing through technological means  to what Orwell references as a blue helicopter peering through citizen s windows  Nowadays we have drones that could potentially do this if need be  In this world  the mere act of keeping a journal is seditious  punishable by death  or  at the very least  25 years hard labor  And Winston Smith is as seditious a character as there has ever been written  I read this book long ago  in for high school  I believe  I remembered the basic story line  and parts of it stuck with me all these years  such as the ending and having a major crush on Julia  But it wasn t until I read it again that I appreciated just how interesting 1984 is as a story and how good a writer Orwell is  One thing I completely forgot from when I read 1984 the first time around was Smith s reading parts of the book  The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism  by Emmanuel Goldstein  Smith taking us through the ideas laid out in that book is as fascinating at 1984 itself   absolute masterpiece  so much good to say about this  so many thoughts running through my head whilst reading this and so many thoughts still going through my head   RAZBOIUL ESTE PACELIBERTATEA ESTE SCLAVIEIGNORANTA ESTE PUTEREBIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  Classic  One to re read every decade or so  Fascinating that the original title was 1948  Bowie wanted to put his version on stage  Orwell s wife refused  and the result was the concept album  Diamond Dogs  You can see a snippet of what he had in store with live footage of that tour and the album is much richer when you have read the book  As an act of showing solidarity with the Egyptian Student who was arrested for reading 1984   yes it is a crime in our beloved Arab countries  I started reading it  Now I know exactly that it was a thoughtcrime  http   www theguardian com world 2014    Down with bloody Big Head  oops  that was another review for another book  Down with Big brother  If you want to see Big Brother  you will find him in places like Cairo  Damascus  Baghdad  Riyad     and other cities in the Arab world  I will not overlook the fact that the book is pleasurable  full of worthwhile ideas that make you think what people are capable of here are some quotes that stunned  shocked  scared the heavens out of me   others are just so beautiful either said By Smith Winston  the narrator or Goldstein in his book

dream scenery  are a continuation of one s intellectual life  and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake                            Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past                             It was not the man s brain that was speaking  it was his larynx                            The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words  but it was not speech in the true sense  it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness                           She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan                           Everything faded into mist  The past was erased  the erasure was forgotten  the lie became truth                            The heresy of heresies was common sense                            It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated  Whichever way you turned  the telescreen faced you                            No emotion was pure  because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred                            If you kept the small rules  you could break the big ones                           this game that we re playing  we can t win  Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds  that s all                             there was no such thing as happiness  that the only victory lay in the far future  long after you were dead                           and if I refuse to confess  they ll shoot you just the same                            The aim of the High is to remain where they are  The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High  The aim of the Low  when they have an aim    for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to                           The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses  mere feelings  were of no account                           If I confess  they ll shoot you                            If you can feel that staying human is worth while  even when it can t have any result whatever  you ve beaten them                             Winston stopped reading  chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading  in comfort and safety                            Goods must be produced  but they must not be distributed  And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare When war is an objective in itself                            War is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent                            Then war becomes literally continuous  it also ceases to be dangerous                            Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police                            The best books  he perceived  are those that tell you what you know already                           be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives    is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal                            From the point of view of the Low  no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters                            if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad                            Sanity is not statistical                           6079 Smith W personal note  This in not a name  This is an inmate serial

more interesting this way  Maybe this book was written for you  You know a Big Brother that is watching  day and night  You know that it talks from that place with no existance  authoritive and perverse  And you know people who want to be watched  who crave for that gaze  Maybe you have wondered what it is to be under that watchful stare  Well  you have a chance to know where it started  The irony  the poisonous sarcasm of the name  A Big Brother that watches over you  Not really a tirant  Not a bully  Not a god  A big brother  Now that you live in a world where everything  some even sugest  one day  our minds  can be uploaded and shared in a cloud  and many petabytes of information are filtered by those you should not be watching over us   they are not big brothers  just goverment    be curious  and read about the dystopia imagined by George Orwell  Now that search engines  online  always try to be one step ahead of us  semantically smarter than us  so we don t have to think  learn about doublethink  and the issues raised in this book  decades ago  Think  read  feel  By modern standards it is not a thrilling book and i would have given it a 4  but it is quite educational and it has a powerful message which earns it a 5 easily  It is a book one is served well by reading  however most people these days are not so naive as to think that there is no one watching you  not with the massive NSA scandal fresh in most peoples minds  but it underlines the importance of looking to our past and keep a damned close eye on those eager for power  and that is something that can never be stressed enough   A must read for those who and whose parents have lived in Soviet Union  This is a book that every living human needs to read  A powerful cry for freedom of thought an expression  This is a new favourite  love the way George Orwell writes  at some point in the future I will read  Animal Farm    1984  was one of those books I ve heard people praise all my life  but never read  probably because I never got around to it  but luckily I m glad I didn t because I don t think I could have grasped the complexities at such a young age  I was a bit apprehensive to read  1984  because I had a luke warm reaction to  Animal Farm  in the middle of last year  but both Orwell classics are day and night in gripping narrative  emotional sacrifice  and sympathetic characters  It s cliche to say that Orwell was ahead of his time with  1984  but it truly reads like a sci fi paranoia action movie from the late 80s  not to mention that Orwell created a manifesto for a fictional governance with its own lexicon  If you re looking for a book that encompasses the themes of  freedom  and  paranoia    1984  is the book to read  George Orwell orchestrates this dystopian world and the people that live in it with hair pin magnificence  and Winston Smith is his puppet for the dangers of thinking out of the legal status quo   1984   more than anything  is a book about the underlying desires in a puritanical world  and out of all the comparisons this book has drawn to today s social climate it s this on that resonates  I was impressed at how complex these characters were  whether they were hiding behind rebellious facades or expressing disturbing feeling spurned by living under the restrictions of the fictional Oceania  Orwell didn t hold back when explaining Winston s violent disdain for women  because the party abolished sexual pleasure  except for procreation in selected marriage  It s these kind of ominous details that make  1984  groundbreaking  it s a no holds bar analysis on how society s affect on the social psyche  Accolades aside  I did have a few negative critiques about  1984   like Orwell s meticulous mapping out of the Brotherhood s manifesto  It went on way too long and was more on the tedious side to be considered interesting  it felt like an unnecessary intermission  And the interrogation part could have been edited down a bit  it became repetitious and belabored  almost like Orwell didn t know when to end it  All in all   1984  is a fascinating read  and solidifies George Orwell as one of the most prolific writers in fiction  for his deep well of imagination and introspective style of writing  I d call him the Nostradamus of English Literature  I hope you enjoy and revel in this book as much as I did   Tam bir SAHESER     Distopya nin tanimi soruldugunda  bu kitabi gostermek yeterli olacaktir sanirim    Ayrintili yorumum  http   1kitap5yorum blogspot com tr 2      Definitivamente pasa a formar lista de mis favoritos  es un libro que a pesar de ser escrito en 1949  tiene mucho que dejar y es dificil creer que fue escrito en dicha epoca por el contenido del mismo  es inevitable no comprarlo con la realidad  te hace pensar  analizar  Es un libro triste  sombrio pero excelente Es una historia que habla de una sociedad sin libertades civiles basicas y un gobierno con un control completo y sin respuesta  manipulador y de censura  no existe la libertad de pensamiento  expresion ni sentimiento  un mundo controlado por una minoria y que mantiene al resto de los seres humanos en una dictadura del  Gran hermano   que a traves de unas pantallas dispuestas en cada rincon controla todo movimiento palabra que suponga un cuestionamiento del regimen establecido  una dictadura de pies a cabeza  con aires de democracia y justicia Se puede decir que estamos viviendo lo que es el principio de una sociedad orwelliana  Una sociedad donde se manipula la informacion y se tiene represion social  Definitivamente es un libro que da origen a muchos debates y discusiones Me encanto    George Orwell s 1984 is perhaps one of the most interesting dystopian literature pieces I have read in a while  As a result of reading this work  I have shown great interest in doing more research on the topic that would include reading The Iron Heel  1907   We  1921   and others to form a comparison among the dystopias that have come my way  Prior to this  I have read Brave New World  1932  and then Plato s The Republic and Edward Bellamy s Looking Backward  1887   both acting as a counterbalance to what I know about dystopian societies Nevertheless  1984  as described in the afterword  serves as a warning to humanity of what we would become with our current systems intact  What one will find when reading 1984 is the Socialist vision failed as human suppression of truth and pleasure reign over Ingsoc  Eurasia  and Eastasia  Different names for their philosophies  but essentially the same system   one built up from the grounds of hatred and desire for power  This book truly shows how people are seeking power and will do anything for it even if it must come to destroying minds and continuously revising the past  In conclusion  free will is not present in this society  The only people to have free will is the Inner Party  who have been successful at keeping their positions intact  The people have no say other than to continuously hate an illusionary figure that may or may not exist and love Big Brother  which also may may not exist  It is as they say  if they have control of the present  they control the past  which influences the future  If it is one lesson to be learned from this book  it is to make sure the desire for power or any other desire blinds humanity s conscious  otherwise  societies like this form  where certainty is gone altogether and only a present is existent  All else is gone  limited  or restrained by the other power in play  The first time I read this book  it was required for High School  I skipped the  book within a book  section  and skimmed the last few chapters  Then I watched the movie to fill in the gaps  The second time I read the book  I read it straight through  just out of High School  and I have to say that it scared the shit out of me for some reason  I ran with a lot of paranoid  drug damaged kids  and the book was a little to close to what everyone I knew was actually talking about  which somehow made all that paranoia seem justified and  true   Since then  I ve come to realize that  while great  it s actually a somewhat disappointing as a book  Orwell has written some good stuff  and there are sections of 1984 that are intense  But on the whole  it s ultimately unsatisfying  and knowing that the same man wrote Animal Farm makes me want more out of this book than is there  Still  it s well worth the read  Every child should be forced to read it so they  too  can experience the effect of an institution forcing a piece of media on other people  and then get a little creeped out by how it all works  And I highly recommend getting the paranoid   government out to get me obsessions out of the way early on in High School  so that you can read other stuff later when you ll appreciate it more     flnhy  twjd fy Tyt lbdy  wlknh nhy  mkhyf    w b br   dq hy  shbh btdhwq

prescient  terry gilliam s brazil is the monty python version of 1984    1984 was a very powerful book to me  I read it in my older years and would have liked to have read it when I was younger to see a difference in time of life and way of life  little tech to over abundance of tech   My review  spoilers below  view spoiler  The power of control over the population is a great risk as we begin to understand the needs of the people versus the party  The generic party has devised a system to control the population by watching everything they do  The power comes from the idea that they can see the persons thoughts by the  thought police   thus manipulating the population into  behaving  as they party intents  As we as a population become more connected with our  smart devices   the difficulty is now to live life knowing  Big Brother  is a real entity and is watching us and building patterns of control and marketing to control us  In the end the brain control of the party wins Winston s love and adoration after all the torture and mind games    The party wins  I hope to provided a difficulty to most  party  antics and fight the powers to keep from being won over to the  party  and the thought police    hide spoiler   Absolutely stunning  BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU Basically what Orwell tries to convey here is the reality of any establishment  The Establishment simply wants to play make believe  If you want to have your own perspective of things  it simply won t have it  Think about the colonial establishment  What did the British do  They built their own schools and colleges in the colonies and created their curriculum  A curriculum which would teach the natives their own religion  but only to the extent where it wouldn t do any harm to the British interests  In English literature  we were taught Jeremy Bentham s  Panopticon  theory  A Panopticon is basically an institutional building designed by the English social theorist in the late 18th century  The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe   opticon  all  pan   inmates of an institution without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched  Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once  the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times  effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly Orwellian political Big Brother replicates the exact same idea  Your behavior is controlled  the moment you feel you re at large the Big Brother will immediately catch you in the act  This is going to stay with me for a long time    really   really  got me thinking   Levaste pontapes  foste chicoteado e insultado  gritaste de dor  rebolaste no chao  em cima do teu proprio sangue e do vomitado  Choramingaste  imploraste misericordia  traiste tudo e todos  Consegues imaginar uma unica forma de degradacao por que nao tenhas passado  Assim se verga a vontade  se aniquila o espirito e a tentativa de rebeliao 1984 e o classico das distopias e sem duvida o melhor que ja li neste segmento  George Orwell tinha uma imaginacao brilhante   um tanto macabra  mas prodigiosa   so assim se explica que nao se tenha esquecido de nenhum pormenor e tenha feito desta obra o maior exemplo duma sociedade totalitarista onde o cidadao nao tinha voz  vontade ou autonomia  Sob o dominio permanente do Partido e do Grande Irmao eram vigiados dentro das suas proprias casas  todos os movimentos observados e analisados ao pormenor  recebendo informacao adulterada  viviam sem passado  sem heranca historica ou cultural  sem se atreverem a sonhar ou ambicionar algo  num clima de permanente desconfianca onde o odio era promovido gratuitamente  Viviam  executavam uma tarefa e morriam  Sos e com medo Mas o regime ambicionava mais  Para um controlo total  havia que desagregar completamente a mente humana e molda la a sua medida  Promovendo cada vez mais o medo e traicao  ate que nem entre familiares  nem entre conjuges houvesse confianca  Suprimir as emocoes  tornar o ato sexual um mero exercicio reprodutor e acabar de vez com o contacto humano  passariam a seres automatos e obedientes  A longo prazo a propria linguagem seria abolida e passariam a comunicar por grunhidos  A posteridade jamais ouvira falar de ti  Vamos suprimir te totalmente do curso da historia  Vamos transformar te em gas e lancar te na atmosfera  Nada restara de ti  nem nome num registo  nem qualquer recordacao na memoria dos vivos  Seras aniquilado  quer no passado  quer no futuro  Nunca teras existido  Uma antevisao apocalitica do futuro  No entanto  se pensarmos nalguns regimes que ja grassaram por este mundo  e se pensarmos no que teria acontecido se nao tivessem sido travados    Winston Smith is one of literature s great heroes  O Brien one of its great monsters  Okay  Smith is scared of rats  and suffers agonies of conscience and very real pain  but he takes on the state in his own small way  Big Brother is not someone to be worshipped  Hitler and Stalin gained power because people were slow to spot the danger  and there s Orwell s warning Read more here  including an article by me on 1984 s Central Character  Winston Smith http   www booksmusicfilmstv com Book    This is a great modern classic in which the principles of Newspeak are disclosed as the newly enforced communication in the year 1984  We read on only to feel despair about the future of man  We read about doubletalk   slavery is freedom  war is peace  etc  Such misleading jargon is being used today  People indeed are no longer  saying the opposite of what they think  but think the opposite of what is true   It makes the reader wonder whether human nature can really be altered through succesful manipulation of the mind  This is genius  Winston Smith lives in a totalitarian society called ingSoc or English Socialism  which rules England  Every bit of literature except propagandistic one  science except military one  any traces of humanity and compassion are forbidden entirely  You cannot keep even a personal diary  Instead what you have to have is hatred against an enemy and nothing more  There s a war between Oceania  Eastasia and Eurasia  This war is different for it is started not to achieve a victory over the enemy in the old sense of word but to maintain civil unrest  to keep forever the hierarchic system of power and control over the subdued masses that are called the prols or proletariats  IngSoc alters books  articles  statistics  people s minds  everything  even history  The prols believe that they had overthrown old capitalists and became the true history makers whilst they are not  The Party  well deserved analogy to communist one  kills and humiliates anyone who even started thinking in not a favourable way to the regime  There is no difference in the eyes of the Party between a thought and action  You think another way  you ll be vaporized in every sense of the word  The Thought Police will see to that  The sex is forbidden  Love is tolerated as long as it can produce children  future soldiers or mothers of soldiers  Winston is loathing all this  He wants a freedom in everything  in thoughts  in actions  in literature  in social life  He rebels against oppression and wants emancipation  He joined a rebellion movement called Brotherhood  Maybe that s one of the reasons why the writer also included a sexual life between Winston and Julia into the book  Winston and Julia were captured  tortured and humiliated  in the end They betrayed each other  This betrayal is slightly described not as a weakness against physical torture but as a normal thing when it comes to the mind torture  I kind of advocate this betrayal in the book so that the readers can fully grasp the sufferance and anguish the people of the totalitarian states must endure all their life   When I started reading this book  I felt like I was entering a new world that is different yet similar in many ways to the world we currently live in  The story revolves around an average person named Winston Smith who lives in a country ruled by an oppressive regime that tries to control everything people seem to care about  For instance  there is the Ministry of Love  which punishes any couple who develop the slightest inclination toward loving each other  There is the Ministry of Truth  which seeks to falsify historical events in a way that promotes the Party and helps maintaining an image of leadership and superiority in the eyes of its citizens Big Brother is a symbol of supreme leadership  no one knows if he is dead or alive  but everybody must love him unconditionally and never attempt to question his existence  Anyone who dares to express his hatred toward him will be considered as sick  and will be treated immediately by experts who will purify his mind and remove all doubts from it The Party uses various means to control and shape people s thoughts  Telescreens in each home  the Thought police  the concept of Doublethink  which relies on the idea that something could be true and false at the same time  Doublethink is a mind manipulation technique  which makes the victim be fully subjected to the oppressor and unable to form his own ideas George Orwell s 1984 made me realize that in the face of an oppressive and powerful dictatorship  it is hard to fight back and revolt because the problem has escalated beyond any single man s capabilities  I believe that Nature has its ways of dealing with problems at such a big scale  it might take it some time before it reaffirms balance once again  but as history tells us  Nature always wins  rwy   bqry      ynjH lktb l bqry fy twSyl sh wrh llqry  bTryq   bqry      Hsst w n qr h bZlm mn Hwly wDyq lHl km ysh r bTl lrwy   wynstwn smyth     lrwy  ttklm bshkl ry    n  nZm  lHkm lqm y

mysterious The protagonist Smith Wilson s transformation from a rebel to one who loves Big Brother was painful 1984 exposes the worst crimes imaginable the destruction of truth freedom and individuality The ending was also great I wish the story never ended I read two interpretations of the ending one in which Winston dies and the other in which he dreams of dying I prefer the first one But anyway the real Winston already died in room 101 Its definitely a must read The story of a man losing his originality and becoming the puppet of the party leaves you craving for more  lm  qr  shyy

depressing but so incredibly relevant today it should be read by everyone that didn t have to in school  George Orwell is so insanely engrossing to read as details spring forth constantly but with no superfluous over analyzation  You are Winston Smith once you ve gotten far enough  and then G O  adds a whole new dimension midway through the story to fuck you up even more  This book opens a perspective that your brain can never not see from again   good I knew this book was amazing but i had no idea just how amazing  This book is effing genius  The world is just   Mind blowing  So well constructed and thought out  Loved it The thing about this book is that it s so eye opening and enlightening and it carries such a deep message  and yet it was thoroughly entertaining at the same time The ending was not what i expected but i ve come to realize that i love sad and dramatic endings more that happy and cheesy ones 1984 was so complex and sophisticated that some parts took me very long to get through    spoiler alert  Like the part where winston was reading Goldstien s book which was solely political and required my full and complete attention It s one of the best books i have ever read  to be honest even though i spent a relatively long time reading it Also  the whole idea of Newspeak was absolutely flawless  I thought it added even more depth to the world and Ingsoc However  and truth be told  i thought there were some holes in the world building and i had some questions that went unanswered  spoiler alert Like  for example  if the party edits every book and every newspaper ever written so that it suits its ideology  what happens to the already existing copies and the published books  Does the party send people to recollect them every single time something had to be edited  Were they burned and disposed of and new copies had to be printed each and every time  And if so  doesn t that mean that the party has to spend tons and tons of money just on that process alone  Wouldn t that hugely affect the economy  Or were the people simply not allowed to own books Also  why  at end of the book  when Winston was set free did nobody pay attention to him  Why was it completely okay for him to speak with Julia and touch her without any bit of worry And what the hell is the deal with O Brien  Was he pretending the whole time  Was he so twisted that he was sane  Was he a part of the brotherhood but was so good at hiding it  Does the brotherhood exist at all  Sigh  so many questions  so many questions   This is one of the best books which I have ever read  I liked Orwell s thinking style and imagination  He gave information from future like Nostradamus  His abstracttion style is so normal and you really feel that utopic world  The torment which had been done to Winstone made me so upset and nervous  Being on the level it was so difficult to endure those happenings  I felt them  I imagined and Liked  I recommend this book  read it    Fantastic  And  very disturbing  The things brought up makes you think of society today  and how one should pay more attention to  and question  everything we are being told and shown  Things such as history  media  music and books even  1984 is really worth a read   Autorul propune o alternativa a istoriei care sa demonstreze publicului cititor ca in primul rand gandurile  iar in al doilea rand faptele  pot avea urmari greu de imaginat  Pentru ca da  de cele mai multe ori faptele urmeaza gandurilor  Gradul urias de constientizare pe care il implica natura umana nu este indeajuns pentru infranarea instinctului de a refuza ceea ce nu ne place sau de a exprima prin vis  ganduri refulate  Tocmai aceasta axioma este foarte bine inteleasa de Orwell si exploatata in toate sensurile ei

after all it wasn t written by Michael Bay  so it both had a good plot  and it had an actual meaning  This book is like a warning not to let computers and government take over and control every aspect of our lives  including what we believe  The main character Winston lives in a world in which anybody not affiliated with the government is constantly being tricked into thinking that their government is flawless  and always doing the right thing  They are also always watching each person s every move  and know everything they do  and will execute what they call  Thought criminals   which is the name they give to to anyone who has opinions on anything that opposes those of the government  Orwell s prophetic warning of our potential future is an important piece of advice which should certainly be remembered for years to come    Finished reading  July 6th 2014   Being in a minority  even in a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad    view spoiler  How to begin describing this little masterpiece    As you read 1984 it becomes clear George Orwell was way ahead of his time when he wrote his novel back in 1948  The vision of his negative utopia is easily to be called brilliant  a world set in the nearby future where personal identity doesn t exist  collectivism is the key and war is used as a way to suppress the masses  Reading about the lives of the two main characters Winston and Julia in this dystopian world where  Big Brother is watching you   is both interesting and disturbing  Orwell definitely hit the mark with certain points in his book    Examples include the mass media trying to control life  politicians preferring people to be ignorant and politicians using the continuous war as an excuse to keep peace and order  A definite must read Life in 1984 is made into a routine where individualism is a crime and everyone should live exactly as the Party orders  The world in 1984 can be seen as an aftermath of the Second World War and is divided into three states  Oceania  Eastasia and Eurasia  The three states are in continuous state of war and all governments use the war as an excuse to suppress their population  Every single movement people make is controlled by the state and disobedience detected by the Tought Police  by the telescreens placed in every home and public space and even by their own children who will betray them within a heartbeat to the authorities  Punishment  Getting arrested by the Tought Police and a almost certain one way trip to the Ministry Of Love  And trust me  things inside that ministry aren t that rosy at all  you can say things get pretty ugly inside Winston works for the Ministery Of Truth where he is one of the workers in charge of revising and changing past newspapers and any other messages so they don t contradict the current situation in Oceania nor the authorities  The Party with Big Brother as their leader believes that  he who controls the past controls the future   And that  he who controls the present controls the past    In short  they are falsifying history and people are behaving like brainwashed zombies and don t even seem to realize it  Unfortunately for Winston  he is different  He does notice something is off  but even only thinking about that is a crime  thoughtcrime  in Oceania and he knows it  The authorities are doing everything in their power to make people ignorant  even altering the language into one where there are no words left to express yourself Even when he knows it will be his end  Winston tries to defy the Party anyway and starts a diary  Things become even more dangerous when a co worker called Julia expresses her love for him and soon start a love affair    They have to hide their every move since love for the sake of love is forbidden in Oceania and can get them arrested  People aren t suppost to have physical interest in each other and only state approved marriages are allowed to  fulfill their duty  and create the next generation  Winston and Julia also get involved in an underground organization against Big Brother and manage to hide their relationship for quite some time  But no good things can last forever  and soon the day they dreaded arrives at last    I think this novel by George Orwell was one of my favorite reads of this year  Or at least one of my favorite classics  If you haven t read 1984 yet  I strongly suggest you do  Trust me  it s worth it  And if you already have  you probably know why I am lost for words describing this story     hide spoiler   P S  Find more of my reviews here   mndh ftr  thr khbr lqbD  l  Tlb bkly  lhndsh jm   lqhr  lHmlh lrwy  1984 skhry  lkthyr wn mnhm thkm

another favorite i have neglected to place  i read this first when i was 14  an old hardback at home  about the same time as great gatsby  i have read this at least 3 times  so an interesting intro to literature of ideas  something particularly bleak  the vision of switching enemies  getting your hate on  of power for sake of power  the essay on new english made me cognizant of the power of words to distort or even create realities  so many ideographic terms  from thought police to big brother  insures this will never become dated even now after 1984  hard to believe it has given a name to so called reality tv  have to be aware of the power of media only just becoming apparent at the time written  brave new world is the one to read for that http   www michaelkamakana com uncate    tHky

literature  Although  I am not a fan of gruesome and despicable torture tactics which the author made a point of adding it to the end of the book  I believe that George Orwell simply outdid himself with this masterpiece of a novel with the imageries  plot and literacy wise aspects that both entertained and proved to be in many ways a work of art that is ahead of its time  No wonder it was banned for a while Excellent read  I recommend it for all matured readers  Ever since I read Orwell s 1984  the one thing I have in mind is  most people are missing the point  Concentrating on one target and ignoring the other big threat   Concept of God  Religion  Religion has the full capacity to bring about Orwell s nightmare into reality  Probably it already has  All double talk  Discouragement of free thinking  Encouragement of blind belief  And religion promoters everywhere in the world constantly brainwashing us about how big losers we are going to be if we stop believing in God  Threatening  Ridiculing  In rare circumstances   Condemning  Outcasting  And in the case of revolutionaries   First trying to make them feel guilty  and then eventual murder  The problem can be solved if the 85  of the people  general citizens  start looking for the real truth and revolt against the biggest delusion of the human race  even bigger than Geocentrism   but as Orwell rightfully predicted  general people just won t care to revolt  in fact  they would be terrified to  And if somebody revolts  he ll be forced to believe just how wrong he is and feel enormously guilty about his revolt and then some more  Well  Orwell s 1984 is a true work of Genius  First half didn t do much for me   probably as the totalitarian distopia concept wasn t new  Second half brought the book into its own  however   so brutal and uncompromising  especially the last couple of chapters  which have a take on what we would do when faced with torture that I think is all too true  Comecar a ler um livro com expectativas altas nao costuma ser um bom pressagio para a leitura  Nao foi o caso  Adorei este livro e a pergunta que me faco e  porque demorei tanto tempo a pegar lhe   E me dificil acreditar que este livro foi escrito em 1948  E que continuaria a ser um grande livro se tivesse sido escrito hoje  Mas a verdade e que foi escrito ha quase 70 anos e continua hoje a ser um livro fantastico Vejo os classicos como obras primas da literatura  Sao no porque sao literariamente especiais  fazem um retrato de epoca mas geralmente respeitam uma serie de regras que so fazem ser sentido porque foram escritos em determinada altura  Nada disto se passa com o 1984  Este livro nao precisa de qualquer enquadramento para ser lido e apreciado  Nao faz um retrato de uma epoca  em vez disso apresenta nos uma sociedade alternativa e e brilhante  Atualmente estao na moda as distopias  lembro me por exemplo dos  Jogos da fome  e de Divergente    Sinceramente nao acredito que estes livros existissem sequer se o 1984 nao tivesse sido escrito  Acredito que este livro mudou o mundo  E a verdade e que nao mudou apenas o mundo de quem gosta de ler  Para o melhor e para o pior trouxe nos o conceito de Big Brother  de total ausencia de privacidade  Seria de pensar que quem le o livro ficaria com asco ao BB  No entanto alguem que efetivamente leu o livro  ou tera apenas ouvido falar da historia   lembrou se que seria interessante espetar com 12 pessoas em algo parecido a esta sociedade  Enfim   Poderia contar vos a historia  Seria tao facil faze lo mas isso iria  a quem ainda nao leu este livro  estragar a leitura  Para quem ja leu o livro  e otimo nao e  Da arrepios  nao vos parece  A logica subjacente a toda a sociedade e tao simples que quase da para acreditar que iria funcionar  Quase    Nao posso deixar de realcar a linguagem que o autor inventou para este livro  Horrivel a ideia de limitar a liberdade limitando a capacidade de exprimir ideias por inexistencia de vocabulario  E no entanto  cada vez menos utilizamos a fabulosa lingua que temos  limitando nos a nos proprios exatamente da mesma forma http   www ler por ai blogspot pt 201    nn n rf  n l  Hd yqbD  l  zmm lslT

establish a certain level of control over citizens  It also made me wonder about the tie between government and big corporations  Such things as vote buying   special  favors from Congress members  tax breaks for big corporations  etc  I am NOT by any means a big corporation hater or anti government person  I do believe we need a certain level of  control  and rules to follow  but just how far will it go  Can money and power buy just about everything  We are now required to carry car insurance  health insurance  etc  This was not the case 20 years ago  I wonder what it will be like 20 years from now  Where do we draw the line  Should there even be a line  What about your job  Suppose Big Brother starts  assigning  jobs to people according to their skills  Just some things to consider  Great book  Very well written  this book draws you in and gives you a chance to identify with a person living in a Totalitarian state that has been represented in the extreme   Increible como penso que podia ser el mundo en 40 anos hace 60 anos y mucho de lo que expone ocurre en muchos sitios del mundo With characters such as Winston Smith  his lover Julia  the symbolic Big Brother  and others

fictional genre     Cevremdeki herkese hediye ettigim   mutlaka okunulmasi gerektigini savundugum kitaptir 1984  One of the darkest  if not THE darkest novel I have ever read  1984 left me in horror for days after I ve finished it  This was the first time in my life I actually realized that such repressions and privacy limitations are something that is already part of our world  and though it is not in such a dark form and a combination of all of the horrors described in the novel  it still exists and is a regular cycle of our struggle with ourselves  Orwell presents a view of our society where we are incessantly controlled by police and government  something that is not far from our reality  and only accentuates our need to stand by personal liberty and individualism  The novel teaches us to be always on guard for our own freedom  to struggle on our own rather than be left at the mercy of extraneous agents  and to constantly exercise our rights  That s the only way to have a truly democratic society  a democracy that comes from the people not from a selection of higher class rulers  The images of Big Brother  the Ministry of Love and the Newspeak will always stay in my mind and keep me sane whenever I feel I may give in and forget about my liberties  Lumea lui Winston Smith este o lume degradata pana la absurd  o lume a inconstientei si indobitocirii  o lume a brainwashingului pentru putere  o lume in care trecutul este falsificat in fiecare zi  iar adevarul este travestit in favoarea unei logici bolnave    Citesti 1984 cu o vaga framantare de nesupunere  cu sentimentul ca ceva trebuie  trebuie sa rupa firul existentei mizere  Oamenii sunt manipulati pana la dezumanizare  nu mai au amintiri  sentimente  atitudini sau trariri care sa scape controlului politic  Cuvintele sunt desfiintate pentru ca nu mai au utilitate  iar arta in sine devine derizorie  Cand oamenii traiesc precum animalele  balacindu se in propria lor mizerie fizica si psihica  iar orice pulsiunea sexuala este folosita ca motor al masinariei politice  omul ramas in normalitate se intreaba daca nu cumva el este cel dement Citesti si speri ca cineva sau ceva va trezi acea lume din cosmarul existentei monstruase  iar in final descoperi cu oroare ca in fata durerii si suferintei nimeni nu este incoruptibil  ci oricine poate deveni gaunos  contradictoriu si lipsit de sens daca aplici torturile potrivite     Ce poti face in fata unui nebun mai inteligent decat tine  care sta si iti asculta argumentele cu calm si pe urma staruie in nebunia lui    I had to read this book for senior English and to be honest  I had been dreading it since I saw it on the syllabus  Everyone I talked to who had read it said it was one of the most boring things they had ever read  And was it boring  You bet it was  The first two parts  it is split into three parts  were extremely boring  Typical dystopian book  Controlling government  main character who is unhappy and wants to rebel  although unlike YA dystopian books  not even a young female protagonist I could relate to   love interest  and joining the rebellion  AND     a bonus that you don t find in YA dystopian novels     about 30 pages of political philosophy    SNOOZE  Okay  so admittedly I didn t like the first two thirds  which is most of the book  all that much  But wait  I thought that I knew where the plot was going  I thought Winston was going to join the Brotherhood and help overthrow the government  everyone lives happily ever after  the end  I never saw the plot twist coming  The  leader  of the Brotherhood was actually just fooling Winston into admitting he was against the Party  Who knows if the Brotherhood even exists      If you ask me  it was made up and even if it was real  it would never make any sort of progress   Everything  every  act of rebellion  that Winston had made throughout the entire novel had been FUTILE    The Thought Police had been watching him the WHOLE TIME  Winston doesn t join the rebellion and become a hero  He gets brainwashed  and becomes just like everyone else  That ending will stick with me forever because it wasn t a happy one  It was hopeless  This book made me think so much about what  knowing  actually means  about the role of government  and about our society today  This book was amazing  I was pleasantly surprised   Wow  This book gave me the chills and had my heart racing  it was terrifying and eerily familiar  The  book within a book  sequence was tough to get through  but I feel this is a must read for everyone  I am thinking that this book and Brave New World will be taught in tandem in the new AP lit class Update 4 17 14 I read this with my AP class and I think they enjoyed it more than any of the other novels we read this year  It really is timeless  To be read again     I started reading this book because it was the most recommended book  As I started reading it  I did not find it difficult to grasp what the author was trying to say  That is one of the unique parts of this book  Generally  in our elementary and high school years  upon hearing the concepts of dictatorship  totalitarianism  fascism and the like  we used to groan  NOT AGAIN      But Orwell s style of writing of this wonderful dystpoian novel is gripping and ceases to bore us  The amount of imagination used by the author in this novel doesn t seem to be far from reality  Though this is a fiction novel  we don t feel that the contents in the novel are hilariously out of the world  which is very normal in case of fiction novels  Though Orwell had written this novel in 1949 predicting what might happen in 1984  his predictions aren t completely fictional  Most of the times  knowingly or unknowingly  we are believing many concepts without using our logic and reasoning  Are we really rational beings as we proudly call ourselves  Think about it  A wonderful book  The best dystopian novel ever  Period  When first I started reading 1984 I felt annoyed and somewhat frustrated  The world in which Winston Smith lives is one of total dictatorial control  made clear by the first part of the book  When thinking about why  thank God we can still wonder WHY  this book annoyed me so much  it struck me  I felt  by reading about the world in which Winston lived  like my head was pushed under water and I was not allowed to breathe for just long enough as not to let me faint  The gasp of fresh air came in the form of a shop filled with little trinkets  A place where the so called  free past  seems to have somewhat materialized  if only in objects  All seemed to go well when Winston ends up renting a room above this shop and having a thing with another party member  Plenty of breathing for me here  But then    Back into the water  just deep enough to keep gasping for air  but too shallow to actually drown  The ending was somewhat unsatisfactory to my annoyance with the world created by George Orwell  Great book  great read  I dont know what to write after reading it   I will say  devastated  depressed and very sad  It was a magnificant piece of work  that describes to us how any ideology based on one view can destroy human soul  What struk me is how this ideology of big brother did not make execuses for what the party did of torture or falsification of history or dividing love in family or the double thinking philosophy and disinhibition of instincts like sex  it just said frankly that their aim is to make human as zero  as nothing  in order to keep life going on   We want power for sake of power  and all human lives are nothing but insignificant  All the universe is an image made by us  creating it and putting it in the mind  It almost describes an alian mentality  As if big brother or his concept is made to destroy humans    The story was written in 1948 describing the time of big brother in Oqyania in 1984  in the future  The world was controlled by Oqyania  in London   Orasia and Eastasia  It was mainly about Winston who was a simple member in the Party  by force  not by his will   An orphan who lost his family cause of the party  and has diffuse foggy memories about good warm moments with his mum  and little sister who disappear suddenly  The author was genious in writing this  not only to warn us from the communism at that time in 1948  but also in telling us how every thing can be a misconception or inception  The love story between Winston and Julia could not last  of course  as u would expect  There are no surprises here  and if the author finishes his story with a different ending  may be less depressing than what we got  then it would be a dissappointment too   I think  no matter  the darkness I saw  the apathy and indifference I experienced while reading it  just thinking that this novel was written will make me always not giving up  When I see all these people with brain wash around me  those who dont have a will  those who are deprived  or those who are just miserable by others  I know that they find a way to live  to survive  and transmit their hidden seeds of fighting spirit into the stars  or dust  or new future genes  I read the novel in Arabic  and I think the translation was very good  as I did not feel any interruption in the flow of words  or even the poetic expressions used especially by the internal monlogue of Winston  I guess  every one should have a different way how this story should end  Just one thing about torture  it was so described in details that it creeps u and u wish u just kill yourself instead of all this  I wonder how many totalist systems used these torture technique til our modern time by all kinds of regimes  I wonder how humans created torture  and how they became so creative in it  in destroying themsleves  Amazing to see how the leaders make the war as good way to step on the dignity and dreams of the ordinary people  so that the leaders get always safe  When the lower class loses all intellect just to find a way to feed the mouth  and when the middle class brag about the previlages  the tiny previlages they have this is how revolutions are terminated before they start I wish I could write more  but I am honest when I say  I am devastated   It s been a long time since I last read this book and I d forgotten the lengthy section of Goldstein s book  which gives Orwell a chance to expound his theories of power relationships  governments  and war  Naturally  I couldn t help but ponder the recent Cheney administration and the war on terror  It fits right into Goldstein Orwell s ideas about keeping a population agitated and fearful and how that makes it easier to govern  Some prescient pondering from Mr  Orwell  that   Also good to contemplate the ideas about limiting access to information  particularly about foreigners and enemies  and how this control of information allows for totalitarian control of a population  Freedom of Information is tyranny s biggest enemy If you haven t read this book before  then get ye to the bookinist post haste  Amazon Big Brother is watching  I last read this book as an assignment in 9th grade and did not like it at all  Although we had to write a couple essays about it  we barely discussed it  and very soon it was just shoved aside  forgotten  Three years later  my AP Lit exam is coming up and I decided to read a classic to prepare myself  I look through my bookshelf and see my copy of 1984  and think  why not  I ll read this one  IT  WAS  AMAZING I honestly cannot understand how the depth of this book totally escaped me the last time I read it  I think it was the sex  I was a very innocent child  and I remember very clearly thinking how disgusting the sex in this book is  However  I had just read three aSoIaF books just before reading 1984  and the sex in Martin s series makes the sex in 1984 seem like hugging  Not to mention that the sex in 1984 actually had a meaning  it was rebellion  For whatever reason  I did not realize this last time  I did not realize a lot of things last time  And if I was to reread this book in another three years  I am sure I will find even more things I did not realize this time or last time  The Party s brainwashing techniques and mind games were BRILLIANTLY TWISTED  And the whole idea that nothing is real except what you make real  like O Brien is flying is he and everyone else thinks he is  is just SO BIZARRE  I loved this book  I think it is one of my favorites now  up there with Harry Potter  the Gone series  and aSoIaF   Reading this  I felt every step of the way that one more push could cause me to denounce the book as over the top  but it always managed to keep itself in the incredibly uncomfortable realm of familiar hyper realism  Overall  this book is basically the instruction manual to North Korea  but even divided into parts  I found that I was relating various facets of the story to everyday life  The more direct suppression and surveillance reminded me of the looming police state whose musk fills the air in present day North America  whereas the aspects of thoughtcrime and Newspeak  more often than not  reminded me of the ultra  progressive  left  much to my unease  But then I suppose you know a classic by its ability to withstand the ages I feel captivated by this story structurally as well  The entire thing is very cerebral  with lots of chess like exposition  and where there is no dialogue  there is an airtight atmosphere of anxiety and fear  Much like Winston  the reader is not made to feel secure for a single moment  and in the only moment that serves as an exception to this rule  the reader  and Winston  pay dearly for their foolishness If you want a political thriller  then I can only point out the obvious  there is a reason why philosophy classes tend to have this book in their curricula  There is a reason why pirate copies of this book are shipped to countries like Iran where simply owning one could entail penalty  There is a reason this book won t die   ktb mhm     Glb an Hn bd n f   Hdthh f lyan   dh qbl lns l kdhwb  lt   lzmhm bh lHzb   wdh knt kl lsjlt tHk  lqS  nfsh  fn l kdhwb  tdkhl ltrykh wtSbH Hqyq        While reading  currently near the middle of Part Two  When 1984 first began  I couldn t help but feel that Winston and the other characters were rather one dimensional and that the storyline was mundane  However  as the book progressed  my interest grew  Orwell s portrayals of the totalitarian government and Winton s contradictory feelings to such a government   freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four  if that is granted all else follows   create a thoughtful and intriguing plot that leaves the reader asking one simple question  how will it end Also  by introducing Mr  Charrington and Julia  Orwell creates a certain hope for the reader  Winston can cultivate a loving relationship and experience new feelings while successfully avoiding the Thought Police  The addition of the O Brien s mysteriously hopeful atmostphere also seems to encourage a positive future for Winston and the world around him  I am currently at the part where Winston is explaining the loss of his mother and sister  and I m extremely curious about how the story will end After reading The story really began to take hold after Winston and Julia met with O Brien  For the first time  the reader is given a concrete hope that a  brotherhood  does indeed exist and could potentially hold the power to overthrow a seemingly unconquerable totalitarian state  Though Winston doesn t really learn anything new from Goldstein s work  he is inspired all the same  One of the most dramatic events occurs when Winston and Julia are arrested above Mr  Charrington s shop  I honestly did not see such a change coming  but I was actually glad that this wasn t a typical  happy ending   Winston s time spent in the Ministry of Love s holding cell is horrifyingly uneventful  though nothing really seems to be happening  the reader dreads where Winston will end up  presumably  room 101    O Brien s treatment of Winston is grueling and frustrating  O Brien clearly portrays how the government has the power to completely alter history  not to mention just how easily people believe what they are told  I felt the final ending  though admittedly a shock  summed up the messages of the book clearly  I also think it leaves the reader with a thought  don t let the government ever become like Big Brother  or there will be no hope for the future  During I am very intrigued  Sophomore year we read  Brave New World  and the idea of 1984 which was implied was that the book was a failure  compared to Huxley s  because Orwell had incorrect visions of life in the next 20 years  However  I find this book to be better than  Brave New World   So far it is easier to follow  What baffles me the most is how it is illegal to think  The concept of absolute power is well achieved  but it is impossible not to think  Even without realizing we are thinking what to do because we have to tell our body what to do while doing simple tasks such as brushing teeth  So far this is the only aspect which I cannot let myself believe about the book  Other than that the writing style makes me feel sucked into the life of Oceania and makes me want to contiune reading Review After finishing 1984 I was frustrated since the last line is  He loved Big Brother   which means it is impossible in Oceania to have your own opinions or to disintegrate the government  The last line gave up all hopes that I had throughout the book that Smith could break apart the power  Overall I really enjoyed 1984  it was my favorite summer read just because it followed one character so it allowed me to become apart of Smiths story  In addition it has everything from love  torture  future technology  betrayal  and dictatorship which made it interesting and not redundant  The book made me think about how lucky we are to live in a nation which grants us many rights and allows us to protest the government without harm  A brilliant prophecy of the career of Prime Minister Tony Abbott  The incredible seership of the Great Prophet George Orwell never ceases to amaze me  This is my favorite novel of all time  I ve read it many times  and I ll probably read it many more  It touches me on so many levels  It expresses the very essence of the human spirit and has so many metaphors about life and the society we live in  Orwell is such a great author that he does it in a way that is very easy to follow without introducing too many characters  Instead he focuses almost solely on the protagonist in a way that makes you feel that you are actually him  I can relate to the way he battles with his constant censorship  while keeping hope in the human spirit overcoming  I don t want to spoil the ending  but it gives me chills when I think about it  even after reading it more than once  Whatever I say about this book won t do it justice  You have to read it   yumknuk  n tSdWq  ya shy  bmkni  y shyin  n ykwn mzyfan  w Hqyqan  mn lmmkn Ht   n tkwn lSftn  mzyf  w HqyqyW  Gyr

brilliance but because in the back of my mind I know praising  the book  will set the Thought Police on me  Read it as soon as you can  This book is seriously    Wow  There is so much depth to all the characters and the setting and just    I can t even think of where to begin  so i ll start with the end  I read the last line at the start and i didnt think much of it and so i was reading the book knowing what kinda happened at the end  but when i read it at the end the sentence had so much more meaning to it  knowing all that he went through and i was choking up just reading it becuase i kept thinking that his last wish was to die hating big brother and die a free man and that ending just broke my heart into a million pieces and each of those pieces were put into a blender    I felt genuine fear and hatred and sadness and relief and i ve never felt so much in one book before  I was surprised at how much i understood Winston and his situation and though i was somewhat confused  i felt like i understood it  But i didn t want to because the reality of the pain and torture just wouldn t sink in and when it did  it hurt  I felt like crying and throwing the book at the wall in anger  This book was reli something more than i ever expected  sh  mw sf jd n   rwy  bttklm  n lZlm wlstbdd wlfqr wljhl bGD lnZr  n myn lmw lf w sn  nshrh mHtwh mwjwd  blHrf  f bldn   bir uluslararasi

list  When they gave me the book I immediately told them yes  I first read it twenty years ago in school  but I went ahead and read it again just to make sure  This is one of those classics  along with Fahrenheit 451  that should always be included in school curriculum  One thing I thought as I was reading it is that having students read this book today could lead to a more fun and engaging experience than when I read it  In 1995 1996  I remember being fascinated that the book was written in 1948 but it was portraying events that could actually happen in my lifetime  As I read it again I am still convinced that the dystopian society where Big Brother is always watching isn t too far of a stretch for the future  The unique opportunity that presents itself for teachers today is to relate this classic to books movies that their students are probably familiar with that follow along the same lines  Hunger Games  Divergent Trilogy  and Books of Mortals  Ted Dekker     La guerra es

 I really enjoyed this book  It was an interesting story line with suspense and detail  I didn t necessarily like any characters because one of the book s main story s characteristics centers around NOT having expressive emotions so I wonder if that s why Orwell kept them so dry  Regardless  great read   Thoroughly interesting book  I first thought it would be boring and old fashioned  however the political issues and tones and issues still questions political structure and ideology today  Not only that  but I did end up being engrossed by the characters themselves  The decriptions of even the most mundane and obsolete characters were thought out and viberant  At times  my heart raced a million miles a minute due to the plot lines and writing technique  Possibly above all else  without a doubt the most gripping and satisfying ending I have read in a while  Do NOT read this book if you want hollywood fairytales  It is satisfying because it is the correct ending to a very true at heart story  Wonderful  My interest in this book peaked when I began to see the stigma surrounding this book in it s entirety  I have seen multiple instances where somebody attempted to discrete another by merely denouncing they re mindset of that of a  tin foil hatter   using this book as a foundation  Having been given that impression you would think that one would never desire this book in their memory  It is a ride unlike any other  and due to that this book will hold a place on my shelves that I can t place many others If you get past the positions of the previous generation  and see the message within this book for what it is  it s amazing  The world in which this book was written was entirely different from our s current  Yet the message  in itself  still stands strong   to anyone who like dystopian type of society based book    this should be your number oneloved it          I have never read a more depressing novel as this one   If you want to keep a secret  you must also hide it from yourself   In 1949 when George Orwell wrote 1984  no one realized each and every quote from his novel is going to be so true in the future  yet more than half a century later  his dystopian vision of future is alive and in arduous good health  It s horrific to even think that your own children are spies of the government and will willingly denounce your own family to the thought police  Today s world is no different  whenever we search something on google  like a photo on Facebook or make an online purchase  we are giving not just our personal data but even our thoughts to these companies which are inherently controlled by the government  Indeed every apartment  every individual is bugged with a 2 way telescreen  The only way to keep our secret is to bury it deep down inside us and never think about it  The world of 1984 is a perfect metaphor for today When I started reading this book and came across sentences  rather ideologies such as war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength  The closest real life institution I imagined to this dystopic world was China or north Korea  but as the book progressed it turned out Mr  Orwell proposed the trap of a far worse ideology  A totalitarian institution which controlled your thoughts  where what is not banned is required  China is still authoritarian  which is less deformed face of totalitarian state  North Korea on the other hand is moving towards more of a totalitarian system  When George Orwell wrote this book way back in 1949  he didn t make a prophecy that the world will be ruled by big brother in future but it was a simple warning to the mankind  and he often proclaimed that 1984 could happen if humankind fell into the traps of big brother and started believing in everything he has to say  He gave a clear message that man should be aware of the assaults on his personal freedom and should defend his most precious right  the right to free will    It s a beautiful thing  the destruction of words    News peak   the party strategy for absolute thought control of the citizens by stripping them of the language needed to conceptualize resistance  Synonyms and antonyms are banished because they create shades of meaning and nuance of ideas dangerous to the Party s absolutist slogans and propaganda    He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past     1984 Book ReviewJ  Preston Huffman 3 30 11 1984 was written by the world renowned socialist Eric Lee who s pen name was George Orwell  Even though he was a socialist he hated communism and was extremely intolerant of intellectuals  He died at forty seven years and left behind some of the world s most moving books  including 1984  1984 is set in a world that has become a total communism  It is not only a communism  but totalitarianism where the government controls every aspect of your life  what you do  where you work  what you eat  and even what you think  The country called Oceania is led by  Big Brother  who is always watching you from hidden cameras  The people are constantly afraid of the secret police called the  Thought Police  who can arrest anyone for  Thought Crimes  which are thoughts that do not agree with the ruling party  Even though 1984 has come and gone  George Orwell s frightening painting of the world may still become a terrible reality  Almost every aspect of the book has some truth behind it such as the depicted circle of power  George Orwell describes a vicious circle of power in which the government is made up of the upper class and rules over the lower class  When the upper class gets out of hand  the middle class rallies the lower class with promises of a better life and over throws the upper class  The middle class then becomes the upper class and is oppressive against the lower class  They then stay in power for many years until they are also overthrown  The upper class in Oceania stopped this issue by eliminating the middle class with constant war and fake shortages   This was an incredible book but is not a light read nor is it satisfying  If you enjoy books with extremely happy endings  then this is not the book for you  1984 makes you rethink the way you look at the world  It also makes you confirm your political and world views  The book is an extremely emotional book that shows humanity at its best and worst and creates an all too realistic anti utopia  I tried not to regurgitate what has been previously said about Orwell s book because it seems rather futile and pointless to me  however  this is my rambling review and interpretation of Nineteen Eighty Four George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four is one of the most important  if not relevant  novels of all time  Set in a dystopian landscape where every moment of your life is being observed and scrutinised by Big Brother  an all powerful  all knowing persona  In the digital age of Skype  Twitter  Google and countless other social media sites  the entire history of you can now be seen on a computer screen for everyone to see  We tag messages with our current locations  take selfies whenever we feel like it and even find love on the internet  we are aware of other people looking at what we do but do we ever think about the big corporations behind them  Not often  What would Big Brother think of us Orwell s book was published in 1949 but Nineteen Eighty Four could have been published yesterday  I am very glad that I rediscovered this text  It has very much opened my eyes about the world that I live in  It s easy to think of Nineteen Eighty Four as a bitter satire of Stalin s USSR and perhaps the totalitarian regime in North Korea as a contemporary reflection  but there is as much of Nineteen Eighty Four in the United Kingdom as there is in those aforementioned places  The idea of  thoughtcrime  is a such a striking concept  maybe one day in the far future  for the sake of national security  our thoughts maybe monitored  making sure that we don t have anti government thoughts  This may seem like a far fetched or even trivial observation  which I can understand but look at the state of modern computers for example  20 years ago the idea of a 3D printer would seem laughable  We live in a year where the idea of a wearable computer  like Google Glass  does not even surprise certain people  Thoughtcrime doesn t seem too far away too me  give or take a century is my guess  give or take a few centuries  in hindsight   I think a lot of people forget about the love story in Nineteen Eighty Four  as the dystopian setting seems to be the main talking point about the book  Winston and Julia s relationship is a very real and naturalistic to me  they squabble and argue but also deeply love each other  cherishing each moment in the black and white lives  Simple pleasures like drinking  real coffee  become a milestone  in fact  just being with each other is enough  Winston Smith has his life turned upside down by Julia  she rekindles and reanimates a youthful lustful spirit in him  They are one  Julia does something to him that he can t explain  Love does that to Winston Smith  They know that their relationship will never last  it may be weeks  months or even years before they are caught but they will get caught at some point by Big Brother and there is nothing they can ever do to change that fact To me  Orwell writes love as something beautiful and meaningful but something will eventually die  no matter what  The world of Oceania and Air Strip One is believable  the world of the Outer Party  Inner Party and the Proles are living  breathing worlds  Orwell makes you live through Winston Smith s monotonous life  you feel the dread and everlasting misery There are so many quotes that are so powerful in this book  literally pages upon pages of memorable quotations  There are vast sections of Goldstein s book which could be used as genuine doctrine of political parties on both sides of the political spectrum  I am sure the politics of Nineteen Eighty Four have been discussed  debated and argued ever since it was published in the 40 s  so I think it s easier to decipher your own meaning to the politics of the book  I have also learnt a considerable amount about the philosophy and economy of war  the idea of three powerful nations locked in a state of permanent conflict makes so much sense economically  the outcome of the war is meaningless but rather the war is keeping Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia stable  I read a few chapters of Nineteen Eighty Four when I was around 12  I gave up but I loved the premise  I rediscovered the book about three weeks ago  my dad had given me a rather battered copy that he had been given so I gave it a shot  I think everyone should read this book  regardless of their political beliefs  or lack of  or agendas  even non readers should give it a go  It has to be read   n lyh  mlt nfsy kdh  _    rwy  1984 b d

 angosciante e molto relistico  La storia si svolge nel 1984  dopo le guerre mondiali e in un mondo sempre in guerra  stracolmo di regole asfissianti e dove i cittadini sono spiati in ogni istante ed in ogni luogo  costretti ad usare un linguaggio consono e se possibile in Neolingua  la lingua che il Partito e il Grande Fratello hanno imposto  Ogni opposizione viene punita  in maniera segreta e quindi perfino piu rumorosa  Il Grande Fratello ha creato schiavi ed automi  pronti a credere alla storia che il Partito proclama Ma qualcuno che non e mai del tutto sottomesso c e   Deve solo trovare coraggio per agire  E in questo caso questo qualcuno e Winston Smith  impiegato del Partito esterno che si occupa di correggere refusi  in realta inesistenti  da giornali  libri  film  audio  Lui in realta odia il Grande Fratello e presto iniziera piccoli atti di ribellione  Per tutto libro non si smette di vivere in angoscia e anche con un poco di speranza anche in un mondo cosi cupo e crudele

faculdade  reli dois meses depois e  de la para ca  ja li umas quatro vezes  E daqueles livros que nao deveriam sequer ser classificados como ficcao  ta mais para uma grande metafora da nossa vida  A existencia arida  vazia e cheia de frustracoes do personagem principal  Winston Smith  e agoniante  Da vontade de voce ficar se debatendo enquanto le o livro  berrando  FAZ ALGUMA COISAAAA   e ai voce percebe que ele nao pode fazer nada  porque os   poderes nem tao ocultos   a sua volta sao dominantes demais  O Winston esta completamente a merce da sociedade e do seu lider invisivel porem sempre presente  o Grande Irmao  Apesar deste livro ter sido escrito em 1948  esse mundo distopico ditatorial do Orwell tem tanta semelhanca com o nosso que chega a bater uma tristeza  Nao da mesma maneira como ele imaginou  mas de uma que talvez seja ainda pior  de algumas maneiras   e mais sutil  mais velada  Tanto que na maior parte do tempo nos nem percebemos  Somos escravos de modelos  expectativas e padroes  Somos controlados por informacoes que sao constantemente distorcidas para servir interesses de um lado ou de outro  Somos observados quase que o tempo inteiro  Quanto mais evolui a tecnologia  mais dificil e se manter alheio as influencias externas  E parece muito que isso tudo e uma questao de opcao    Talvez seja  ainda  Mas quem nao se enquadra e logo visto como o esquisito  o doidao  o riponga da maconha 1984 e uma viagem de reflexao  E o final    Diria que e um dos melhores que eu ja li  A primeira fase ja esta nos anais como uma das melhores de todos os tempos  e eu tenho que concordar   Era um dia claro e febril de abril  e os relogios marcavam uma da tarde    This is a copy of my review for this book in PBS  in case you ve seen it there  I happened upon this book by chance in the library  At that time I vaguely knew it has something to do with Big Brother and an Apple ad  but nothing else  I m glad I read it though  I think my perspective will probably differ somewhat from the typical American  Western  reader s  but I find the book rather amusing  especially the early parts  It reads like a satire to me  and many times I had to chuckle to myself  yeah  that s so true   It s like watching Saturday Night Live where everything is a slightly exaggerated spoof of the real thing  I grew up in a communist country  so I can appreciate a lot of practices mentioned in the book  for example the ever watchful eyes around you  the banning of true romances  the need for Party arranged marriage  the practices of unperson  including the act of removing references to someone from text or photos   the de emphasis of personal feeling  the heavy bureaucracy  the adulation of the paramount leader  etc   Although truth be told  on the last point the book probably pales compare to the current practice in North Korea   It s scary  it s suffocating  it s depressing  but it s so true  At first I thought that Orwell was so far ahead of his time  since at the time of the publication  there was no Iron Curtain and communist atrocities weren t well known  or so I thought   But now that I ve read more about Stalin s USSR  I realize he got his inspirations from there  Still  pretty insightful book if you ve never lived in that system before  Many people commented that it s a dystopian society in the future  Well I can tell you that there have been times in history in certain countries where it was very very close to being the reality  You should be thankful you re living in a society where you can afford to think it s way off in the future   Apart from the satirical content  I also find one idea very insightful  it s in the content of the little revolt book   and that is the suggestion of a 3 tier society  and how they ve been interacting and probably will continue interacting till the end of time  I find it so funny  in fact I laughed out loud when I got there  Here you go  all the revolutionary thinkers and philosophers of the world  thinking their brains off  and at the cost of sometimes hundreds  sometimes thousands  and sometimes millions of lives  about how to have a better society  And yet all they do is just to rehash and repeat what Mr Orwell has so clearly described before  It s what come closest to capture TRUTH compared to all the other things you see each day  Michael Moore  Occupy movement  Congress  Wall Street  the NK Kim Dynasty  Gengis Khan  the Russian Revolution  the French Revolution  even the American Revolution  and so on   Isn t it amazing The last thing I really like about the book is the love story  I love the love story  Some people will see it as cold  bleak  unromantic  bland  etc  but I see it as having everything  warmth  tenderness  playfulness  longing  heart  It s love  period  Especially the girl  she s obviously been described by the author as  the girl of your dream   She s hard to come by  but if you happen to know her  try to grab her heart before it s too late  This book is simply brilliant  Set aside all the political meanings behind it  this novel manages to establish a horrifying world that one can imagine living in  it manages to transfer you into that world easily and artistically  and it manages to show you and make you feel  in the most horrifying way that d give you shivers instantly  the true    or what it believes is true    nature of humans I usually quote the best lines  but I didn t do that this time  for various reasons   however I did manage to highlight one line in which I went out of my way to highlight   Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood   From part 3  chapter 3  I thought that was deep  and true to some extent    Warning    here be spoilers  Everyone is familiar with this story  I would think so on this site at least  and it is a timeless and haunting tale of government control gone to its logical conclusion  Total control over the masses from the time they awake right through their sleeping hours thanks to constant video surveillance  Orwell s prescient story is quite amazing in that there is now  according to a March 2011 article by the Guardian newspaper  one CCTV camera for every thirty two British citizens  I don t know of another novel  or essay or proclaimed prophetic message even  that has come closer to the actual truth the future brought  Along with  newspeak   the language of the government media outlet that gives everything a different meaning or false impression     we call it  spinning  the news these days when it is in fact just a nice way of saying  being the best and most palpable liar   Orwell again hit it on the nose of how this world has declined into a sick and malevolent place  Winston Smith  our  hero  of sorts  though not a hero in the classical sense and not even an anti hero in that the typical anti hero is caught in or aware of a bad situation but he has no interest in changing it but nonetheless ends up taking the heroic stance and winning the day usually at great personal cost to his own well being  but Smith is simply a man caught trying to have a few basic pleasures  strawberry jam and sex mainly     tho not in combination  and is betrayed to the  Thought Police  by the man he and Julia  his illicit lover and jam sharer  had been renting a room from for their many rendezvous which they thought were well planned  However  things are as bad for those who don t squeal on their fellow citizens as those who are caught doing what the law says they shouldn t so  again like today  squealing on  suspected terrorists  is thought of as patriotic even if there is no way of knowing if the person or persons accused actually are terrorists  They are simply picked up  perhaps but not always given a perp walk  and then they disappear into various black holes the U S  Government has set up throughout the world with no legal way for anyone   family  friends  their attorneys  though they have no right to an legal representation since they have no right to habeas corpus  no rights at all at bottom  and so are held incommunicado for however long their captors  again read  the U S  Government  deem appropriate or until the alleged terrorist succumbs to the torture    starvation  exposure  accidental drowning during water boarding  or complete mental breakdown as they are often held in a manner where sight and sound are completely deprived  chained to a spot on the floor  and gagged    commonly used and commonly shown restraint method used by the government and seen by millions of Americans and others throughout the world  will literally drive a perfectly adjusted human being into a mass of irreplaceable psychological jello in just 48 to 72 hours  And we stand by and watch it on the nightly news  these people in their orange jumpsuits chained down to the inside of a C 130 U S  Army transport plane and are told in the serious  sonorous voiceover that it is the only way to ensure control over these  terrorist animals   Of course  there s no proof other than some neighbor saying that this person is a terrorist  And what motivation would that neighbor have to turn in their neighbor  the cash reward from the U S  which amounts to about a decade of salary for people in the middle east     or simple revenge of a slight or argument they had with that neighbor some time ago and this was a perfect way to get even     or perhaps it s just that in the United States that neighbor went to that mosque built in the small suburb about some time ago and they ve seen other of  those kind of people  coming over to that person s house and the group would be there for hours plotting god knows what  sure they were cooking on the barbecue in back or playing badminton     but that s probably just a cover for the terrorist plots they were hatching      and of course without any legal rights  they certainly are guilty if the government says they are ok i ll just stop there     it s a great book that means more today than it ever has meant and will continue to mean more and more to thoughtful people as the years go by and we quite happily relinquish our rights  inalienable or otherwise  one after another until it will always be 1984  nh rwy  swdwy  bHtrf       ry   wjdt nfsy mnGms  bdkhlh wm khwdh  btslsl  Hdthh        tmn   n tbq  mjrd  Hdth  l  wrq blt kyd  nd ltqyym

nation of Oceania  It is astonishing how he envisioned a world not so different from the one we are living in the present  psychological manipulation  control over informations and history  use of language to control minds  The language Orwell uses contains many words coined by the author which are now common among us  Luckily  this book is in many educational programs  Higly recommended  I had heard so many good things about this book that by the time I finished it I could honestly say that the praise it got was deserved  Here we have a dystopian society in the 1980 s in Oceania   Big brother is most definitely watching every person  every thought  everything even a tasty cup of coffee has been altered so much it does not even resemble real coffee   they are given a substitute    The book is frightening in places   if you stop   really think about if this could happen    yikes     To be only allowed to think what you are allowed to think  For punishments to be incredibly cruel and in some cases fatal  You are constantly aware of everything you do and think and try and push those thoughts out of your mind For not thinking correctly  and going against what you were told was right here punishment is very harsh almost to the point of losing your mind  Love is not acceptable and black could be white if they say so and 2 2 may not equeal 4 here It is a strict society where people are more programmed by big brother then living free lives The book has haunted me while I have been reading it  Truly great book  Superb adaptation of one of my favorite novels  I love the way the scenes from the novel are moved around chronologically and juxtaposed differently  to give the feeling that Winston s days are interchangeable  like Groundhog Day  And then after he and Julia are caught  the storytelling shifts abruptly to linear  with the dialogue between Winston and O Brien distilled down to its essence  Powerful telling of this story  I don t scare easy  1984 chilled me to the core  And I detested the book even when I rated it a 5 As you probably know  1984 deals with a dystopian future where Big Brother  good job imitating it  Hollywood  keeps an eye on every human activity through cameras  privacy is a concept unheard of  standard and uniform are the normal and original thinking is frowned upon  But more than just the story  the real scare was the fact that this book could just as easily be rooted in reality If it sounds like an exaggeration  suffice it to say that soon after reading  I got paranoid about my college professors  simple actions by friends  and started questioning everything around without any basis  And all the same  I would recommend it  because paranoia is a small price to pay if it helps to diminish your ignorance  fyh fylm smh

trying to understand itself  Or how every book you ve ever read is just a different combination of 26 letters  Now imagine getting that brain melting feeling by reading something about politics  For 267 pages Simply put  1984 is a novel about a dystopian future  complete with an abundance of technology and an all powerful government feeding its people lies  It s also the story of a man  Winston Smith  trying to get by without drawing the attention of the Inner Party  While it doesn t look much like the society of the year 1984  it can be argued that the main points of the novel are incredibly similar to today s society  especially in the incredibly large technological presence  But hey  I m not here to interpret it for you  That s your job I believe that everyone should read this book at some time in their lives  just to gain a different perspective on things  I also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys classics  especially Orwell s other novels  and books about politics and intrigue 5 stars for making my head explode  I found I couldn t put his book down  It has such strong imagery and it s that vividness that really makes this such a disturbing idea  It doesn t matter that the time has long pasted with the new age of the internet  the themes are still relevant to our everyday lives  Winston s obsession with the truth and reality is so important these days were we can now  replace files and everything is changeable and mutable  It s quite heavy material and the ending  don t worry I m not going to spoil it  leaves you feeling very displaced  Making you think very hard what you would do and then come to the horrid enviable conclusion that you would have done the same I personally really enjoyed it  Certainly more of a plot and environment based tale than for character but I still feel that it was a strong book  it just depends on your preference  I would recommend to anyone with open mind who doesn t shy away from the dark realities of life  In this culture of surveillence we have today  just remember BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU Un libro completo Critica social  analisis de la humanidad  y del desarrollo individual como seres humanos Una

SAVAS BARISTIROZGURLUK KOLELIKTIRCAHILLIK GUCTUR 1984 by George Orwell is a dystopian novel that was published in 1949  It takes place in the year of 1984  in what we would today call London  England  in the novel  London is called London  but England is called Airstrip One  and Airstrip One is itself a province of Oceania  one of the world s superstates   The main character is a man named Winston Smith  a worker at the Ministry of Truth  Minitrue   where he alters  destroys  or creates historical records to coincide the recorded history with the past that the Party  the ruling governmental structure in Oceania  wants to exist at that time  e g   if the Party wanted someone to never have existed  all mentions of that particular person on record would be permanently destroyed  and new records without mention of that person would be produced   Winston secretly despises the Party  He meets a woman named Julia  who also despises the Party  contrary to Winston s initial impression  and they begin a supposedly covert and illicit relationship  However  they are found out  and the Party manages to  re educate  him to love and follow the Party and Big Brother  the possibly nonexistent leader of the Party  I find this book to be full of ideas that are extremely thought provoking and relevant  both in the past and in the present  For example  Orwell writes about how the Party can control reality by manipulating the perception of the general population and modifying existing records at will  A good portion of the Ministry of Truth is dedicated to the alteration of historical records  Winston once had to edit an announcement from Big Brother because it praised a certain Comrade Withers whose organization was dissolved later  thus shaming him  The Party also educates the population in deluding themselves into believing whatever it is necessary for the Party to have them believe  whether it is that black is white or that 2 2 5   This particular behavior of self delusion is referred to as doublethink  where a person can both believe and disbelieve something at the same time  e g   a person can believe that black is white when black needs to be white  and that black is black when black needs to be black   Orwell also happened to write 1984 as a warning as to where he thought the world could be heading  a world where there is no absolute  truth   Another thing the book mentions is that the world had the technology to make everyone happier and give everyone a better life  yet people who wanted power  power is apparently better than utopia  realized that if everyone was equal in wealth and education  than they would realize that the ruling class was unnecessary and would overthrow the ruling class  Thus the people who wanted to be rulers and the rulers themselves decided to waste the technology by creating things that would supposedly benefit a war effort  in order to keep the non ruling classes with less wealth and less education I recommend this book to most teenagers and all adults  I would not recommend this book to anyone not in at least 6th or 7th grade because they would lack the necessary comprehension to grasp all of the ideas and concepts inherent in the novel  I would recommend the book to  almost  all people at least in the 9th grade and above because they would have the aforementioned comprehension  or enough of it  Many ideas and concepts are interwoven together in this book  and they are worth the time to learn about and contemplate  if not to investigate further  sq ly lqdr tlk lrwy  hdy  mn Sdyq knt m rfty bh bD

emotions both you and Winston Smith feel  To be totally honest  I thought of this to be a futuristic society with lasers and cool guards  almost like the Hunger Games trilogy  I was TOTALLY WRONG  but I am glad I was  This dystopian society  Oceania  is one of three  with Eurasia and Eastasia as the other two  The principles of Ingsoc are similar but  different  in all of the superstates   If you are interested or read the book and are confused  go to the back of the book to fully understand what it is  The concept of never being able to think or speak out or really do anything that the Party does not want to you to is insane  especially living in America where these freedoms are undervalued  I was enveloped in the book from the love affair with Julia to the  view spoiler  imprisonment of Winston and reprogramming so that he would be corrected  hide spoiler    Ingsoc is pretty much English Socialism  and the principles of Newspeak and how an entire language could be adjusted to fit its needs  All the rich vocabulary is being eliminated and simplified  Your brain might hurt after reading this book  but the book needs to be re read to fully run through what happens and how some of these seemingly insane ideas are coming true today  A must read 5 5  A need to read in your lifetime book  If you have gone this long in your life and have not read this book  Then pick up a copy or steal one  This is a fundamental book for both Fiction and Non Fiction lovers Terrific  also scary  i can see why this has gained the reputation it has  was disappointed in the sad ending  though i suppose this was necessary for a dystopian story  Winston was truly a character that it was easy to relate to and you put yourself in his place easily  The romance was very good  although sad that in the end  the party  destroyed their love as well as everything else  i liked how  the book  was set up as an amazing and wise and sacred book  but was then totally brought down as a fake in the end  Perfect  A fiction that reads like history and mirrors the current state of totalitarian approaches by many governments  1984oo gezh    sain nom baina lee  Unekheer sain bichsen goio nom Gekhdee l

book was awsome  From beginning to end  Orwell does an incredible job of depicting a future in which there exists not a harmonios utopia  but a world in which all life is controlled by governmental forces of opression  a chilling world where all motive  thought  act of commerce  and even emotion is regulated by  Big Brother    Big Brother   the foremost entity representing Oceania  one of three supernations remaining after a devastating communist revolution that occurred throughout the world  controls every aspect of the main protagonist s life  Wilson Smith  From his thoughtlife  the kidnappings of mental malefactors by the thought police  to his linquistic repetoire  NewSpeak  a language manufactured and sanctioned by the State  devoid of creativity  short and efficent in form and purpose  to the history that he reads and knows about the world that existed before the rise of  Big Brother  and the one ruling Party  the government also erases any historical facts that create discrepancies within and between messages of state dogma   Any sign of deviation from pure adoration of  Big Brother  is censured severly  and those caught seeking freedom from such a sterilized and controlling society are never seen again  Wilson decides to resist  and in the end  is tranformed radically by his struggles  This book allowed me to understand that liberties  both personal and civil  must be protected dearly  and that freedom is a fragile and delicate endowment presented to mankind  and as such  must be protected at all times    La Guerra es Paz  La libertad la esclavitud y la ignorancia es Fuerza 1984 hace parte de las distopias clasicas mas aclamadas en la literatura universal  Ya son mas de 50 anos desde publicacion y cada vez la similitud con la realidad va incrementando  Yo lo considero como una metafora de la actualidad  gran parte de la poblacion es victima de un horizonte mental de su propia ignorancia y ni ellos mismos se dan cuenta Winston Smith es el gran protagonista martirizado por el gobierno totalitarista que oprime la libertad de los habitantes observando cada movimiento  nadie se salva de la omnipresencia del Gran Hermano  todas las calles  hogares  paredes  muros  en los billetes y relojes todos con el mismo rostro del enemigo del Estado acompanado de un eslogan que dice  El Gran Hermano te vigila  seguidamente la ciudad esta rodeada por cantidades de telepantallas que es por donde los partidarios pueden observar a las personas  Un mundo caotico atestado con las peores reglas y un regimen casi absurdo pero muy revelador en esta resena pretendo dar a conocer las crudas caracteristicas de la novela pero aun asi la hacen un gran libro y tambien argumentar porque es un espejo de la realidad  Winston es un gran personaje principal que es capaz de desafiar el trastornado universo que lo ataca  el muchacho odia a la figura omnipresente  tiene grandes deseos de escapar de la guerra a pesar de saber que es imposible porque la sociedad esta dividida en tres grandes potencias  Oceania  Eurasia y Asia Oriental que permanecen en constante conflicto por sus ideologias politicas y permanecer en el poder  Otro dato que no se me puede escapar es la brecha que separa las decadencias economicas  estan los  Altos  que tienen influencias burocraticas y poseen permiso de apagar las telepantallas cuando estos lo deseen  por otros lado confluyen los  medios  que tienen una estabilidad economica relativamente normal pero no tienen los mismos privilegios que los altos y finalmente los  Proles  que tienen escasos recursos y tienen prohibida la intimidad  estan vigilados por doquier y se constituyen por telepantallas en su al rededor  Ademas de todo lo mencionado  falta resaltar que los ministerios hacen parte del funcionamiento de esta sociedad  se encuentra el Ministerio de Verdad que se encarga de las noticias  espectaculos y demas actividades  sigue el Ministerio del Amor que rige las leyes  el Ministerio de Abundancia y el Ministerio de la Paz que se encarga de las guerras Pero eso no es nada ahora viene lo mas sorprendente de toda la novela y es la Neolengua el idioma oficial de Oceania es algo dificil de explicar pero es algo intrinseco en la obra y la forma en que funciona es impresionante  La Neolengua tiene como objetivo privatizar el conocimiento  embrutecer a las personas  limitar el pensamiento  desaparecer palabras fuertes o que expongan un significado negativo y propagar la ignorancia para todos los ciudadanos   que significa que esto  que las palabras como  Revolucion    desacuerdo    Pelea    libertad   entre este tipo de lexico esta totalmente fuera del vocabulario de las personas  esto quiere decir que no pueden protestar en contra del partido politico ni oponerse una forma muy eficaz de lavar el cerebro  La ultima palabra puede usarse pero de un modo diferente  por ejemplo   El pero esta libre de piojos  o  El cesped esta libre de sucios   en oraciones muy basicas y cotidianas  que no aporten un contexto en contra de alguien  En el caso de palabras como  malo  se dice  Inbueno  se incluye un prefijo y el antonimo  todo esto con el fin de tener un vocabulario muy corto y estrecho en intelecto Tanto es el temor de ser inteligentes hasta pensar es una accion vigilada  denominada como  crimental   donde la policia del pensamiento puede llegar adentrarse en tu mente y si ellos perciben cualquier signo de odio contra las campanas politicas  te  vaporizan  para no decir la palabra  matar   porque no les conviene tener personas con algo de conocimiento  son los autenticos espias Ahora la similitud que tiene con la actualidad es el simple hecho de que la humanidad esta embrutecida por esas  cosas  que segun ellos los hace  felices  pero en realidad son victimas de su ignorancia y ni saben  todo el futbol  la farandula  la television basura y musica comercial contribuyen a limitar el intelecto entre los ciudadanos  cuando pierde un equipo deportivo se limitan a llorar y no se lamentan por cosas realmente importantes como las situaciones del ambiente o problematicas de la sociedad en ambitos de educacion o pobreza  tampoco se les pasa por la cabeza leer un libro  solo piensan en cosas sin sentidos  La novela es un espejo a lo que estamos viviendo y quiza muchos no tienen ni la menor idea de lo que esta sucediendo  Por otro lado  las neolenguas buscan limitar el lexico   que pasa ahora mismo  son las mismas cuatro y cinco palabras que utilizamos  solo que aplicamos sinonimos y no nos damos cuenta  puede llegar a ser involuntario pero al menos ciertas personas se preocupan por tener un buen vocabulario y no pasar por ignorantes pero otros  ni lo meditan En conclusion  es uno de mis libros favoritos  me encanto como se refleja la sociedad y todos los disturbios y constantes luchas que vive Winston sirven como reflexion y aprendizaje  me falto mencionar mas personajes como Julia  Syme  O brien o Parsons  pero eso mejor lo dejo para que lo lean y no adelantar mucho  Es impresionante la forma en la que Orwell narra la cruda y espeluznante realidad  la depresion que inunda esa sociedad  1984 es una vision a lo que ocurre en nuestra realidad   This was such a thrilling read  I had heard so much about this book as it s probably one of the most talked about classics on my list  but I missed out on this in high school  Definitely worth the read  So many terms from this book are used in the media nowadays  Doublethink really got into my head hahaha  Big Brother is love  Big Brother is life  tjdwn r yy fy mdwntyhttp   kuwson blogspot com 2009 06 19    1984 is so brilliant and cynical and astonishing and truly mind boggling  I am in awe of George Orwell for creating a meticulous yet completely comprehensible system of government  and the way with which he constructs this novel  It is a classic for a reason  The slow build of the story really requires your full attention  but taking your time with this is oh so worth it  I think I can now confidently say that Orwell is one of my favourite authors of all time   Orwell simply got two things wrong 1  The year 2  That the government would have to lift a finger  We ve done it to ourselves  willingly  http   rosadeldeserto weebly com linc   Se devo essere sincera in un primo tempo non volevo recensire questo libro  o meglio  dare una mia opinione a riguardo  Non e un romanzo facile da analizzare  ma poi ho voluto provarci e spero che i miei pensieri non risultino errati o confusi Era da molto tempo che avevo voglia di leggere questo romanzo  L ho preso in prestito ma e rimasto mesi in silenzio sulla mensola  fino a quando non sono rimasta ammaliata dalla sua voce  e non ho potuto resistere oltre Mi aspettavo un romanzo difficile da leggere  invece  nonostante parlasse di temi importanti  e scritto in maniera semplice  con uno stile fluido che ti trascina nella lettura ed e difficile bloccarsi  Questo e sicuramente un aspetto che ho molto apprezzato ma  in verita  ho amato questo libro anche se mi ha lasciato dentro emozioni molto negative  angoscia  paura  rassegnazione  tristezza e incredulita Si  perche non e un romanzo facile  Non c e allegria e anche quel filo di speranza che sembra per un attimo illuminare la trama  si spegne del tutto In realta  soprattutto nella terza parte  mi sono sentita soffocare  avevo lo stomaco sottosopra  sconvolto  Pagine e pagine di ripetizioni che descrivono perfettamente il mondo futuro immaginato da Orwell   Ci incontreremo la  dove non c e tenebra   1984 e un romanzo distopico ambientato in un futuro in cui il mondo e suddiviso in tre immensi superstati sempre in lotta tra loro  l Oceania  l Eurasia e l Estasia  La trama pero si svolge in Oceania  la cui capitale e Londra e la cui societa e governata secondo i principi del Socing  e guidata dal Grande Fratello  o Fratello Maggiore  che tutto vede e tutto sente  Nessuno sa chi sia veramente  ma e possibile notare il suo volto e i suoi occhi sempre fissi sui cittadini  nei grandi manifesti in giro per la citta  Grandi teleschermi sempre accesi controllano la vita di tutti  i tuoi pensieri  le tue azioni  e il braccio armato  la cosiddetta Psicopolizia  e pronto ad intervenire in caso si commetta uno psicoreato Apparentemente non ci sono leggi scritte  occorre rispettare pero tre slogan presenti ovunque LA GUERRA E PACE LA LIBERTA  E SCHIAVITU  L IGNORANZA E FORZA Tre dettami che  a mio avviso  incutono gia una certa angoscia Il protagonista e Winston Smith  un uomo che lavora al Ministero della Verita  in cui si occupa di modificare le notizie dei giornali  a seconda dei pensieri del Partito  Altri tre Ministeri gestiscono la societa  Il Ministero dell Abbondanza responsabile per gli affari economici  il Ministero della Pace che si occupa della guerra  e il Ministero dell Amore  il piu terribile  che mantiene la legge e l ordine pubblico  Nomi assurdi per i loro veri scopi Il mondo in cui vive Smith appare cupo e triste  Tutti sono chiamati a vivere allo stesso modo  senza nutrire forti emozioni  come l amore  sono chiamati ad avere lo stesso pensiero  quello del Grande Fratello  e ad amarlo nonostante tutto  Sembrano quasi come dei non uomini  dei burattini  pronti ad eseguire cio che viene impartito loro  Dei giocattoli vuoti privi di emozioni  di pensieri  di opinioni personali  Non esistono rapporti  Si compiono atti sessuali solo per procreare  I bambini sono spesso le spie contro i loro genitori  La guerra e perenne  la fame persistente  Insomma  un mondo che sin dalle prime pagine soffoca  fa male  colpisce veramente cuore e stomaco In questo ambiente  pero  succede qualcosa di strano nel nostro protagonista  lui inizia a domandarsi cosa ci fosse stato prima  Come era Londra prima del Grande Fratello  Come si viveva prima  Il mondo era sempre stato cosi  Ed e nel momento in cui inizia a pensare e ad amare la bella Julia  che qualcosa si risveglia in lui  Smith comincia ad essere un uomo  con i propri pensieri  le proprie emozioni  un amore intenso  E scaturisce in lui la voglia di scontrarsi contro quel partito  di lottare per andare contro il Grande Fratello verso il quale nutre un sincero odio Smith inizia ad intuire che forse la rivoluzione puo venire dai prolet  se solo iniziassero a capire l importanza di una tale iniziativa  Quel mondo di persone lasciate a se stesse Per un attimo  quindi  si avverte una flebile speranza  Una volonta di cambiare la triste situazione  Di sovvertire le regole  Di colpire al cuore il Grande Fratello e ribellarsi a una societa dittatoriale che annulla l uomo Fino a quando    qualcosa si spegne  Julia e Winston vengono sorpresi dalla psicopolizia e portati al Ministero dell Amore Torture fisiche e mentali  Lavaggi di Cervello  Tormento Entrambi vengono come ripuliti dalle loro idee  Svuotati dei loro sentimenti e dei loro pensieri  Rimodellati secondo le regole del Partito Eppure  Winston per un attimo sembra resistere  ma  perdonate lo spoiler  quella terribile stanza 101 sara la fine anche della speranza Quando ti minacciano di farti cose a cui non puoi resistere  che non vuoi nemmeno immaginare  diventa facile tradire e rinunciare  Abbattersi completamente  Ma e la frase finale che colpisce senza pieta Sicuramente molti di voi avranno letto questo libro  Probabilmente lo avrete compreso meglio di me e ne avrete parlato anche meglio Io non so se le mie parole siano confuse o meno  ma quello che posso tornare a ribadire e che questa lettura mi ha sconvolta parecchio E un romanzo che si legge facilmente ma anche con la dovuta attenzione a ogni singolo dettaglio  Un romanzo che fa riflettere e che puo essere paragonato anche alla nostra realta Questi bombardamenti di messaggi fuorvianti  questa volonta di annullare l individuo  di spegnere i pensieri e le emozioni  e accaduto all epoca di Orwell  e infatti  da quel che ho letto e un puro attacco a Stalin e Hitler  ma  in un certo senso  succede anche ora  Dittature che impediscono la liberta di stampa e di pensiero ci sono anche ora  credo  Ci sono realta spregevoli dove non ci si puo amare E    l ignoranza e il modo piu efficace per un governo di imporsi sui cittadini  In fondo chi non legge  chi non si informa  chi non sa  e piu orientato a credere alle balle raccontate da un partito  Cosi come i cittadini del mondo raccontato in 1984  Tutti credono che il Grande Fratello abbia ragione  che sia da amare  che ogni cosa che viene detta e urlata attraverso quei teleschermi sia pura realta  Non importa se muta ogni volta  Non importa se l Oceania era in guerra con l Eurasia e poi con l Estasia  Se il Grande Fratello dice che e sempre stata in guerra con uno dei due stati  questa e verita Non e triste tutto cio Immensamente triste Tutto il romanzo e impregnato di pessimismo  di quell impossibilita di rivoltarsi  Tutti sono controllati  anche di notte  se parli nel sonno rischi di essere preso e torturato  di compiere un delitto terribile Una societa dove non puoi amare  pensare  riflettere  e terribile Insomma  tirando le somme  e un romanzo che DEVE essere letto  Un romanzo scorrevole ma che lascia molte sensazioni negative addosso  Perlomeno  cosi mi e successo  Mi ha lasciato inquietudine  angoscia  soffocamento  Sensazioni difficili da mandar via La terza parte  in particolare  e un vero e proprio pugno nello stomaco  L abilita di Orwell nel descrivere le torture psichiche e fisiche e sorprendente  Mi sembrava di essere in quelle celle  e sentire quei sgradevoli odori  Quegli individui magri e impauriti  Quei segni terribili di torture  Quegli strumenti macabri che portano l uomo ad annullarsi completamente Terribile  Davvero Eppure proprio per questo sento che sia uno dei romanzi piu belli  meritevole del massimo dei voti Insomma se non lo avete ancora fatto  leggetelo Se lo avete gia letto  spero che le mie parole non siano state errate  Ma  e un mio pensiero  e io mi lascio andare sempre dalle mie emozioni  piu che su aspetti tecnici o altro   WAR IS PEACE  SLAVERY IS FREEDOM  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH What  you re probably thinking to yourself  What are you talking about  What kind of nonsensical babble are you speaking of  They re opposites of each other  gosh darn it  It s a lie  It s all a LIE Well  you passionately confused person  I m talking about 1984 by George Orwell  aka one of the finest dystopian fiction ever written  You think that all they do is take love from you  You think that all they do is seperate you into faction  Do you really think that there s  view spoiler  some kind of a happy ending   hide spoiler  Hah  Aren t you cute  No  this book is depressing as hell  It s weird as hell in some parts  But here s the thing  George Orwell is right  It s haunting  Do you really want to live in that kind of society  Where your thought is monitored  too This book was also uber fun to analyze  Look  Yep  someone had a lot of fun  And I wasn t even finished with the book when I took the picture  I found 1984 to be an intriguing and insightful dystopian novel about the society and consequences of totalitarianism  The book takes place in a war torn world reduced to three super states  all following their own form of autocracy  I found it remarkably interesting as to how this book is what the author pictured the future  and how there some parallels even today  George Orwell uses a similar satirical approach in this story as he did in his previous work Animal Farm  I will admit  I myself found this novel challenging and difficult to understand  as this book may be considered far above my skill level  I urge all people to read this and to enjoy if for themselves  Amo odio al Gran Hermano  Libro

that needs to be said or experienced about the genre can be garnered by reading this and Huxley s Brave New World  Both books are somewhat prophetic  but 1984 hits far too closely on many marks with current society  Oceania is a world where power and control are the only things that really give The Powers That Be any sort of satisfaction  and the deprivation of the working class is the means of getting that  If you haven t read this book  you need to read it  And soon  before it becomes more of a historical document than a novel  And before it disappears     In 1962 Mother took little brother Fin and me by freighter and airplanes to visit her parents and siblings in Norway  The visit  lasting the summer  was extremely memorable  Her parents lived in a two flat near the new campus of the University of Oslo  on the outskirts of the capital  That was our base between visits to other relations  In this residential neighborhood  shopping was done at the roundabout of the tram line leading downtown  There was a small library located on the island so formed  a library with a shelf or two of English language books  On a first visit  I picked 1984 as I was already a science fiction fan and had heard of it  Since then  of course  I ve seen the Burton version of it on video  but haven t read it since  Memories of the actual novel are therefore sketchy  Naturally  as a ten year old  the sex scenes were quite interesting  but not attractive  Indeed  the whole novel was dark and depressing like the attic at my grandparents  where I slept  like the scars of the world wars which I had seen flying from Bremen to Copenhagen  like what the media said again and again about the threats of Communism and of nuclear war   Something everyone should read  Creepy yet believable  I really liked it in a creeped out kind of way  The story starts off by ten non related people that receives a letter that says each of them are invited to an Island  And then  all of the ten people accept the invitation and arrive to the isolated Indian Island  They go into the huge mansion and enjoys a great dinner with the new people  During the dinner  a guest  Anthony  suddenly chokes and dies  In the next morning  one guest s wife didn t awake  People start to suspect that the deaths are no longer an accident  but a planned murder  I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading suspense and mystery  It is a very thrilling book  and makes the readers to not stop reading  I give this book a 5  because the ending was very unexpected and shocking  Big Brother is God  No  I do not mean that because I was brainwashed by the Ministry of Love  Someone who can see you at every moment  someone who can hear your voice all the time  someone who knows what you re doing at every single moment  someone who wants you to love him unconditionally  someone who wants you to submit to his ideology without doubting or questioning or even thinking about doubting it  someone who can judge you while you dream  someone who doesn t want you to have sexual relationships without being married  and someone who will never die  is God  But that is also Big Brother  It is redundant to say what I said because religions are  at least most of them   in their core  totalitarian  The late Christopher Hitchens once subtly mentioned Big Brother while comparing religious people s way of referring everything  to a totalitarian judgement  to an absolute monarch  One more thing that I kept thinking about was how true 1984 actually came to be  Not much  for the modern world really  I don t buy the arguments that the NSA can check our phones  computers  emails  and Facebook  Yes  they can and they probably do but we all have the choice of not using any of those  The people of Oceania didn t have that choice  They had no way of getting out of the sight of the telescreens  Big Brother was omnipresent  But I cannot deny that some of it actually did come true  albeit not in the same degree Ministry of Love s torture is comparable to the Guantanamo Bay s treatment of prisoners  The continuous warfare is evident in the USA s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan  although I think this is just a coincidence  But the violation of freedom of speech is evident in countries where religion dictates the laws of the country  Take for example the people in Saudi Arabia or Iran who tweeted blasphemous remarks about Muhammad or Allah  We all know their fates  Even in a country where religion isn t that much of a factor in state laws  sometimes it can raise its ugly venomous head  Take for example Bangladesh  a country where secularism was one of the four basic ideals of the constitution  that was abolished later when some idiots who became leaders decided to make Islam the state religion   In 2007  a leading newspaper in the country published a cartoon in its supplemental magazine  The cartoon was about a guy asking a child what s his name  The child told the guy his name but the guy said that he should add Muhammad in front of his name because he is a Muslim  The guy then proceeds to ask the child what s the name of his cat and he replied Muhammad cat or something similar  I doubt the writer had any intention of insulting Muhammad  I m pretty sure the cartoonist was also a Muslim  So  what happened  you ask  Well  the cartoonist was imprisoned  the editor had to publicly apologize  and the government banned the highly popular magazine  The reason was for  hurting religious sentiments  It is all bits and pieces that came true  It makes you wonder if theocratic states like Saudi Arabia or Iran actually had technologies like the telescreens through which they could monitor the activities of people 24 7  what would they do  What would happen if they could know your thoughts  Would a slight deviation from the Islamic law be punished  Would they punish you for thoughtcrime  Does apostasy count as a thoughtcrime  Because essentially  you are thinking and making a conscious decision to abandon a faith and choose another way of life  If it does  then people are already being punished for  thoughtcrime   we just don t call it by that name This perhaps wasn t a coherent argument but I tried to share what I thought were some similarities  But perhaps I am underscoring Orwell s writing abilities by talking about the similarities and not mentioning how much of a well written book this is  It s a brilliant piece of writing that warns us of a dystopian society where totalitarianism breaks apart individuality  Where a human being is reduced to a mere number   6079 Smith W   A brilliant political novel as well as the exploration of the effects of language on our thoughts and the ramifications of psychological manipulation  The afterword precisely summarizes this book with a single question  Can human nature be taken out of humans so that they forget their longing for love  for freedom  for solidarity  which is to say  they forget that they are humans  The answer  Orwell says  is yes  you can t say you re well read until you ve read this  i mean  come on  julia  winston  the rats  and DOUBLETHINK and DOUBLESPEAK and NEWSPEAK and the way history can be manipulated  i think it was perhaps reading what winston s job was that first stimulated my interest in history   which  history and memory man  here i am  brilliant book  kind of a thriller  and yet a scathing remark on society   even more pertintent so long after 1984   I m not sure what to say about this book  except that I can see why it is a classic  The whole totalitarian regime of Big Brother  at the same time both totally banal and totally terrifying  has so many resonances with the modern day that it is scary how closely the author was able to predict what was going on  There are a few occasions when 1984 slips back into 1948  with the use of terms and phrases that seem archaic now  but these moments are few enough and disappear entirely in the latter part of the book  I did have a few problems with the misogyny of the main character  and by implication  that of the author   but this is swept aside in the powerhouse of the final part  I think I found this book so deeply disturbing because at heart I am a conformist  and I can easily picture myself doing all the things that the people in this book have to do to survive  though they are existing rather than surviving   That s not an easy thing to admit  especially as I would also consider myself middle class  just the type of person who is most downtrodden in this book  The lower class  the proles  have a relatively easy time of it living in ignorant bliss with their beer and their mindless entertainment  much like quite a lot of people do today  all you have to do is look around you to see that the proles are already here   The upper class  the ones in power  will do anything to stay in power  as the section of the rebel book that Winston Smith reads out loud makes clear  and here again we can see current day examples  with the spin doctors and career politicians who  run  our countries  In the end  this book is frightening realistic and perhaps we all have a part to play in not letting something like this actually happen  Big Brother is not watching us  we are Big Brother  Big brother is watching you   bdy  m rfty bjwrj wrwyl knt fy rwy  mzr   lHywntm jbtnysh bsbb twqyt qryth wlm

in 1949  Written in 3rd person  the book follows the life of Winston Smith  an average citizen of Oceania  one of three super powers that consists of Australia  America  England  South Africa  Greenland  and Iceland  Winston lives in London  or what once was London at least  Living in a communist society  Winston secretly harbors hatred towards the inner party  whom control everything in their world  the amount of food  supplies  your job  your family  even your ideals and beliefs  They monitor everything via giant telescreens and hidden microphones  even when one is in their own home   It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen  The smallest thing could give you away   Your worst enemy  he reflected  was your nervous system  At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom   62 63   As Winston attempts to find the Brotherhood  a secret group that apposes the Party  the reader learns more and more about Orwell s prophetic  nightmarish vision of the future  Winston is an average member of society in 1984  He is thirty nine  frail and thin  and a worker at the Ministry of Truth  Winston s work consists of rewriting the past  He takes past news stories  and rewrites them to agree with The Party s current political standings  A common example being  if Oceania were to suddenly go to war with Eastasia  when they were allied with them yesterday  all historical documents containing evidence to the contrary would be altered by the workers at the Ministry of Truth   Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date  In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct  nor was any item of news  or any expression of opinion  which conflicted with the needs of the moment  ever allowed to remain on record  All history was a palimpsest  scraped clean and re inscribed exactly as often as was necessary    34   As such a worker  and as someone who was alive before the Party came to power  Winston has developed suspicion as to many of their falsified statistics  Despite following the Party s solution to this  known as doublethink  He still wishes for a return to the way the world was before the party came into power  and so begins a search for the brotherhood  an underground organization that directly apposes the party in any way it can  Orwell doesn t waste time  His books are always just as long as they need to be  no more and no less  And so characters develop quickly  Their basic description and ideals are laid out quickly  and expanded upon only when major events occur in the plot line  But despite that  Orwell manages to shock the reader by bringing back many snippets of conversations  or even minor characters that readers overlook in their first reading   He was still recognizable  but he was not the same person any longer  His body had straightened  and seemed to have grown bigger  His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation  The black eyebrows were less bushy  the wrinkles were gone  the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered  even the nose seemed shorter  It was the alert  cold face of a man about five and thirty  It occurred to Winston  that for the first time in his life  he was looking  with knowledge  at a member of the Thought Police   224   Throughout the events of 1984  Winston comes to understand the how  and eventually the why  behind the Party s actions   We control life Winston  on all its levels  You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us  But we create human nature  Men are infinitely malleable   269   Winston learns the true nature of the Party  and is deeply sickened  But the Party has terrifying methods of inspiring obedience  as Winston soon finds out   You asked me once  what was in Room 101  I told you that you knew the answer already  Everyone knows it  The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world   282   Winston s mental willpower and will to survive are direly tested by the Party  easily forming the event that shapes the person he is by the end of the book From the first sentence  to the last four words  1984 s terrifying reality is mirrored in our own world in many ways  and is a must read for anyone whom wishes to better understand the motivation behind the governments of our world  Increible libro  Desde que empece a leerlo supe que no me iba a durar mucho tiempo    la historia me gusto  el final no me lo esperaba Tiene muchas cosas muy interesantes  en cuanto a la privacidad  a la manipulacion de las masas  la concentracion del poder y la ambicion  La edicion que lei tenia tambien un afterword escrito por Erich Fromm que valio la pena leer tambien  my opinion on nineteen eighty four should be self explanatory by my profile name god damn it  more people should read this fucking book  they also should read animal farm  homage to catalonia  and a brave new world  the latter by aldous huxley  a separate writer   but this book first and foremost  it s a good introduction into dystopic literature  a north korea lite  or to be more precise  DPRK itself is actually 1984 lite   a bleak future  best described as a boot stomping on human face  forever  where the Party controls the future  the present  the past  and alters reality under its whim I haven t yet to read the Indonesian translation  so I have no idea how well Newspeak translates to Indonesian  it s freaking awesome in the book  Orwell has an appendix in the end dedicated to describe this new English  where critical thinking  or thinking in general  is eliminated and language is merely a means of duckspeak  A perfect tool for perfect dictators ala Big Brother and his Inner Party 4 9 5  long live Orwell o  o  Do not read this until you want to depress yourself with the truth of how your society is going to become Single handedly the most wonderful  and most horrible book I ve ever read   An amazing book  with an amazing storyline and plot  How the characters interact and betray each other  and how they change is done better by Orwell in 1984 than in any other book I have ever read  The last about 1 3 of the book is the best part in my opinion  The ending was better than anything anyone else could have thought of  The way this book is connected to the politics of that time  and even today s world  is also amazingly well in this book  I highly recommend reading this book to anyone who wants to get lost in an amazing futuristic world and hear one of the best stories of all time told by one of the best storytellers of all time   People simply disappeared  always during the night  Your name was removed from the registers  every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out  your one time

lan   War is peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength  It s like these three phrases that The Party uses  summarize the entire book  Also  this is a frightening novel  It feels awfully presumptuous to be reviewing a book that is one of the most famous pieces of dystopian literature yet penned  so rather than review it  I shall simply give my take on this dismaying portrayal of future Britain  It may sound flippant  but I was genuinely and significantly affected by this book  This novel  bummed me out  and for no fewer than three days I found myself somewhat listless and despondent  I m not sure if it was the content that pressed so heavily upon me or the comparison of today s world against that of Orwell s mind  but something spoke to me in a very profound way  Living in these United States  I am afforded a set of human rights by the Constitution  however today s Britain affords its citizens no such luxury  I do not mean to paint Great Britain as some sort of oligarchical  or dare I say  Orwellian   super state  but the safeguards that prevent a disintegration of humanity in the United States are not present in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  Every day in major British cities more cameras are installed and more privacy is removed from the populace  I may be seeing specters  but I do wonder what Orwell would have to say This novel is hugely poetic and drastically depressing  It is not enough to simply tolerate the government  one must accept it  one must love it  Like Swift s A Modest Proposal the sentiments expressed are as poignant today as they were the day they were written  maybe even more so  One does not simply read this book  one feels it  The broken world in which Winston Smith lives becomes tangible  The helicopters and view screens cease to be elements of a story and start becoming the seeds of great and horrifying possibilities  It s hard to read  sorry  it s hard to feel  not because of inaccessible language  but because of sheer sentiment  This is one of my very favorite novels  What to say about 1984  Well  for me it s one of the best novels that have been ever written  Now that youth adult dystopian novels like The Hunger Games  Divergent or Maze Runner have become best sellers  I encourage to all its readers to discover this wonderful jewel from where all these novels have been inspired and of course also to the rest of readers  Spanish version  Que decir de 1984  Para mi es una de las mejores novelas que jamas se hayan esctrito  Ahora que las novelas juveniles de sociedades distopicas estan tanto de moda  animaria a todos sus lectores a leer esta maravillosa joya de la que novelas como Divergente  los Juegos del Hambre o El corredor del laberinto beben para crear sus ideas de sociedades totalitarias   This book was amazing  a definite must read and classic as there s nothing I can find to criticise  George Orwell s writing was beautifully descriptive with many memorable lines that continuously enhanced the quality of the book  One that stood out for me the most was the infamous slogan that the party used and was mentioned a lot   War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength   This slogan introduces the first idea of doublethink and the nature of the party who control their people s way of thinking and outlook on life and the world Big Brother  the party  the proles  Oceania and the rest of the world are genius ideas that are tied together perfectly  there s no confusion with any of them as all ideas are explained properly and we are supplied with just enough information  Big Brother is the leader of Oceania and dictates victory  loses etc  from the telescreen that watches it s party members with great vigilance  ensuring every action and thought is in line with their standards  Winston  the protagonist does not fall within this bracket as he experiences dubious thoughts that could cost him his life and he feels alone in his reason of thinking  He even goes as far as dangerously buying a diary from a prole shop and starts recording his different opinions and thoughts  Winston is a great character who has many attributes but just as many faults which are both developed as the novel progresses  Winston s development especially towards the end is an unexpected  shocking twist which is horrible in one sense but also fantastic in turns of unpredictability  The supporting characters are also written well with deep complexity and jaw dropping personality U turns The brilliance of the dystopian setting comes hand in hand with the unique  compelling plot which draws you in from the first few pages  I loved where the story went and the struggles the characters endured to get there  This book  without a doubt deserves 5 stars as it contains an engrossing story  with in dept characters and a captivating world  I d recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading    To hang on from day to day and from week to week  spinning out a present that had no future  seemed an unconquerable instinct  just as one s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available   Amazing and frightening at the same time  1984 makes you change the way you think about what true power  control and paranoia really means  Biz azad deyilik  I feel like with classic books  there is not really much to say that can be original or has not already been said about them  In any case  as this is my first encounter with this book  I will give my review nonetheless  I am astonished at how perspicacious and insightful George Orwell  He wrote a book about a dystopian future  creating and imagining a world that is not that different to our world today  more than half a century later  In the book he writes the manifestos of an oligarchy that controls the world he describes and the struggle of an individual to set himself free in such a world  simply by trying to hold on to his own thoughts and go against the thought control regime  while struggling to maintain his memory s integrity and dispute the party s offering of a past that is once again controlled and defined by them to serve its needs and propaganda  Sovereign thought is the greatest crime that can be committed  as the Party has built a fortification to eliminate free thinking to extend its control over humanity  starting by censoring and controlling press and then taking complete control of the supply and demand of its people  Even geography has succumbed to the political control of those in power and as a result the continents have been reduced to 3 new ones  Oceania  Eurasia and Eastasia that are always at war with each other because once again this serves other purposes  Theoretically  a party that is in utter control of its people to the extent that they can control even their thoughts should have created a world that suffices in everything  Poverty  malnutrition  war and illiteracy should have been eliminated  but they are not  because even if the Party has everything available for its people  it does not give them everything as this annihilates a hierarchy that needs to be maintained  A part of the population needs to be illiterate  because only then they are not a threat and this is reinforced by the Party s motto  Ignorance is Strength  This is true  the question is who is it strength for  The book starts with metafiction  its main character is writing a diary describing his dystopian reality for future generations to read and keep as proof of a past that existed  The difference between Orwell and his character Winston  is that the former predicts this dystopian future  while the latter describes it and simply wishes to document it  Winston lives in a world where the past is falsified to be accommodated to the convictions of the Party and the only way to have any control over the past is through memory that cannot be shared with others  which renders it unworthy as the past can be proved or exist through written records like history books or photographs and collective memory  If the party controls both  then the party controls the past that has shaped the present that contributes to the future  Individual memory does not matter  as the party has the power to annihilate and remove any individual like Winston from the past anyway The extent of the foreshadowing and predictions happening in this book and how relevant some descriptions are is very astonishing  The influence of the book even until this day is evident in the use of the Party s slogan  Big Brother is Watching You  for a popular reality show  A lot of the younger generations are familiar with this slogan but for the wrong reasons  In my opinion  it would be a nice ironic touch would have been for the producers of the show to offer copies of this book to every contestant participating  Orwell s theory on war  tv and how control of available material can be used as not just propaganda  but to control one s way of thinking by limiting his available information  as well as the use of surveillance and the threat of it is incredibly insightful and ahead of his times  Even though the ending of the book is not optimistic and it does not really offer any way out  I think the essence and purpose of it was not to provide an emergency exit  but to be thought provoking therefore it has served its purpose Truth is I have not been this excited about a book in ages and I had a very strong reaction to this that made me want to read every single line written by George Orwell so suffice to say I strongly recommend this book    Over the summer I have read quite a few good books which may be on the 20th century side  but are quite the classics which give you a lot to think about  The first one I ll explore is George Orwell s eerie world of 1984  Although the actual year of 1984 was far from it  as much as my 1980s history knowledge goes   let us jump back in time   or in a way the future as this was written in   1948 or 49   I m sure it was written in 1948 and published in 1949 since Orwell originally planned to name the book 1948 then just swapped the last two numbers   Anyway  On with the review The Story   5 5 stars There are 3 parts to the book   the introduction  the rendezvous and the finale  Despite there not happening much  literally   the story still keeps you glued to the book The introduction is just that   the part where Orwell entraps you in the world he envisioned and explains it  Albeit the confusing beginning  once you keep reading in for a few pages you begin to understand the gears of this chaotic dystopia  Orwell s slight obsession with communism  well more of him hating it  not in a good fanatical way  shines through here with the totalitarian setting  As we go along with the thought rebellious  or  thought crime   perhaps  See what I did there     yeah  you re laughing     Winston Smith  we discover an earth quite different from ours  or is it   dun dun DUUN   I should get more serious  seriously     But this is not just any world   this is a world which will  as they say   give you the chills   There is no independence allowed and you are always watched  literally  Cameras everywhere  Did Orwell by any chance give creators of CCTV any ideas  I wonder       Either way  there is a lot of irony and a lot of hypocrisy  the Ministry of Peace dealing with the war  Classic     It was a twisted world which was always at war with something  at least that is what all the citizens of Oceania are made to believe  It is but a world full of lies and terror as we find Winston Smith s job   falsifying the past  There are many more points I would like to make on world building  but that will come later The rendezvous  It all begins with a love note and then we have a rebellious couple of Winston and Julia  Julia is quite the wicked wench and her impurity is just what draws Winston towards her  Most of this middle section is pretty much the development of their relationship  albeit quite a weak one based mostly on lust  But it does not end there  The so called Brotherhood  of whose existence no one is sure  apparently reveals themselves to Winston  This was a strong yet predictable move on Orwell s side  It is strong as we see a build up of resentment and rebelliousness within Winston towards the climax of the story  This very build up however is also what made it a predictable move  Not everything turns out as planned however and there comes one of the biggest plot twists I have seen  a disappointing one in terms of morals though And so in the finale the loose ends are tied  The story is wrapped up nicely  not literally   The finale section is most likely one of the most dreadful couple of pages I have ever read  As strange as it sounds   good dreadful  The whole concept and situation was very frightening  despite you knowing you are perfectly safe within your own house library park wherever you are reading  The entire time you are reading until the end and thinking  It couldn t possibly become more horrifying   you then find out that Orwell has a nasty surprise up his sleeve for you  You could never be quite sure what was going to happen yet you still had hope  Orwell brilliantly ripped out that hope and trampled on it  leaving you with a heavy heart once you finish the story The Characters   3 5 5 stars Winston  An interesting little fella who just happened to be the oddball in the most dangerous place to be an oddball   Orwell s 1984 universe  His hatred of the party is actually understandable and his intellect shines through to the reader  He has an open mind and knows when he is being fooled  mostly  If he knew all along  the ending wouldn t have been so tragic   Being the outer party member  in human language  we would refer to it as  middle class    he knows the ins and outs of the ministries  at least his own   he knows how he should behave and what to avoid  Keeping in mind what kind of a world he lives in  that is pretty amazing Julia  A shallow little tart who hates the party as much  if not more  as Winston  Her shallowness was rather annoying what with her falling asleep on important philosophical lectures and discussions with Winston  Perhaps it is my memory which has been killed by time or was she not really introduced with a background story and why she hated the party  Oh there are plenty of reasons to hate it  but what was Julia s Big Brother  although not really appearing   With all the given hints  it seems that this is just a fictitious figure of the party  It seems to me like Stalin left quite a mark on this character O Brien  Oh  holly macarena  Now this was a twisted character in more ways than one  I cannot honestly claim that I foresaw the plot twist on his sake  it was quite a shock for me as to who O Brien was and his real purpose  As they say   it s always the quiet ones Goldstein  Was this but another fictitious character with whom the party could diagnose traitors and offenders while also giving a common enemy  Orwell have left that a mystery  yet his style of gnashing your hope gives me the impression that Goldstein most likely was another fake enemy The Others  Well these were just the minor characters  They were important in a way  and they were not  Mostly because a lot of them became  unpersons    Writer s Technique   5 5 stars Orwell s style is bleak and blunt  why am I thinking of knives now      so it goes without saying that this story s tone was perfect  The style created a depressing and hopeless atmosphere  perfectly reflecting Orwell s 1984 universe Let us get to the world building then  The idea of falsifying the past is quite a scary one yet a realistic one  This was influenced of course with communist USSR under Stalin s tyranny  The way Orwell presented it however and the background stories he created almost made it his own creation  Many of Orwell s inspirations came from the same place such as the delusional and bizarre idea that 2 2 5  The way this view however was forced was indeed very scary  Orwell played his cards well in contrasting the calm demeanour of the torturer and the agonising prisoner who had to accept those views as one can take a certain amount of torture before actually wanting and beginning to see what his tormentor tried to make him see  even if it was complete baloney A certain phrase however really shocked me to the core    You  Are  The  Dead    I was amazed again and again at Orwell s masterful skill in creating shocking and smiting remarks which once in a while just hit you right in the   feels  I guess  I m not sure how else to describe that Overall   5 5 stars This is a very dark dystopia which gives you a lot to think about  It is a favourite type of book of mine   one that stimulates the brain and one that engraves deeply emotionally  Every time I think about this story  I still get the  chills   It was far from a  pleasant read   but more of a very interesting read To summarise This is definitely not a book for children or those who love a good light hearted novel with a good romance  I think I would even go as far as to categorise this in a way in the horror genre  as the last part of the book definitely qualifies for that   As I have mentioned before   this is a stimulating read so if you like these sorts of books  go ahead  Personally I have enjoyed it  but I am a very weird person  And so that is all   Thank you so much for reading Original review  1984 Review on my Book Fox blog For sometimes you may be fortunate enough to come across something that will not just inspire and hold sway for only a sheer flimsy swing of the pendulum  until the curtain is swept aside by a debonair ally  For Nineteen Eighty Four had such an elemental influence on me that I have not been able to formulate anything beyond a few garbled grunts of appreciation  even after years since I first picked this up  But armed with determination and a whole day ahead of me  paired with the bright prospect of endless cups of coffee from the spanking new coffee machine now gracing my kitchen  I urge my fingers to magically churn out something that might be to a crude degree intelligible of my deep and ardent admiration of Orwell and this masterpiece  Nineteen Eighty Four primarily tells the story of one man Winston Smith  a common two legged product  and launches him headlong into a totalitarian society that is governed by an almost mystical invisible force  Invisible because it is everywhere  From the oppressive posters of Big Brother staring down from every corner and turn of the alley  to the telescreens that cannot be switched off and is used perhaps as further instrument to spy on the residents  This world is a far cry from the known  It is divided into superpowers and Airstrip One is what used to be England  now forms the mainland of Oceania and is where the story takes place  The elite dictatorial oppressors of Oceania exercise an almost god like sway over the country  wherein they control not just the physical instruments of the society but also the psychological  So much so that thought is governed and any deviation from that prescribed by The Party is subject to execution  Minute inflexions in facial expressions and demeanor are monitored via the aforementioned telescreens  a hole in the wall  children who are but soldiers and everybody else in between and any suspicion of diversion from The Party dictated truths are sure to find themselves erased off existence  The oppression is complete  In 1984 power is absolute and total and in the hands of a few  It is a world where fear  isolation and morbidity need not veer their tentacles through shadows  but stare blankly through each solid moment of wakefulness  and for that matter even in sleep   For those familiar with the story it is easy to derive examples of historical references to the story  to the Stalinist era  and as a warning against the dangers of a totalitarian communism but my interest lies in the stark limelight that the evolution of the social structure is thrown into  Like Animal Farm I am more interested in what this novel pertains of the future and perhaps even the present and certainly of the condition that is humanity that seldom bends with time  Most Dystopian fiction rely on the inevitable turn of the Giant wheel that brings whatever was and dresses it in the relevant garb of the century  Arguments have been made whether we are currently even living in Orwell s 1984  Let s face it  there is no absolute truth  Historical negation has never been a new term and history is but a few astute observations that had to be written down to be  accepted   Often  it is from the dictates of power that negation replaces with the next formidable truth  In 1984  Orwell uses the example of a transformative language  Newspeak that replaces the any advent of true expression that inevitable launches a society with a mental handicap  Such power is fluid and is strong  thus capable of replacing some truths with different truths  and the capacity to differentiate has been snatched long ago  To bestow on the propaganda  the media is vital to the many pronged attack  The loss of individualism purported from being told what to think  how to be  who to marry  how to live  any of that sound familiar   becomes so apparent when Winston advents on the dangerous idea to put in ink the shadow of the thoughts that have been swirling around this head for some time  but when he starts about realizing this scheme  the pen feels unnatural to hold  the scribbles are childish and the act drives him into such a state of shock that the thoughts that he so sought to write of desperately and at such great risk to his life  almost escapes him  Nothing is perhaps as fearsome as the loss of freedom  Many a war has been to preserve that vital necessity  But what of the freedom of thought  What remains  when that power is snatched from us  SHyH n twq t lktb mmkn tkwn mHSltsh lkn mkny  Hdwthh ls  mwjwd ltTwr  l  kwkb lrD  mr  m kn HT mstqym dy m kn f  wqw  w khTwt

Zm hdfnlktb ry   w nhyt   jbtn    1984 is George Orwell s dystopia novel that have setting about after world end  Just like name of book  the setting of book is 1984  When George Orwell wrote 1984  the world was dominated by fear of communism  The communism of Soviet spread quickly than american and Europe s thought  Though this 1984  George Orwell warned the idea of totalitarianism  government s power abuse  and dominating civilian s freedom  Yes  this novel has something in common with The brave new world  If brave new world warned the world that people don t need to read the book  George Orwell s 1984 warned the world that people can t read the book because of government  In this 1984  government control people s idea with the power  like soviet  and Nazi  Interesting thing in the novel is  the way of government to control civilian s idea  is already used in history overall time  For example  just like last scene of novel  making people betrays his friend is used during Holocaust  And some of the way like remove the verb  or word  is still used by al qaeda  which is dictator of Arab  Through this novel  reader will feel sadness  hopeless  and scary  by reading this book  we need to prepare ourselves so no one can dominate ours mind  and stop the dictator  Brilliant book about a dystopian future brought about by the  perfection  of politics and The State  The last act is particularly terrifying  both in raw descriptions of torture  and in the systematic breaking down of the human mind Curious  I couldn t figure out if this would be a favorite of Conservatives or Liberals  I think that either side of American politics could cherry pick parts of it as supportive of their point of view The book should be read for the cultural references alone  There are so many words and phrases you will have anew understanding of based on the reading of this book  bbsT      rw  m ktb fy lsys     stkwn dy man w bdan mrj  llrwy yyn    wlSn  l flm    lnhy

with relevance as each year goes by What can be said about this book that has not already been said  Orwell s despondent view of an evil utopia hits all the right notes  His vision into a near possible future is stunning  depressing and all too understandable  A warning  a final prophesy written by a spirited visionary in the final stage of his life Many have read this book early in their youth  most likely as part of their educational upbringing  1984 and Animal Farm are standard  pedantic texts battle ready for disaffected youth to sink their teeth into  This book  among the greats  seems boundless in the echoes and touchstones resounding within its tome  In revisiting the text many years later  one will find that Orwell s words seem strangely even more relevant than they were at first blanch  Perhaps even more so than they were when original meted out and scratched into paper during the author s self imposed exile in the Scottish isle that was his final home so many years ago  There are so many elements here that have such deep and broad depth that will keep this work of literature relevant for many more years  Orwell invented the terms  Big Brother  and  Thought Crime  and dove unrepentantly into issues of privacy  personal freedom and individualism  All this before the revolution of the internet  He also fretted over the degradation of language  OMG   and the breakdown and bastardization of society s communal bonds  family bonds  bonds of friendship and the abolishment of simple love  His vision of a mechanized society  one that even turns books out by machines   is more than a decry by a luddite so much as it concerns the debasement or obliteration of the individual and sense of self  Orwell s main thrust seems to be right at the heart of man and the core inner lust for domination and power  simply for its own sake  That ever present evolutionary tendency to thrive at all costs without purpose or direction  and the ability of that singular impetus to take over and distort all else toward its own end  He digs that up out of the blackest parts of the human heart and disgorges it upon the shoreline of society receding tide as if to say   This too is what you are  Do not kid yourself  For me  this book was rough  The tone was bleak  Throughout  Unflinchingly somber and hopeless  Yet  the story of the protagonist and his struggle amid this world turned upside down  is relatable and believable  Despite the obvious despair and immeasurable odds  we do feel for Winston Smith  the protagonist  and we do root for him  We follow him in his desperation to find something  some way to express himself and make a dent in the impenetrable wall that has become the totalitarian society which he is a part  We feel his constant fear and ever present distrust of everything  almost  The little glimmers of possibilities  even when they are squashed  keep your interest and balance the grim gray that pervades everything  One thing that struck me was that the female character Julia  is an interesting addition  She has a good amount of gumption and serves more than just a goal or love interest  She is fleshed out pretty well and adds a lot of dimension to the story by sharing the protagonist s goals  but also coming from a slightly different more realistic viewpoint  Another thing I found interesting in reading this book in present time was how insular the story is  We are just as stuck as the protagonist  All news of the outside world and the society is filtered to the reader through the regime in power  We never really know who to trust or when something might be real or made up or mere speculation  Nothing ever really seems certain  The story never ever escapes this   there is never an Oz like  Man behind the Curtain  moment  Not really  We are told how some things work  and sometimes by sources that are deemed more reliable than others  but we don t truly find out  This tight view point  keeps up a claustrophobic feeling that forces the storyline to remain connected to the protagonist s individual struggle  Even though Winston Smith is concerned with larger concepts and a revolutionary struggle on a society level the story remains individualistic  However  the tale is not a man s struggle with himself  it is a man s struggle to find himself among others  the interrelatedness of things and how important that is  The totalitarian regime in power has distorted this effect and is manifesting control by continually putting up road blocks and pseudo constructed  societal norms to hamper true progress and growth  Even still  the individual struggles to find their place in society  As the story goes on  I think it is clear that most of this doomed society continues to struggle with this  And the powers that be  must expend an immense amount of effort and expense to constantly suppress this  In the end  can that really work  Have a care  Big Brother is watching Podcast  If you enjoy my review  or this topic  this book and the movie based on it were further discussed debated in a lively discussion on my podcast   No Deodorant In Outer Space   The podcast is available on iTunes  YouTube or our website  my link text www nodeodorant com   No se como comenzar esta resena  pero intentare ser coherente  Postergue la lectura de esta novela por anos  aun sabiendo que posiblemente se convertiria en mi favorita una vez que lo hiciera y que era probable que pusiera en palabras coherentes muchas cosas que pienso y que creo desde hace muchos anos 1984 es un libro que nos cuenta el proceso interno de un hombre llamado Winston Smith que empieza a cuestionarse la verdad sobre un regimen totalitario en el que esta inmersa y cree ciegamente la sociedad La novela  publicada por primera vez en 1950  parece ser un claro reflejo de lo que es el mundo hoy en dia  con un monton de medios tecnologicos que apuntan a un dominio y un control de las masas de manera tan sutil que parce ser todo normal La trama nos inmiscuye en la mente de Winston y en su transmutacion desde el pensamiento a los hechos y luego a su resignacion  en una oligarquia que no ha dejado nada a al azar y que ha aprendido de todas las dictaduras para mantener el poder  y eso es mutilar todo sentimiento ajeno al odio y a la lealtad a la patria y por supuesto al partido que les domina Hay tantas frases  tantos conceptos y tanta verdad que rescatar de estas paginas que ninguna resena que una aficionada como yo pueda hacer le hara justicia a lo que senti a medida que avanzaba  Pero dentro de mi impresion puedo decir que es una lectura que no dejara a nadie indiferente  Que esta llena de matices y retrata de manera tan creible el dilema de un hombre que comienza a ver los vacios en la historia de la revolucion y que aun asi debe actuar para evitar que eso lo lleve a la muerte  que uno se hace parte de su impotencia y de lo irrisoria que muchas veces es la verdad Demas esta decir que recomiendo este libro una y mil veces  pero si por algun motivo alguien no esta interesado  al menos que lea el capitulo 9 de la segunda parte porque es tan revelador y pone en palabras simples lo que muchos pensamos acerca del como esta distribuido el mundo Sabemos que nadie jamas toma el poder con la intencion de abandonarlo  El poder no es un medio sino un fin  No se establece una dictadura con el fin de salvaguardar la revolucion  ni se hace la revolucion para establecer la dictadura  El objeto de la persecucion es la persecucion  El objeto de la tortura es la tortura  El objeto del poder es el poder Kala itu London tak lagi

wordpress com      1984 by George Orwell is a very good book and I recommend to everyone  It s very horrifying thinking about living in that world in which your own children are undercover spies for the government and I think this shows control over people in all aspects in their lives  For example  in page 19  the most private thoughts can eventually be discovered by the thought police  and tried as treason against Big Brother  Everyone lived in a community where dictatorship takes place in  Big Brother is everywhere in posters watching everyone  But he is never actually seen  I think this a symbol that he is the face of the government  Overall  this is a good book because it shows how dictatorship is bad and oppressive to the people  Easy read  but not a happy storyThis book made me really question my understanding of human nature  truth  and individual importance  The book took no wild turns  I knew just as Winston did that there would be no happy ending  Even so  I think it was important to read  one of the greatest books I ve ever read  wq y  Hd ldhsh l bd  ny s  yd qrth qrybdf tny l  dwm  mn ltfkyr   rd  lnsn w m  ryd bh w lh   mwq n wmwqfn mn l lm   lqdr  w l jz  lwq

rwy   bqry  one of the best book i ever read  This book totally distroyed whatever optimism and faith in the human race I had left   seriously I will skip the part where I say that the book was so well written  the language perfect  the visual affects present  etc  I just have to say that I am amazed at the accuracy in which Orwell writes about the  future  for him  the 80s  for us  the history of our kind since the 30s until now and God knows if we are good enough of creatures to avoid these events in the future  The idea of the negative utopia is not new  but the collection of the atrocities that governments commit and people of different nations accept has never been as accurate as he described in this book  What devestated me the most about this book is that I am just like any  prole  in Oceania  i might believe in certain ideas  i might condemn certain acts  but I have stopped trying to do something about it  The Party and Big Brother had absolute controle of life  of history  of people  of past  present  and future  not just because they were brutal and unforgiving  but also because before it came to existance  people had been indifferent  busy with their own little lives  vulnerable to manipulation  and accepting of ultimate state power  Orwell tells us what we know but won t admit  any idealogy can be manipulated to give power to a group and oppress another If you look for books with happy endings  this is not one of them  and not in the sense that the protagonist dies  no  it is a fate way worse than dying  it s love  and you will only understand it when you read the book I took my time reading this book  coz it was really hurting me to read it  and feel my hopes for a better world being shattered into peices  but if anything I learnt from the story of Oceania  is that the power of a nation should always be questioned  and that  political stability  is overrated  and often indicates a silent population  I definately feel myself leaning even more towards Anarchism after reading this book Definately one of the best books i have read  This is my fifth book for the Back to the Classics Challenge  2015 Frankly  the book was never in my to read list  I simply read it because I had a two in one copy of Orwell s classics  Animal Farm  which I always wanted to read  and 1984  But I liked the first one so much that I simply could not resist starting the second immediately after  And I do not regret it at all  While Animal Farm is undoubtedly relevant to our times  it is still an allegory in which the main characters are animals  1984 is a much darker book  and here Orwell does not use animals to put his point across  The story is set in a dystopian world in the year 1984  somewhere in England  renamed Airstrip One   The government of the day  the Party  is all powerful  so much so that it controls not only the actions but also the thoughts of citizens  The Party is developing its own language  Newspeak  that would only contain words representing the thoughts of the party  and would be a much reduced form of Oldspeak  the English of old times   Every home has telescreens  which function both as transmitting devices for the party propaganda and as receivers for watching and listening in to the residents  Anyone thinking a wrong thought would be accused of  Crimethink  by the  Thought Police  and  vaporized   The Party even controls the memories of the people by erasing all links to the past  obliterating books  newspapers  literature  anything that contradicts its worldview  The past is held to be mutable  The embodiment of the Party is Big Brother  a semi divine figure who watches over everybody  and is never wrong  In this surreal world the protagnist  Winston Smith  finds himself struggling to remain sane and reasonable  He knows that the party is wrong  but he is too scared to admit it even to himself  finally mustering courage to pen his thoughts in a diary  away from the prying telescreen  Later he meets and falls in love with Julia  an Inner party member who  he realizes  also shares some of his thoughts  But they are soon found out by the Thought Police and sent to the  Ministry of Love  to be tortured so that they confess their crimes  both real and imagined  But the real objective of the torture is to make the victim admit that the party is right  and to make Doublethink  a Newspeak word meaning to know the reality and yet reject it  a part of their psyche  The torture is brutal  and at the end Winston betrays Julia and also says that he loves Big Brother The story is a grim warning to what extent things can go wrong if totalitarian regimes are left to proliferate unchecked  Similar to the way the animals unquestioningly toiled under orders from the pigs in Animal Farm  the proles  lower classes  are seemingly content with life under the party and never think of revolt  In that sense I believe Orwell partly lays the blame for the suffering of these people on the people themselves   on their inaction  lack of intellect and lethargy  On the other hand  the specter of telescreens is closer to reality now with CCTV cameras everywhere and the daily news of some government agency snooping on our private emails and internet activity  Every political party wants us to belive their propaganda  which they themselves know to be false and yet accept as reality  Doublethink   Even though 1984 came and went  we need to be constantly on guard that our 1984 does not happen in the twenty first century  mn wl lrwyt lty qr th  qr

you say and they want to control every aspect of your life  I really enjoyed this book In the novel the government forbids their citizens from having independent thoughts  close friends  and even being in love  Throughout the book Winston is extremely frustrated by this  One day a woman named Julia that he works with slips him a not saying that she loves him  They start having a forbidden relationship He also knows a man named O Brien  who is a powerful party member but this is never revealed to Winston  Winston suspects that he is a part of the secret organization to overthrow the government  so he believes that he can trust O Brien  One day O Brien invites Winston over to his house to go over work related items  While Winston is at O Brien s home  he reveals to Winston that he is a member of the organization that is going to overthrow the government  and he gives him a book that has all of the beliefs of the organization in it  Later on while Winston is reading the book with Julia the thought police burst through the doors and bust them both for their illegal actions  It turns out that O Brien was working for the government the whole time  and only lied to Winston to catch him  Winston and Julia are separated  and he gets sent to The Ministry of Love  where he is beaten and tortured until he betrays Julia and tells them exactly what they wanted to hear  Afterwards O Brien reveals to Winston that the Government only does these things just as an exercise of power  there is no other significant purpose  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS PEACE  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  page 6  Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past  page 35 I enjoyed the book because it is a fascinating look into what a government with total control can do to its citizens  wHd  mn  jml lrwyt lty qr th Ht  ln   lk n jwrj  wrwyl knt ytHdth  n  wSm l lm l rby w lys  n lndn fy  lm 1984 lmftrD rwy  tHbs lnfs tthqfk jyd mn nHy  lstbdd w twb h lnhy  m swy  ll sf

Oceania is being ruled by the Party  All freedom is gone  all pleasures are forbidden  all information is propaganda  rebellion is unthinkable  and your relatives will not hesitate to betray you  Even thinking rebellious thoughts is a crime  bound to get the attention of the Thought Police and a harsh punishment  And the masses live in constant fear  For they know that Big Brother is watching them   Just like The Lord of the Rings is the mother of all fantasy stories  1984 is the mother of all dystopian stories  Neither of these books were the first in their respective genres  far from it  but both of them changed their genres into something more  and in many ways became the greatest works ever written This is as far as I can see an important book more than a good one  George Orwell is a much greater thinker than he is a writer  1984 is not a spectacular book in any way  It s not particularly well written  It s not particularly complex  But the ideas behind it are greater than any book Personally  I ve always considered Orwell to be one of the most important thinkers of the modern era  He s revolutionised the way we see the world  And while his is the way of the journalist  the political commentator and the social critic  his books are still enjoyable to read for what they are The thing I find the most interesting about this book is that it s basically a critique of radical left wing thought  Yes  you ll find attacks on capitalism and different forms of authoritarianism  But Orwell s main attacks are focused towards the dangers of revolution  communism and left wing thought in general  As the man himself once stated   So much of left wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don t even know that fire is hot  Now that  however  is not interesting in itself  or special in any way  The interesting thing is that Orwell himself was a left wing thinker  You might accuse him of hypocrisy  but that would miss the point entirely  The thing that fascinates me the most about Orwell is that he s a left wing thinker who manages to see the flaws and dangers of left wing thought  and subsequently tries to develop his own views from that insight Since political terms mean different things to different people  although there are right and wrong definitions of most of them   I won t showcase my own views in a public review  Ask me privately if you re interested  I love discussing politics  Here and now  suffice it to say that Orwell and I agree on a great many things So much for the political analysis  For further reading I d recommend having a look at Isaac Asimov s very critical review  which I found almost as interesting and important as the book itself  If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  for ever  More than anything  1984 is the core of dystopia  It shows us everything that is wrong with our world  everything that has been wrong with it  and most importantly  everything that could go wrong in the future In addition to presenting the reader with a possible future that to most of us would seem like our worst nightmare  it has a philosophical core bound to enlighten just about anyone on a thing or two  Orwell teaches you the true meaning of power and fear  and of the most stable pillars of human society This is one of the most important books of our time  It inspired every single dystopian writer after it  It inspired V for Vendetta  one of my favourite movies  It inspired generations of political thinkers  And it s a book everyone should read at least once  We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness   Des les premieres pages  on percoit clairement que 1984 fait partie des oeuvres de la dystopie  Le grand Orwell depeint  d une maniere terrifiante  une societe atone ou l homme est asservi sans vergogne  ou le moindre mouvement  clin d oeil  voire de futiles revelations de somniloquie peuvent vous faire  vaporiser   A l encontre des systemes totalitaires d autrefois qui visaient a faire obeir les  heretiques  et les rebelles par la terreur et la torture  l Ingsoc  le parti unique figurant dans le roman   repose sur les mecanismes de la surveillance constante et permanente des citoyens  la manipulation des esprits  le redressement par l education et une falsification inlassable du passe comme celui  qui commande le passe  commande l avenir  et qui commande le present  commande le passe   Plusieurs decennies plus tard  nous sommes en plein dedans   Une oligarchie financiere qui detient la destinee des masses  les proletaires   Une manipulation frenetique des media  diabolisation  falsification des evenements   futilisation         Tracage  localisation  espionnage  lois de renseignement  les etats d urgence et j en passe    Bref  je trouve que c est un livre incontournable  a lire et a relire  I have read reviews on this book that state that it is more an essay than a novel and that it s characters were not relatable and  bland   Yes  it is written by Orwell who is a brilliant essay writer  especially on social commentary so elements of that seep into his writing style  However  he is also the most vivid brilliant novelist and this is one of his finest  And if you don t get a beautifully crafted vision of setting and character in your mind through the reading of this book  I feel sorry for you having missed out on this chilling tale  1984 takes place in a futuristic dystopian society  Originally written in 1949  Orwell writes about a post WWII world 35 years in the future where Big Brother and Ingsoc rule over what is called Oceania  The government of this time has come to control and watch the movement of all of its citizens  and even though no laws are official  if an unspoken rule is broken punishment can include torture and death  All records of the past have been erased or altered to the point that no one knows for sure what year it is  Hence  the title 1984 really refers to the government s power to brainwash or confuse an entire country to the point where the year is unknown  Orwell writes  He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   In changing the records of the past  people have forgotten what is true and have come to accept or believe that Big Brother has always been around and that the world was always like this  By altering records Big Brother seems like all powerful  with the power to predict the future and many successes  In this dystopian society individuality is frowned upon  The Thought Police is present to monitor everyone s thoughts and if anyone is in suspicion they will be captured than brainwashed tortured or killed  Everyone is supposed to resign their individuality and become a part of the Party in order to be  free    WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   This is the Party s motto it is evident how they wish that all citizens give up individuality and their curiosity in order to become accepted  The book has a deeper political meaning behind it too  Orwell warns and criticizes communist and totalitarian governments throughout the entire novel  It is a warning to not give too much power to the government and to remain free in individual thought and action   Wow  Scary world  According to the afterword the opposite of  Utopia  by Thomas More  Though i know Thomas More but i never read his book so i can t comment on that  But what i can say is that this book is a new age of Nostradomus  With the latest scandal of PRISM and NSA who can say it won t turned out like this  Although not exactly same but not too for away  With constant war and unequal distribution of wealth between proles and top of the chain  more and more of Inner Party or in our world  top one percent  getting wealthier than ever  I am not a fan of conspiracies but it seems like the government trying to create Orwell  s world exactly the same  The proles must wake up  The capitalists alway said to create enough wealth to overcome social disorder but its BS  The rich keep plundering while the poor keep scrambling the leftovers  Orwell s classic  although written in 1949  is unique in that it becomes increasingly applicable as time goes on  In today s world of smart phones  smart TVs  motion trackers  cameras  etc  the warning received from 1984 becomes more and more unsettling  In an era of progress and fundamental changes  Orwell saw what many could not 1984 describes a dystopian society with an all powerful government know as The Party  Citizens of Oceania are constantly watched and evaluated by various technologies  particularly  telescreens   Those who may actively oppose the Party  or even those who are even thought to be opposing the Party   thoughtcrime    simply disappear To those who have enjoyed dystopian novels such as The Hunger Games  Divergent  or The Giver  I would encourage you to read 1984  Not only is it well written and exciting  but it is also a sobering piece of classic literature seeking to keep the masses awake  The first  classic  I have read  And one completely worthy of title  Written in 1940s  the book imagines a world in 1984 where even independent thinking is a crime  the language is being rewritten continuously rewritten so that it has less and less words  thereby narrowing the thought process A must read  It s damn scary to imagine every action of you being observed remotely by an telescreens  and a government like Oceania  George Orwell s narration is insane  Going to be one of my all time best books When I belatedly read one of the classics of literature  those I avoided in high school as being stale or irrelevant   I am usually amazed at the universal and timeless truths that are woven into the stories  Having just read Orwell s 1984  I am truly blown away  You can skip the academic treatises on authoritarianism   why it arises  how it can be sustained  Just read 1984  Orwell nails it He begins with one of the great opening lines in literature   It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen   Eerie  very eerie  And soon you are introduced to the dystopia where Winston Smith and the entire populace are taught  war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength   People are led in a daily Two Minutes Hate  where everyone focuses their hatred on the enemy nation  and particularly the  possibly fictitious  Emmanuel Goldstein  the Enemy of the People The possibly of arrest for thoughtcrime and facecrime terrify the populace  Children are taught to turn in their own parent for thoughtcrimes   It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children  History was continually rewritten   Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date   because  as a party official explained   Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   Winston  who is employed to rewrite history  wonders if he was  alone in the possession of a memory  as the public seemed to swallow the all to obvious changes  There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature  music  drama  and entertainment generally  Here were produced rubbishy newspapers  containing almost nothing except sport  crime and astrology  sensational five cent novelettes  films oozing with sex and sentimental songs composed entirely by mechanical means   Hmmm   sounds familiar The world of 1984 focused on a perpetual warfare among the three major superstates   But Goldstein  the Enemy of the People  explained that the read agenda of warfare was not conquest      the three super states not only cannot conquer one another  but would gain no advantage by doing so   but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory   the  real  war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory  but to keep the structure of society intact  When Winston is eventually captured and charged with subversion  a party official provides the big picture   The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake  We are not interested in the good of others  we are interested solely in power  Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness  only power  pure power    We are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing  All the others  even those who resembled ourselves  were cowards and hypocrites   The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings  Over the body   but  above all  over the minds   Reading 1984 did bring out one of my own authoritarian characteristics  if I could  I d force everyone to read 1984  The ending of the book gives you the chillss Podia falar da minha opiniao perante este livro  mas dizer que gostei ou dizer  ganda livro  podia enquadrar mas nao seria a cena  1984 fala de uma realidade alternativa mas muito parecida a esta realidade  o facto do autor caracterizar as situacoes sociais da maneira que e explicito no livro torna a sua visao sobre este mundo  uma visao futurista  por ele conseguir criar uma historia com base nos piores medos da sociedade de hoje  medos nao conscientes em pessoas que levam as empresas para um futuro de independencia  tornando o mundo afastado dos interesses dessa empresa     lqr  lthlth  b d mr  bl rby  w  khr  blnjlyzy  nh rwy  tqr  thm tqr  mn jdyd f lan  I loved it   If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  for ever   Orwell s prediction of totalitarian government in this book is by no means dated  as the title suggests  Point of fact  one could almost say he was off by 31 years  Is our world as dark as the world he paints  no  at least not yet  As I read the pages  however  I did see the fulfilment of some of his prognostications evident in society 1984 should serve as a warning  but to many in power  I dare say it is used as a blueprint A must read for any fan of dystopias  this is the proverbial grand daddy   kn  nqhm m rk

One such example is of the overwhelming darkness and cynicism conveyed by Orwell at the end of the novel  While Winston Smith is being interrogated and  taught  by Obrien the reader realizes that any hope of a triumphant and rebellious ending is gone  This is particularly shown through two quotes  With the first Orwell is setting up a false allusion of hope when he has Winston narrate   If there was hope  it must lie in the proles  because only there  in those swarming disregarded masses  eighty five percent of the population of Oceania  could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated    chap  7  Book 1   However this slim hope of the overthrowing of the party is quickly destroyed by Obrien  who comments on the same subject   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious    Chp 7 book 1  Overall I did not find the cynical approach to the novel effect the experience  rather it enhanced it  Also Orwell s long lectures on politics were fascinating rather than boring  Awesome book   lrwy   bqry  tftH  fq jdyd lltfkyr wmdwl  l Hdth   w  stGrb  bdan  n jwrj qdmh bhdh lTrH l bqry lftn   fb d Hdyq  lHywn wryl

believe everybody in 2012 should read because of its applicability to today  Orwell creates a character named Winston who lives in a world entirely void of individuality since the government not only tightly regulates life  but has actually managed to control what people think without them even realizing it  It is embedded into them at an early age that The Big Brother or The Party is infallibly good and right on every subject therefore becoming robots with no inner judgment or sense of love  Orwell wrote this book during the time the Communist Soviet Union was in power  but did not write it for the express purpose of criticizing them  He possessed amazing discernment of what the Communists were all about but also saw how these things are becoming true in societies everywhere and wanted to give us a warning of what the world could become like if we don t stand up  He saw that we are in fact already on this track and that we need to do something now in order to keep this nightmare from coming true   Since he saw these things in 1949  what would he think of the world today  If you read this book  you will see many frightening resemblances to the world we live in  For instance  in 1984 history is constantly being rewritten to make the people think what the Party wants them to since  he who controls the past  controls the future   This is happening to us today  truth is being replaced with lies or simply cut out altogether by text book writers who are editing history for their own agenda  and pretty soon this truth will be forgotten altogether  This is such a threat because what you believe about the past is what determines your actions for the future  There is also the Spies  a group of children who squeal on their parents and report them to the Thought Police  This is also seen to be coming true  Children are slowly pulled away from their parents in our society and taught that what they believe is old fashioned and sharing with their teachers the silly view that their parents have  Kids come home from school  and take it upon themselves to educate their parents on the appropriate views and behavior  As one can see  it is not only the tight regulations that the government enforces in your daily life  although that increased control is definitely seen in our government today  but that uncanny ability to transform your mind and the way you think  Today the government is also trying to play  Big Brother  by telling you that they know best and it is their job to provide for you  I believe that this book is a warning which encourages us to take action in our daily lives and stand up for what we know is right and also our individual freedoms  Do not give up your individual discernment to be blindly conformed to the masses   As a person who doesn t read many books  I was at first skeptical of 1984 being good  I was soon proven to be very wrong  as this is probably one of the greatest books I have ever read The book covers the life of Winston Smith  a middle aged  at least he thinks he is  Londoner  as he as he goes about his everyday tasks in a city of drudgery  anger  and sadness  The city is commanded by the Party  as it rewrites old documents to correspond with current events  amongst other things  and is patrolled by the Thought Police  an organization existing to create a world of controlled thought  And then  of course  there is Big Brother  the Joseph Stalin resembling character who appears as a deity in front of the general public I might be slightly bias about this  but I had a wonderful time with 1984  I would definitely recommend this to any fan of dystopian novels  or  for that matter  anyone  This book is doubleplusgood  I recently saw this book as a suggestion by one of those  50 scariest books you ll ever read  kind of lists  I had read Animal Farm years before and I know of 1984  served as inspiration for the Apple Macintosh Ad  The book was not exactly what I expected  despite having some flash backs of V for Vendetta throughout the whole reading experience  I found Winston to be a likeable character and even rooted for him  However  the book did not frighten me I can draw parallels with what happens in the book and what is happening in my own country as the government attempts to increase control but never did I feel that I might not be able to sleep at night for fear that Big Brother would have me vaporized  Strangely though  the book did have a kind of effect on my own life in the sense that I felt a kind of burning desire to escape what felt like my own version of Big Brother  The Though Police  the very people with whom I work and live  seemed to be out to get me and turn my own ideas against me Anyway  a good read which I feel deserves five stars and credit for being the inspiration behind things like V for Vendetta and that evil box of wires known as the television   I can actually remember when 1984 was the distant seeming future  Although it has become dated in some ways  1984 remains relevant today  serving as a reminder of how easily freedom can be redefined out of existence  It has lost none of its power to horrify and repel the reader  particularly those who follow the contemporary political scene and see words like  patriotism    terrorism    equality    person   and  freedom   redefined with alarming disregard for common sense by those who ought to know better  In 1984  the individual has ceased to exist  for all practical purposes  at least until he calls attention to himself through acts of sedition  and in this dystopian world  non conformism is the very definition of  sedition  In Brave New World  which I recently reread  the state was as all powerful and intolerant of unorthodoxy as Oceania  but it maintained  to a certain extent  the illusion of benevolence  The state focused on eradicating any desires that could not safely  that is  without threatening the hegemony of the state  be fulfilled  Through manipulation of the fetal environment  cradle to grave social engineering  and the use of mood altering drugs  the individual was made to desire exactly what the state needed them to desire  The citizens of Oceania in 1984 are controlled by conditioning of a very different sort  They are controlled through fear and coercion  but here too  drugs play a significant role  This is a much more sinister society  a society devoid of pleasure  I had to laugh when it occurred to me that the former is a sort of left wing totalitarian state  while the latter is a right wing one As of the year 1984  Orwell s frightening prophecy had ceased to materialize  But now  30 years beyond that anniversary  we are slouching ever nearer to that dismal world he imagined  I m not saying we will all one day inhabit the world Winston Smith does  but I do see how the unthinkable can creep up on us in tiny increments  kind of like old age  We d best be on our guard  Written in 1948  1984 was George Orwell s chilling prophecy about the future  And while 1984 has come and gone  Orwell s narrative is timelier than ever  1984 presents a startling and haunting vision of the world  so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish  No one can deny the power of this novel  its hold on the imaginations of multiple generations of readers  or the resiliency of its admonitions a legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of time Winston Smith lives in a world without freedom  The four Ministries  the Ministry of Peace  Plenty  Love  and Truth  control everything  Big Brother is watching you  For younger readers  or people who don t read in general  it may be interesting to know that this is where Big Brother comes from  Being watched any time of any day and judged if you take so much as one step in the wrong direction  is a quite chilling perspective  This father of all dystopias is as terrifying   if not more so   now as it must have been when it was first published  If we look at our world today and how willingly we publish the most private details about ourselves  about our habits and preferences  think Facebook   this book gives you an incentive to question your own behavior From the very first page  I plummeted into this novel  It has something of a traffic accident quality to it  terrible and scary but you kind of can t look away  Discovering Winston Smith s world and how the government is controlling everybody in it  is at the same time a pleasure to read  simply because it is a well written book  and eye opening in a very uncomfortable way  Ideas such as doublethink or newspeak scared me more than Pennywise the Clown ever did  But the modification and simplification of language to keep citizens in check is only one of the things that took my reader s breath away  The seemingly random rewriting of history to suit the government s current needs was another  If the country is now at war with Oceania  it is made clear that it has actually always been at war with Oceania   even though that s not true I could go on and on about all the little details and the big ideas that make this such a monster of a book  But apart from all that  it is an incredibly well written story  The plot shows us how Smith wants to break out of this world and that he s not the only one  Orwell gives us the slightest bit of hope which keeps us going and rooting for Smith to find something better than a world with though police I cannot recommend this book enough and I m quite angry with myself for waiting so long to read it  After a year and a half  the imagery is still as vivid in my mind as it was when I first read the book Even if you hate the plot  even if you don t sympathize with Winston Smith  this novel does one thing above all else  It makes you think  I assume that s why it s so widely read in schools and I hope it will continue this way  Any friend I have  avid reader or not  I beseech to read this book  It won t make you happy and it won t make you feel good  so reviewing it in summer is maybe not such a great idea  when everybody wants light  fun reads  But I don t care  Whether you re 13 or 83  if you have a shred of curiosity in you  if you think the world is not perfect and if you want to share this vision of a man from the 1940ies  Read  This  Book  if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself   It s a beautiful thing  the destruction of words  Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives  but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well  It isn t only the synonyms  there are also the antonyms  After all  what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word  A word contains its opposite in itself  Take  good   for instance  If you have a word like  good   what need is there for a word like  bad    Ungood  will do just as well   better  because it s an exact opposite  which the other is not  Or again  if you want a stronger version of  good   what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like  excellent  and  splendid  and all the rest of them   Plusgood  covers the meaning  or  doubleplusgood  if you want something stronger still  Of course we use those forms already  but in the final version of Newspeak there ll be nothing else  In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words   in reality  only one word  Don t you see the beauty of that  Winston I know we re supposed to be terrified by this but I actually see the beauty of that  It is true that you cannot  and shouldn t  politically speaking  impose a designed language on the public but the idea of a modernistic  minimalistic reduction towards a less redundant and more modular language is appealing to me at least as a theoretical exercise  Apparently Orwell was also ambivalent about it  in a series of broadcasts to India that he produced from 1942 to 1944  he chose to use Basic English  an English based controlled language  a simplified subset of English  created by Charles Kay Ogden in 1930  which would later be his inspiration for Newspeak in 1984   There are in fact many constructed languages  Volapuk being the cutest in my opinion   I can feel that when he wrote the above passage for the lexicographer Syme  some part of him was still strongly empathizing with the character and seeing  the beauty of that  I would argue that Orwell s ambivalence manifests itself throughout the book  even though he depicts with Oceania an extreme and horrible form of modernity  he actually takes the side of rational modernist thinking versus what could be called postmodernism   interestingly  represented also by the Party   on important crossroads  through the protagonist Winston s thoughts In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five  and you would have to believe it        Not merely the validity of experience  but the very existence of external reality  was tacitly denied by their philosophy        His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him  the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate  the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand  much less answer  And yet he was in the right  They were wrong and he was right  The obvious  the silly  and the true had got to be defended  Truisms are true  hold on to that  The solid world exists  its laws do not change  Stones are hard  water is wet  objects unsupported fall towards the Earth s centre  With the feeling that he was speaking to O Brien  and also that he was setting forth an important axiom  he wrote Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows  If you re not convinced that this passage relates to the modernism postmodernism duality  here are O Brien s  a member of the Inner Party  words to Winston You believe that reality is something objective  external  existing in its own right  You also believe that the nature of reality is self evident  When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something  you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you  But I tell you  Winston  that reality is not external  Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere else  Not in the individual mind  which can make mistakes  and in any case soon perishes  only in the mind of the Party  which is collective and immortal  Whatever the Party holds to be the truth  is truth  It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party        You must get rid of those nineteenth century ideas about the laws of Nature  We make the laws of Nature        Before man there was nothing  After man  if he could come to an end  there would be nothing  Outside man there is nothing You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us  But we create human nature  Men are infinitely malleable The resemblance of these sentences to postmodernist poststructuralist thinking is striking  especially because these schools of thought weren t around when the book was written  O Brien dubs it  collective solipsism  in his dialogue with Winston   The word postmodern was in use at that time  albeit only within the context of art architecture in a much narrower sense   Of course these ideas have their ancestors in the history of philosophy  but it is Orwell s genius that he presented a staggering discussion of them with a novel written in 1948 in such a way that it nearly encapsulates the intellectual climate of the second half of the century  What is more intriguing to me is that he has managed to describe in a convincing way an oppressive regime that is both modernist and postmodernist to the core at the same time When we navigate the ocean  or when we predict an eclipse  we often find it convenient to assume that the Earth goes round the Sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away  But what of it  Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy  The stars can be near or distant  according as we need them  Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that  Have you forgotten doublethink The concept of doublethink itself  the act of simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct   by the way  is one of the key features of postmodernist literature  both as a characteristic of it and as a cherished quality in other things So  on one hand Orwell criticizes modernism through a caricature  a full scale minimalization and modularization of language  strict standardization of the living spaces and of people  total disconnection from the past  etc   while on the other he defends  through Winston  modernist thinking against the postmodernist ideas of the Party  Was he exercising doublethink himself when he wrote the book  Maybe he was just lucky enough to live in a period when thinking outside the modern postmodern paradigm was still the natural thing to do  Or maybe he was deliberately rejecting modernism and postmodernism  hoping for a third alternative   or indeed having no hope for humanity whatsoever In any case  I do believe that Orwell was expressing his own thoughts when he wrote these lines for Winston Being in a minority  even in a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad  This book is interesting  The background about this book is demonstrating cold war era  There were lots of conflict between socialism and capitalism  However  do you believe this book is written in the 1930 s  The author of this book accurately demonstrated about the situation of the socialist country during the cold war period  The country is formed by the leader called  Big Brother   and the main character Winston Smith is a person who was counterrevolutionary  This book shows how the government keeps tracking your every single behavior  and how to brainwash the civilians  George Orwell  the author this book  is from Great Britain  and he wrote this book in 1930 s  According to his background  this book is a kind of propaganda which shows why the socialism is bad  We can see the conflict of the socialism and the capitalism through this book and the author s background  Every once in a while I try to write a review for this  then invariably discard it as inadequate  One thing that s unquestionably true about Orwell s novel  and indeed his work at large  including his excellent essays  however  is that there s an immediacy  a palpable closeness  or  closing in ness  perhaps  to his direct and lucid narrative which readily reflects those matters most demanding of our attention today  From the state of governance globally to the fissures and cracks at smaller levels  directly down to the individual  the follies of apathy  revisionism  nationalist distraction and other entirely human fallacies we excuse daily  all find strong resonance in the narrative  though one is likely on first reading to be swept along by the sheer emotional pull towards the ruthless end At least as preamble  I invite the reader in doubt of this relevance to watch this http   www youtube com watch v xGo1Dq    In case the video is taken down under copyright  the link is to a BBC documentary series called  The Power of Nightmares    The Trap  is from the same filmmaker is another good documentary series  Having noticed there s an edition here with an introduction by Thomas Pynchon  a search yielded it at  http   www scribd com doc 100899 Pync   Eric Fromm s afterword for the popular Signet Classics edition is at http   douglassocialcredit com resour   I m not aware of any good annotated editions  but a good separate guide may help better than an accompanying essay or a read of Wikipedia or even a good documentary to understand the historical perspective from which Orwell wrote this dystopian classic Since the book is out of copyright in Australia and a few other places  it may be downloaded as a very nicely formatted  pdf file here or elsewhere  With novels such as 1984  I have already heard or read so many allusions to the narrative structure that I have an unfortunately limited pre conception of the true depth and gravitas of this masterpiece  Often compared with Huxley s Brave New World  I find Orwell s vision colder and more deeply textured  All great literature touches on timeless themes about humanity  In 1984  we explore themes of identity  personality  freedom  the soul  personal expression all through the lens of the individual versus the state  In this case  a very totalitarian state that maintains rigorous monitoring of its citizenry  along with constantly bombarding them with hawkish propaganda  Its hard to give spoilers with 1984  because so much of it has become a part of our common culture  If you have ever heard  Big Brother is watching  that is from 1984  This book can be viewed very pessimistically  However  I found it to have some of the most romantic prose I have ever read  Just as much as this novel is about the state s collective ability to crush one man s soul  it just as much manifests a platform from which that same person can never truly be denied their humanity  because it is intangible  Hope can always overcome oppression because you can never turn on the dark but you can always turn on the light  Brilliant  One of those classics I haven t read in a long time  that I remember being very good  but that I should really read again soon in order to confirm  Even more important than before these days  in fact  in that it was one of the first projects ever to precisely define exactly what Fascism is  remember  before this novel  there were lots of disagreements over what linked Hitler and Mussolini together  for example  ideologically  apart from it being advantageous for them to team up against the Allies  When I think back now to so many of this book s plot points  they match up with actual items from the Bush administration so precisely to be scary  that s why I m thinking of sitting down soon and reading this again for the first time in a decade  Years ago I had read Animal Farm and I loved it  1984 has been on my  to read  list ever since and I have finally found the time to read it  I fell in love with it before I had even finished the first chapter 1984 centers around Winston Smith  living in a world controlled by The Party and Big Brother  There is no secrecy and no trust  just loyalty to The Party and unquestioning their ways   if you question their ways or seen as a threat you are  vaporized   However Winston isn t like everyone else  he secretly hates Big Brother and longs to find someone like him  The novel follows from his rebellion in the form of a diary  rebellion in the form of love to the horrific inner workings of the Ministry of Love  This society terrified me from the beginning  the thought that these people were being forced to live like this shocked me  Although despite how disturbing I found it I couldn t put the book down   I just had to find out more about it and more about Winston  What made this novel so frightening was the fact that this could happen  There are always people out there who want to rule  and we ve seen in the past how people can be brainwashed and follow power blindly  However the characters don t seem to remember the past  a life before The Party and the war with Eurasia  everything has been erased and rewritten in NEWSPEAK  Shakespeare  Milton  Chaucer   all gone  The novel is split into three parts  the first is there to introduce the reader to this new society  The second is about a hidden love affair and the third  the consequences  At first it doesn t seem like there s anything going on in the way of action   some may find this a little boring but I was so fascinated to hear about The Party and their rules that I didn t care  The plot beings to thicken in the second part and is in full swing by the third  Even if you feel like giving up I strongly advise that you stick with it as everything starts to make sense and the ending is sensational   it was how I imagined it from the start although it still left me speechless and seldom What made this novel even more enjoyable was the characters  It was very easy for me to identify with Winston as I felt the same disdain to this new way of living that he has  This reinforced my opinion that Orwell is such a talented writer as this book just made me feel so much  I could feel myself being manipulated by his words   ironically much like many characters were manipulated by words by The Party  As a reader I wanted him to challenge what was happening and to escape unscathed  He is the only character we re able to trust  however at times it appears there are other people on our side   Then there is Julia who loves him and they re both cautiously ecstatic about finding someone like them   for a while it looks like there is hope for our protagonist I genuinely didn t see a lot of the twists coming and I wasn t ready  or able to predict  the horrors of the Ministry of Love  This just made the book even more exciting for me  There were times when my jaw literally dropped because of various revelations  Everything ties in so well and by the end all the puzzle pieces fit together and you realise what has been going on  you even see what The Party is really like with their methods 1984 is the first novel  for a long time  that I have really loved  I have read many dystopian novels and none of them has affected me in the way that this has  It has easily made its way onto my list of favourite books and I know that re reading this will be just as amazing as it was the first time round  I ve only just put it down and I already want to be sucked back into it This is a novel that I will never forget and I think everyone should be exposed to it   Quien controla el pasado controla el futuro  quien controla el presente controla el pasado Escrito en los anos 40  1984 describe un futuro ficticio  turbio y desolado  donde la libertad y privacidad han desaparecido  Simplemente es un libro complejo y asombroso  Imprescindible      Y realmente resultan inquietantes los ligeros  paralelismos de la sociedad plasmada en el libro y la actual  La vigencia de esta obra es incontrovertible  I first read 1984 when I was in middle school  I was on a quest to read all of Orwell s works after finishing Animal Farm a few years earlier  Yet  it had been so long since I have last read the novel that I had forgotten quite a bit The scary thing about Orwell is that he picks up on the small details  such as the importance of language in forming ideas  and he explains them in such a way that even a die hard believer in a happy ending is left thinking    well maybe that could work  That is a scary prospect The world that is created is similar to socialist or communist societies  yet it is manipulated with the artistic flair of science fiction and ingenuity  The characters are real  meaning they are likable and appalling  You feel sympathy for them  cheer for them  and are disappointed in them  No matter the emotion  you connect with them Orwell is a masterful and popular storyteller  His novel  1984  is worth the hype that it has received  It is expertly written  and to date the best dystopian novel ever written  It s hard to know exactly where to begin  This is probably the heaviest novel I ve ever read  and a huge amount of topics are discussed  either in depth  at a surface level  or somewhere in between  after finishing it just a few minutes ago  I want to say that the  main  theme is objective reality v s subjective reality  but you could just as easily say that privacy  or lack of  is the main theme  as well as a dozen other different things  A whole gleaming spectrum of ideas and ideologies are discussed here   it may be dystopian fiction on one level but it s also  obviously  a political essay  a terrifying and remarkably clear one that  ironically  vividly outlines the difficulties and potential terrors of ambiguity  It is a very effective novel  prophetic in some unnerving ways  and scary  It actually scared me  I ve read a fair amount of books and I ve never been scared like that before Why was I so scared  I think that s the key here  I was scared  I think  because what happens to Winston Smith seemed like a thing that might happen to me  Winston is introduced as a logical  intellectual man  able to separate himself to a degree from the insane society he lives in   his responses are mostly very understandable  his hatred of Big Brother natural  his fear utterly relatable  You must be on his side because the other side is insanity  Winston is reasonable  he might not be perfect  or even all that likable  really  when you get right down to it  but you can t not be on his side  because  like I said  he seems to be the only sane one  It s like being in a strange nightmare  in a town you ve never been in before  and all the people there are unknown  unfriendly  and potentially dangerous   and you initially think you re all alone   but Winston is there to see the reason in things  By default the reader and he become comrades  Together maybe we can get through this insanely disturbing novel  Of course   very huge spoiler up next  Big Brother does get Winston in the end  I guess I knew that was coming  And now I go back to why I was so scared   because the process which makes him buckle under  although seeming sometimes absolutely insane and impossible  was written in such a way that I found it  at other times  completely plausible  And because Winston and the reader are comrades  probably similarly minded  you start to think it could happen to you  That for all your intelligence and reason  in the end   it could happen to you  Big Brother might get you  too  Maybe I m sounding a bit paranoid  but that s the feeling that the novel evoked   an utter annihilation of privacy  the unmaking of a perfectly reasonable  intelligent individual  going against all the  good  or  correct  forces of the universe that most people feel will prevail  In the end  these maybe pretend forces do not prevail  as you could I guess suggest Winston is  at least for a while  their instrument  if you believe in them   The insanity of unreasonableness  the might of a backward and awful society that seems terrifyingly plausible  prevails instead  Other books have done similar things  But I wasn t so scared of them  It s probably a combination of the powerful language  the realism  and the pure intelligence of the novel that made me feel that way  While I don t really understand the appeal of many classic books  I do for this one  It satisfied me at an intellectual level  Not to sound pretentious  hopefully  George Orwell s understanding of politics and society is  like I said  astoundingly clear  I couldn t have put it in nearly such a straightforward way  I could see why people might find it dry and boring at times  and it could easily be if you aren t interested in the social commentary and all of that   but me  taking delight in all things politics and philosophy  had a grand time  I love being challenged intellectually  and this was at the right level for me   hard enough that I had to use my brain more than just at an idle running speed  but not so hard that it became gibberish  It made me think  and also validated some of my own thoughts and musings  which of course leads me to think I m smarter than I probably am  Also  by the end  like I mentioned  you re given one of those arguments that never has any real answer  objective reality v s subjective reality The Party and Big Brother believe in a subjective reality  that is  that the things that happen in the world  in the past specifically  are true only once the human brain has comprehended them  and that if events pass without conscious observation by people  then they haven t happened at all  That you can rewrite the past not just in a superficial way but in a literal way  Winston  meanwhile  originally believes that existence rolls along independent of the human brain  and once things happen  they happen and will remain that way in the untouchable past as fact forever  Most people would probably lean towards Winston s view of reality   it seems logical to assume that the universe isn t just contained in our own heads   but the problem is that the idea of a subjective reality also seems plausible  looked at from certain angles  How do we know for sure  That question is why answering definitively is impossible  What the Party ultimately does is rob Winston of his ability to think of reality as something objective  It doesn t sound so bad when you say it like that  but what goes along with is is a complete reversal of his emotions and personal philosophy   once determined to see Big Brother overthrown and the world return to a more sane state where people can think for themselves and do what they please  by the end Winston is a hollowed out puppet  Whether something like that could realistically happen  I don t know  There is maybe an element of exaggeration in that respect  but at the same time there s still that unsettling grain of plausibility  Why couldn t that happen  The reality of 1984 probably will never happen  In my personal opinion  I would find that pretty remarkable if society ever evolved in such an extreme way   but elements of that extreme society aren t just plausible  they re really happening  We shouldn t get too hysterical and go around taping our laptop cameras and buying dark sunglasses  but we should be aware that a single minded government  or governments  are certainly capable of impeding upon our personal privacy  and in fact already have to a degree  1984 is a prophetic warning against what society might become  and has started to become  even while its extreme state probably won t be reached in reality In the end  I was thoroughly impressed with this one  George Orwell is more than a capable writer  not only in terms of the conveyance of ideas but also just in simple terms of prose  It s an excellent book and I m sure I ll read it again to see what more I can get out of it  Learning your mind by travelling into unknown spaces future is what Orwell brought in this novel Creating a future political environment is not an easy art require good array of thoughts for others but came in handy to Orwell ORWELL Brother in Telescreen quotes  Political Writing is an art 1984 is an Example Orwell is a Torchbearer  Wow  What a book  Written over 60 years ago and still very relevant today  After reading  and being disappointed by  A Brave New World  I had my reservations about reading 1984  for out of all genres  Sci fi ages the least graceful  But I found 1984 to not be a book written in 1948  but something that could have been written at any time  even today   The prose was surprisingly clear  non complex and succinct  It evoked the senses and had action and pace  something very modern  The structure too was arranged to build in tension and complexity  something I find lacking in  dated  fiction   And above all  the message being told is as relevant today as it was back when the book was first published  That is what I believe makes this book so great  and so truly frightening  1984  however  can at times be uneven  devoting extensively large chapters to  explaining  dogma and politics  That said  the things said in those chapters are just as interesting as the plot and in actuality  all that  info dumping  is truly where the core of the book is  In these political sections  there is a truth to what is being said  Things that might sound familiar  Things that may have happened in some form in your own country  That is when this book becomes riveting  That is when this book becomes truly scary And that effectiveness  that thing that makes 1984 so influential  is its powerfully accurate message about society and government  a fact that has and always will be a true    the power of a dangerous  or any  government is its control over its peoples thinking without them realizing they are being controlled  The totalitarian dictatorships of the past are obvious examples  look at the Nazis and making genocide  acceptable    but what is more frightening is  some of the statements describing the ridiculously oppressive Big Brother government  describe even some actions done by our  free  democratic governments  It is truly disturbing to realize actions in your country s past may have had the same purpose this fictional government had    trying to control your thinking That brings us to the purpose of all of this  1984 isn t meant to be just doom and gloom  it is meant to be a wake up call  Like 1984 says   Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   Knowledge is power  And the only way to prevent such terrible acts of control from developing is for the people to have real knowledge of what is happening  As such  I think this book should be read in schools  When a statement  even fictional  can be still relevant decades  even generations later  it is proof that it is in some way true  1984 portrays accurate signs of an unjust governing system  Things everyone should be aware of  Things everyone should fight against so that 1984 never truly becomes reality  A mayor comprension mayor dolor  Esta vez fue mas desgarradora la lectura hacia el final  su  falso recuerdo  me arranco las lagrimas  su desolacion me calo hondo  Aun asi  no queria terminar de leerlo  Hasta la siguiente  Orwell  This is one of my favorite novels of all time  However  I do not recommend reading this at a time when you are clinically depressed  which is what I did  While I was still able to enjoy it  the grim subject and content did not fend well with my state of mind at the time  When my college announced that they put on a play by this novel  I took my whole family to see it  This was one of their promotional photos And the show was amazing  This  as you may have guessed is a novel with a political and social message  You have Winston Smith s hate for sexual oppression  You have Julia who challenges all that  You have a government that watches your every move  You have doublethink   If you are into totalitarian  dystopian novels with a heavy message  that doesn t exactly end in happily ever after  then it is for you I do recommend listening to Muse s album  The Resistance   which was written entirely about 1984  as a soundtrack to the novel  That made my experience with this very multi dimensional  They did make a crappy movie by this novel in the 80 s  but I hope for a remake  And I d kill to play Julia   D  1984   Orwell s greatest masterpiece  has only a single fault  its premise failed by thirty years  For if it was called  2014   only minor details would need changing This is an intelligently written book  one you wish to have written yourself  The author has a peerless capacity of examining the problems in the world he built  translating them with utter perfection into our own frail reality  It is as disturbing as it is addictive  and it casts a shadow so deep upon your reason that it

it makes you think about things like politics  media  marketing and the fact that as much as you would like to rebel against it  you can do nothing alone  And that it is almost impossible to wake the consciousness of everybody about it  I don t think we are doomed nonetheless but a perfect society will only be possible when each and everyone sees the pettiness of today s society  You simply can t create an utopia when sexism  racism or other intolerence are still existent  But hey  it s only my opinion George Orwell s  1984  was definitely a book that had a profound impact on me for various reasons  Orwell beautifully creates a world where the mere thought of rebellion is forbidden through powerful but simple psychological methods like Big Brother  It then leaves those in power to do whatever it is they want  effectively conveying a world of pure submission  Multiple times when I was reading I wondered if submission was really preferable to extinction  Morally  some people would rather die than submit to some higher power  However  through the conception of  1984   it dramatically brings a world founded on submission  The people fear individuality  they fear that the government controls every emotion  thought and action  The protagonist Winston believes that they are not omnipotent and desperately tries to find something they cannot control  This leads him on a downward spiral to the dangers of freedom and self thinking  I loved this book despite how depressed it made me but it seems the best books are those that touch us at a personal level that we are not even comfortable with  Also  this book is heavily detailed and has great and memorable writing  It effectively transfers the tone of the book easily to the reader  Readers will grow to sympathize with Winston s struggles and will want to shout  down with Big Brother  with as much malice and pride as possible  This book is definitely a must  especially if you read Orwell s other books  like  Animal Farm   It is very fascinating and quickly becomes a book you cannot put down until you read it to the very end  wrwyl wSf Hln fy mjtm tn l rby  lHly  w ldhy ll sf sytmd llmstqbl  yDan m lm ytm tGyyrh

ly mSlHh  When my teacher Mr  DeSolvo recommended this book for extra credit I thought sure no problem  then at the end of the book I thought this is a very strange one indeed    What it is that we want  A warning  an option  The party can t be forever  A proletarian somewhere must also pass on the idea  An underground base must be equally as subtle  There are too many people in the world who get strange ideas for no apparent reason to say the proletarians could never rebel  They re unwatched  Now what if everyone got tested  even proletarians  at 16  There are still some to slip through the cracks  to see what s going on  Control and power over the party may be stronger than anything yet enforced  but omnipotence and omniscience over all its subjects is impossible to affirm by the very nature of not knowing if you don t know that you don t know  What O Brien said may not have been concretely true at all  since reality is in the mind  then a whole horde of proletarians could be coming to burn them down and since he believes the party to have absolute power than even when confronted with demise he will go on seeing it as reality  Doublethink is not useful in times when a response to danger or change must be immediately addressed  There s always gonna be  sick phucks  by a society s standard that could shift what is popularly thought of as desirable  People naturally rebel  even against what is good  Think  Moral men manned the concentration camps of the Nazi s  corrupted by overwhelming evil  But not all of them could ve been unresisting  merely attaching themselves to the most magnetic of powers available  Some are not like that  The human mind is too distinct from the human mind  Yes we are all remarkably similar when summed  but how different in some ways  by what others tell us though    And if big brother is the only one doing the talking then oh my  But even then  some MUST rebel  don t assume your mind s shortcomings are inherent in everyone  some are not merely defiant  some are formed from a different clay altogether  but then that is false because our genes are the clay and it s all there  the same 99 99  for everyone  It is a fully imagined world  from details big and small  of the three major powers  their purposes  down to the posters of big brother  the grimy walls  the proletarians who resemble  oddly enough  the normal people of today  Its premise  that the successors of last year s government should eventually figure it out  is pheasible  and frightening  In fact this enitre book is frightening in the power it had to open my eyes about why I act against my will  and what my will is ultimately guiding me towards  My belief in God for the past three years  if there was any  was itself and act of doublethink  and continues to be  I realize that I have been trying to convince myself that yes  although in reality I do not accept his existence  it d be nice for him to be  more comfortable  would give me an imaginary friend whose promises I can fall back on  I had deliberately been betraying my logic in a loop of escapist thoughts and traps  Is it better to be happy  or to be knowledgeable  The ideas in this book were very well thought out and explored  yes reality  as far as we can tell  is only what we think it is  It s out there always without us  but how to reach and and grasp it  What are the powers above us trying to accomplish  What would be best  and how to decide that when everyone s definition differs  Is it tempting to say that being told what is best and never hearing otherwise could bring and end to    what  To refute this remember  would you prefer to be lied to if the truth would cause you suffering  So many thoughts  and warnings  and predictions and battling philosophies and their consequences come together in this novel and I m glad he wrote it  It s minor flaws or weaknesses in argument can hardly be called flaws at all because their rebuttles have never been proven or called for in the real world  But it s a good guess  as good as any  and has such a practical application to our lives that it might be hard to go back to lighter  escapist stories  at least with the same enjoyment  Literally have no words  Part 3 was amazing   lHrb hy lslm lHry  hy l bwdy ljhl hw lqw   rwy  ry    rbm knt tshbh wq n Hd ltTbq l mn jh  lslyb nm mn jh   jzn

bachelor institutes and schools  Is a hard  raw novel concerning politics  love  betrayal and torture  and this both senses  psicological and phisical ways  They are all living in a world where history  being changed when and as Government wants  citizens have come to a point in which they do not know anymore in what year are they living in  It is supposed to be 1984 when it starts  This haunting nightmare of a possible human future reminds all time to certain last century awful ways of governing  Needless to mention which two ones  They are governed through and by the Intelligence Service  does Putin Government tells You something about this    in the book the so called Thought Ministry  So  they think they have a leader  who is a war heroe and whatever else You or they may want  But in reality no one knows that one  Is only a virtual icon  a face in a big screen  That is said to watch the population everywhere  full time  There is the Propaganda Ministry  the History Ministry and could not lack  the War Ministry  For they all live in a permanent economy war State  Having the whole world been divided in only three continents  The citizens we know  e g   live in Eurasia  In this context  there is only one political party to which all are forced to be part of  Altough  to become a militant  one has to deserve it  For sure  Does all this remind You some despotic regimes   Then You can reach higher positions in the Party  for instance  betraying a friend or the love of your live and denouncing him or her as a Party enemy In this context  two militants  officials of the Party caught the eye one each other and start an affair leading them directly into sincere and wonderful love  And shall leave the plot at this point for it deserves not to be revealed  Only adding that this absolute Masterwork will constant and increasingly surprise the reader with turnings of the screw  Me  while reading it  thought twice or three times  okay  and now what  and then  and what else now   and again   but what else can happen  it is going to end now    but no  there is always a beyond  Or so it seems  Not to say  that when it really ends  the open and perfectly closed end is the least but logical  one could expect  So  how not recommend to everybody  if someone has not read it yet  this beautiful terror metaphoric storytale  The big O stands in its highest literature position due to this work  Maybe he is still watching us all  all along his watchtower  He shall live for ever in our minds  that is sure   wHd  mn lrwyt lkshf  lty tj l mn lS b

someone else already is this  Anyone recall the New Year s Day  also a sunday  Peanuts strip for the year 1984  Snoopy felt awful after partying all night  but not from too many pizzas  too much root beer or excessive dancing   It s thinking about all the George Orwell jokes we have to listen to in 1984    Charles Schulz never followed up on this thread of thought after that  can anyone tell me what you think about this  thanks tl dr If there s one thing that can render the role playing  happy go lucky   I m so awesome I don t even have to remember my human s name  cloudcuckoolander of a beagle somber and sober  it s George Orwell and his masterpiece Nineteen Eighty Four  A very fitting choice  Mr Sparky   I can t believe it took me this long to read it  Loved it  The only thing i disliked was it disregarded religion entirely which given today s actual unfolding of the future clearly could not be done other than maybe North Korea  Wouldn t work I m any populations where religion and religious extremists have their base  Loved how creepy the kids were in this world and again in today s context parallel to the dangers of dehumanization coming from addiction to cell phones and the  boredom  of things like reading and education  This book is as important as ever   lrwy   lf b sys     lf b m rf  lHy lHmd llh  n lys fy qdtn mn hw bdhk jwrj wrwyl kl yTlb lslT  llslT

Minor spoilers  but nothing that will compromise the enjoyment of reading the novel in the author s words This is perhaps the first novel I have read entirely at the  Anna Centenary Library  ACL is one of Asia s largest libraries  and famously received a 2 794 page long invoice from Cambridge university press  for books worth 1 3 million GBP  And it s in walking distance from my hostel 1984 is not a novel about 1984  It is a novel about every year that follows it  and every passing year has one mission  Vindicate George Orwell and his predictions  And you ll be pleased to know humanity is tirelessly doing just that Let s come to the book  I have tried to get through this novel at the formative years of my reading  I have always stopped it in the first 30 or so pages  I am actually kind of happy that I did so  Why  Because  until you achieve a certain maturity  the books you read are like those childhood stories your parents tell you  You have a vague but sure memory of enjoying the time immensely  but you don t always know what it was about  And a novel as this  is too good to be used as expendable in such manner Now  I can read with much more patience  can understand much more that when I started out  and more importantly  I know much more about state sponsored mass surveillance  which is the crux of this novel I am a computer engineering UG student  And there is no doubt that today  computers aid the most massive surveillance  in all of humanity s really long history  And we seldom know about it  much less care  for the surveillance agencies are very good at being invisible  It is only partly funny that the NSA was expanded to  No Such Agency  in the initial years In my field  we often hear news of such surveillance measures  at a much higher frequency than in the general mainstream media  The technologies involved interest us  And in such news  there is almost always at least one person commenting with the adjective Orwellian  I was familiar with the word  but never bothered enough to force myself through the book  Until I read Sabah s review  that is George Orwell writes about a world  where the state is in a perpetual state of war  with the remaining two states in the world  Oh  and the state has superior surveillance  geared towards making sure people believe in and wholesomely contribute to the war  There are other motives  but I don t want to spoil the plot for you  in case you haven t read it yet  This following quote shall suffice  until I reread and comment on the writing of George Orwell  rather than summarizing the story poorly  insulting my own intelligence and the author s  Let s look at surveillance first  Big brother is watching you  can be  and ought to have been a reassuring phrase  Don t worry baby  your big brother is watching you  over  is enough to calm anybody s nerves about anything worrying at all  Except  in this case  it is not  State surveillance agencies have a habit of using something akin to this familial tie  Brother  to legitimize their peeping at us  constantly  Usually  it is patriotism  Patriotism is such a primal feeling that even beings of logic and extra ordinary reasoning fail to see reason when they imbibe patriotic words  It is something that has the power to bring people together  something that can validate humans killing each other  spying on each other  and much worse things  because  in the beautiful words of Macaulay       And how can man die betterThan facing fearful odds For the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his Gods  Orwell succeeds in painting an extraordinarily vivid picture of a society that has been convinced that they need to be at war  The constant flooding of information about victories in battle  the war being closer to the end than it ever was  The daily two minute hate was replicated in the real world by almost every country that was at war with another  People were told about terrible weapons of mass extinction  bio weapons and what not  Iraq war springs to mind   Green Zone is a movie you might want to watch  if you enjoyed 1984 Politicians invoking patriotic feelings to aid war is not actually a terribly new thing  We have been doing that for a very long time  It is always some hidden army that will strike us someday  and can be prevented only if we preemptively strike them  The Americans  have great experience in this  convincing their own citizenry that they are the big brother of the world  somehow tasked with bringing peace in the world  and always make sure they engage in war with people for far flimsier reasons than they have a right to Once you convince them you need to be at war with the rest of the world  the next thing to do is warring with your own citizens  Here  almost every single country in the world is at fault  Mass surveillance enables this  The telescreens are modern day CCTV cameras  You are being watched constantly  and your every move given an adversarial meaning People often wonder why you need to be worried about being watched if you have nothing to hide  Such people  can watch this  Video  of the immensely talented John Oliver interviewing Snowden  It will be frightening how Snowden has been painted a traitor  and reminds us of a much more subtler version of the Thought Police Winston writing in a diary and fearing he might be executed for that is not entirely devoid of real world counterparts  State or terrorist execution of bloggers is a news we are all too familiar with Such things are made possible only because of mass surveillance  And we have a myriad of three letter and four letter agencies doing their job 24x7  Snowden revelations  the PRISM program  Wikileaks  are very small apertures through which we can look into the scary world of Big Brother  We have computers that have become extensions of our bodies and minds  And in essence  knowing your computer is knowing you  How  A computer records everything it does  Usually it is for our own convenience  Just like to keep some things close to us  than the others  It helps to remember what websites you researched yesterday  without taking up the memory space needed for it  It helps to remember the song you recently heard  since you may decide you like and want to play it again tomorrow  But  it also helps people who want to watch you because  in essence  your computer is like a detailed journal of your thoughts  tastes and leanings  And that is why governments want to put back doors in our computers  Some succeed without spooking people  Some  like Kazakhstan  just pass a law and make it impossible not to be watched   Source   There is a very real possibility that you have not heard about this  Convinced yet  So yes  we have mass surveillance and mass hypnosis happening right amongst us So  the question here is not whether George predicted all the minute details for us  It is that he predicted the broad plans  and gave us convincing reasons to believe in that predictions  How could you have a slogan like  freedom is slavery  when the concept of freedom has been abolished Don t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible  because there will be no words in which to express it And when memory failed and written records were falsified   when that happened  the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted  because there did not exist  and never again could exist  any standard against which it could be tested Orwell manages to tell us all this  and not once do you find it implausible  He isn t too keen on propaganda or advancing his own ideas  The things that happen is his novel  happen here too  albeit for different reasons than stated in the novel  But they do happen and with an alarming similarity to the fiction And we have it happening  with an exponentially subtle manner  It is almost to believe in it  even if the truth is staring right in our face People often tell you the novel is depressing  It is not  If anything  it is like reading a prophecy that is coming to fulfillment around you  But it need not scare us  You know why  For every Winston that submits to the Big brother  we have a Snowden that breaks the Big brother s nose  All we need to do is not to let ourselves believe that anything at all can be a valid excuse to constantly watching us  The masses never revolt of their own accord  and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed  Indeed  so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison  they never even become aware that they are oppressed Orwell has written perhaps the most accessible account on Surveillance  And he has done that with chilling accuracy and inviting simplicity Highly recommended  one of the most amazing books I ve ever read offering a different view of how ideologies can be changed and used to serve those in power and how media can control people s mind  i think Orwell himself if he lived today wouldn t reach that point of perfection in describing the contradiction those in power have  last if anyone wants to read a different novel that offers a distinguished political view 1984 is your first choice  Haunting This is the  darkest  book I have ever read  It made me feel very depressed  I have no hope left for humankind  we are all doomed  Seriously though  I had a headache and felt sick after reading this  maybe it was because I sat for 5 hours finishing it  but I was hoping for Winston to save the day  that magically something or someone will pop up and save us all but it never happened  he just dies as a person  metaphorically   at least that s what I read from the ambiguous ending   he and his thoughts were killed by the bullet along before he was released   It always turns out all right in the end  but not in 1984 I ve had this book for months and wish I had read it back then  I only read it now because we are going to study it for English class  because it s one of those books that changes the way you view the world and everything  I m not sure I enjoyed it though  well I thought the beginning was great and very entertaining and then it just got more disturbing each chapter  It is frightening how realistic it is  despite it being a work of  fiction  it is shockingly believable  George Orwell is a genius  he is a prophet First I thought I was going to focus my revive on what a good read it was  expect for that tedious extract from  The Book   but that s not the point  everyone should read 1984 because of what it has to warn us about  I do not know though how we can stop it from happening  But just like when Winston read  The Book   this is all stuff we already know except worded for us on paper  You might be traumatised for the rest of your life but read it because it s better than not knowing  h  kthr mn mjrd rwy  bl h  rw y w tSwr  myqyn lmstqbl tswdh syTr  ldykttwry  w rDwkh lsh

afastamento emocional para conseguir ler todo o livro  Sao muitas reflexoes levantadas e muitas inquietacoes despertadas sem nenhum cuidado Orwell nao esta nem um pouco preocupado em ser cuidadoso ao tratar sobre como seria o futuro  levando em consideracao as mudancas que estavam ocorrendo em sua epoca O mundo era tao absolutamente controlado que o Orwell o descreve assim  Como era possivel fazer um apelo ao futuro  quando nem um rastro seu  nem mesmo uma palavra anonima rabiscada num pedaco de papel  tinha condicoes de sobreviver fisicamente  Nesse futuro a memoria individual nao existe  as pessoas sao levadas a ter uma memoria coletiva  onde o Partido reescreve a historia sempre a seu favor  Nao sei voce  mas tenho essa impressao algumas vezes  de me lembrar de um fato de uma maneira e todos a minha volta se lembrarem da mesma ocasiao de uma forma diferente  E angustiante Winston  o protagonista  esta assim  so com suas memorias e se afogando na agonia de entender o que acontece e nao poder fazer nada para se livrar ou livrar os outros  Ao se sentir assim  ele decide ser a oposicao ao Grande Irmao  lider do Partido  seu pensamento e  Nao ha a menor possibilidade de que ocorram mudancas perceptiveis em nossa geracao  Nos somos os mortos  Nossa unica vida genuina repousa no futuro  Ele sabia que nao poderia vencer o Partido agora  mas acreditava que poderia fazer parte de uma revolucao  unido se a uma organizacao que possibilitaria uma vida livre as outras geracoes Depois desse ponto  so lendo mesmo    nao quero estragar a experiencia de leitura de ninguem   Your kind is

 You re the only freaking insane in this world OR 2  All the people in your world are crazy except you WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  A Review of George Orwell s Book  1984In the years 1948   1949 George Orwell wrote a fantastic book about his prediction of how society would act and be governed  This book would soon go on to become one of the most awakening and eye opening books of the twentieth century  It foretold of odd human characteristics that we would develop in the wake of a suppressive government  and Orwell does a brilliant job in his description of human weakness  Overall though  1984 is a dark  depressing book with Orwell transposing his concerns and feelings through the point of view of the main character  Winston Smith  who struggles to keep sanity in a world where everything he believes and holds true is false  To make matters worse Winston lives in what is known as a  negative utopia   Orwell does this to show a nightmarish reality  and to have the reader side with Winston s point of view  Having read 1984 I believe that it should be rewarded five out of five stars In the book 1984  Orwell discusses at length in a symbolic fashion about the struggles and weaknesses of humanity  Brilliantly orchestrated  he opened my mind to human fear  For example  relatively close to the end of the book he speaks of how humans have a fear that they will do everything in their power to relieve themselves from  I find this to be true  I think that everyone in this world has a fear that they wish will never come true  Orwell uses these fears to show how much power the government of 1984 has  and to show Winston s ideas beginning to change in favor of how the Party says they should be  In Winston s case his greatest fear was rats  and to get rid of being eaten alive by these rats he sacrifices Julia  the love of his life  to endure this pain  In this way  Orwell takes an intellectual and mental idea of everyday life  and symbolically explains it in a fictional story  Doing so  I believe Orwell made it clear for me to understand what he wanted to convey  and how he wanted the reader to feel  Another key concept to 1984 is how Orwell perceives the use of thinking  and thought process  In my opinion this was mind blowing  I had never perceived thought in that manner  For example  much like in Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll  Orwell speaks of what the majority thinks triumphs over the ideas of the minority  Such as if everyone in the world believed that two plus two equals five  and only a couple of people in the world know that it equals four  who s actually right  For the world looks at the people who believe two plus two equals four as crazy and delusional  while the minority knows that they are right  In Alice in Wonderland  Alice comes to the conclusion that everyone in Wonderland is crazy and she s the only normal one  However this idea is countered by the Cheshire Cat s observation that if everyone is crazy and she is the only normal one  is she really normal or abnormal  How Orwell explains this idea and creates it into a story proves his masterful literary skills  and it sets up for a revolutionary concept to behold and ponder In the end Orwell s story combined with his ideas make up 1984 s hook  for it lured me into a new way of thinking while terrorizing me into believing the world of 1984 could become a possible reality  He sheds light on human weaknesses and fears showing possible ways an enemy can take advantage of the situation  He then in turn confronts the psychological and intellectual side of my brain causing me to question my thought process and somewhat confusing me at the same time  However much of the confusion is relieved by the well paced storyline and the conflicts between characters  Overall  I am thankful that the world of Orwell s 1984 did not become a reality  and that it is only a warning of how humanity needs to act  I was thrilled and terrified by the contents of that book  and without any hesitation would gladly award it with five out of five gold stars  J ai commence la lecture de  1984   ce classique sur lequel je ne m etais encore jamais penchee  mardi soir  Autant dire que l actualite qui sevit depuis mercredi  n a fait que me plonger davantage dans ce roman de George Orwell  resonnant en moi d une maniere bien particuliere  Tout ceux qui l ont lu savent bien sur de quoi je parle   1984  a ete ecrit en 1949 et est un roman d anticipation qui prend une toute autre ampleur des annees apres  George Orwell depeint un monde totalitaire  dans lequel plus aucune liberte n existe  Les libertes de s exprimer  d aimer et meme de penser sont abolies  Les refractaires s exposent a un traitement particulier  Le  Parti  re invente l Histoire  pour implanter toute sa puissance dans les cerveaux des    etres vivants  Ils ne sont plus des hommes  juste des pions  On les place ici ou la  on leur dit ce qu ils doivent penser et ce qu ils doivent savoir  Les rapports entres les gens sont reduits a neant afin d eviter toute conspiration  tout  eclair de genie  qui provoquerait la moindre reflexion sur ce qu il se passe autour d eux  Dans ce monde dans lequel les libertes sont systematiquement bafouees  nous suivons Winston  qui reflechit  malgre lui  Ce roman d anticipation se verifie  inutile de le dire  dans l histoire qui est la notre  Meme si nous n en arrivons pas a de tels extremes   1984  nous fait penser que la frontiere est mince entre la liberte et le totalitarisme  et que seule la voix de l Homme peut faire basculer les choses  George Orwell nous fait penser qu aucun rejet de la liberte ne doit etre accepte  car un rejet  ouvre la voix a beaucoup d autres  A mediter  a mettre entre toutes les mains   Writing a review to a novel as critically acclaimed as Orwell s 1984 is a daunting task  as I feel no thought that I might possibly have about it  will quite suffice to express how well crafted the novel really is   So I won t even try to say anything clever  I ll use this space to catch some thoughts I have after reading  so that I can compare them with whatever I think the next time I come back to this book  It is no question that it is and will remain as one of the most powerful warnings ever issued against the dangers of totalitarian authority This morning  a night s sleep after I finished reading it  what s strongest in my thoughts though is 1984 s penetrating analysis of the psychology of power  of history and of language  It s indication of what they respectively mean for the human condition The gloomy ending leaves you with a pessimist outlook  Though democracy formally  supposedly won out the Cold War with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990 s  1984 does not seem exactly averted considering the state of the world at the moment  March 2014   And I wonder if Orwell was wrong insofar as the imminent danger is not only intrinsically political  but most of all intrinsically human And personally  I guess I am hopelessly sentimental  I am a little troubled by and don t know what to make of the love in this book that has meant so little  made no different and was out of everyone s mind so casually  The ending  as a whole  is something that will need more thinking  Creo que del canon distopico este es mi libro favorito  Si  tenemos a Un mundo feliz  La naranja mecanica  Fahrenheit 451  pero ninguno logra un final tan opaco como este  Lo que mas me atrapo  aparte de las descripciones de los ministerios y la relativizacion de la verdad  es que el amor se configura como la alternativa rebelde  Asi  no es solo una opcion romantica como un camino hacia la libertad  Notese como este libro realza el papel de la memoria historica de los pueblos como via de dominacion  e igualmente como se construye el sentido comun  algo que Raymond Williams explica muy bien en sus ensayos   1984   The Road to Wigan Pier  A Parallel AnalysisWhen The Road to Wigan Pier was commissioned  fortuitously in the period when Socialism was on the retreat and Fascism on the rise  Orwell must already have begun to glimpse the world which he was to envision with vigorous clarity in  1984   This review is a dual review then  of  1984  and of  The Road to Wigan Pier  In The Road to Wigan Pier  written ostensibly as a documentary report on the life of the working classes in the industrial towns of england  Orwell uses his reportage to investigate two crucial questions  1  Why class differences persist even when the means exist to destroy them2  Why socialism is failing practically and intellectually even as the moral facet  of it rectitude  is irrefutable  to his mind  at least The reader has to be warned that The Road to Wigan Pier can seem a bit rambling  or circuitous   at times but is in fact a tight composition and has been echoed by many writers since Orwell  The structure of the piece is quite elegant  In the first section  Orwell provides a direct detailing of the life in the  industrial towns   of the proletariat  of the toiling classes  It is evocative and reminded me strongly of Behind the Beautiful Forevers  Life  Death  and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity in depth of detail and emotional involvement  It is a quick tour but captures the essential cruelties and degradation of life   rotten housing  lack of toilets  unemployment   and the complete hopelessness of it all  But just as Boo does later  Orwell also manages to convey that it is not due to the people  it is purely due to the conditions imposed on them  Orwell is very careful to drill this point home  It is the situations that make the classes This is exactly what I expected from the title of the book though I had also been resigned to some amount of political commentary  Orwell being Orwell  But soon the real purpose of the book starts to take shape and for a while I felt disappointed  But Orwell soon reveals the purpose behind is autobiographical excursions in the second part of the book and now I have come to regard this second section as the most vital  It is a narrative technique which I am now starting to notice in a number of other authors trying to grapple with class differences  including Suketu Mehta in Maximum City  Bombay Lost and Found  trying to come to terms with a riven Bombay So  in this second  and to me most important  section  Orwell exposes his own biases and prejudices through a frank autobiographical study  He opens up his own upbringing to show how prejudices creep in and establish themselves in our psyche and never let go no matter ho hard we hammer at them  Situating himself as a symbol of the middle class  Orwell uses this sketch to convey how we are all prey to such class prejudices and that we need to work within our own limitations and especially of the one s we are trying to convert to the specialist cause  by we  I mean the Left Book Club   the intended audience of the book   He uses the pungent example of  lower classes smell  as an irrevocable class barrier  This has come under much criticism but it is important to keep in mind that it is only and example  he could have gone with the  non pronouncement of the  H s  or any other minor but hard to avoid detail  To criticize the choice of detail is besides the point Then comes the last section  the fulmination and the grand rhetoric  This section is the hardest to agree with and feels the most dated to the modern reader  Orwell tries to examine his second major point   Why is Socialism Declining  His answer is that it is because it is associated with mindless mechanized progress   due to the wrong instruments of propaganda which are turning away all the right sort of people and bringing only the  quacks  into the socialist circles  Instead  to win the all out and most important war against Fascism  which is  Orwell asserts  at the Gates   the Socialists need to forget class propaganda  accept that class prejudices will take longer to disappear  as elucidated in the previous section  and focus on the principles of  liberty  and  justice   which Orwell is sure will bring all the moral and intelligent people into Socialism  Only by asserting this moral core of Socialism  stripped of class propaganda  can the scales be tipped in favor of Socialism and away from Fascism  Now the humanistic picture of the depravations of the first section are resurrected in another light and Orwell presents both the class proletariats as well as the  economic proletariats   i e  people like himself  born to a higher class but earning only the equal of a industrial worker   as mow likely to tend towards fascism  if for no other reason but self preservation  Socialism needs to bring these classes into its fold  That is the crying need of the day   And then perhaps this misery of class prejudice will fade away  and we of the sinking middle class     may sink without further struggles into the working class where we belong  and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful as we feared  for  after all  we have nothing to lose but our aitches   H s    The Literary Lens   The 1984 ReappraisalThe conclusions advocated by Orwell must seem too simplistic to modern ex post readers  but there is another angle to be explored here that is not political in nature  This arises from the fact that this exposition was published before either 1984 or Animal Farm and after Brave New World  Orwell is quite clear that the Utopia  or Dystopia  or better  Utopia Caricatured  envisioned as the end goal of socialist progress in Brave New World is the very core of intelligent man s revulsion towards Socialism   arising organically due to associations with  softness  and degradation  Orwell needed to show the other extreme to turn this revulsion on its head We often compare Brave New World and 1984 as if they were alternate predictions and give marks to Huxley for having predicted better  But this misses Orwell s point  Orwell wanted to show the other extreme   the purely Fascist Dystopia   to bring around the people who were revolted by Brave New World and similar Utopian visions that were doing the rounds then  such as The Dream and Men Like Gods   Orwell calls these visions of the future that is based on mechanical progress as   the paradise of little fat men   which he admits was  aptly caricatured by Huxley in Brave New World  You can also think of the caricature in the Wall E movie for a better visualized reference  Orwell gives a grand argument  based on how the purpose of machines is to make human life easier and thus softer  to show how the Wall E future is pretty much inevitable according to this conception of progress  He needed to present the antithesis to this vision   1984  No matter how bad the caricature of the socialist progress  the Fascist one is surely the one to avoid  1984 was the rubbing in of this idea  already set forth in 1937 with The Road to Wigan Pier  more than a decade before the fictional attack became unavoidable for Orwell Thesis  Antithesis  Synthesis   Boom   said the Three Sisters And  if we can claim that Orwell s prophesy is today less imminent than Huxley s  then Orwell wins the battle of  who can scare them most   Well done  Orwell  you turned the course Huxley  you needed to scare us more   we are headed there fast  still   He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past  Edit  Changing my rating from a 4 to a 5  because I really haven t stopped thinking about this book since I finished it  So many fantastic ideas that really change the way you think about the world we live in  even today So it s taken me a long time to get to this classic  but I m so glad that I didn t read it any earlier in my life because I don t think I would have truly understood it if I was the younger version of myself  Or would I have  If I think that I could have  it would be true that I would have understood it  but if I continue to doubt my past self  then there is no way my past self would have understood it  It s all up to me in the moment  It s all in our minds anyway  right  I really enjoyed this  but I was a tiny  teeny bit disappointed  I guess I went into it assuming I knew all about it  and I was wrong so it was a little confusing and at times frustrating  but I m probably more at fault then the book  It is true what they say though  this book is no less than terrifying  There s no doubt that Orwell is a genius  I found that I was continually doubting that this book was written in 1948  It seems like such a modern idea  it s hard to wrap your head around the fact that around the same time that Hitler s war had ended  someone was coming up with this idea for a novel  It just seems like so long ago  but it s such a newidea  See what I did there  The book  if you have not yet been forced to read this at school  or have chosen to pick it up on your own accord  is based around a totalitarian society in which is run by an ominous figure called Big Brother  Most things in this society are illegal  or in rations  There are government workers called  The Thought Police   based off of the NKVD   a communist society in which brutally tortured the Jewish who were lead by Joseph Stalin  The Thought Police basically  as the name suggests  govern the thoughts of everyone in Oceania  England  America  Australia   If someone thinks or even dreams about something that is against Big Brothers government  they are taken away  and are  turned into gas   They basically become non existent  Big Brother controls everything  He who controls the present controls the past  and so he has the power to erase these rebels from history  and his government has enough control to make sure that everyone in the community forgets about their existence as well  This is actually reminiscent of some propaganda that Stalin controlled wherein he removed those of power from images when they were killed off  It s really quite scary to think of how reminiscent this book and society if of our own  I think that s what makes the novel so terrifying  The sheer amount of power that Big Brothers government extends is incredible  They basically have the influence to be able to convince their people that 2 2 5  I believe that this notion is meant to be representative of the Communist party slogan from the second  five year plan  in which they hoped to accomplish the said 5 year plan in four years  They intend to make the impossible  possible  and they intend to make everyone around them believe that what they are doing is right  and is possible  and so they have complete power over the people s thoughts  Much like the party in the novel  I can t say I was a huge fan of the characters in this novel  I definitely didn t connect with them  but I honestly don t think that s really the intention  You re meant to see the flaws of these people that show evidence of past society s still being present in the totalitarian society  Just because Big Brother has this power over people  doesn t mean that they can be completely rid of their human urges  You can t wipe out centuries of human progression and human instinct so easily  You can enforce rules  but there really is no way to make people follow them  They will inevitably break these rules  no matter what the consequences are  We see this happen in the novel with one of the main plot points being the relationship between the protagonist  Winston Smith  and Anti Sex Party co operative  Julia  There relationship is illicit  firstly  because no two party members are allowed to be together  and secondly  because relationships can not be based on attraction  It is illegal for two people who are attracted to each other to be with each other  they must only remain together to reproduce to make future spies for the party  The party seeks to abolish the orgasm  and merely set dates for fornication  hoping to basically make sex a banal task one must do  but not look forward to  One thing I really loved was the mystery behind the Ministry of Love  It s set up as a place that s not happy  right from the beginning of the novel  but you just don t know what it is until the end  and it s such a great reveal   view spoiler  I love that the only form of  love  is the love of Big Brother  and that is essentially the only reason why prisoners are forced into torture  for the forced love of their leader  hide spoiler   I m not sure if any of this made sense  or if I actually managed to say anything at all  it s late and I ve had a long week so forgive pls  I could go on and on about the symbolism in this book  because it really is incredible  but I would go on for a long time  The social critique is amazing in this novel  and it really scares you  The imagery is extremely frightening  Highly recommend this book  even if you re not into classics  It s quite easy to read   This book is a hard read  especially for someone who is so use to reading contemporary books   But i swear to you  once i was done with this book  nothing was the same  it changed my view on the world  it made a true impact  and now even when i look at a good place where everything is tidy  all think is  what dark secrets are they hiding behind this perfect image   This is the dystopian novel that beats all dystopian novels  i absolutely love it   How brilliant is Orwell  When Winston and Julia meet in the flat for coffee  cor i can almost smell it Then when Winston gets to see himself after his punishment at the hands of Big Brother  The disgust at himself is almost too painful And then the final act  the realisation before his finale       amazing book And Jees isnt this Room 101 way more scary than the Hancock Merton one on the tv I listened to the audiobook  which is wonderfully narrated by Richard Brown The really scary thing about this book  which was first published in 1949  is how accurately it describes so much of the world we live in today  This classic has been dissected in so many ways over the years  so I m not sure I have anything new to contribute  My only regret is that I waited so long to read it  This book is bloody marvelous  and should be required reading for every citizen  no matter the country  every decade or so   Dystopia  I bloody love dystopia  think I mentioned that in another review  Why specifically  No idea  one of those odd things that I can t really explain  But this  this book is one of the three that made me want to begin writing  pitched up with On the Road and Transmetropolitan  this was the first of those that I read back in ninth grade  Problem is  that was the last time I read it and proceeded to Brave New World soon after  so a few things may or may not be muddled up in this  and I apologize profusely for it now  I think nearly everyone has had to read it at some point and is passingly familiar with the main concept of it  the whole idea of the nation being at war with another  the monitoring of the population at large  the ten minute hate every morning  Smith s rebellion at the whole thing just from buying and recording in a journal  the proles  O Brien  Julia  betrayal  room 101  etc  Hm  feeling just a bit more horrified when I thought of the room and the rat cage on Winston s head than earlier  fantastic But these would be nothing but concepts if it wasn t for Orwell s writing  that massively verbose prose  the density of the whole thing  to be so engrossed within a situation and know what the color of the carpet in the room Winston and Julia met in  If there has been anything from the novel I wanted to emulate in my own writing  it s that  Intricate detail on all things  setting a situation and setting in such a way to show the audience exactly what the writer sees   Full of intelligent metaphors  it scares yet comforts me  to die hating them  that was freedom   It is a rightly acclaimed novel written by the author of animal farm  Its story is based on socialism and its consequences on individual freedom and their lifestyle  Orwell  the author  depicts the medium  characters and events very graphically and makes its audience feel the experience of being inside such an oppressed society and to sympathize with the main character of the novel  Smith  whose mind is in lunacy compared to the main beliefs of others  The special inventive wording like doublethink  black withe  crime stop and etc  is very succinct and clear to describe the concepts and mentality of the dictatorship imposed by the party  I read the book with enough deliberation after each chapter as to understand the beauty and perfection of the story telling faculty of Orwell  The ending appeared to me as very clever  unpredictable and in accordance with the point of the story  and not using unnecessary dramas  The real dramas were the living style and dominion of individuals in a dictatorial social party    Rating Clarification   It is difficult for me to translate my sheer wonder and love of this book into words  but I ll try  This book is one of the most beautiful  chilling  and haunting pieces of literature I have ever read  Orwell s writing style is captivating  the characters are complex  and the world scarily resembles our own  Those things don t begin to cover why I love the book  though  There are so many reasons  too many to count  that this book has stood the test of time and so many reasons why it is important to read  Anyway  I ve decided to split this review into sections so that my thoughts will make some amount of sense  Here goes Plot The plot of 1984 is simplistic  maybe even a little cliche  It s simply about a totalitarian society that oppresses and brain washes it s people  At least that s what it seems like until you delve into the book  Orwell has created a world as complex as our own  We are never given answers to some questions about the society  and neither is the main character  We are shocked by some of the answers  just like Winston  And some we see coming  The point is that the plot seems simple enough until you get into the book and then it thickens with each page  And the terrifying thing about the plot is that while it is extreme  it so closely resembles our society that you can almost start to forget that this is a dystopian  It s pretty creepy and had me wondering where we would be in a couple dozen years  This plot is unlike anything I have read before  and I think it s richly developed and easy to believe Characters There are a wide array of characters in this book  but the focus of the book is really a character study on Julia and Winston  who are both dynamic characters that change often throughout the story  The thing about these characters is that they are both so unlikable that they become likable  They are complex  realistic characters with motives and emotions that feel so real that it s like you know them  Honestly  this book has some of the most realistic characters I have ever read about  They have flaws  but one thing ties Julia and Winston together  their love  It is heart wrenching to watch what happens to that emotion as the book progresses  Even if this book is not a romance at heart  the love between Winston and Julia is poignant and quite easy to believe  I also thought that the antagonists were interesting characters  and I think that they can even be sympathized with  They are simply products of the society that they were raised in  and while you hate them  you feel bad for them too I would do more aspects  but in all honesty their are simply too many and I think that this stories main aspect is the characters and plot  So  what is the moral of 1984  I think that it could be perceived in many ways  but that Orwell s main message is the dangers of a society that oppresses it s people  I think that this book is meant to be a guide  to show us what we need to do so that our society does not become this  That message comes across very well and I believe that Orwell had the right idea  We must save our society before it is too late  and that s what 1984 is telling us  So I think that this is an essential book for everyone to read and hope that all of the people that haven t given it a shot do  It s well worth the read    m qbl lryfyw    kdhb lmnjmwn w lw Sdfw    al  lzmn    khrf      d  m rf  lmstqbl    kdhb byWinn   lryfyw    ql  mrswn    lktb hy lathr l kthr bq

functions left me feeling like a crazy person because I was trying to process the whole thing and was terrified of this  future  Orwell predicted  Then I realized that Huxley  at this point  is more

like an essay  but the novel was mostly political and didactic  I wouldn t say it was necessarily entertaining like the Percy Jackson books  but it was definitely eye opening To think  How far in advance Orwell predicted such a dystopia   or  at least  a modicum of security and intrusion into privacy   in the early 20th century  about 1984 I have not read Brave New World or The Handmaid s Tale  but surely  this would rank among those two  The story of the creation of hell on Earth  because that was easier to achieve than paradise  This hell is one of imagination and memory  In 1984 no one remembers if the world was ever a better place  The old books are all gone  destroyed or revised by the Party and Big Brother  and the English Language is about to go the same way  Winston Smith wants to rebel  but he isn t sure of either what he is rebelling against  or for  I last read this novel in high school  and as a teenager what went over my head was just how fallible Winston and Julia were  They are not rebelling for the greater good  but because they are bored of their lives as Outer Party members  totally devoid of any passion accept for hate Orwell s description of how technology is used to erode privacy is more relevant than ever  Newspeak could have been invented for the Internet  cameras and microphones are already everywhere  substitute drones for helicopters  How the most violent and gory images of the Boston Bombings were pushed into our faces  whether we liked it or not  implied what we consider to be privacy is changing  and people are becoming desensitized to the extremes of violence  Orwell s descriptions of ultra violent newsreels could have been written in response to our world  not six decades before it  Little could be written for a novel like this  Even from the beginning  one has the feeling of reading something epic  something so great and above him herself  that will surely stay with him her after finishing the novel  which I assure you it s totally true  Poetically written and politically composed  1984 is at the same time a prophecy concerning the immediate future society  our own society of surveillance  betrayals  brainwashing  of unsaturated consummation and genuine imperialism  as well as an allegory of past societies  Orwell created one of the best dystopian and sci fi novels about a politically deranged world   consequently it s only fair to argue that he influenced every similar novel of the 20th and the 21th century  A harbinger of the future humanity deprived of love  imagination  free will and independence  1984 illustrates the story of Winston Smith  his thoughts and experiences in Big Brother s lunatic nation  Well done Mr  Orwell  your last novel couldn t be more appropriate  Thank you for offering it to us   1984 by George Orwell is a rather intriguing and complex novel  It takes place in a futuristic  yet dystopian setting  Due to continual involvement in wars and bombings  the inhabitants of the country Oceania are living amongst poor conditions and are being monitored at all times by Big Brother  Big Brother happens to be the face of the Party  which holds the power over citizens  The main character  Winston Smith  is an average man that works as a records editor  He drinks and smokes to escape any paranoia or worries he encounters  Despite the fact that his every move is monitored  he rebels and starts creating a personal diary  which is against the law  Later he rebels even more by sneaking around with a young woman named Julia  They fall in love and find a place to meet up with each other  They decide to rebel against the Party and Big Brother together  Meanwhile  a member of the Inner Party  O Brien  introduces Winston to the doctrines of the Party  O Brien turns out to be an enemy of Winston and turns him and Julia in  It turns out that Winston and Julia weren t as discreet as they thought they were  Both are separated  tortured  and forced to save themselves by turning against each other  In the end  they see each other again  but they ve basically been scarred and changed for life  The novel is actually more dense than it may seem due to the many accounts of symbolism  allusions  imagery  and themes  It contains themes of love  violence  manipulation  technology  betrayal  power  and rebellion  Big Brother symbolizes a god like  omniscient being  Its ironic because its not proven that Big Brother actually exists in the story   The first fact about this book that fascinated me was that the book was published in 1949  How can Orwell see this far this accurately  It almost scares me and makes me awe him The second fact that makes the book still relevant is the fact that a country which abides the rules of strict communism still exists here on earth today  North Korea  I have read  Nothing to Envy  by Barbara Demick which introduced me to the current state of this country  And the knowledge of the state and the book clearly coincided  North Korea is strictly following the rules in 1984 to keep the citizens under control by controlling their minds and souls The third fact that made the book revolutionary is that it inspired thousands of books and movies which consists of tortured brainwashing which makes the audience doubt reality A powerful heart shattering book Became one of my faves       Ora amava il Grande Fratello  Distruttivo  Tristemente vero per certi aspetti    1984 e considerato il romanzo distopico per antonomasia  ritratto di una societa quanto piu negativa possa mai esistere  Ed  in effetti  non c e accenno di speranza nel testo  non c e possibilita  Non c e luce  Per quanto si speri  si preghi quasi  che il protagonista resista alla repressione fisica e psicologica del partito  questa cosa non accade  Il lieto fine non c e Il lettore assiste  impotente e frustrato  all annientamento totale di ogni sorta di sentimento umano E  da ieri che ci penso  che cerco di formulare un opinione Questo non e un libro che puo piacere  non c e niente di piacevole in quello che si legge E  un concetto amaro e pessimista e distruttivo  Nichilista Eppure io credo di aver appreso di piu ora leggendo Orwell che negli anni passati a studiare E  un libro che consiglio  a chiunque Chiunque voglia capire davvero la guerra  quella moderna  quella del pensiero La guerra che erode la dignita umana dall interno

presents both an interesting and thought provoking storyline  This book succeeds as both an argument against communism and as a dystopian narrative  George Orwell carefully creates the book s events  and has perfect control over diction  Orwell furthermore spares no expense at creating a realistic scenario  complete with slogans  songs  and memories  This story has hooked me from the very start  and in the end  has completely changed my philosophy  I genuinely enjoyed reading this book  I hope this isn t THOUGHTCRIME   parca parca dagiliyorsun Sen nesin biliyor musun  Bir pislik torbasi Simdi don arkani da yeniden bir bak su aynaya Su sana bakan seyi goruyor musun  Son insan bu iste  Sen insansan iste insanlik bu  Kitapta bana en saglam carpan sey buydu herhalde Hazmettikten sonra tekrar bir seyler yazarim belki Usually  I am not wont to scrutinize and analyse a book that I ve just read  or even to ponder upon the implications of what I read at some further time  It is  as if  I concern myself only with the immediate story  exploring  if ever  only the peripheries that are necessary towards the continuation of suspended disbelief  I have often taken pride in such a procedure since it removes me from questioning the motives of the author  and therefore  in a manner  preserving the dignity of the literature  A deluded belief  perhaps  nonetheless extremely effective since it is self moralizing It is for that reason  and the profoundest sense of having done myself wrong  even wasting a considerable portion of time and resources  that I find myself to be inspired  I have felt  in the manner Orwell writes  and I might be misquoting  although the essence is preserved   that inspiration lies in reading what you already know  It is  as if an invisible veil is suddenly lifted from your eyes  and in that moment when you read or hear words from an external source  words that describe that feeling buried inside of you  that you know you have been lying to yourself Well  George  you ve done it DOUBLETHINK  and to even consider this seemingly childish word to ever produce such a resonance inside your head  like a flooding crescendo  you can only term it profound  Centuries have passed since men worshiped superstition  believed wholeheartedly that the sun and the moon are the eyes of a giant cat     while simultaneously knowing that they are Gods that have to be sacrificed to  dictating the fates of their lives  I took it as a curious oddity  an entertaining fact that can be supplied when a conversation gets too dull  a plaything not fit to be pondered upon  for how can it be possible for one to think so Stop it  George Why should it matter  what these so called powers on top do as long as it doesn t affect my life  After all  if it doesn t really stop me from smoking the occasional     cigarette  who am I to whine about the supposed oppression  Now  before you start to think that I ve turned into some crazy conspiracy theory belching lunatic  I would like to put your unnecessary apprehensions to an end  I have not  But indeed  one is forced to manufacture scenarios and draw analogies when they read  The masses never revolt of their own accord  and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed  Indeed  so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison  they never even become aware that they are oppressed   In other words  one is forced to wonder Now why  you ask  is Orwell a genius First of all  I never said so  but let us work under the assumption that I did  Now all we have to do is prove why he is one  After I completed the book  the first question that came to my mind was  Why did Winston have to die  After all  if he has come to love the Big B  why should he not continue to live and thus  1 the self deluded populace  Which led me to wonder whether this was the ultimate aim of the Party  to die in service of BB  or at least  the ideals that he stood for  I immediately rubbished that explanation  but wait  I didn t  Perhaps  it is the fact that Winston has betrayed Da Brotha   forgive me  but I can t help but think of BB with a twinge of mockery  that sets an example to the party and Winston himself  because that is what they are striving at  thought control  that betrayal of the Party s doctrine is tantamount to extinction  The genius is in the fact that not only the individual  but the Party itself will believe so  A snake eating its own tail  eh Alright  now that I think of it  I m not going to list down all the reasons that point towards Georgie s supposedly high IQ  Believe what you want Now  why do any of it This  I still don t understand  There is still a lot of time for me to understand why  because frankly  Junior couldn t convince me on that  unless I die  that is Okay  Welcome to Oceania  A world where Big Brother rules over everything and dictates everything  A world where WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  A world where you re being watched 24 hours a day  7 days a week  A world where there is no place for individualism and freedom to think  to act  to speak  A world where humanity is dead  George Orwell wrote this literary political and dystopian science fiction novel as a grim picture of the future  Through this sharp satire to totalitarianism  Orwell pointed out the danger of dictatorial government whether it is left or right ideology in a depressing  frightening  and unimaginable description of Oceania  Ingsoc  Newspeak language  the concept of doublethink  and Big Brother himself  The book that has been widely banned for its controversial ideas is in the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die list  And do I  as a reader  agree that Nineteen Eighty Four should be read before I die  The answer is yes  Because I think George Orwell meant this work to be a word of caution  if not prevention  so that the situation in his novel won t come into reality  melmarianhttp   surgabukuku wordpress com 2012

Orwell is most definitely a man who challenges the current state of  order  in our countries  governments and is skeptical about their decisions and this book is the epitome of his beliefs  It is unorthodox  and it provides such a vivid  notorious  thought provoking image of a dystopian world that suffers from totalitarianism The political themes which constantly appear in this book like the question of dictatorship or democracy  as well as freedom or security are constantly appealed to throughout the book and as you read along you reminisce to these themes  and relate them to the political issues of today enhancing the reading process  Winston s character experiences a massive change in personality and it shows the contrast of one who is not afraid to stand up for his rights and to have his her own opinion and merely a sheep who mindlessly obeys the government  This book brings up so many political and ethical questions that it gauges the reader to keep going as they get sucked into this totalitarian dystopia  A classic that everyone should have on their shelves rwy   bqry  mhm tklmt msh h rf  wSfh   lrwy  tdwr Hwl hdhh lklmt  lHrb h  lslmlHryh h  l bwdyhljhl hw lqwh

read the book entirely through  I thought it was quite good  bordering on phenomenal  considering the prescience Orwell shows with his writing in view of society in the very near future  For a book with only three primary characters  I found myself quite riveted to the story  Moreover  I definitely think it speaks to our society today  Some would argue  and I might be one of them  that you could take the phrase   Big Brother is watching you   and replace the notion of Big Brother with the NSA  CIA  or any number of other alphabets soup agencies in charge of intelligentsia within our government  That is an entirely different discussion but one this book begins to unravel for us Nonetheless  I was very pleased with the book  I thought Orwell did a good job of communicating the story  giving background  and saving the very provocative moments for the end  The book does evoke many emotional reactions from the reader  and I thought Orwell was very careful in crafting the story to reveal just enough at the appropriate times for the reader not to become jaded about the outcome  even if it were already known It s a shame Orwell died at such a young age  I think he could have contributed much more to the world literature in general as well as specifically to the idea of an encroaching government that does not have the well being of its citizens as its primary purpose  I recommend this book for people who are not afraid to look into a future where power truly has corrupted completely but does not also offer the reader a soft place to land  Simply brilliant Utterly deep and true  1984 was a book I had to read for my senior English class  I was super excited to read this book and though it ended up totally shocking me  it was very good  I knew the basic story of this book  a corrupt government that spies on it s citizens  but it goes so much deeper than that  This government completely manipulates and brainwashes these people and there s absolutely nothing they can do about it  If they even think about going against their leader  Big Brother  they get tortured and killed  It was all just so sad  but amazingly written Even though this book was really good  I do not recommend it for everyone  There is quite a bit of violence and some sexually explicit moments  But that s what gives it it s really amazing a raw elements  So if you feel you re emotionally mature I say go and pick up this book  Not only will you read an awesome book  but you will also learn a lot about different types of governments and how people in different countries are treated so poorly  lw kn fyh njwm tny knt bl trdd dyh llktb dhktr Hjh shdtny lyh knt lmnTqy  wlsls  lly t rD byh wtHs f l nh mbytklmsh y klm    l dh byHky  n wq  f ly m sh    lmdh Twylh bldn lmnkwbh

llh wlkn nqnT mn  hl mSr There are very few writers whose work have been so profound that their names have become adjectives  Shakespearean  Kafkaesque  Orwellian 1984 remains George Orwell s greatest legacy  a fact shared by Roberto Bolano s novel 2666  both books with a four digit number as the title  both written frantically by authors who knew they were dying  both profound in their exploration of human cruelty  both lifting the veil of propaganda and rhetoric to get to the Truth underneath I try to re read 1984 every few years or so  so as never to forget Orwell s powerful message  We Must Not Let This Future Come To Pass   and to rekindle the tingling literary joy I experienced when I was first exposed to the book in my last year of high school  The clandestine budding romance between Winston and Julia  the ever present terror evoked by the telescreens and the Thought Police  the Party s final solution of engineering humanity out of every human being  the hope and optimism that lives in Winston s heart  which is then crushed by O Brien in the Ministry of Love s Room 101  and which returns  oddly enough  in the form of the book s appendix on Newspeak Totalitarianism is still very much a reality around the world  with civil liberties always under attack  and so it s important to keep the nightmare world of Oceania and Airstrip One alive in the mind  One must be ever vigilant for signs of the watchful eyes of the Thought Police in CCTV cameras and internet wiretapping  of the destruction of language resulting from devolution into contextless acronyms and SMS speak  of the censorious invasion into our very minds by authoritarian and corporate influence 1984 can only be described as a tragedy  Boy finds girl  boy loses girl  boy loses self  With the final lines  Winston Smith gloriously professes his love for Big Brother and thereby takes the final step in becoming an unperson  but his suffering and rebellion serve as inspiration for us all to never take our lives and freedom for granted  Orwell s literary sacrifice of his most human protagonist remains one of the greatest contributions to the world of letters and to the continuing species of humanity  George Orwell s 1984 was mandatory reading during my schooling  and typically assume most students educated in North America have encountered it by the time they re out  so I was surprised to see it end up on the iO9 s list of sci fi books that people claim to have read  but haven t actually  Written shortly after World War II as the world was becoming increasingly polarized between the burgeoning superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union  the book is set in the dystopian future of 1984 where the world finds itself pitted between three warring superpowers and is a go to in not only English courses  but finds its way into History  and Political Science courses from High School all the way up into University  Told from the POV of a government bureaucrat from the Ministry of Truth   responsible for the daily barrage of propaganda leveled against their populace to maintain support of the war effort   it chronicles his struggles to embrace an individual identity in a society that demands total obedience to the Party and adherence to their narrative as it shifts to meet the government s ever fluctuating needs  Despite this being written in the context of the  Soviet menace   the observations made in 1984 are as important now as they were then  as we bear witness to our present day struggles with personal privacies and governments actively changing history to better align the narrative with their political agendas  and how easily technology can be used to facilitate such  Definitely a must for everyone to read regardless of any personal preferences they might have http   www cultureaddicthistorynerd c    1984 di George Orwell  pseudonimo di Eric Arthur Blaire  viene pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1949  un anno prima della morte dell autore affetto da tisi  Non riesco a capacitarmi di come nello scrivere questo libro ci abbia visto lungo  raccontando di un mondo immaginario che noi adesso definiremmo dispotico  in una Londra distrutta dove il Partito  con a capo il Grande Fratello  controlla  osserva e spia ogni tua mossa attraverso i TELESCHERMI  presenti ovunque e impossibili da spegnere e inculca nella mentre delle persone la politica del partito  LA GUERRA E PACELA LIBERTA E SCHIAVITUL IGNORANZA E FORZAUn mondo dove nulla e illegale ma quasi tutto e sconsigliato  Il pensare e ridotto al minino  la NEOLINGUA  istituita per ridurre al minino il numero delle parole  si sostituisce all inglese  nessuno e amico ma tutti sono compagni  pronti a denunciarti al primo segno di disaccordo contro il Partito  Un mondo orribile e opprimente  dove le gioie della vita e gli istinti stessi dell uomo  i sentimenti e i pensiero sono aboliti   Ma Winston   il protagonista del libro e una piccola lucina di speranza in mezzo al buio che avanza   convinto che prima o poi il mondo e l umanita riuscira a risollevarsi   che ci sia ancora una speranza e che essa risieda tra i PROLET  Il popolino  gli esclusi  considerati al pari degli animali e di sprezzati da quelli del partito come Winston  ma che sono gli unici che ancora conservano l umanita che il Grande Fratello vuole cancellare dal mondo e sostituire con l odio Se c e una speranza questa  risiede fra i Prolet  Finche non diventeranno coscienti della loro forza  non si ribelleranno e  finche non si ribelleranno  non divertano coscienti della loro forza Il problema dei prolet pero secondo Winston e che   in un mondo che brucia  essi non riescano ad avere una visione generale dei fatti  Indignandosi per le cose sbagliate e ignorando i problemi piu grandi  Vi richiama alla mente qualcosa Ci sarebbe da scrivere pagine e pagine su questo libro  tematiche che vanno dal Tempo al Sesso  dalla Famiglia alla Fedelta  ma il libro e cosi importante e famoso che sono sicura che troverete online analisi migliori e piu estese della mia  Non so perche io non abbia mai letto questo libro  perche non me l abbiano mai proposto al liceo  Sarebbe interessante far fare un raffronto ai 18enni d oggi tra il mondo di questo libro e la realta attuale  Penso che  come e successo a me  aprirebbe molte menti e si scaverebbe una nicchia nel profondo della mente di ciascuno per riproporsi in continuazione Ultimamente i libri e film ambientati in mondi post apocalittici si sprecano  mondi distopici dove la societa lotta contro un tiranno  Tutti hanno sentito parlare della saga degli Hunger Games e sicuramente tutti hanno o letto i libri o visto i film  Bene  se questa comparazione mi e concessa  1984 e la versione seria di quello che sarebbe Panem in una realta priva di illusioni e lieti fini  perche non tutte le storie ne hanno uno Chiaramente e un libro che DEVE essere letto Non ci sono condizioni   ne pecche o critiche Erica Con este termino mi re lectura de la trilogia distopica  1984 es por lejos el mejor de los tres  muy constante  no tiene partes excesivamente aburridas como los otros y un muy buen final  no solo se habla de fascismo  este libro critica el comunismo y otras formas de gobierno poniendo todas a la misma altura  A  Fahrenheit 451  le falta imaginacion   Un Mundo Feliz  decae en la mitad y el final es horroroso  por eso este libro es la lectura definitiva de los tres  1984 is a perfect example of what our world would look like if we had a nuclear war  Winston Smith  the protagonist of this story  finds himself wondering about the past  This drives him into the idea that everything that is normal in Oceania is wrong  He begins keeping a diary of everything he can think of about the past  As the story goes on he falls in love with another girl who hates Big Brother  the dictator of Oceania  They then find a secret oraganization against Big Brother and begin scheming  The story isn t all roses though something bad happens to them but you ll have to read it to find out what  This book it s so good  The climate of book it s dark and some scary  The main hero is called Winston  Winston is a office worker in government institute  He feels that something wrong in his life  He don t know what is wrong  but he feel that Winston live in a very safe country  The country has main idea called  big brother  Winston life in this country is very hard because he is be observed 24h per day All people in this country are observed 24h per day and they have a very small freedom Winston bought a pen and notebook and he is trying write a diary  And the story is beginning    One of the most gripping and influential books I ve read  hmh jy khtb khwb bwd   khyly khwb pysh rft   wj grft w fwql dh tmwm shd   Ty khwndnsh hmhy

lHkwmt wl nZm  l  n lktlwj wHd  Overall excellent read  Five out of five for sure 1984 written by the mastermind  George Orwell was published in 1949  Approximately sixty years ago  It s been a long time since it was out  Well  it still doesn t fail to deliver  A short summary  The main character feels that the government is doing something very wrong and tries to create a revolution to stop it Pros  Excellent use of vocabulary  Seen many new words throughout and learned many things  Easily believable setting  Everything from the first page to the last page resembles a real world  One of the three FIRST  dystopian  novels  MEANING  ALL BOOKS SUCH AS DIVERGENT  MAZE RUNNER  THE GIVER AND MANY MANY MORE WERE INFLUENCE BY THIS BOOK  AND THIS BOOK STILL BLOWS MOST OF THEM OUT OF THE WATER  A prediction that s probably going to become the truth  The fact that many people are losing their human qualities such as sociality through virtual social medias and gratitude through tumblr or instagram alarms me and makes me question   will our world become like the world Orwell in imagined  Cons  Quite confusing at the front   Some pages such as 200 230 were just plain  research papers   They were quite hard to read  Theme    Not really  more of a warning to mankind  Unless all humans stands up and try to make a change  all will lose human qualities  love  thankfulness  bond between parents and children  without even noticing it  I recommend this book to all people  Especially the ones looking for a CHALLENGING read with some insane plot and true outlook of the world  it is quite inappropriate so be sure that you are not sensitive of the matter   After all of these years  still very good  How did Orwell know what we would come to in the twenty first century  Constant warfare with some vague Eastern enemy  Fear  hate  and a government that spies on its own citizens  It s for our own good and to ensure the defeat our enemies  By having this book read you won t be the same ever The book was memorable  to this day it is very fresh in my mind  Although some part of the book are rather long and unnecessary  I did enjoy this book overall  It is definitely a book you must read before you die  Absolute classic  and more relevant today than ever   after all we do live in an age where every notebook has a webcam  countless living rooms have Kinect cameras  there is CCTV at every street corner  the government is spying on calls and emails at an unprecedented rate  and the amount of computing power we have available actually makes it possible to completely analyze peoples  behavior  1984 is an absolute MUST read for everybody And it s well written  too  This book gave me the chills  It really makes you think about society  and about how much of the news that reaches us is actually true  Orwell was right  he was just 20 years off   I stole that line from Christopher Hitchens  I admit it   Probably one of the most important books of the 20th Century  and I have no idea how to review it properly NC The book that began my love of dystopians   1984 was a great read  It was very intense in many spurts  This book affected me because even though it was written in 1948 it had brains behind it like it was written in the 2000 s  This book is so advanced because it sort of represents our government today  Our government watches and monitors many things  just like this book  Unlike the book our government does not watch us as much so we at least have a little bit of privacy unlike the characters  Society today would comment as in how realistic and how it pertains to today s lifestyle  All the cameras or telescreens watching people  The books intended audience is to every common person because they do not want the government to have complete power over the citizens  The setting is crazy and has people watching when they don t even know  This eliminates free thought and creativity  so people do not know what to do  rwy  1984 lrwy  lknz  ___  l

t gush  but seriously this is the dystopian future story to start it all  freaking Terminator  wouldn t exist if it wasn t for this story  sort of   Orwell s writing is amazing  the world of 1984 is both compelling and terrifying and it makes the reader really question the importance of free will  and Big goddamn Brother  God this book is perfect  the highlight of my time in education was getting to write about this beautiful beautiful book for my A Level coursework so yeah 10 10  A   5 shiny golden starts whatever you want  just read it and that kickass Apple advert from the 80s  you know the one This might be one of the scariest books I have ever read  Power for the sake of power  Though I am certain that my friends who do not embrace any type of theism will grouse at this  I can t conceive of much else outside of theism but power for the sake of power  It might be said that theism in its various strains is a means to power for the sake of power  It can certainly be used for that  How far are you willing to go to impose your concept of good upon people  I sense that if we are willing to go much outside of the marketplace of ideas  where  ologies and  isms can be bought and sold freely  then we are no longer interested in promoting a good as much as we are interested in obtaining power for the sake of power  that is  controlling others by force Someone is going to have a monopoly on power  Organized society requires that someone have responsibility for the sword  This being the case we need to endeavor to make sure that that monopoly is governed from without and within and easily toppled  Man  this book scares the crap out of me  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars  I feel speechless  SPEECHLESS  I do have one thing to say  I BELIEVE that no matter what 2 2 4  In a world where two plus two must equal five  a man dares to believe that the answer is four In this novel Orwell describes a world ruled in such way that man and animals became much alike  The tableaus he used and the terms he coined all testify to the ingeniousness of the writer  And to his cleverness  Orwell manages to completely shock the reader when a moment which was evidently expected since the early first chapter comes  with one simple line  as chilling as a sentence could ever be  You re the dead   When you finish reading 1984 for the first time  you d feel like lost in yourself  consumed with a massiveness of ideas and questions   You d feel sorry for yourself being a part of such horrible world  and you can see every little detail of the novel all around you 1984 seems to talk about dictatorship and regimes claiming revolution  but truth is  you can t see any difference between these regime and any what so called democratic regime IngSoc   Democracy BigBrother   Peace MakersInner Party   International CompaniesDoublethink   public opinionTelescreen   Broadcasting companiesThoughtcrimes   anti Semitism  wikileaks  open data  hack activism  etc It s no more about fear  hatred and negative thoughts  Power seekers  have found better tools to keep their control over the world  They are founding a whole system in which some men have choice  feel free  are well fed and educated  but know nothing about the other men  they don t know that they have better life level because others are starving  they don t even care  But  I don t blame Big Brother  I do blame Winston  because he was weak  because he didn t believe in the truth  he was just believing in himself To be read over and over again  There were many parts of it which just blow your mind away  A simple read but with many thought provoking sentences and situations  There were some parts which I did not enjoy much and would most likely give a 4  Especially the one where he is reading The Book  But the other sections before and after outweigh this  I was thinking more and more about each thing that happens in this book as I read it   Is it happening now      Can this happen in the future   Negative Utopia by torture and psych control  Would remain relevant for many years  Note to self   should read the other negative Utopian books   I just loved this book  I couldn t hardly stay away from it during the last 100 pages or so  It was captivating  fascinating  and thought poking  I don t think you have to be a conspiracy theorist to like this book  It  however  does make you think about our government  not just the US  but government in general  Politics is all about power  specifically who has the power  One of a government s purposes is to provide law and order  and  I believe  that gives way to some form of controls  As in the case of 1984  the society has four ministries  Truth  Peace  Love  and Plenty  We can see the parallel between these ministries and real life functions of the government  Information is filtered through the government in  as needed  manners  Nobody knows for sure what is considered to be  real   not even the government itself  Or information is delayed  so that by the time it s released it wouldn t matter as much  Orwell cursed the capitalists  but he acknowledged that socialism wasn t the way  Government lied about what goods were being made  And goods being made were not what the society needed  e g   they needed razor  but that wasn t being manufactured  bootlaces were   Oh  I can go on     I was rooting for Winston toward the end of the book  I didn t want him to break down  I couldn t help but felt sad for him  He wasn t able to feel love    wasn t able to experience regrets or grief  over his mother  Today there were fear  hatred  and pain  but no dignity of emotion  no deep or complex sorrows He fell in love with Julia  It was real to him  He was happy  And I think that he tried so hard to cling on to that love    It was like he put her and his love for her on a pedestal  In the end Big Brother succeeded  and he broke down  It was truly sad to me   Sometimes   she said   they threaten you with something  something you can t stand up to  can t even think about  And then you say   Don t do it to me  do it to somebody else  do it to so and so   And perhaps you might pretend  afterwards  that it was only a track and that you just said it to make them stop and didn t really mean it  But that isn t true  At the time when it happens you do mean it  You think there s no other way of saving yourself  and you re quite ready to save yourself that way  You want it to happen to the other person  You don t give a damn what they suffer  All you care about is yourself  His love was ideology  I felt like that was how many government turn one group against another    whether in a civil war or even in a caste system  Sometimes you start out with the best intention  but somewhere along the road you re just broken down It was fascinating to read the two chapters from the book  The ideas that Orwell casted were just so awe inspiring  I went back and reread the two chapters  I m not implying that I agree with what he said in the book  but I appreciate this complex thoughts and ideas It s one heck of a book  I read 1984 for the first time in high school  in the mid 1990s  At the time I do not think I understood how much it was commenting on the world around me  And perhaps it was not  as much as it is now  Because it definitely is now  It is not hard to hear about the NSA programs and not think about the telescreens and the Thought Police    it was why I wanted to read the book again  But it goes beyond that  The idea of controlling people s education and inequality to make them stupid and afraid  so that you can control not only their present and future  but their pasts as well  The idea of the collective bandwagon being more truthful on reality than the objective nature of reality  The use of continuous war to justify and propagate inequality and power concentrated in the hands of the high class  All these things are happening around us  only not to the systematic extent accomplished by the Party in the book  Orwell meant this to be a warning decades ago  but it is still a warning now  Think for yourself  and don t get fooled again  1984 wHdh

first time in human history  power has become absolute  is narrated by Orwell so horridly yet realistically that you become seriously doubtful if the destiny of our race would not be such  There seems no shortage of reason behind a complete totalitarian society  as throughout the whole history  humans have longed more than anything only one precious thing  POWER  The modern states also strive for this invaluable desire  One might wonder why that should be termed wrong  in stead of maintain partial power  to gain supreme power over everything  even over the thoughts of people  This is that sort of literature which fills your mind with utter pessimism about the future of human race  not giving any hint of hope  Hope may lie somewhere  this type of positivism has become quite a convention to end any pessimistic writing   but the essential human instinct which is corrupt with dark desires leaves us almost nothing to hope for  1 The author came about to emphasize the themes of trust  loyalty to oneself  and of others  Orwell overall tried to point out that something you are told to be right may not be the case  People can be fooled to another bidding as in the novel Big Brother over sees all 2 The events in this book reveals the authors intentions of how the world isn t as it seems  One has to find out for themselves  or to be fooled by it  Even in today s world  our government does what it can to do for its people  But do we really know if we are free to do what we want  Not all done can do good  but for whom it is directed to 3 This books per say didn t make me uncomfortable at parts  but it made me realize with enough effort  anything can be accomplished even when things seem dire  This makes me want to try harder at the things at which I struggle most 4  I would highly recommend this book  It opens your mind in more than one way  I can t put it down  Every time I read I  I learn something more about the world and myself  If I could  I would give it 10 out of 5 stars   Truly amazing yet creepy   One of the few books  I would want to re read more than once   Best of the best   Disturbingly thought provoking  Quite possibly the most perfect book ever written  This book has wrecked my brain and sent chills down my spine  I love it  Nunca jamas en mi vida  me paso de terminar un libro y quedar atonita  angustiada y con un dejo amargo en la boca  Cualquier parecido con la realidad  no es coincidencia   Kebebasan ialah kebebasan untuk mengatakan bahwa dua tambah dua sama dengan empat  Jika itu dijamin  semua yang lain mengikuti    hal 110 diawali dengan ekspektasi tinggi karena tahu bahwa buku ini termasuk kedalam buku terbaik sepanjang masa  bagi saya sendiri buku ini adalah buku masa depan  memang buku ini lahir pada tahun 1949  meskipun begitu tidak peduli kalau ceritanya meramalkan  masa depan  tahun 1984 yang udah terlewat  pun juga saya belum lahir  tapi cerita yang tergambar adalah tetap merupakan gambaran masa depan  sebuah contoh sekaligus kritik terhadap negara totaliter  yang mungkin sengaja disampaikan oleh George Orwell sebagai peringatan agar situasi di negara totaliter seperti yang digambarkan dalam bukunya ini tidak sampai terjadi di dunia nyata ya  semoga aja apa yang digambarkan di buku ini tidak kejadian  karena siapa juga yang ingin hidup di negara totaliter seperti Oceania  apa apa di awasi negara  ngeri rasanya menjadi seorang Winston Smith meskipun punya pacar cantik tapi bahkan mau ketemuan aja harus dibayang bayangi rasa takut diciduk oleh negara  hidup serba di atur  semua perbuatan  perkataan  ekspresi wajah  diawasi ketat 24 jam oleh negara melalui teleskrin  suram suramnya negara totaliter seperti yang digambarkan dalam buku ini meskipun fiksi  tapi terasa nyata  terasa nyata karena George Orwell begitu pintar dalam menggambarkan keadaan distopis sebuah negara lengkap dengan aturan aturan serta norma sosialnya pokoknya tidak ada ruginya membaca buku ini  kisah yang sangat dalam dan kompleks  kualitas terjemahannya pun sangat baik  penggunaan gaya bahasanya diatur sedemikian rupa mirip seperti gaya bahasa pada sastra klasik Indonesia  jadi tidak terasa seperti membaca buku terjemahan  ada banyak sekali kalimat kalimat yang  quotable   salah satunya seperti yang diatas  jadi ingin dibuat  quote selfie  lalu upload di instagram  war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength and watchout BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU  HOLY SHIT  I ve never written a book review on here before  but this book    wow  I literally just finished 1984  and I am seriously contemplating everything right now  This book makes you THINK   And doublethink too  I ve rarely been so gripped by a book  The ending especially  No spoilers  but shit gets real  The scary thing is how disillusioned everyone in this book is  How could anyone possibly believe that a society founded on hate is better than a society founded on love The Orwellian writing is superb  At times  I felt like I was being brainwashed along side Winston and everyone else in the novel  I seriously couldn t put it down  which truth be told  is something that happens more with my iphone than with books  But I loved this book  For anyone who is considering reading this book  do   This is probably one of my favorite books of all time  The emotion and realism that Orwell captures in his book is amazing  and this book really made me view life differently  I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone  The ending was really the scariest part  Not because of what happened  but because of what did not happen  I only realized this weeks after I read it  Such an amazing book  The tone of this book is as depressing as its subject matter  appropriately  It is a dystopian future in which hypocrisy and government control are absolute  The media is a blatant and all pervasive mind control mechanism  The book outlines the chilling details of one dissentor s struggle to resist the omnipresent  omnipotent and mysteriously impersonal Big Brother  This is a dystopic classic and is still relevant today  1984 es la madre de las distopias y de la ciencia ficcion  Para muchos  el libro de referencia de un genero muy de moda en la actualidad  sobre todo entre los jovenes  La lectura de 1984 ha sido apasionante  absorbente y  ademas  muy didactica  de una forma verdaderamente gratificante  El mundo que propone George Orwell esta ideado  planificado y detallado a la perfeccion  Es sorprendente su capacidad premonitoria  ya que resulta imposible no encontrar muchos de los aspectos de la trama en nuestro propio mundo e incluso en nuestro pais  Aunque esta escrito en 1949  no podria ser mas actual  No penseis en un clasico como algo aburrido o latoso para leer  1984 es adictivo y  cuando lo termineis  os hara reflexionar sobre muchos temas   Puedes leer la resena completa aqui  http   dondestamilapiz blogspot com e     Orthodoxy means not thinking  not needing to think  Orthodoxy is unconsciousness   This is Orwell s masterpiece that transcends its warnings of totalitarianism  Orwell s uncanny prediction of totalitarianism has stood the test of time as apparent in North Korea today  while reminding us to think for ourselves  But after reading it he knew he was not mad  Being in a minority  even a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad    He fell asleep murmuring   Sanity is not statistical  with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom  This is Orwell s plea to strive for objective reality even when drowning alone in an ocean of misinformation  willful ignorance and submission  This imperative was what nearly compelled Orwell to name this novel   The Last man in Europe   Orwell has stated his fear of those who manipulate history which grew when he  as a soldier in the Spanish Civil War  witnessed incredible newspaper fabrications of battles that did not occur  He warns us of the powers of rhetoric and its role in twisting truths into untruths and implores us to hold  above all  our ability to reason as the basis of objective reality  In philosophy  or religion  or ethics  or politics  two and two might make five  but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four    Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull    Learn to think for yourself  Don t be influenced by popular opinions  Scrutinize every bias of yours and identify why you hold them  Totalitarianism is forced orthodoxy  a lobotomy of our critical faculties  The reason this novel will remain eternally relevant is because whether oppressed by totalitarianism or not  one is always in danger of losing one s ability to think  It is true that in most of today s democracies  a  big brother  is a technological extreme we ve not yet reached  although we are trying our best   but the lure of  big sister  is unrelenting and prevalent in social media  subjugating our views and opinions  causing us to blindly follow the majority without adequate scrutiny  If we continue to conform in this way  we edge closer to Orwell s nightmare vision and fueled by today s technology  the nightmare will distend beyond even Orwell s rich imagination  When I finished this book  I wanted to give it a place of honour on my bookshelf  but I also wanted to throw the book out of the car s window  I couldn t handle the end  it was so sad  The storyline itself was very good and interesting  it made me realize that not everyone in the world has the rights and facilities we have here in the Netherlands  You have to enjoy the little things that life brings  In the book  I loved a quote that describes that intention precisely    Winston       He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this  in the cool of the summer evening  a man and a woman with no clothes on  making love when they chose  talking of what they chose  not feeling any compulsion to get up  simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside   The writing was beautiful but sometimes very difficult  Some chapters of the book did I have to re read to understand what was going on  There are some monologues in the book that were so long  I couldn t concentrate me enough to read it completely  But that s probably because the book is from 1948  and I would love to re read this book in a few years when my English is better I would recommend this book to people who can handle a tough story in old writing  I loved the book and I ve learned so much   Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood   Under the spreading Chestnut TreeU sold me   I sold UThere lie they   here lie weUnder the spreading Chestnut Treethis line at the climax part OMG   More horrific than a horror It s a Masterpiece by genius George Orwell The thought of this book provoked from the regimes of Socialist   Communist parties of World War II The initial part was kinda boring but at the middle   then the end was great  The best part of the book was I think the tortures by O Brien   the book of Goldstein   awesome twists The Power Hunger   The absolute corruption by manipulations  view spoiler   I knew how that it was gonna end as a tragedy as I ve read Animal Farm i know Orwell s ways   hide spoiler  It was the worst conditions in a dystopia i ve ever read The world was reconstructed on the basis of Fear   Hatred How the things turned out in the book like Freedom is Slavery  War is Peace   Ignorance is Strength   The concept of Doublethink was the most important part of the book   how the brainwashing they did to the entire population throwing them in the pits of illusions and even burning up their conscience This book was also on the Existentialism   the Illusion of Destiny laying many psychological implications  I don t think this would be suitable for children   shouldn t be in academics although it is thought provoking This was based on the fact that the ever struggling Highs now decides to retain their positions permanently by suppressing everyone else I totally agree with the critics that  THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A WARNING   NOT A GUIDE   This is the most awesome thing I ve read this year  A journey into the eternal darkness of  politics  that should not be missed  Googled  mindblow  and found this  Was not disappointed  This is one of the most important books ever written  It is many things  including an appreciation of the whole idea of language itself  The exploration of an out of balance relationship between the state and the individual is salutary   bqry  HdW l lm  sht f  lm m

George Orwell atau Eric Arthur Blair merupakan penulis berkebangsaan Inggris yang juga pernah meraih Nobel Kesusastraan  Buku ini pertama kali diterbitkan pada tahun 1949  Buku ini berisi pemikiran pemikiran atau semacam ramalan Orwell akan kondisi Inggris kurang lebih empat puluh tahun mendatang yaitu pada tahun 1984  Dalam buku ini  Inggris disebut dengan nama Oceania  terdiri atas kawasan kawasan Amerika  pulau pulau Atlantik yg meliputi Inggris  Australia   Afrika bagian selatan   Oceania digambarkan selalu berperang dengan Eurasia  terdiri atas seluruh bagian utara daratan Eropa   Asia  dan Eastasia  terdiri atas China   negeri2 di bagian selatannya  Jepang  sebagian Mancuria  Mongolia   Tibet   Ya  negara dalam 1984 hanya terbagi menjadi 3 bagian  Oceania  Eurasia   Eastasia  Winston Smith  tokoh utama di buku ini merupakan seorang anggota Partai Luar Oceania yang bekerja di  Ministry of Truth   Departemen Kebenaran  di dalam Departemen Rekaman  Tugasnya adalah untuk membelokkan fakta  menghapus masa lalu dan menciptakan realitas baru  Winston mengubah isi pidato  pernyataan pernyataan pemerintah  isi majalah atau surat kabar  serta arsip arsip lain sesuai dengan instruksi Partai dan  Bung Besar   Tujuan utamanya agar rakyat tidak mengetahui bagaimana kehidupan mereka sebelum Revolusi  dan kehilangan petunjuk tentang mana yang benar dan mana yang salah  mana yang ilusi dan mana yang nyata  Di Oceania masyarakat dibagi menjadi 3 kelas  yaitu Partai Inti yg beranggotakan orang orang pemerintahan yang langsung berhubungan dengan instruksi dari  Bung Besar   Partai Luar yg beranggotakan orang orang biasa yang direkrut karena memiliki kualifikasi tertentu untuk melaksanakan tugas pemerintahan  dan Kaum Proletar yang merupakan rakyat jelata non partai yang dibiarkan hidup dengan pendidikan dan kesejahteraan minim Setiap hari masyarakat Oceania selalu dijejali dengan doktrin doktrin tentang keagungan Bung Besar dan kebencian terhadap Goldstein  pemimpin oposisi  serta musuh musuh negara seperti masyarakat Eurasia atau Eastasia  Sungguh mengerikan rakyat dibiarkan hidup di bawah garis kemiskinan tanpa mereka tau kehidupan sebelum Revolusi itu seperti apa  karena setiap hari masa lalu diubah dan diperbarui sesuai kehendak Partai  Winston memiliki rasa ingin tau yg lebih besar daripada teman temannya sesama anggota partai luar  Winston selalu berusaha mencari tahu seperti apa keadaan Oceania sebelum masa Revolusi  untuk itu dia sering melanggar aturan partai secara diam diam  Mengapa secara diam diam  karena setiap gerak gerik anggota Partai Luar selalu diawasi oleh Telescreen dan Mikrofon tersembunyi  Telescreen ini seperti kamera cctv jaman sekarang  hanya bedanya alat ini bisa mendeteksi gesture2 mencurigakan dari objek yang diawasinya  meneriakinya dan melaporkannya kepada  Polisi Pikiran   Tidak ada kebebasan bersuara berpendapat di Oceania  bahkan setiap pikiran diawasi oleh Polisi Pikiran  Jika ada indikasi atas sikap yang menyimpang atau tanda tanda perlawanan  maka bersiaplah untuk  diuapkan   Ya  diuapkan berarti dihilangkan  nama mu akan dihapus dari sejarah  Penculikan  Penyiksaan  Pembunuhan menjadi hukuman pasti yang akan didapat jika melanggar aturan partai Di Oceania para penjahat pikiran diharuskan mengakui segala kesalahan yang dituduhkan kepadanya bahkan yang tidak mereka lakukan sekalipun  Mereka harus mengakui realitas buatan partai tanpa boleh memiliki realitasnya sendiri  bahkan jika partai mengharuskan mereka mengakui 2 2 5 maka realitas itulah yang harus diterima  Pemutusan hubungan antara orangtua dan anak  suami dan istri  serta antar teman  Tidak ada teman sejati  karena mereka bisa saja melaporkanmu kepada Polisi Pikiran  Pemasungan kebebasan berpendapat ditandai dengan penciptaan Bahasa Baru atau  Newspeak   Bahasa dan kata kata lama  oldspeak  disusutkan  dihapus sehingga tidak ada lagi kata kata yang dipakai untuk mengacu pada sikap perlawanan atau pemberontakan kepada partai Buku ini membuat saya bergidik ngeri  tidak terbayangkan jika saya harus hidup dalam dunia yang diciptakan oleh Orwell dalam bukunya  Penculikan  Penyiksaan  Penghilangan bukankah itu

One of the best novels ever written  I believe  Terrifying  bleak and thorough trip into a totalitarian society  There s a reason  Big Brother  will forever be in our lexicon   Who controls the past

want that to be taken negatively as the sadness is purely from the fact that the book in fact had an end  I tried as hard as I could to stretch it out over a long period of time  limiting myself to only reading a couple chapters a day but I still found myself cheating    Just one more page I swear  This is a book I have been wanting to read for a while now and I am not actually sure why I never got around to it  My dad however must have remembered me mentioning it and bought me this lovely edition as  stocking filler  for Christmas  How such an amazing present could be referred to as stocking filler is beyond me  Right from the start you can see the parallels with how society is now and  while we may not have slipped as far  yet   you can easily see how the government would keep watch to such a scary extent if given the chance  I found myself sharing in the  not misery  but grudging acceptance of Oceania and for once while reading a book I had little hope for a happy ending and felt it wrong to hope for such a thing  I definitely recommend this book to everyone  It makes you think  It scares you  It draws you in to a world that doesn t actually seem to far away  1984 is a book which will stay relevant throughout all of history  It lived up to and beyond my expectations of it and I feel the urge to re read through it already  I know it was the first book I read of the new year but already I can see it being the best book I read of 2012 as another book would have to offer up a lot to beat it I am most certainly in a dystopian mood now though and will have to try and find some good ones to read On a completely unrelated note  every mention of the name  Oceania  makes me long that little bit more for Smashing Pumpkin s up and coming album  Here s to hoping it also lives up to my hopes   Meraviglioso  Un libro GENIALE  Posso tranquillamente inserirlo tra i cinque libri piu belli letti nella mia vita Consiglio a tutti di leggerlo  riesce ad aprire la mente  proprio perche parla di un mondo  chiuso   ed inevitabilmente fa riflettere  E  scritto in modo scorrevole  in certi tratti mi ricorda moltissimo la DDR  nella Berlino Est  mi tornano in mente libri relativi  appunto  alla storia del muro di Berlino  avvenimento che fu successivo alla scrittura di questo libro  1961 1989   che la DDR abbia preso spunto da lui   Credo che ORWELL abbia scritto una grande opera  all epoca era  reduce  dalla seconda guerra mondiale  e quindi ha avuto sicuramente spunti da cio che e accaduto negli anni che hanno preceduto e in tutta la durata della guerra stessa  ma e stato veramente geniale  Questo libro riesco a trovarlo attuale  spesso cercano di  metterci  in testa cose assurde  che alla fine diamo per vere proprio perche piu persone pensano di vedere questo fatto avvenimento  o credendo in qualcosa in piu persone   automaticamente  puo diventare vero  e proprio la nostra mente che lo da per tale Non ho trovato nulla di scontato  molti avvenimenti non li avevo immaginati  non avrei mai pensato che certe cose accadessero il  quel  modo o  nell altro   e riuscito sempre a sorprendermi  Spesso capita che quando si legge un libro  si percepisce cosa accade dopo   per 1984  non e assolutamente cosi  Avevo optato per due finali e alla fine  un terzo mi ha completamente spiazzato  non lo avevo minimamente immaginato ORWELL con questo libro e entrato totalmente nel mio cuore  ed e riuscito ad aprirmi gli occhi  rwyh mn ldb l lmy tSwr lmjtm  lshmwly ldhy yHkmh lHzb lwHd bTryqh mbd     mstw  lfkrrwy  tqr  mr  tlw nr  y lbd h ldby  All I can

Wow  Honestly I loved this book more towards the end    At the beginning it felt like it dragged with all the descriptions and all the background stories from Winston    I think at some point I even got confused between the Party  the thought policy and the brotherhood    After about 60  this book seriously hooked me up  Julia and Winston made a really cute couple  although after Julia and Winston get caught they are out to just self themselves and give up the other one easily   Julia gets tortured although the book does not really explain what happens to her but when Winston sees her after his own torturing then we can deduce that she WAS tortured  her body and spark is not the same  it seems to Winston her will of life has been sucked out of her    Winston on the other hand gets tortured by O brien  and is given a set of confusing answers  is the Brotherhood real   you will never know  the Bother hood is watching   ok     In end we don t really know if Winston is dead or not  although I believe he is shot in the brain and the two brandy tears rolling down his nose is blood    I don t really know  I left me quite intrigued     just like what going on here  In Orwell s 1984 we find Winston struggling with his place in the world he lives in  Watched 24 7 by Big Brother  and working a mundane job changing the past to keep the government correct  he can only find solace writing in a notebook in a small corner away from the telescreen  He scribbles his disgust with his world  and begins to hope that the man he sees in the Two Minute Hate every day is real  and that he can somehow join him  You know  not very good thoughts to have about the government that dictates your laws and can punish you severely  especially a government with the amount of power as Big Brother  I will not go too much further into the plot because I like to avoid spoilers  I love the novel  and I give it a 5 star rating  It builds upon the dystopia that was growing within Animal Farm  minus the animals of course  and takes it to its extreme ending  complete and utter control  This novel shows a bland  dangerous world  so when the plot twists hit  it becomes an insane read  The ending is depressing  but I will not say why here  Amazing book that is good for anyone who enjoys dystopian fiction   Este livro deixou me com uma especie de febre  quase conseguia sentir aquele espirito

shock from the ending  This book started out boring but then varied from interesting to lovey dovey to boring again and then the ending was an explosion of intensity  I REALLY liked this book because of the ending  which is most likely everbody s favorite part   The ending really got me thinking and made me frustrated but it was also realistic which I like  I also enjoyed all of the characters personalities because they were so interesting yes  even the antagonists   This book is a suprisingly good read and I think everybody should read it once in their life  1984 e considerato a ragione un capolavoro  La lettura di questo romanzo post moderno  in quanto ambientato in un epoca futura rispetto allo scrivente  offre delle importanti riflessioni al lettore poiche Orwell immagina un mondo in cui il Big Brother  incarnazione del potere assoluto e quindi deumanizzato  controlla le vite di ciascuno  L obiettivo primario  pero  non e solo il controllo  ma la manipolazione delle vite e questa si puo ottenere solo agendo in alcuni ambiti  1  il linguaggio  ossia privando gli uomini dell uso di un lessico variegato  2  l amore  poiche non essere liberi di amare  rende schiavi di una vita anodina3  il bipensiero  ovvero la negazione degli eventi passati e quindi di un principio di non contraddizione  in qualsiasi momento si puo far finta che il Partito abbia commesso un azione sbagliata  negando che sia mai avvenuta 4  la poverta  perche se ci si disabitua alla bellezza non si avra motivo per vivere con intensita e quindi per volere qualcosa di piu 5  la guerra  poiche utile mezzo per fomentare odio e incanalare le frustrazioni E  triste pensare che il mondo di Orwell non sia poi  cosi dissimile dal nostro    I didn t know what to expect when i started this book and didn t think much while reading it    until Winston and Julia were arrested  Then it became clear that we had lost to big brother and it was a race against the clock to save ourselves from whatever was coming  First part was world building  second part was centered around julia  i thought that Winston and Julia would end up married  and i expected  oh so wrongly  that the last part would be about rebellion  As i saw that the last part was quite short i thought that maybe it would only put the presages of a change and the hope that would came along  But no  The object of the end of the book was the end of humanity  And it was painful to read  O brien was    terrifying but impressive at the same time  Do read it   One of George Orwell s most famous novels  Nineteen Eighty Four   sometimes published as  1984  was written in 1948  and published in 1949 by  Secker and Warburg   The original title of the novel was  The Last Man in Europe   which refers to the main character Winston Smith  The novel was written in an age when dictatorship and totalitarianism were present  for example  in the Soviet Union  So in my opinion it may not be unintentional that similarities can be drawn between the political system of Airstrip One  a province of Oceania in  1984  and the politics of the Soviet Union  The  world  being built up in this novel with the English Socialism or Ingsoc  as it is named in the language  Newspeak  invented by the government  is anti utopian  It means that it intends to look utopian  but it is flawed  It looks like that everything is provided for the citizens  but in fact they are misled  Think about  for example  the history books being constantly rewritten  Besides  the government s main motive is not to care of the good of others  but it is solely about having as much power as they could possibly get  Naturally  this includes the power and control over others  as well  This is what Big Brother is for  But what happens when there is one man  whose thoughts and feelings are not  switched off   The answer is that this totalitarian system interprets this  incidence  as a need for cure  which could rather be called mind control or brainwashing  because the result is beneficial only for the political order and not for the  patient   It is again not about what is good for the citizen  but what is best for the system   I wasn t expecting this book to be as scary as it turned out to be  It started out as dark and gloomy like a lot of other Dystopian but as I got towards the end the physical reactions this book gave me were more powerful than possibly any other book I ve ever read  I am talking specifically about room 101 and the horrors that lay within  I wanted to cry out of sheer despair for Winston  My stomach churned constantly throughout the very last part of the book  Overall  this was a very powerful read and the message that it portrays was done beautifully through Orwell s stunning writing  However  I read this as someone who is particularly ignorant about politics and whilst I found the sections that were essentially info dumping quite helpful some people who are like me and do not know about politics will find this frustrating as it is a lot to take in in some places    Nao era fazendo de ouvir  mas mantendo a sanidade mental que a pessoa transmitia sua heranca humana   Eu resumiria a moral do livro nessa frase    This book is about so much more than analyzing the projected future of a Stalinesque communism  The insights into language  your vocabulary can limit or free you  and the expanse of a military state are still appropriate  Love Orwells ability to take an idea and expand on it to show the consequences of unchecked power  Ultimately this book is such a great read in the era of ongoing wars  government supervised social media etc  His challenge to the push and pull of the limits of security vs  freedom is astute  I feel like once you read this book you ll start finding similarities in the modern world and that makes it a must read   My favorite book of all time   Hry  lfkr hl fkrt ywm  n t ysh mthlm  shw fy hdhh lrwy    lm kn  ntZr  n ystslm fy l khyr  khb

the spreading chestnut tree I finished reading  1984 by George Orwell  two days before  Since then this verse has haunted my sleep  giving me my worst nightmares  Until today if asked  Why do you care about history  Or existential reasoning        I probably wouldn t have answered  After reading 1984 I have a definite answer   Go and read 1984  People s indifference to the tampered history and Winston s pathetic attempt to figure out how the world was before tyrannic government and O Brien s statement  the Party  control all records  and we control all memories  Then we control the past  do we not   astoundingly portrays what happens when we stop struggling with these questions and allow a small group of people in power to make all of the judgment calls  Incredibly depressing  Also incredibly profound  Wooooow  This book was almost prophetic  I read it first in high school because I had to  and then I read it a second time as an adult  It was as an adult that I actually enjoyed it  I didn t understand the significance of it as a teen  Truly  what Orwell envisioned for 1984 is more in line with 2014  Simply wild  I enjoyed it immensely  and will likely read it again and again  The 1984 concept I find is connected vaguely with some of the dystopian literature of today  Take the Hunger Games  for example  The concept of rations and the song about the Hanging Tree is similar to the Chestnut Tree song and food rations in 1984  only the songs have different metaphors  more or less  The most frightening thing about this book is how incredibly real the author makes the concept with three slogans alone  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  The way George Orwell created the possibility of such a concept is so believable that you end up fearing that this might happen to us in real life  I am only comforted with the idea that as long as the world keeps its humanity  this could never happen  Please  good God  let us keep our humanity  I feel that is the moral of this story  if we lose our humanity  this is what will happen  If we make our thirst for power too great  this is what will happen  The reeling emotion I feel with this book compels me to give it five stars  Doubleplusgood   Best of them all  I haven t read any book that finishes this good  Its like I was in it  msh  rf  bd  mnyn wl  qwl yh   lrwyh dy  bqry  bjd bs ll sf ynqSh b D

It s not just the ultimate dystopian classic  It s a cultural phenomenon  It gave us Big Brother  the Thought Police and  of course  the adjective Orwellian  I ve never read anything that can rival Nineteen Eighty Four for its sheer sense of decay and oppression  There s not a single page that doesn t provide a chill of some sort  and that doesn t hold up a mirror to modern society Nineteen Eighty Four s relevance hasn t diminished over time  despite the parallels to twentieth century political figures that might otherwise date it  Sure  Emmanuel Goldstein might be Leon Trotsky  and Big Brother might look like just like Stalin  but you don t have to know that  You only have to realise that Goldstein may no better than Big Brother  and  most importantly  that Goldstein might not even exist at all  History is written by the victors  It is tweaked  changed  whole parts of it are purged  and Winston Smith knows it  but the truth has been so well hidden that nobody will ever discover it  Not Winston  and not even the reader I love Nineteen Eighty Four  It s a book with a message  but it doesn t preach  Orwell really had a handle on that old advice for writers  Show  don t tell  If you don t come away from reading Nineteen Eighty Four with a healthy distrust of the government and the media  you re doing it wrong  Just re read this book again after not reading it since high school and I loved it even more  Amazing writing   Quien no ha oido hablar de esta novela en algun punto  es de las novelas mas conocidas del genero distopico y una de las mas relevantes  Me es muy dificil explicarme con un libro tan bueno como este  Ya ha pasado mas de una semana desde que lo termine y creo que la sensacion que me dejo con su final ha ido mejorando con el correr del tiempo Winston Smith es un trabajador gris de treinta y siete anos  al menos esa es la edad que cree tener   que trabaja en el Londres perteneciente a la basta zona de Oceania  Trabaja en el Ministerio de la verdad  en la que su empleo consiste en alterar lo que dicen los periodicos antiguos segun las decisiones del Partido para adecuarlo a sus necesidades  Con una ulcera en el tobillo que le pica constantemente y una telepantalla que le reproduce noticias pero que ademas le espia  Winston vive una vida en la que hasta pensar de forma contraria al pensamiento del Partido es mortal  Esta organizacion en la figura de su lider el Gran Hermano  lidera constantes guerras con Eurasia y Estasia para asi  cuidar  a sus ciudadanos  Fomenta el odio hacia el gran opositor y y destructor de la sociedad  Emmanuel Goldstein y promueve la devocion total al Gran Hermano y a la supresion de sentimientos como la amistad  el amor y claro  la libertad de opinion Winston como tal  es un simple peon  Pero con el tiempo ha aprendido a disimular sus recuerdos  sus pensamientos y su rico mundo interior  Es decir  ha practicado el doublethink  la habilidad de tener dos pensamientos contradictorios al mismo tiempo y estar consciente de ello  En su interior  Winston odia el regimen y al Gran Hermano  pero al mismo tiempo debe quererle  Winston en su interior es un opositor del gobierno  y no tardara en buscar a otros que lo sean  Resena completa   http   rapsodia literaria blogspot co     lmr l yqym Hkm stbddy lHmy  lthwr  w nm ysh l lthwr  lqm  Hkm sbddy  nn nqwm btdmyr lklmt nn nslkh llG  Ht  l

of free thinking  the manipulation of the past and the future  An endless situation without hope  Just so dystopian and just so impressive  A palatable Matrix War is Peace  Freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength and the way the George Orwell convinces us to such a blatant belief that 2 2   5  is in itself a literary feat  Newsspeak and Doublethink sends shivers down the spine when one thinks how and why of power explained in the  Book  have been implemented He has analysed the very fiber of society  how is one supposed to revolt when one doesn t know if he is being oppressed  When the history is being rewritten continuously and to make one s most fundamental beliefs change and also accept them as truth   Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past   One of the best political philosophical novels I ve ever read in my entire life  A book to remember  not only because of the beauty of its language but because of the sinister story it tells  its current  real and futuristic  Its constantly ringing alarm bells that speak of hoplessness and degeneration  Winston Smith facing big brother  a huge overbearing  dogmatic  security conscious  thought manipulating system that seeks to  regidize  life and streamline the mind to think in a tunneled approach while espousing a system of thought control to keep the one party and one ideology going for the sake of political power  1984 is about big brother watching you through television and camera screen found everyewhere in the workplace  public places  in the home  even the toilet  It says a lot about our world  although the book was published in the late 1940s  Its a book of sad unmitigated horror about altering relations between your spouses  sons and daughters socialized to spy on you  girlfriends and friends  a society where emotions are sapped  and sex demeaning for the sake of serving big brother who looks after and nurtures you  The picture is real  dumbfounded  menotonous and exacting  depicating a future society of drudgery  skullduggery and absolutism  The horrors continue in the depiction where power is there for its own ends made certain through through continually changing your system of information so whatever  news  you have is constantly being altered  re altered  changed and manipulated to suit different times  and for shameless political expediency  I first read this book about 20 30 years ago and was really moved by it back then not sure that anyone can truly say that they enjoyed this book as it makes uncomfortable reading or at least it should  Anyway now that I m a lot greyer I hesitate to say wiser  I decided to revisit it in particular in light of news stories in Britain about phone tapping and the Edward Snowden  GCHQ spying revelations to name but two I won t go into detail about the story and will only say that the main character Winston Smith is in the minority of 15  of the population that works for the Party  Big Brother  which controls Oceania  He lives in a very grey London where shortages of all sorts abound and a city in constant threat of attack However  he begins to doubt the validity of his work and the tenets of the Party in particular when he falls in love with a work colleague Julia  In their own way they decide to revolt against Big Brother with calamitous consequences  I really enjoyed the character development and despite the greyness of life within London Orwell manages to bring it to life with vivid brilliance  The ending when it comes comes with a bit of rush and it is not a happy one Despite being written many years ago what is most disturbing about this book is that it is so easy to see parallels with life  particularly in the West  today  We have Government ministers that want to introduce bio metric identity cards  CCTV cameras sprouting up everywhere  supermarket storecards that monitor exactly what you are buying  seemingly more and more losses of civil liberties in the supposed unending fight against terrorism with more and more power taken from the people and given to even smaller cliques despite talk by Politicians of  localism   It could even be said that the present wars in places like Syria  South Sudan and Central African Republic are in many ways like the  wars  staged in this book  they are not about winning National territory or gaining natural resources but instead imposing one own beliefs onto others and there just seems to be a certain inevitability about it all just as in this book which should be truly frightening This is a very good read and one in which the ideas it espouses should live with the reader for a very long time and as such should be considered as compulsory reading in all Further Education establishments  A timeless message  We should all re read it  Ce que j ai aime   Winston  ce pauvre Winston  Ce qui le rend tellement attachant  c est que ce n est pas un heros  c est toi et moi  juste un pauvre type  qui n est pas tellement attirant  et qui commence tout juste a se poser des questions  aimerait ameliorer un peu le quotidien  juste kiffer sa vie  Sa compagne Julia  avec qui il

une quelconque cause  je veux juste rester libre et qu on arrete de me ronger le cerveau  Merci Orwell  quel putain de visionnaire   tu fais mal  mais c est pour mon bien Ce que je n ai pas aime   Devenir encore plus lucide   http   wc pressepuree fr 1984 george     It was really good  though a hard read due to how much thought has to be put in to be able to understand and relate  1984 is a fictional book that was written by George Orwell in 1948  The book depicts Orwell s horrifying prophecy of what he believes the future will succumb to  Like The Hunger Games  1984 presents an ugly forthcoming after their forms of government began to become power hungry  Orwell continuously restates Oceania s the setting of the novel   motto  WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   Orwell stresses this statement so that the reader can truly understand the ever so contradicting world of Oceania  In this world opposing statements somehow keep the people believing every word they say  no matter how little truth it really holds  Like Katniss  the main character  Winston Smith  is torn between being safe and surrendering to the government or putting himself in immense danger so that he can possess the power of thought and freedom  Throughout the book this proves to be an internal battle for Winston  With so much at stake  Orwell is sure to keep the reader on their toes wondering which direction Winston will run  This dystopian novel is a must read for all  I awarded 1984 with five stars because of the way that Orwell was able to peer into the future and tell a both chilling and horrific view of what the future could very well capitulate to  Although he was imagining 1984 and that year has come and gone  reader s can still compare Orwell s unforgettable novel to what our world could look like in thirty years  For generations to come 1984 will always be a prevalent novel because of its easily relatable and unpredictable topic of the future   I don t know what to say about this book except prehaps the obvious If I say it was brilliant or a work of genius I won t be saying anything that hasn t already been said by the readership populace or some superior authority that is undeniably and indisputably true The trouble is that this piece has become so deeply ingrained in the consciousness of Britain and even the world for it s cultural impact literary brilliance and stark truthfulness that it seems anything that I say might be superfluous and repetitious So what can be said that is new about a truly great novel that seems above reviewing Well for a start to a new audience who are familiar with a book prehaps because it s a cultural treasure or through the media the charm and immediacy of the book as much as it s raw and graphic description of probably the most terrifying totalitarian dystopia in literature lies in the simple and compassionate depiction of it s all too human and familiar characters trapped in a Britain ruled by English Socialism or Ingsoc and the eponymous  Big Brother  The central players in this formidable drama the rebels Winston and Julia are as simple engaging and ordinarily English as anything or anybody could imagine in Anglican lore Their tribulations and courage in facing an enemy who they know too well from within are described with a simple knowing grace and insight Their relationship is described openly and without proper frills not least with the theme of sex an offence under  Thought Crime  which  the party  are trying too abolish or anyway it s erotic element leaving it only for the necessary marriage and children with no  human participation  by the female This was very daring for the time the book was published and it s surprising that George Orwell got away with it so far as I know when the novel was published but also shows a maverick streak I think is pivotal to the novel s thought and greatness Now that I think is a statement of original thinking No such restrictions inhibit the old fashioned working class  the proles  who unlike the inner party workers are allowed their pleasures in the old way and are simple enough to admire the awful regime which doesn t seem to affect them though It is these simple folk that Winston and Julia admire however seeing in them a link to a better world dimly remembered and their faith in the people who one day will over through the government even though it may take a millennium There is an almost constant sentimental longing for things past and old English in  Nineteen Eighty four  and this is seen through the lives of the proles and the eyes of Winston and Julia The world of London s east end still intact in a much changed country is vividly portrayed in the description of it s streets and pubs and is part of an idealism I think that can also be found in his other novel of anti starlinism  Animal Farm  that evokes feelings of freedom and a return to simple values Both books draw their strength and authority from such clear sighted opinions Hopefully I ve provided something new for criticism of an established masterpiece It certainly is a book that deserves renewed examination  Unfortunately  1984 is still real today  Mr  Orwell s account of Big Brother  i e the governement  conformity  denial of human rights characterizes many countries today  Yes I do recommend this book highly  Ever asked yourself why this society exists on notion of goodness and freedom  Why can not a society with exactly opposite values exist   An order based on oppression  and pure pursuit of power  Such is the power of 1984  and Orwell  of course  that you would end up questioning these fundamental fabrics of society  and wonder why good is good and bad is bad  It s like looking into the basic structure of our moral values and discovering that everything is empty within  In a literal sense  Orwell is asking the same question Physicists have been asking for ages  In this universe  why is that matter is invariably preferred over anti matter  What makes good preferable than bad   Not that I am comparing  bad  with anti matter  its just an analogy Yes  this might sound crazy and you might think the questions asked here are stupid  But sit down  read the book uninterrupted for a whole day  and do nothing but read it  And don t just read it  let it flow deep into you  And you would find yourself transformed from the person who believed that  Truth always triumphs  to someone who can t distinguish truth from lie  in a single day   rwy  mdhhl  mn jnb jwrj  wrwyl   Hyth yntqd bh lr smly    lsyd

is terrifyingly plausible  It really did a number on my anxiety  but in a very thought provoking way  I can honestly say that reading 1984 caused me to seriously reconsider my priorities and make some major changes in my life  Beautifully written  my adrenaline was pumping the whole way through and the story haunts me to this day   Side note to anyone wondering  I really wasn t a fan of Animal Farm  Both novels focused on the dangers of authoritarian government  but portrayed the ideas in completely different ways   jwrj wryl bd   rwyh mlhsh Hl   nZrh mstqblyh  nhyh Gyr mtwq hbr h lktb n twq  m lm yrh Hd In around 250 pages  Orwell unravels everything that philosophers like Hobbes championed  He creates a theoretical society that instead of being founded on providing for every man s wants is founded on denying the majority of men their needs  and yet functions perfectly  As in Animal Farm  he also orchestrates the book s allegorical content so intentionally that it is an enjoyable piece of entertainment  This book is powerful not only as a dire warning against autocracy  but also as a thoughtful philosophical text and an engaging novel   A stunning portrayal of a potential future  written by a weakening man with a great  open mind Perhaps my favourite book of all time  at least so far   Nineteen Eighty Four  presents us with a world where fascism and totalitarianism reign supreme  where humanity is but one working mass  a machine  supporting the ideologies put into place by the Party  with Big Brother at the helm  Winston Smith   the protagonist   is a man who doubts the world in which he lives  and has done for some time  But that is Thoughtcrime  And Thoughtcrime is death   the Thought Police have ways of finding things out  But this cannot stop Winston   drained and depressed as he helps to pull the wool over the eyes of society  he decides to find out just what life was like before the revolution  But I won t spoil it for you Perhaps the most striking aspect of this book is that it can indeed be seen as an exaggerated commentary on the ideals held by society today  Indeed  thankfully  we are not under a totalitarian regime  nor is open mindedness a crime  but we still move as one  we are expected to play our part  to conform  a slave to money and then we die  The connections that can be made between Orwell s fiction and our reality are somewhat disturbing This is a remarkable piece of literature  Very highly recommended  My friend once told me that she would never read The Fault in Our Stars again   I just don t want the things that happened in it to happen again   she explained  I thought I understood  I thought that when I read it  my soul would be shattered by the tragedy that is the intelligent Augustus s heart breakingly unfair and incredibly well known demise But when I read The Fault in Our Stars  nothing of that sort occurred  Augustus s death was heart breaking  And sad  And horrifically unfair  and poignant  etc  etc  but it wasn t THAT BAD  I thought I could very well sit through it again  And I did  immediately afterwards  I read the whole book again and thought that  yes  it was sad  But I could bear it a few more times But I don t think I ll ever be able to read 1984 again  I just don t want the things that happened in it to happen again  I don t want to be there as the picture falls away from the wall to reveal the telescreen again I don t want to watch helplessly as Mrs Parsons is dragged behind her shutting front door by her maniacal kids again I don t want to flinch as the starving prisoner writhes on the floor and desperately betrays everything he once was in an attempt to avoid Room 101 again I don t want to watch as the paperweight is mercilessly smashed on the floor again I don t want to realise that there is no Brotherhood  and O Brien was always a bad guy  and The Book was written by the Party again And I don t want to watch as Winston is shattered into a million pieces again  Winston  clever  quiet  curios  desperate for proof in a world full of lies  I don t to be present in the final scene when the shells of Winston and Julia have nothing left to love each other with again I don t want to read about the rats  THE HORRIBLE RATS   or the whitish speck of dust  or the lady with red arms who would sing all evening if she had an endless supply of clothes pegs I don t want to be there when Mr Charrington walks into the room and Winston knows  he just knows  again And I don t think I ll ever sing  Oranges and Lemons  again This book TERRIFIED me  It shook me to the core  It s not happy  There s no triumphant ending  no place inside Winston s head the Party couldn t reach  It s sad  and it s scary  and it s truthful and expresses myself better than I ever could  Winston is one of my favourite characters ever  and at times I thought that this book was a love story  but it s not  of course  It s a warning  and it s as relevant today as it was in 1948  If not more so And I think that  even though it will shatter me again  I will have to read it again sometime  It s too important not to be read again  and again  and again  I Wish that I read this sooner  The well known references to Big Brother and Room 101 emanated from here Oceania is a socialistic Dystopia engaged in ever changing wars with Eastasia and Eurasia  Wars  we later discover  keep the people repressed and easy to govern  They are kept isolated from the other countries and dependable statistics in terms of economy  wealth and history and therefore have no form of comparison  They simply have no way of knowing how worse off they are and have to believe the propaganda dolled out to them which could change from day to day  They know that logically that it s not right and have to employ  doublethink   Newspeak  is the language of the Oceania and evolved from the Oldspeak  It s constantly evolving and slowing all adverbs  adjectives  words expressing or describing emotions and beliefs are being stripped away and replaced by one precise word so for example  we have  good    plusgood  and  doubleplusgood  to describe something positive  It becomes and offence to use any other word once the approved one has been adopted The story has modern as well as futuristic themes  The protagonist is Winston Smith who works in reality control and writes one day in his diary   If there is hope     it lies in the proles   As I write this anti capitalist demonstrations are taking place in London protesting against the Big Capitalists It has good dramatic tension as well as comedy  I loved the description of Winston s frustration at trying to question the old man in the pub as to whether his life is better now or 50 years ago Would recommend to anyone interested in the themes mentioned above  1984 is probably one of the toughest  if not the toughest  book to review  It has become a cultural phenomenon and is referred to in everything from movies  news and talk shows to everyday conversation  Before even reading the book  I knew the basic plot of the story  knew the terms doublethink  Big Brother  Room 101 and Thought Police  For someone who tries to not even read reviews  unless that s how I discover a book  before reading a book  this makes reviewing 1984 nearly impossible  But I ll try to talk about the book on its own merits  not on what it has become in our culture Frankly  1984 is a terrifying picture of a possible future in which everyone s actions  even thoughts are under strict control  Enter Winston Smith  a man who remembers the first days of the Revolution and the Party s rise to power  But he can t talk about it because the Party now has complete power over everything  past  present and future  The past is malleable and can be changed in an instant  which is part of Winston s job in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth  After being oppressed for so long  Winston is the kind of person you would expect  He s terrified of being found out  yet rebels in small ways by writing in his diary and loving Julia Yes  Winston is a hero in some respects  but he s not your traditional hero or even your traditional anti hero  He s just a man struggling through life in an oppressive regime  knowing that there is no hope of change  He doesn t join the rebels in actively fighting against the Party and Big Brother  he doesn t become a high ranking official of the Inner Party to sabotage their efforts  he doesn t distribute pamphlets denouncing the government and he certainly doesn t do any other traditional hero in a dystopia things  Maybe I ve been reading too much YA lately  but 1984  depressing as it is  is quite a nice change  It s not a hopeful or uplifting story  it s a warning I wouldn t exactly call 1984 fast paced by modern standards  but it s not like I fell asleep reading it either  There s an atmosphere of doom that hangs over the whole novel and it sucks you in  forcing you to keep reading even though you know the ending  The best part of George Orwell s book  You can interpret it how you like  You can interpret it as a warning against big government  a tirade against socialism  or  conversely  praise of socialism   a cautionary tale about what happens when people stop questioning their leaders  etc  It s easy to see how the term  Orwellian  worked its way into the vocabulary of not only our politicians  but the general populace I give this book 5 5 stars  I mean  really  this is one of the few classics that should be studied in school  hychy nmyshh gft    1984

what is now part of one of the three world powers  the others being Eurasia and Eastasia  Oceania is a basically communist society in which there is one totalitarian government which consists of the Inner Party  rich   the party  middle class   and Proles  proletarians   The one thing that makes this government really work is the deprivation of emotions  the constant watching  and the fear of its people  I think one of the main themes of the book was that it was a warning of what could happen if we continued on the our path  It also showed many similarities to totalitarian dictatorships such as Nazi Germany  Like even though the Party does not directly prosecute the proles the are treated as inferiors like the Jewish people were as shown here   The Party taught taught that the Proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection   71  One of the things that I really liked about this book is that it made me think of the things that a government like the one in 1984 can do to a person like alter the past and that is a scary thing for a person or even an entire event can just disappear with the snap of a finger not one question about it not one way to prove it wrong  Another thing I also liked about the book is that even though it was a slow moving book it never became actually boring because it just made you think about what was happening  Although 1984 did not come true in 1984 it still has a great possibility of happening today   Lee la resena completa en Atrapado en la lecturaOrwell no contento con meternos en esta sociedad  tambien nos da un trasfondo con  el libro   en el cual nos explica masomenos el funcionamiento de la misma  Y si bien por momentos sentia que estaba en una clase de Sociologia  o leyendo un libro similar al Principe de Maquiavelo  perdonen  no se como llegue a esta referencia XD   dos cosas que no me gustan tanto  en este libro me fasino  PD  Profe de Sociologia que da clases en mi facultad   podria dar este libro como ejemplo   No  Okay u u   Y mas adelante vemos una explicacion mas del lado del Estado  y el choque entre ambos pensamientos es simplemente fabuloso Lee la resena completa en Atrapado en la lectura I do believe this novel should go into  horror  shelves  even  thriller  is too good for this book  During reading  1984   I couldn t stop shake my head  This novel should be one of the scariest book I ve ever read  I feel shiver  depressed  and curious at the same time  Not a long ago  I have read another Orwell s book  Animal Farm  and I got the first impression that Orwell s strength is his imagination about how the ideal political system should be run  Alike with Animal Farm   1984  is also a good guide for student of politics  so they can clearly know what it feels living under a totalitarian regime that very strict  and rules people s life in every detail  people basically have no rights to own everything  every material belongs to Party  and Party have scheduled people s daily activity  Orwell wrote it so well  made me almost feel hard to breathe at the same time as he told the story thoroughly  I was amazed of his detail in building how totalitarian world would be  This novel really affected me so much afterwards  and for me  1984  deserves 5 stars  Edna ot nai brutalnite i podtiskashchi knigi  koito s m chel  ry    bkl m n  lklm     rwy  khyly  tHky wq  ldykttwry  wlHy  fy Zl

As far as socialistic governments go  George Orwell has imagined the worst case scenario  It is the year 1984  The countries are divided into three super nations  Oceana being the nation that 1984 takes place in  The government is suppressing free thought via agents called the thought police  Every person is being watched through telescreens  their behavior scrutinized and examined  It is dangerous to even reveal emotions and facial expressions  English is being replaced by NewSpeak  a language which effectively eliminates creativity  Ignorance is being shoved down the throats of the people   hence the Party s paradox slogan  War is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strength   Children are even encouraged to turn their parents over to the Police for denouncing Ingsoc   the socialistic advance of the governent  The party is broken up into three groups  the inner party  the outer party  and the Proles  The inner party is composed of about 2  of the nation s population  wherein all the Party s deepest secrets are kept  The outer party is about 15  of the population  and despite its workers working inside the government with insidious tasks  such as the doctoring of historical notes to meet the Party s standards  they are still kept relatively ignorant of truth  The Proles  the lower class  who make up the rest of Oceana s population are completely unaware of the things that go on outside of what the party informs them  and are hardly monitored at all by the telescreens  Big Brother is the omnipotent head of all government in Oceana  Big Brother is watching you The protagonist  Winston Smith  is a resident of the province Airstrip One  He is a worker for Minitru   named in NewSpeak  and has the job of rewriting historical documents  Intrigued by learning the truth of the past Winston is a Rebel of the Party in his own mind  A thought Criminal  The punishment for thoughtcrime is death  and if he reveals one iota of his secret  the Thought Police will be on him like a starving animal on a 16 ounce sirloin Orwell compellingly relates the fear Winston suffers through day to day  conveys the uncertainty through which he must faces his friends  and builds suspense with the deep mysteries of Oceana s sadistic government  If you value your REM cycles  you should leave 1984 alone   it will have you staying up late on a regular basis to read just

never the full english original and I must say    I fell in love  it made the book even better  definitely one of my favourite novels ever  In my opinion  it has every right in the world to be considered a great classic  Wow        I had to start my review with that word  George Orwell has really did it in this novel  It is BRILLIANT with all the meanings of the word  He imagined a whole system of a country and a society  A perfect one which can be logically achieved  He invented everything in the novel literally  You will know when you read it  He actually invented everything even a language  The  Book of Goldstien  is the masterpiece of Orwell  I totally recommend it to everyone  You will not believe that this book was written in 1948  Amazing  amazing book and a must read especially in the age of the DPRK and the Patriot Act  I was told the language was archaic and that the theme was no longer relevant  I disagree  Orwell s message continues to ring true   1984  is one of my two favorite books of all time  George Orwell created the perfect paranoid masterpiece  and his work has proven to be all too accurate with its nightmarish future view of our world  So many words and phrases from  1984  have become part of our common  everyday vocabulary   big brother    thought police    memory hole    comrade   are just a few of the most memorable  This book was tremendously influential in my own writing  and you can find echoes of it throughout my novel  The Unreals   The fact that it is still required reading in many high school english classes is one of the few encouraging signs from our public school system   2   2   5If you say or even think otherwise  you re committing thoughtcrime  The Party knows it and you will be punished accordingly  You re also not allowed to love  laugh  feel pleasure  write journals or have friends  All that could jeopardize your loyalty for the Party or worse  your love for Big Brother  What s funny is that the action takes place in 1984 and it s presented as a futuristic hopeless society  because the author took the world order of that time  1949  and envisioned a future where socialism continued and evolved into a horrid form of control of the masses  This book makes us realize what the people of the fifties had in mind regarding their future  They were terrified of a Government that wouldn t settle for controlling their food ratio  their property or their workplace  that would go further than the material world and do everything in their power to control the minds of the population  It s a sad story  a fictional and at the same time a very realistic scenario  Today  sadly  it s also a very probable scenario  because there s bound to be a time in our lives when power consumes people to the brink of insanity   hl mn lmmkn qtl lrdh   mmkn jd    Love this book  Orwell at his bright eyed  insightful best  It has some serious weaknesses as a novel  He s a smart man who could write a good novel  Burmese Days is one of my favorites   But I don t think he was content for 1984 to be merely a novel  so I gladly overlook the fact this is a hybrid of essay and fiction  For an ardent socialist  Orwell has the unusual distinction of writing some of the best critical works on that political philosophy with Animal Farm  The Road to Wigan Pier  and 1984  Makes me wonder where he stood at the end of his life  with 1984 coming as his last major work  Animal Farm was clearly an allegory of Stalinism  Wigan Pier was an attempt to address criticisms head on  Neither of those explanations fully  remotely  really  explains why he wrote 1984    Orwell on language has always fascinated me too  Between reading Richard Rorty  a proponent of contingent vocabularies  a belief that our words frame and limit ideas and that different vocabularies would lead us to different ways of viewing the world and truth because there is no single  organizing truth  everything is contingent   and the recent handling of an eruption of political scandals along with the re branding American political discourse in general  e g  how discussion of abortion can now be short handed as  women s health    Orwell seems as prescient  timely  and relevant as ever  However  I worry that Orwell will one day be seen as a  how to  guide rather than warning  Wow  I had heard so much about this book and it definitely came up to my expectations  It was as scary and sad as I had hoped  It required concentration and was quite hard to read  especially compared to Animal Farm  and the Stephen King s which I have been reading   but I was reading an old Penguin Classic version with tiny font and I knew that the language would be formal and complex  I almost want to use double speak myself on occasion and I am sure I will understand more references to 1984 now I have read the book   h  lyst rwy  blm n  ldrmy bl h  qr  llwq  f  lmD  wlHDr wlmstqbl wrw y  wq y  lwq  mtkrr  l  mdr

The dystopia that Orwell described was far beyond my imagination  The fact that a government could torture someone physically  torment him emotionally and mentally and manipulate the human nature in the way described in the 3rd part of the book just to stay in power was terrifying  There were  as I expected  many projections into real life  either in history or in the current political affairs  For instance  the concept of erasing someone from the records was actually used  in a much less intense way  in the soviet union by Stalin  It is worth noting that throughout the book  it didn t feel like it was written 65 years ago nh rwy  tqr  thm tqr  mn jdyd  This is the first time since graduating that I ve felt that I ve put some of the theories and skills we had been taught into use  I absolutely loved this book  Just because it s a political fiction  doesn t mean that only those with an interest in politics should read it  But everyone should read it  I think it encourages a healthy attitude wherein you learn to think for yourself and learn to look into things rather than naively believing what everyone tells you is the right thing to do or the right activity to enjoy  Brief synopsis of story   1 2 paragraphs  Winston Smith lives in the empire of Oceania under the watchful totalitarian eye of Big Brother  Civil war and a movement called Ingsoc  English Socialism  have reshaped the Western world for the worse  Oceania is under control of the Party and the Party controls all    including reality  It is a world full of hidden microphones  secret police  and two way telescreens that apprehend all  A world in which privacy is scarce and  in some ways  dangerous Winston spends his days as civil servant in the MiniTrue RecDep revising history and deleting  unpersons  from the official record  There he meets Julia  a mechanic and member of the Anti sex League after she secretly hands him a note that says   I love you   They begin an illicit affair and meet O Brien  an Inner Party member who may actually be a member of rebel faction called the Brotherhood  However it turns out that O Brien and Big Brother have been on to them all along  Winston and Julia are captured and finally tortured and re conditioned for re integration by exposure to their deepest fears  Separated and alone  Julia and Winston betray each other and in the closing chapters we find Winston an alcoholic  alone and reconciled to  indeed  sincerely accepting  Big Brothers rule  Crushed beneath the wheels Kind of work defined by basic elements  character  plot  setting  language  theme   what elements are foregrounded  How do they fit together  1984 is the bleakest of bleak futurism  Big Brother s reach extends not only into the daily lives of the citizens of Oceania  but into the fabric of reality itself  Orwell explores and illustrates concepts like Newspeak and Doublethink  processes through which meaning is twisted and negated  Through language and conditional thinking  the party is able to create a shifting and mutable reality that suits whatever purpose is required at the time  For example  seditious person who has been eliminated by the Party is referred to as an  unperson   An unperson then is deleted from all records and  through the process of Doublethink  is believed by all Party members to have never existed at all  As such there existence is systematically negated and perceived realities become unprovable  It is  in this sense  a culture of madness and denial Kind of work defined by structure  how is it constructed  Orwell tells the story with a 3rd Person limited POV  namely exclusively Winston s  In so doing  we get to inhabit his skin and feel the confusion  dread  and oppression of living under the watchful eye of Big Brother  This helps emphasize one of the major themes of the novel  the fate of the individual subsumed by the society in which he lives  What room is there for the individual in the machinery of power Further  the limited perspective allows us to only know what Winston knows  while we suspect oh so much more   which helps Orwell create tension and dread as the novel hurtles toward its conclusion  We know fate will not be kind to Winston  but we cannot be sure from where the blow will come  or when  or from whom  Kind of work defined by theme  interests   A clear reaction to authoritarianism  Orwell s dominating message seems to be that man  as he progresses  may in that process become a soulless automaton without even being aware of it  A cog in the machinery of the culture he has created and in which he expends his energy endlessly without result like a hamster on a wheel  Secondary is the fragility of our own belief systems  how easily and how effectively they may be supplanted by a system of negation similar to the one employed by the Party  Orwell posits the value of the individual  a value the Western world holds dear  is null in the face of absolute power  As O Brien states      If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face       forever   The state holds sway over the individual  influencing thought and action through piped ideology and forced nationalism  Indeed  xenophobia is a powerful force for the Party  By channeling the tension of the masses toward their perpetually warring rivals  the Party effectively negates that energy being directed toward itself Finally  your overall analysis of this piece holistically  I find Nineteen Eight Four to be one of the most terrifying visions of a human future possible  A future of complete abjection and abnegation of the self  A place where the needs of the state are served by the reality the state creates and all power is directed toward the retention of power  This is a society of purposelessness in a sense  Like consumerism  the state here only requires the acquisition and consolidation  only instead of goods and resources  power   There is no higher striving  no attempt to pioneer or progress  but a stasis of power  For that is what those in power really crave  a constant stable state  Change is the enemy  It creates opportunity for those not in power and it challenges established authority All of this Orwell has adroitly thought out and detailed in the novel  The perpetual war creates a constant state of disorientation  By limiting thought and resources  the avenues for change are choked  By dissuading any outward signs of intellectualism or pleasure  the inward desire for those basic ideals is muted  By forcing citizens to swallow nonsensical  but purposed  language and concepts like Double Think  they condition a population to accept a permanently mutable reality dictated by the state for the state Now that you have read and considered this work in the context of your own ongoing research and writing  how does this work inform that work While I likely have a more optimistic view of human nature than Orwell  I still find the fundamental themes applicable  Here  Orwell reacts  as Erich Fromm suggests  to a  new form of managerial industrialism  in which man builds machines which act like men and develop ment who act like machines     Strange that we would strive to build things in our most ideal image and yet dehumanize ourselves  So the question for me becomes   what happens to the same idea in the context of our blossoming biological and technological future  As culture evolves  how are these tropes transformed and how are they similar  1984 Follows Winston Smith a citizen of Oceania  a totalitarian society  The high ranking members of this regime maintain control with constant monitoring through the  telescreen   citizens observing each other  and a law enforcement outfit called the Thought Police  This dystopian novel provides vivid imagery of a depressed  urban community  and its inhabitants as they succumb to the oppressive guidelines imposed to combat any ideas that did not originate with their authoritarian government  Winston faces physical and mental challenges as he battles to maintain the few bits left of his independent thought Winston works in The Ministry of Truth  an institution designed to revise history and print language as needed  to align with the ideals of the party  Big Brother serves as an all seeing erie figure in almost every scene  This personification of the Oceanic government promotes an allegiance to a  friend  rather that the party  Julia  a beautiful young girl joins Winston s journey of outright rebellion and civil disobedience  introducing him to the possibilities of escaping his tyrannical environment  George Orwell served as a civil servant during his life and noted perilous injustices with the rise of Stalin and Hitler  He first brought attention to authoritarian regimes in  Animal Farm   1945  where he satirically told of the transition from Lenin to Stalin  favoring a fabled style delivery  It also had an inconspicuous moral lesson and could function as sheer entertainment without any acknowledgment of the undertones attacking authoritarian governments   Although Nineteen Eighty  Four served as a fictional account of a dystopian society  Orwell s warning was more direct to individuals that allow the stripping away of freedoms for the sake of governmental control This is an excellent book  I give it five stars for the vivid imagery  as it allowed me to explore every one of my senses without ever leaving a room  Orwell has an abundance elements employed throughout this piece that can be analogous with any civilization witnessing the crumbling of a democratic society  This dark lyrical work of art will provide discussion for decades  It is best read exploring Orwell s background and the history prevailing during the time written  And here it is  Orwell s dystopian masterpiece  Like Anthony Burgess  A Clockwork Orange  1984 succeeds in depicting its failed society with a certain amount of special cutting commentary  1984  despite what it appears to be  isn t about the totality of governments  but of people  the totality of love  And where as A Clockwork Orange wears that message on its sleeve  Orwell cleverly hides his message from the reader until long after the work is finished   1984 is a staple of post apocalyptic  dystopian science fiction  Frightening when it was first published  it has only grown more and more chilling to modern readers due to startling parallels between the totalitarian regime of Oceania and modern Western society  Ask yourself this question  Is screaming like a lunatic at a rival sports team that much different than the two minutes hate  Isn t America s history of almost constant war and conflict reminiscent of the constant state of war between East Asia and Eurasia  Hidden within the story of government oppression and a world which is slowly becoming more and more in control of the party and the people is a moving love story between two Inner Party members  But in a world like this  is there really such a thing as love in the way we know it now  Is there any defeating a regime of control and oppression when the people being kept down by the system are simultaneously in love with it  These are the terrifying questions George Orwell asks us  You may find yourself afraid of the answers   La verdad es que me satisfizo mucho esta distopia  nacio de la mano de un  segun muchos escritores que se dedicaron a estudiar su vida  socialista que conocio y repudio los regimenes de tipo totalitaristas impregnados de fascismo  por lo que esta obra resulto siendo una satira de esos dos movimientos socio politicos  1984 by George Orwell es una obra fascinante que disfrute desde su inicio hasta su final  en donde  como pocas veces me pasa  me gustaron mas sus antagonistas que su propio protagonista  ya que me resultaron mucho mas complejos e interesantes  El mundo que Orwell pinto es grandioso  y no en el buen sentido de la palabra   es un mundo lleno de odio  de miseria  de ignorancia y de mucha manipulacion  Manipulacion de la verdad  del pasado  del presente  del futuro  de la familia  de los placeres  del vocabulario  del pensar y del actuar en general  En el ambito politico esta compuesto por el Partido  cuya figura principal es el Gran Hermano  quien no es una persona en especifico  sino la conglomeracion de la innumerable cantidad de individuos que integran al Partido   en ese gobierno hay tres esloganes que resumen de manera bien breve los inconcebibles fines principales del Estado  LA GUERRA ES LA PAZ  LA LIBERTAD ES LA ESCLAVITUD  LA IGNORANCIA ES LA FUERZA Asi mismo  existen tres ministerios   el ministerio de la verdad   cuya tarea es manipular los hechos del pasado escritos en libros y periodicos para que el mismo coincida con lo que el Partido dice en el presente  es decir  se manipula asi el pasado para que lo que el Gran Hermano dicte sea la total y absoluta verdad   El ministerio del amor   en el cual se torturaba  o como el Partido decia   se reeducaba   a todo individuo que tuviese pensamientos o cometiera actos en contra de la ideologia del Gran Hermano  ensenando pues  a amar al mismo quebrando a las personas a traves de inimaginables y enfermizos martirios   El ministerio de la abundancia  que velaba porque predominara siempre un clima de mero racionamiento excesivo  en el que nadie disfrutara de ventajas  y en el que el pueblo en general pasara hambre  en donde se sufriera para conseguir productos basicos y no contara con buenos servicios  pues el Partido no creia provechosa la distribucion de la riqueza   Y por ultimo   el ministerio de la paz   que se encargaba de todo lo relacionado a la guerra continua que se pretendia llevar a cabo  la cual era considerada ventajosa para poder permanecer indefinidamente en el poder  puesto que la misma era ficticia pero servia de medio de salida aliviadero del odio y el miedo contenido en el alma del pueblo  Ahora pues  esto es una minima parte de todo lo contenido en el libro  y despues de haberlo terminado considero que todos deberian darle al menos una hojeada  principalmente las personas de mi pais   es obvio que no nos encontramos en una situacion tan extrema  el libro es fantasia distopica  es decir  no es mas que ficcion   es util para ver en que monstruo tan horrible se puede convertir  en sus ultimas fases  un gobierno dictatorial y totalitarista   El poder no es un medio  sino el fin en si mismo  No se establece una dictadura para salvaguardar una revolucion  se hace revolucion para establecer una dictadura   This was a reread for me    and obviously a much needed one  I only gave this book four stars in my original rating  and now I can t imagine why If you haven t read 1984 since you were in school  please don t make the same mistake I ve been making for years now  Make time for it again as an adult  You ll appreciate the elegance of the prose far more  and probably be even more disturbed by its implications than you were the first time I know I was  A morte do lider querido  Kim Jong il  reavivou me na memoria a historia de Winston Smith  protagonista de 1984  romance distopico de George Orwell  Qualquer semelhanca entre a Oceania  em 1984  e a Coreia do Norte  pode nao ser pura coincidencia  Coincidencia e o romance ter sido escrito  ou acabado  no ano em que o grande lider eterno  Kim Il sung  chegou ao poder  1948 Num momento em que a Europa caminha a passos lestos para um paradigma que  a semelhanca da China  junta o pior de dois mundos  o pior do capitalismo e o pior

poignant and terrifying as it must have been over 60 years ago  My review is for the unabridged audio CD  skillfully read by Simon Prebble  Orwell describes a dystopian society in the country of Oceania  in which war is permanent  government surveillance is widespread  individualism and all forms of self expression are suppressed  and  big brother  is watching  Though this novel has been on every  Top 100  reading list as well as high school and college curriculums for decades  somehow I had put off reading it until now  I was quite surprised at how relevant it still is  ensuring that it will remain on required reading lists for many decades to come The main character  Winston Smith  works at the Ministry of Truth  as part of a team that is constantly rewriting history to suit the purposes of the current party line  No one is sure who  big brother  really is  or even if such a person exists  Citizens are constantly programmed with  double think  phrases such as  Ignorance is strength    war is peace   and  freedom is slavery   They fear the thought police who will punish them severely for not adhering to party teachings  even in their thoughts  Society is plagued by constant shortages  scarcity and hardships  primarily due to constant wars  The Machine believes in constant warfare to get rid of materials that might make the masses comfortable and complacent  The Party s main purpose is to mold the consciousness of the masses  and was described at one point as a  boot stamping on a human face  The themes of nationalism  censorship and surveillance are just as relevant today as they were over 60 years ago  ensuring that this novel will remain in the forefront of literature for a long time to come  It s not an easy book to read  since the deprivation  brainwashing and torture are hard to endure  However  I suspect that I will read it again and again because of the many levels of meaning and message  I thought that this book was amazing and horrific at the same time  It was so well written  and yet so simple at the same time  This book has to be the best horror book I have ever read  I have read some horror stories  and even watched some scary movies  but this book takes the cake  A world where you can t even have your own private thoughts to yourself  where instead of you watching TV  the TV is closely watching you  You can be arrested at any moment for any crime  you could even be arrested in your sleep for sleep talking  What any amazing concept that people would have so little freedom  but at the same time would be so content with it  It was definitely a good book to read  It was very frightening in the sense that it was unfortunately so realistic  It was realistic in the sense that I feel that after reading this book  that we as the human race come closer and closer to dehumanizing ourselves  and to become more robotic and no individuality  To have no emotions  and to be punished for them is very frightening  After I read this book  my chest would not stop hurting  You know a book is really amazing when it leaves you breathless  It really gripped me a the throat  and I honestly did not think that was possible  It was only a book I kept telling myself  but it felt like the idea of society becoming a working machine rather than a place with individuals and their emotions are coming closer and closer together  I hope I will never see the day where people are dehumanized into nothing more than empty hearted machinery  with the only reason for being is to accept their slavery and to have no type of thought going through their own minds  I shudder at the thought   I read this book in high school  It was during my  awakening period   I really just didn t really care about school  reading  or the world around me before this time  I was a late bloomer  I was just too busy being a kid wanting to play all the time  I heard some others talking about it  so I gave it a try  I liked the romance part of it a lot  But  this book is so much more  I think it is a must read for young adults who are just learning about the world around them  I also read  Animal Farm  by him too  Both great books    He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past   I really enjoyed this reading  It took me a while to finish it and that s probably because I had the need to stop to think about some interesting passages every few pages  More than a novel it felt like and essay and there was this urgency to consider about a lot Orwell had to say  I won t attempt to make a review here  just give a few thoughts about 1984  I was captivated by the term  doublethink   the idea of a hierarchical society that was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance and finally the realization that you won t win against the Big Brother  And for me  this was exquisite  Being in a minority  even in a minority of one  did not make you mad  There was truth and there was untruth  and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world  you were not mad   What does it mean to be mad or rational  Sanity is not statistical  Extremamente atual  Denso  questionador  dramatico e  em certa medida  positivamente repulsivo    It creeped me out in ever single page  Shudder wprthy but breathtaking  this book made me work my way into the mindset of people that now  in the year 2015 live just like that  with very breath they take under close surveilance  no personal life  no choices even in the most simple of matters  Their children are taught to have no thoughts of their own  to embrace what those few in power want them to think without any question  The people who dare develop their own thoughts are the nuisances of this world  not its guiding light and are tortured till they renounce everything that is not in accordance with the system s believes and then ostracized and awaiting their own death  that now seems like a way out of hell and not a way in  It made me appreciate every single ounce of freedom I have and undestand just how precious it really is  It s something you have to fight to keep and not take it as a given because in reality it s not and there are many people out there who would snatch it away in the blink of an eye  I highly recommend it to everyone  over 15 years old that is     What can i say about this magnificent book  Orwell s  1984  is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real  A realistic approach to a totalitarian and bureaucratic nightmarish society world where love is forbidden language is being distorted according to the rules of the Party this dystopian novel left me craving for more page after page  A 5  star rating from me    WAR is peace  FREEDOM is slavery  IGNORANCE is strength    Definitely one of the most terrifying things I have read  Little by little  the Party devoured on the small flickering hope in the minds of the people who believed in Brotherhood  The Party does not want to kill you for going against the Big Brother but they want to reason with you  make you believe in what they think is right or at least what they want you to believe is right  1984 is a prediction  a terrorizing prediction where ignorance of the people reigns the world in disguise  There is only one thing they cannot discern  that is your thoughts but soon they will control that too  There is no right or wrong  there is only the thing which lets you live  There is no escape even in your sleep  there is no one who can save you except death  1984 is the whole new definition of utter hopelessness  despondency  misery  But only to the population ready to revolt or who think away from the bogus facts  to others it is the way of life since the dawn of human kind  Privacy will be invaded  every action is being watched even while sleeping  Your own children will denounce you to the Though Police I read the first few pages several times before I actually picked it up for an uninterrupted reading  I could not bear the idea of Dystopia  I do not know what is left of the humanity if it could not express its feelings  thanks to Newspeak  It was really a pitiful world when we come across Mr Parson who thanks the Party for not letting him go beyond what he is capable of  in terms of going against the Big Brother  After reading this I got a better outline of the conditions we live in and how alert we should be in order to safeguard our freedom of speech  freedom of expression  freedom of thought Most depressing of all is   He loved Big Brother   This book was like reading a trilogy  So much cliff hangers    so much depth  fear  love  hate  anger while reading it  It angered me  espicially when comparing it to what is my reality  This book is brilliant by the reality feeling to this science fiction  that is barely fiction  It is articulate  clear  The ending stroke me like lightning     I love it  It is exactly what I like    a book that angers me  I never read this as a teenager in high school or in college  so I had to find out what the fuss was about  I was totally and completely floored by this book  it was one of the best things I ve ever read  It s a rare thing for me to keep notes on a book  but I did with this  my wife thought I was nuts  like I was studying for a lit exam or something  This book should be required reading for EVERYONE    OR ELSE      Probably the best inadvertent Halloween book I could have picked up this month  I m sure I was suppose to read this at some point in my schooling but I never did but I don t think I would have enjoyed it as much then as I did now  It would have been wasted on dumb 16 year old Ben  I know this book is almost a cliche at this point  it is used as a metaphor for a lot of things but if you haven t read this yet I strongly recommend it  I know I said the last book I read was the best one I ve finished this year but this one might be number 1 and that one 1A   If you can feel that staying human is worth while  even when it can t have any result whatever  you ve beaten them  What thought provoking and insightful novel  A truly compelling analysis of the psychology of power and human nature  This was one of the most intense reading sessions I ve ever had  I would often forget I am in the safety in my own bed and experience alarming levels of anxiety I sympathized with Winston from the first pages  even though he wasn t exactly a likable character  His experiences and emotions seemed so genuine that he felt like a real person to me  A real person stuck in one of my ultimate nightmare scenarios  Big Brother  IngSoc  Newspeak  the Ministry of Love  the Ministry of Truth  Room 101  the telescreens  all represent horrid concepts I hope people will forcefully fight against whenever they re confronted with them  In addition to the captivating plot  I savored the writing style as well  My favorite paragraph from the book was that in which Winston was recalling fragments about his childhood  especially about his mother  I remember thinking that it was one of the most beautiful pieces of writing I ve read in a long time  Another part of this book I thoroughly enjoyed was Goldstein s essay  I think it s a sagacious take on society The world envisioned in 1984 did not quite materialize  though some people might argue that it actually did  but in a more subtle manner  With all the regulations and surveillance people face today it could all go terribly wrong  if the power ended up in the wrong hands  Beyond it being an engaging  beautifully written book  this represents quite a milestone in my life  It forced me to think about what kind of a person I would want to be when faced with dire circumstances  it made me reevaluate some of my ideals and principles   Buenas las tengan  las tardes  noches o dias  no sean mal pensados  estimados lectores calcetineros  en esta ocasion les traemos  lo que viene siendo  una resena de una novela  nada mas y nada menos que 1984 de George Orwell  asi que a darle que es mole de olla  Esta novela es un tanto dificil de describir  es rica en muchos temas y encasillarla en un solo genero es complicado  yo diria que es de reflexion  politica  ciencia ficcion y un poco de linguistica  entre otros En  1984   Orwell nos muestra su vison de un futuro distopico en donde el gobierno manipula la informacion  historica  por ejemplo   existe la vigilancia masiva por parte del gobierno y sobre todo una gran y violenta represion politica y social  no muy lejano a nuestro mundo actual  si me lo preguntan a mi   1984 esta considerada como una de las obras de la llamada  trilogia de las distopias de principios del siglo XX   junto con Un Mundo Feliz  1932  de Aldous Huxley y Fahrenheit 451  1953  de Ray Bradbury  la cual como dato curioso fue publicada inicialmente de manera serial en la revista Playboy  ya saben por temas de censura de la epoca  extrano    no    Regresando al tema  la novela 1984 se localiza en una futura Londres  parte de una region llamada Franja Aerea 1  que      alguna vez fue llamada Inglaterra o Britania  integrada  a su vez  en un inmenso estado colectivista  Oceania  La sociedad de Oceania esta dividida en tres grupos  Los miembros  externos  del Partido Unico  los miembros del Consejo dirigente  o circulo interior del partido  y una masa de gente a la que el Partido mantiene pobre y entretenida para que no puedan ni quieran rebelarse  los proles   alguna semejanza con algo que conozcan    Los miembros  externos  constituyen la burocracia del aparato estatal  de ahi la necesidad de la estricta vigilancia   viven sometidos a un control asfixiante y a una propaganda alienante que los desmoraliza y les impide pensar criticamente  El estado suprime todo derecho y los condena a una existencia poco mas que miserable  con riesgo de perder la vida o sufrir vejamenes espantosos  si no que demostrasen suficiente fidelidad y adhesion a la causa nacional  Para ello se organizan numerosas manifestaciones donde se requiere la participacion activa de los miembros  gritando las consignas favorables al partido  vociferando contra los supuestos traidores  dando rienda suelta al mas desaforado fanatismo  Solo con fervor fanatico se puede escapar a la omnipresente vigilancia de la policia del pensamiento En varios puntos de la novela  Orwell nos comparte su vision y critica politica de la sociedad  nos muestra con crudeza muchos escenarios  particularmente recuerdo uno en el que describe la  guerra de las clases sociales   La clase alta y la clase media estan en perpetua guerra  tomando y quitandose el poder y el dinero una y otra vez con el sobrenombre de  revoluciones  y asi ha sucedido durante toda la historia  la clase media le arrebata el poder y el dinero a la alta y se convierte en la nueva clase alta y quien usan como sus peones  pues a la clase baja  la cual tiene un verdadero y enorme poder  por sus numeros para empezar   solo que no lo saben ni nuca podran usarlo  esto porque siempre estaran distraidos de una u otra forma  por ejemplo intentando sobrevivir  o bien viendo la television o jugando a la loteria esperando por fin poder dejar de ser proles  e incluso si lo dejaran de ser  solo pasarian a ser la nueva clase alta o media y todo se reconfiguraria de la misma forma  es decir  se descarta que alguna vez la sociedad humana pueda vivir en una comunidad o colectividad igualitaria En esta vision distopica del futuro  Orwell nos presenta a un famoso personaje  o concepto   El Gran Hermano  suple a todo personaje politico  el es el comandante en jefe  el guardian de la sociedad  el dios pagano y el juez supremo  El es la encarnacion de los ideales del Partido  el Partido ubicuo  unico y todopoderoso que vigila sin descanso todas las actividades cotidianas de la poblacion  al punto que inclusive  en las calles y casas hay dispositivos de vigilancia para conocer todos los actos de cada individuo   telepantallas    Ironicamente  Orwell insinua la posibilidad de que el Gran Hermano ni siquiera sea una persona real  sino un mero icono propagandistico  El lema del partido es el siguiente  Guerra es Paz  Libertad es Esclavitud  Ignorancia es Fuerza  Otro concepto interesante es la neolengua  adaptacion del ingles en la que se reduce y se transforma el lexico con fines represivos  basandose en el principio de que lo que no forma parte de la lengua  no puede ser pensado En fin  calcetineros  no seguire quemandoles la historia  asi que si les llamo la atencion lo que han leido hasta ahora  pues echenle un ojo al librito  no se van a arrepentir  Me despido con un lema muy famoso de libro   Aquel que controla el pasado  controla el futuro  aquel que controla el presente  controla el pasado   Nota  si  esta novela da origen al nombre de aquel  reality show  muy famoso de los 2000 s Por Rafael Cabral  1984 is a book of how a lone human cannot remain humanistic in a world of cold  unconscious life  It speaks to the goodness and cleverness of the human spirit  but also its ability to be insanely cruel  I found it refreshing that the book acknowledged that  one all of the odds are stacked against you  a few smart moves can fix everything  Once greed and domination takes its toll for several years  it might take just as long to make a step in the opposite direction  as evident from Winston and Julia s recognition of their roles as martyrs  Ultimately  Winston and Julia s relationship is shattered  as they couldn t hold their sacred ideas together in their minds during the worst torture of their lives  1984 is a cautionary novel of how man can turn into heartless  unfeeling  unaware beings right from under our noses   George Orwell was a major critic of large government  1984 sets a picture of distopian future that portrays this criticism  In the book  the government of the supercontinent Oceania controls every aspect of life  while neglecting the proletarian slums at the same time  The  proles  come to represent something to the protagonist and the reader  that the only way to be happy in a world where one can only be quiet about what they see happen every day  is to not inform oneself of such things  Ignorance  in other words  is the only way to maintain the mind Throughout the story  the protagonist  named Smith  meets a few people who want to resist the ever more tyrannical government  But  as the story progresses  the reader begins to realize the Smith is the only person who genuinely held these anti government sentiments  because everyone else was far too brainwashed  In the very end  even Smith admits that he loves the Party I believe this book is really directed to the group of people who say to themselves  Oh  well the government is passing all these laws to protect me   These are the same people who don t think false flag operations such as the Reichstag fire and atrocities such as the Nazi Holocaust  the Crusades  and various other genocides are possible in this day and age  or at least not in such civilized countries as the United States or the United Kingdom This book to me represents the absolute worst a country could get  Orwell writes in beautifully horrific and vivid language a persuasive story for those sheeple who genuinely trust their government  The beauty of the story  to me  is not the message  Your government is lying to you   it is  Open your eyes  shut your mouth  and see what is going on around you   I m glad I read this book because I feel it is relevant to the direction in which many developed countries are headed  and hopefully it will open more eyes than mine  I love this book  even how depressing and terrifying it was  still it was a good read   I m still surprised by Orwell s genius in writing such a book  But  worse I m terrified of how plenty of countries have developed systems close to what Orwell s has imagined over than sixty years ago  Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past     George Orwell  1984This sentence made me stop for a minute or two just to think about it  It does illustrate the Party s technique of using false history to control the past and then the future Controlling people s minds by defining what is true and what is not  gives the party an ultimate power on everyone and everything  When every evidence on every fact going against the Party s ideology is either changed or destroyed  people lose all chances to become conscious  Until they became conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious     George Orwell  1984Analyzing this masterpiece can be long  but what is important to say is   this book is great  I highly recommend everyone to read this book    totally captivating  a must read for anyone who is interested in politics  social inequality  or revolution  with a bleak and haunting ending Savas

saudomar com How have I never written a review for this book until now  I have read this every few years since the beginning of my paranoid education at the age of 11 or 12  when my Dad handed me Animal Farm  shortly followed by 1984 Except I m not so sure I should call it a paranoid education anymore  How much of 1984 has become descriptive of our current society  Dear NSA  this is for you   There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment  How often  or on what system  the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork  It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time     You had to live   did live  from habit that became instinct   in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard       cough No  I mean  everything is all right  I love Big Brother We ll be discussing this on SFF Audio  or in Orwell s words   in the solemn foolery of a  discussion group    When that posts  I ll link to it  one of the best and most painful books I ve ever read   pada 1984 hadir seorang pemberontak  winston smith  si tokoh utama  atau lebih tepatnya sekadar pembangkang  ia menyadari banyak kebohongan yang dibuat oleh penguasanya  dalm hal ini partai  tapi merasa tidak berdaya untuk membuktikan  sehingga yang bisa dilakukannya cuma membenci  membenci dan perasaan tidak nyaman terhadap kondisi pemerintahan  meskipun dengan sembunyi sembunyi  memang sudah bisa dianggap sebagai usaha perlawanan di saat nada bicara  ekspresi muka  atau igauan saat tidur yang dianggap mencurigakan dapat dijadikan dasar untuk partai melenyapkan seseorang  ada polisi pikiran yang mengawasi lewat teleskrin  teleskrin adalah semacam penyadap yang terpasang di tiap sudut ruangan  bahkan di tempat yang paling privat  toilet winston terus berusaha memendam ketidak nyamanannya  sedikit bisa tersalurkan lewat kegiatan menulis yang juga dilakukan sambil sembunyi  beruntung di kamarnya ia menemukan blind spot teleskrin   sampai kemudian bertemu julia  seorang gadis yang usianya jauh lebih muda darinya  tapi memiliki kecenderungan yang sama  kesadaran bahwa lingkungannya dibangun di atas kebohongan kebohongan  lewat usaha usaha tertentu sedemikian hingga mereka bisa merencanakan pertemuan privat  bahkan sampai mengadakan  ritual  pembebasan hasrat  untuk selanjutnya banyak  ritual  diadakan  mereka menganggapnya sebagai bentuk perlawanan juga  sebab hubungan emosional antara cewek   cowok sangat dibatasi  jelasnya tidak boleh ada cinta di atas kecintaan pada partai  bahkan pasangan menikah haruslah bertujuan untuk mempunyai keturunan demi bakti pada partai novel ini terbagi menjadi tiga bab  pertama  penggambaran tirani partai penguasa secara umum  kedua  kisah kasih winston   julia  terakhir  yang paling menyeramkan  adegan adegan penyiksaan winston  ada penyiksaan fisik yang keji dan brutal  seperti yang biasa anda temukan di cerita lain atau film  tapi lebih dari itu semua  disertai penyiksaan pikiran dan psikis  bagaimana winston dibuat sedemikian rupa sampai mengakui dan meyakini bahwa dua tambah dua adalah lima  pengakuan tersebut bukan karena winston kesakitan disiksa lalu menyerah  terpaksa  pikirannya  diledakkan  entah dengan alat apa dan setelahnya ia tetap memiliki kesadaran  hanya saja seolah ada serpih yg diambil keluar dari otaknya  hingga ia mati justru dalam kondisi mencintai sumber siksaannya walaupun ber setting pemerintahan totaliter  artinya sangat berbeda dengan kondisi sekarang  yang katanya sudah demokratis bebas   tapi ada beberapa hal mengerikan dalam novel ini yang saya rasa masih terjadi tentu saja dengan cara sistem yang lebih canggih  sayangnya saya tidak bisa menjelaskan  barangkali ada baiknya anda membaca novel ini  This marks the third time I ve read this book  previously in 1989 at the age of 14  and again in 2007  One of the most important novels ever written  but also one of the most depressing  though the tone and manner in which the Appendix is written does offer the reader a wee bitty glimmer of hope   More frighteningly relevant than ever  on the one hand  sure  thankfully  31 years after  1984  was supposed to have taken place  and 67 years after it was actually written   democracy and capitalism still exist  and the Iron Curtain has collapsed  on the other hand  seeing how even in the free market democracies  Big Government has gotten more and more intrusive into private citizens  lives  see the NSA surveillance scandal in the US  the presence of CCTV cameras on practically every street corner in London  the ability of spy satellites in geosynchronous orbit thousands of miles above the Earth to take close up shots of people and property alike   not to mention any idiot with a camera phone to record your activities and emulate the Junior Spies of Orwell s book  and it becomes readily apparent that the technological potential for a Big Brother type omnipresent superstate is stronger than ever  The year 1984 may have come and gone  but lovers of civil liberty need to be more vigilant than ever in this day and age  and reading Orwell s book helps to drive that point home  1984 had me hooked from the very beginning  I am extremely impressed at how the language is so easy to follow and the message of the story relates to people of every generation        ql hdh ldh  sTr tlk lrwy  rbm  tqn  wrwyl

fqT   more 5 0 heartsA book that was certainly before its time  This is what got me so hyped about the whole dystopian genre  although this book is not your typical dystopian because of the sheer gloom factor The horror and scare factor of this book is not something I was prepared for  I think it hits you the way it does because of how real a lot of this could be  Envision a world where your fearless leaders surmise a totalitarian structure in an ultimately severe way  This is the world that Winston Smith finds himself in  Big Brother is watching You Every action is controlled by the state  Working  eating  drinking  sleeping  talking  thinking  procreating  You name it  it s controlled  The slightest indication of insubordination can be detected by numerous state mechanisms  which include the  Thought Police   telescreen  and even your own children  who will not falter in betraying you to the authorities   Your worst enemy  he reflected  was your own nervous system   Language itself is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself  since individualism is a crime  2   2   5  if the government says it is  Any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime  This is really a deep look at Big Brother  which I m pretty sure Orwell came up with and we still use it today   Again  this book was so far ahead of its time  Take this quote for example   Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing  Like a lot of people  I read this too early in my life  I had to re read it  Many schools have this as required reading  I think its important  but I still think its too early  I wish we could assign reading to adults  You don t appreciate it the right way when you are young because you can t really comprehend all the nuances of life yet War is peace Freedom is slavery Ignorance is strength We watch this novel unfold  Winston must bow  not only because of Big Brother s astounding power and existence  but also because of Winston s inability to arrange any opposing thoughts  Even though he wants to think without restriction  he lacks the discipline and thus the analytical mind to counter O Brien s offenses  Ultimately  his mind follows the path of least resistance  We are the dead  Our only true life is in the future  This book is one of my all time favorites  You have to check this out  mn lTrz lrfy  tuqr  mrW   wyu d qrth mrW   khr   bqrWy  hdh l wrwyl mdh bntZrn     mstqbl  l bl Hdh ydws  l  wjh lnsny   wmn thum

absolute power curropts absolutely   a fiction that is dedicated to the welfare of humanity  The horror and dread of the totalitarian controlling government and the god like figure of the   leader   are conditions i have lived under and so i felt a great deal of familiarity as i was reading through the pages  being brought up in Iraq     although the awe of the   Oceanian   conditions are exaggerated for the justified purpose of satire and heightening the horror  i believe that the human reactions and behaviours in such conditions are so true to life and i believe that this is the main reason for the success of the novel because we readers could identify ourselves with the humanity in the novel   we could feel Winston Smith s frail body breathing and suffering through the pages and get filled with loathing against and fear from totallitarianism   the intended message or warning reaches home and Hail freedom  Reading this novel was a haunting experience for me  Especially because I live in a country ruled by people who seem going in the same direction as the ruling party in Oceania  I hope I m mistaken  I really hope so  I think this book deserves more praise then it gets  I was shocked to find it so far down on the top books on Good Reads  If you want to understand the greatness of this book  you need to think about context  Orwell wrote this novel thinking about the future  Even though the 1984 we lived through was not as drastic as the one Orwell imagined  there are elements and themes that are relevant in modern day society  To think of one man creating this dystopian society of the future and to look at the world around us and see brief similarities is equally as impressive as it is scary  On the plot itself  I enjoyed the characters and their narratives quite a lot  The realistic and honest portrayal of love between Julia and Winston reminded a reader like myself about the harsh reality they exist in and the risks they are taking by getting involved with each other  The first person narrative giving us small insights into the time before a long with the extent of Winston s emotions made this book a good and memorable read  and this book will definitely go down as one o my favourites   Incrivel como o livro permanece atual depois de tanto tempo  E o efeito da historia e de despedacar o espirito de qualquer um  5 5 means i think everyone should read this bookWhere do I begin  More importantly  what do i say that hasn t already been said before  and better I guess i should just begin at the beginning and keep going until I come to the end  then stop  The first thing  in that case  would be what I thought of it as a book  I loved it  This book was an emotional roller coaster  the political activist in me fell in love  the fan girl in my wanted to cry  the reader in me was a bit confused  and the citizen of a country that looks an awful lot like the state he describes was saddened One thing I did not like about the book was the sequence of events  that s right  i don t like what happened  Not because it did or didn t go the way i expected but because it don t make sense  They don t explain anything  things happen and you don t know why  And sometimes you don t know how either  And most of the time it s hard to even think of a logical reason why or how  Granted I think that was the point  the main character is also just as confused so I think it s to give us the feeling of terror but ugh  I want to know the why s I was  however  satisfied with the ending  I understood why it needed to end the way it did  i understood that there was no other ending  The last sentence of the book had to have been the last sentence  No other outcome would have concluded the story If you would like to check out my full Chat  which i

by George Orwell review written immediately after finishing reading FIRST THOUGHTS  Wow    just wow  I can t even begin to describe how good this book was  in comparison to what I read prior to getting my hands on this A while back  I met up with my friend Iris  whilst walking through a park with my parents  She said that she had just read  1984   to which my father smiled and asked when she d blackmail me into reading it as well  A couple of years later  i e   last month   Iris lent me the book and I ve been carefully reading it ever since  As I ve previously done  I started by writing the story of me receiving this book  Just want to mention that I took a two week break from reading it at some point  Firstly  here s a picture that perfectly expresses what I ve been thinking since I ve started reading this book I mean come on  I m surely not the only one to notice the striking resemblance this dystopian London bears to contemporary North Korea  I know this for a fact  because this guy wrote a whole article on the matter   Everytime Big Brother was mentioned in the book  Kim Jong un invaded my thoughts Secondly  most 1984 reviews I read here on Goodreads bring praise to Orwell s writing style  but what about  The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism   That was one of my favorite parts of the book  especially when it is stated that the Ministries were named after the opposite of the actions each one of them does   even if it took me a while to get through it  I was a tad disappointed when finding out who the book s author  i e    Emmanuel Goldstein   actually was  though Thirdly  another good topic that arises when discussing the dystopian novel is the actual existence of Big Brother  From the very beginning  Orwell creates a debate within the reader s mind about the corporality of the  man of about forty five  with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features   In the third part  there s a flash of hope for receiving a solution to this dilemma  but it goes away as quickly as it comes  I tried so hard not to spoil the third part for new readers      Therefore  I ask you  readers of this review  hopefully someone WILL read this   What do YOU think  Does Big Brother exist  or is he the Party s made up poster boy  Here s a nice map of Orwell s dystopian universe  I never would have imagined someone was kind enough to make this Some other things that I would like to mention are 1  there are a couple of plot twists that are quite expected  because of Orwell s foreshadowing   but they are perfectly timed 2  the book s appendix  available in my edition  but unavailable through the link provided below  is both interestingly useless and uselessly interesting 3  after reading the Adaptations and derived works section on the book s Wikipedia page  I really feel the need to see Equilibrium and read 1Q84  by Haruki Murakami  4  there s this quote which has been stuck in my mind for a while now   Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood   5  kudos to Iris for being right about how the third part of the book is the best part  maybe because it s also the most explicit one   it s like the third part is the complete opposite of the first  with the second one being a passageway between them   awesome 6  I can see how this story can appear to be a love story because of Part 2 and also the last bit of Part 3  when they meet again  but it s not literally a love story   therefore  the production of the 2015 Kristen Stewart movie  Equals   which apparently is somehow based on  Nineteen Eighty Four   makes me wonder who allows these people to make movies  For those who haven t gotten around to reading the book yet  click  THIS LINK  to navigate to a free  official  online version of

matter that it s not the most beautiful writing or that the characters are not fully realised It s beyond all  that  because it forms the basis of any individual s thoughts on how societies are run  It makes you question everything that s fundamental to how we live as human beings today  Its words are the reason we read If you haven t read it  there s an important connection in your brain that s missing  the one that links you to the truth  the meaning of everything  and yes  number 42  And to all those who think it should be referred to as an essay  rather than a novel  who the heck wants to read an essay  Splendid masterpiece it s been almost 70 years since this novel was written  yet one can still easily relate to  either you live in any totalitarian country such as a middle eastern one  or in a any capital of the modern world capitalisms  The same game is being played but with different rules defiantly a five stars  Now I know why I ve been told to read this book for the past decade of my life  The role the Thought Police plays in the revising  erasing  and blatant manufacturing of history effects me in two ways  First  as a teacher I see semblances of this in our school s history textbooks  Second  as a student of history I am aware of many interpretations of single  historical events  I am thankful for this diversity in interpretation because it reveals that nobody has a monopoly on the past  Imagine if there was only one account of the whole of history  Imagine that this one account was mutable and when edited the prior account never existed  Orwell does this and much more in his fictional dystopia  Throughout the tale the reader is inevitably comparing his own life and society to that of Winston and Oceania  As intended  this book will enable you to fully appreciate all that entails your life as an individual  Creo que fue uno de los libros que mas me impacto  Literalmente me lo devore  Me recuerdo leyendo bajo el olivo de mi casa  suena poetico   no    En realidad  fue la primera aproximacion hacia lo que es la vida de una persona a la que trata de resistir un lavado de cerebro y finalmente  finalmente   Como se puede pudrir la cabeza humana Todo 1984 precedio a los estudios universitarios de los textos de Hannah Arendt  quien cobro un sentido muy real desde aquel recuerdo de una ficcion Toda la introspeccion psicologica del personaje  como siente que va cayendo  como termina  como se desmorona todo el pequeno edificio de resistencia que estaba dentro de la mente   Sera tan asi  Da algo de miedo pensarlo   La mente humana es tan vulnerable    puede reducirse el lenguaje  Otro libro que valdria la pena releer  Mucha agua ha corrido bajo del puente  nada menos que una carrera universitaria que se aboco a ese tipo de problematicas    Que resultaria de una relectura    una conversion  Otra cosa que da miedo pensar    pero a la vez estimula  Supongo que todo forma parte de lo movilizante que puede llegar a ser un clasico    WHOA  I can t wait to  officially  read it next year  This is probably the ultimate dystopia story  I literally felt like I was being tortured while reading the torture scene  Even the political philosophy sections were not boring in the slightest because it explained so much about our society now  The thing is  even though this book appears to be describing an exaggerated version of Communist Russia  it actually resembles EVERY country right now  In this technological dystopia set in the future   but somehow also in the past      they have this new language forming called  Newspeak  where they re cutting all unnecessary words out the language so that people won t commit  thoughtcrime  because they won t have the words to express it  Given the reduced vocabulary that I see around me that resorts to using the f word as adjective  verb  adverb  noun  etc  this doesn t seem too far off  Also  their society persuades the Party members to  doublethink   where they realize that something is wrong with the party s philosophy but subconsciously deliberately overlook it and just KNOW that the Party is right  and it s always been right and always will be right That got me thinking  what if WE are doing  doublethinking  and overlooking things wrong with our society because we KNOW that our society is ALWAYS right  I could be  vaporized  for saying that  One of the best books i ve ever read  I can t talk about any bit of it because i might spoil it  So  i highly recomend reading it especially those who love political theories that started to format between 1850   1950  This book is about love  human behaviour  human nature and desiers  politics and a load of brilliant ideas Do read it  You won t regret it  i assure you   Fascinante lectura sin duda  me atreveria decir que es una lectura necesaria   I liked the book not for its story but for the eerie concepts it promotes The book is superbly organized and the characters are seemingly real  If i had written this book I would have called it   The negative Utopia  because of the concepts it promotes like  freedom is slavery    War is peace  and  ignorance is strength   But the most alarming or i should say the best  thing about the book is Orwell s ability to convince his readers that such a dreadful world could truly exist  Though the concepts flow brilliantly  the writing style becomes a turn off  I would like to know why is the author so much opposed to the ideas of communism and totalitarian Government  Otherwise I cant believe he could have written such a book  I found it a bit similar to  Animal Farm   Finally I say its an intellectual treat to read this book  These comment are from my reading of 1984 again in 2013   29 years later For me  this book is a testament to both the strength of the human spirit and a celebration of those who resist tyranny along with the importance of knowing the past  and also of human love and friendship  However  what makes it such an enduringly relevant book is how it explores the limits to which people can be stretched and also the way he created such a convincingly dystopic and comprehensively brutal society  It is apparent to me that this book is the author s expression of his horror at what we witnessed in terms of colonialism and its way of treating the colonial subject as expendable which reminds me of the way he depicts the proles  but also of Stalinism and Hitler which he refers to directly  I just discussed it with a student and what made it wonderful to discuss are all of the things he leaves unanswered as well as the philosophical questions he asks  He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave  and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him  They also said to each other   We are the dead  This is meaningful because I imagine when people decide to take a stand  they have to accept this possibility pp  192 3 state the most important theme for me  but in the book this statement is  if not contradicted  definitely challenged Finally  I wonder in terms of the world that Orwell created  how anyone is reading this story of Winston s struggle  O Brien told him that he didn t matter  didn t exist and no one would hear about him  The idea that the story is being told at all might explain the disappointing or tragic ending where Winston says he loves big brother  This could hint at an alternative answer to whether anyone can take over another person s soul  nan Just finished reading  1984  by Orwell  I knew what the book was about and I have heard Big Brother mentioned in the last 20 years in reference to the internet and increasing ability of govnts to monitor it s citizens  but only got around to reading it now  And I think very timely  While the book has many interesting themes I couldn t help but concentrate on the theme of psychological manipulation and draw a parallel to what is going on in Russia today  The propaganda machine has slowly began turning it s wheels about 10 years ago and has finally gained speed in the biggest nationalistic and patriotic movement I have ever witnessed in my lifetime  Winston Smith lives in a society where history and reality are created by the Party  He begins his journey as a disgruntled member who vaguely feels that what is going on is wrong  He begins to take small actions of defiance and as we find out later he is allowed to do so  We watch him seeking evidence that an underground movement exists and joining the  movement  willingly when it presents itself  When he is finally caught we watch the terrible transformation of defiance to submission to identifying with abuser to the final proclamation of his love for Big Brother   nh bHq rwyh tunqr

Orwell is just too genius to put in words The explanation of the slogan was  from my own perspective  the best part in the novel  especially the  War is Peace  slogan Part III was cruel and outrageous  which assured me more and more that I ll never even think about watching the movie  not to mention that i never watch movies after novels anyways Orwell s writing style didn t strike me as much as his ideas did  to push you to think of a way out for Winston in a totalitarian society  is a thing that could actually drive you insane for a speck of a second All in all  it s one of the must read books of  probably  all time  This is a tale about man vs state  And the state is not an ordinary one  it is  totalitarian  in the complete sense of the word  The state not only controls people and their actions  it controls their minds  it controls thoughts and any untoward thought results in thought crime  However  Winston does commit thought crime  when he starts questioning the Party that rules the state  But they get you  no matter how elusive you are  they get you in the end and crush you  Winston knew this and yet he goes down that line  There is a flicker of hope  and then he meets Julia and dreams of finding the Brotherhood  an underground movement set to overthrow the Party  However  the world is no ordinary world and the Party has found mechanism to stay in power indefinitely  never making the mistake of letting arise any dissent or weakness  It is fortified absolutely  This is a depressing book with ideas so powerful and arguments so impactful  only an intellectual like Orwell could have pulled off  It is no ordinary Sci fi dystopian novel  it is a shameful depiction of power in all its nakedness  stripped of embellishment  The Party is not stupid  it is not divine  it is unabashed  Total control  longevity in fact infinitude of staying in power even if it means losing humanity  the sense of reality  the past  memories  logic  everything  The end is Power  the means is power  Nothing else matters   Fantastic book  I read this my senior year in high school and absolutely adored Orwell s creepy view of a future government  khtm  qrty lhdhh lsn  w n m lkhtm   Orwell  George  1984  1949       Still relevant as a warningWhen I was an undergraduate it was fashionable to compare and contrast the two famous dystopian novels  1984 by George Orwell and the earlier Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  Orwell was writing in reaction to communism with which he had become disillusioned while Huxley wrote in reaction to eugenics and the classical conditioning ideas derived from Pavlov and the behaviorists Which novel more realistically predicted the future  Which one gave a better critique of the world at the time of its writing  Which novel was more fun to read  All science fiction is grounded in the present of course and reflects to a lesser or greater degree not only the author s extrapolations from that present but his or her understanding of the world in which we live Orwell wrote 1984 in 1948  His was not strictly intended as a prediction of any kind but a warning  We thought of it as a prediction though  and in the mid sixties when I was at UCLA there was a tendency to favor Huxley since 1984 was less than a generation away and it didn t look like the dreary hell of Oceania and the thought police had any chance of materializing that soon  Clearly the feel good  feelie  drug infused mindlessness of Brave New World was much more likely even if probably much more than a generation away  So we decided Huxley had more realistically predicted the future  great seers that we were   But as to which one gave a better critique of the present  we were in agreement  it was Orwell s 1984  Not that we personally  as privileged members of the great American middle class had been reduced to drinking victory gin and going to rallies for two minutes of hate or had girl friends who were members of the Anti Sex League  What we knew though was that a football rally  with just a little malevolent direction  could easily turn into a hate rally  and the Big Brother of Oceania was not at all that different in some respects from the Johnson administration that had  we believed  killed Kennedy and was now engaged in a senseless war in Vietnam from which we were spared as long as we maintained our college deferments  Orwell s idea that by reducing the words that one could legally speak  by a government imposed reduction in vocabulary through Newspeak  and by an indoctrination of our thoughts through the enforced concept of  thoughtcrime   and by maintaining a constant state of war from without  the populace could be controlled  this was something that seemed so very true  We had only to witness the relatively recent examples of what had happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany  The twentieth century was indeed the century of totalitarianism  and although it did not seem to affect us now  with flower children in the streets and free love and doobies on our waterbeds  it was clear that the danger was there lurking in the distance Furthermore we greatly identified with the secret and illegal tryst of Winston and Julia  who like us  stole hours away from Big Brother  actually we stole them away from parental authority  to meet and make forbidden love  But what I think really sold us on the psychological truth of 1984 and shocked us greatly were the rats about Winston s face that forced him to betray the only love of his life and in doing so lose his humanity and whatever smidgin of self respect he had left  In other words what we saw was the overwhelming power of torture to completely subdue  and as it eventually happened  transform the vital human being into some kind of compliant animal filled with fear and the wretched worship of brute  physical power  humans reduced to defeated creatures glued to the telescreen  smoking government issue cigarettes  drinking government issue gin and cheering government issue soldiers on to the slaughter of distant  hated peoples  while all the while over every vacant space on a wall or billboard was pasted not the Marlboro Man but the face of Big Brother whom the populous had come to love as a beaten dog might love the sadistic human that beats it As to which novel was more fun to read it was a tossup and depended on your personal choice of genre  Those who preferred horror to fantasy chose 1984  Those who could take some secret delight in soma and free sex and in the security of knowing who you were in the stratification of society  chose Brave New World  A consensus view was that if you were a history or a poli sci major you tended to prefer Orwell s vision  and if you were a psych major  Huxley s One of the unanswered questions about 1984 is whether it really is possible to reduce the human ability to think by restricting vocabulary and distorting history  If some words are not allowed to exist and if history is constantly erased and rewritten in order to conform to the current party line  is it not true that we will more and more lose our ability to think independently and become more and more like cogs in a great repressive social political machine Final thought  what would Orwell have made of the possibilities of the Internet to enslave the populace    a review by Dennis Littrell Better than when I first read it 30 years ago   Orwell had amazing insight into the nature of society    I wonder what he would write if he knew about current technology  Capolavoro di fantascienza  Da leggere e rileggere Orwell  in questo capolavoro  ci presenta la tematica della lotta del singolo contro il suo ambiente opprimente che purtroppo lo destina alla sconfitta  vedi finale   Una storia in cui in ogni riga emerge la lotta di Orwell contro ogni tipo di totalitarismo  quello che lui era andato a combattere e che aveva incontrato  Se nella  Fattoria degli animali  l autore attaccava al cuore  Ramon   la politica stalinista  in  1984  egli crea una vera e propria parabola apocalittica delle sue grandi paure  il totalitarismo  la falsificazione e la perdita di memoria storica indotta dai mezzi d informazione  la corruzione del linguaggio  l annullamento dell identita individuale   convogliate in una raggelante descrizione di societa del futuro contro cui combatte l ultimo eroe  ovvero Winston Smith  La storia di 1984 non dobbiamo interpretarla come una visione profetica  ma piu come un monito  come un esempio da non seguire   Aygun has a new book in her  currently reading  list  George Orwell s 1984 is a frighteningly accurate description of what it would be like to live under a totalitarian government system  To be in a place where you food is rationed  your housing is controlled  and you are fully aware of the fact that the government may very well be watching you at anytime  since are you kept under constant surveillance  Andy if you do not agree with and or support the ideologies of the Party  then you are taken away to a terrible place and physically tortured until you do  After all  the concept of individualism is strictly forbidden in this society As preposterous as the idea of such a place as this to exist in reality  the book was written in the late 40s as a response to the actions of the Soviet Union and the Nazi Regime  Orwell pushed Hitler and Stalin s values to the extreme in order to create his futuristic region of Oceania Through the first person experiences of Winston Smith  one of thousands of members of the Outer Party  we can understand what life for an  anarchist  would be in Oceania  The book follows Winston as he commits a series of treasonous acts  such as keeping a diary of falling in love  We witness his struggles in hiding from the government and the Though Police  a judiciary force whose only job is to read your thoughts and apprehend those who are considered to be enemies of the state   until he is finally caught in the end A lot of this book is very psychological  and deals with the breaking point of the human conscience  In order for the Part to stay in power  they must ensure that the citizens will obey them  so they developed a system in which the majority of the population of Oceania are practically sheep  They follow their government blindly  because they know what will happen to them if they don t  The scary part is seeing the lengths that they will go to ensure that this mindless zombie state is kept  from horrible torture to the dropping of bombs that may kill a whole black of people in an instant  Such acts are considered to be the norm in this society Perhaps the most radical part of this story is the passage in which you get to read Goldstein s book  the book within the book   Inside this book are the reasons how and why society operates  including issues such as the class struggle and keeping the region at a constant state of war  These few pages make up the book that Orwell most likely wanted to write originally  But by presenting his ideas in the form of a fictional novel it allowed for allegorical interpretations that appeal to a much larger reading audience Or maybe the reason why Orwell decided to write a narrative was because he knew the controversy that would arise over calling it a non fiction  But even still  many of the ideas that his book expresses are evident in our society even 60 years later  but in small increments  And you would have to be blind to not realise the similarities between the Party and our modern power thirsty corporations such as Walmart 1984 is without a doubt a revolutionary piece of literature that explores certain aspects of political corruption that most people would choose to ignore  And it s about time for us to wake up and seriously consider where we want our society to be in the future  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER   This book scared the shit out of me  It s not hard to see why this book is a classic  Am important lesson for us all   Brillante distopia  grande spunto di riflessione  Da anni  ormai  volevo leggere 1984  e non mi sono mai informata sui contenuti  cosa alquanto difficile  per preservare la sorpresa  E cosi e stato  Sapevo di potermi aspettare il massimo da un libro di tale calibro  e non ne sono rimasta delusa  Ora siamo nel 2015  67 anni dopo la sua pubblicazione  31 anni dopo l ambientazione temporale della storia  eppure i principi che ho intravisto tra le righe sono gli stessi  Seppur in modo piu tenue  siamo vittime della societa  vittime della strumentalizzazione sia televisiva sia informativa  vittime del potere Per questo e un libro che verra letto negli anni a venire  per la sua attualita  Fino a dove puo spingersi l essere umano  Perche e assetato di potere  Non si parla solo di regime totalitario  ma di molto di piu  l annullamento del pensiero dell uomo  e  di conseguenza  di se stesso per una societa basata di odio finalizzato alla protezione dell individuo Tematiche ardue  piene di riflessioni  che inevitabilmente portano ad un amore incondizionato per Orwell e per queste pagine  bHkm lTby   lbywlwjy  fn llbshr Sf  qTy y  wSf  frdy  kl l nZm  lshmwly  l bt  l  lSf  lwl  wstfzt

wtslk nfs lslwk wtnthy nfs lnhy    came to 1984 after reading a series of novels by Russian authors about life in Stalingrad during the onslaught by Hitler and then after the cruelty of Stalin  It s easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy  Of course  in many instances his vision has become realized  Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media  Governments pose rhetoric immersed in  doublespeak   The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression  Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes   The essential act of war is destruction  not necessarily of human lives  but of the products of human labour  War is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent   Oil comes to mind here  And munitions  And diverse other commodities  In 1984 the war is endless   Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure  the same worship of a semi divine leader  the same economy existing by and for continuous war   Sound familiar  The High  or the  priests of power  only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes  Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master  The protagonist  Winston  a  minority of one  questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the  spirit of man  as a force which cannot be overpowered  In the closing pages we see Orwell s true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit  This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli  who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by  princes  with the  will to power   But the  spirit of man  is truly formidable and cannot be overcome  except temporarily  by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies  The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel  1984 is a cautionary  post World War II tale but to say it s unrealistically dark and couldn t happen here and now is to overlook eons of history  And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time    br wrwyl bTryq  fntzy  mthyr  llfz   n wq  kthyr mn l nZm  ldkttwry  bstkhdm nmwdhj mtTrf khyly lHzb Hkm wdhlk fy  m 1984  hl

perspectiva diferente e acaba por ser uma chamada de atencao para o que ja se passou e ainda pode vir a ocorrer novamente na nossa sociedade EN  A book with a really interesting and unexpected story  It addresses current topics such as we ended up being slaves and subject us to something without realizing it  Warns of the danger of a totalitarian perspective that makes us modify our most absolute beliefs and makes them a unique obsession  I recommend it to everyone because it is a book that shows us things from a different perspective and ultimately a reminder of what has passed and may yet occur again in our society  nan I read 1984 the summer of my junior year in high school and fell in love within the first 10 pages or so  Its easy to see why this book has been so popular for the last

work  be it a novel or a Tom Cruise s latest film  is the plausibility of the created society  the motives and rules behind it  The more appalling  the more undesirable  the more horrid are the acts of the society  yet within the boundaries of the human nature  the more the book is going to appeal to the audience  I understand the  how  I do not understand the  why The genius of Orwell s  1984  has not aged since the first publishing of the book  outliving the actual year 1984  and stretching into the 21st century  I do not think that the reason behind the perpetual topicality of this work is our resemblance to Winston or any other of the characters  In my opinion  it is because we believe that 1984 could actually happen   and not because there are technologies to support this kind of ruling  but because the human nature has not changed much  Power is still desirable  violence and manipulation are still the means of seizing this power  and the concept of war has not been abandoned as too inefficient or too destructive  Orwell has certainly created an extreme vision of dystopia   there is not a single hope left after he is finished with his story  and by the end it occurred to me that the ending suits it and I would not want it any other way  What captivated me the most was the precision with witch Orwell discusses language as behaviour control  the meaning of existence and the mutability of the past  It had never occurred to me to doubt the existence of Julius Caesar or Charlemagne  When Winston reflected on how his created comrade Ogilvy was as real as Caesar  I said  almost aloud   no  because Caesar was real  But then I thought   how do I know  Because I read it in a history book  Now that comrade Ogilvy has entered a history book as well  there will be  fictional  children reading about him without doubting his existence  Then what proof do I have of Caesar being alive other than written records  I have no reason not to trust my history book  but the idea remains the same   information could be falsified and distributed easily  In addition  O Brian s question whether the past exists was equally terrifying  No  it does not presently exist in any accessible form or dimension  only in memories  diaries  pictures and records  But if we change them  have we changed the past  We cannot change the events that took place  but we also cannot reach them in any way  We can  however  change how we perceive and remember them  and we also can reach these memories  Then  what is past  My dictionary describes  past  as  earlier in time   but time as a device of measuring the duration of events  So  then   past  are earlier events and  as discussed  we can change how we remember them  It derives that  if every single memory of an event is changed and every single trace of it altered as well  the past is changed  Of course  no one would really undergo such trouble  I hope  but  in theory  it seems possible  That is what Orwell is saying  unimaginable things are possible  And not only with history  but also with the language  Language is thought and thought is language  Have you ever spent a reasonable amount of time listening or reading in a foreign language and then discovered that you  think  in that language  But you are not fluent  only intermediate  or  perhaps elementary learner  and therefore your vocabulary does not allow your thoughts to develop or wander round much  Your thinking is reduced to basic concepts and confusion  resulting from the obstacles   your lack of sufficient amount of words in that language  You would not spend too much time  thinking  in that language but for the sole purpose of learning it  would you  What Orwell is saying in  1984  is that without the proper vocabulary and shades of meaning one is unable to express one s thoughts  even more  unable to think  And what is a human being without thinking  A labour force easily subjected to control without any hope of rebelling against its enemies  Well  there you go  I have almost written an essay myself  The reason for this is that Orwell gives much food for thought  if you find his philosophical themes being topical and his story equally frightening and plausible  Apparently  I have  and it has lead me to write some of my thoughts down here  and I could only wish to go five or so years back to that day when we discussed this book in out literature class  Now I would make much more use of that class   Rats eating my face  Will  Never  Leave  My  Consciousness Thanks  George   1984  by George Orwell was an awesome book  The entire book kept me on edge the entire time  The idea of the Thought Police constantly watching the people of Oceania and reading how Winsten coped with his difficult life was very interesting  Winsten is constantly battling between the fear of his own thoughts and how the Thought Police would kill him if they ever found out his betraying words and thoughts  So many things that Winsten does could get him in trouble  To try and imagine life with each of my actions being critiqued and watched and it could end up being my death if the Thought Police didn t like it is of course a very in vervains thought so it made this read very interesting  I would definitely recommend this book   Just reread this after gosh only knows how many years    because I saw it on a free shelf  Age brings new perspectives and I still have to recommend this one on a regular basis  It shocks me how many young people come into the food bank I work at and just don t read  or only read a very limited amount  Some actually have told me that they thought that Twilight the book was based on the movie     and so was The Hobbit  Yup  and many others too  There is not a week that goes by that I don t generate a personalized reading list  Sososo many of these kids have not read books that I would have assumed were standard  Argh  So this book invariably makes it onto many of those lists    along with the tempting  remember this is a banned book  comment OI read it at work  on the bus and etc  and because it was an uber busy few days  I actually drew this one out for 2 whole days  What was gratifying were the amount of comments and discussions I had with strangers Everyone should read this book  It s been 2 years since I read 1984 but I swear I still get a headache thinking about this book  This is the kind of book that still haunts you long after you ve finished reading it  It makes even more sense in this century we are living in  It is one of my favorite books I have ever read in my life but it also has to be the best dystopian novel ever written  I remember when I had to put this book down  I was staring at the wall for like 15 minutes doing nothing  It s revolutionary  especially for its time  It has a great plot  strong characters  and the themes are relevant even in the 21st century  As the time passes  I more and more realize that history is changed daily as we watch  Orwell had it right  He was just a little ahead of his time    Big Brother is watching you   He who controls the present  controls the past  He who controls the past  controls the future   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH    It still makes me shiver everytime I remember those quotes  Everytime I begin to describe this book  it feels like whatever I say about 1984  it is not going to be enough  It s astonishing how Orwell perfectly predicted the future and how you can relate to it  So just go and read it  It s a visionary masterpiece and Orwell is the king of dystopian literature   Loved this  thought the ending was AWESOME  When Winston like rips off his shackles and totally smashes O Brien in the face and he s all like  this is MY boot stamping in YOUR face forever   and then he goes and bones the hell out of Julia who had also totally overpowered her guards by being sexy and ingenious  The last chapter where they have the mexican stand off between Winston  Big Brother and Goldstein and they BOTH shoot Goldstein and Winston and Big Brother each only have one bullet left each and Big Bro tries to trick Winston into putting his gun down  but he totally works it out and Big Bro is shouting at him  WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  and Winston is just like   Ha ha  YOUR ASS IS MINE   and then he blows him away and he prods the hole he s just blown in his throat and he s like  Hey  you can do Doublespeak for real now   CANNOT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL  lbd mn qrth mr  khr  n sh llh  rwy  ltrykh

wbrGm mn Hzn lnhy  wqswth l nh lys lh bdyl   Not sure if this is a review  or a rant  or just me spilling everything that s on my mind This is a book that nearly most of my international affairs teachers keep talking about  This is one of the books that you cannot graduate from IR major without hearing about it  I picked this book because this is one of my favourite teacher s favourite novel  Before reading this book  I already had a vague idea about some of the concepts in this book  but I never knew that this book was so scary  and devastating  The scariest part about it is that some of the things in this book apply to our modern time  I have always heard the phrase  Orwellian society   but I never exactly knew what it meant only after I read it  Imagine living in a world where you re being constantly monitored  every move  every word  every thought   That s crazy  but unfortunately  we do live in such a world  We are being watched both indirectly and directly  Imagine not being able to have your own thoughts  and your own beliefs  For me  the one thing that I don t want to be stripped off is  freedom of thought  The book tells the story of a 30 something guy called  Winston Smith   who happens to work in one of the ministries in the Party  The Ministry of Truth   His job in that ministry was to alter the past along with the truth  and fabricate them so that they can suit the Party s desires  Winston happened to deviate from the Party s path  and he started to  THINK   and thinking was a punishable crime in Oceania  It was a crime so dangerous that you d get wiped out of existence for doing it  Going against Big Brother wasn t the only thing Winston did  he also fell in love  which was also a crime according to the Party  Within the Party  you could only be with someone else in order to bear children FOR the Party  Winston also kept a journal with him which he used to write in  and this was also considered a crime  The book focuses on totalitarianism  and how it is like living under a totalitarian rule  I have read before that it may refer to Nazi Germany  and Russia under the rule of Stalin  The book is very depressing  but I really loved it  The story is very powerful  and I like the characters  The only thing I hated was the long descriptions in some parts of the book  I thought that since this is a classic  then the language would be a bit difficult to understand  but it was really easy to read  English is not my first language   Obviously  my favourite part would be the last part of the book  especially when he was talking about the  war is peace  freedom is slavery  and ignorance is strength   I can say a lot about this book  but I feel like this is enough  Oh  and I liked the concept of 2 2 5  it s really all about what you believe in  For example  Donald Trump claims that he ll make America Great again  I could believe that if I wanted to  just like believing that 2 2 5  however  we all know that Donald Trump will only make America even worse   sorry for using this example  but this was the only way for me to understand it   2 2 5  that is true  because I believe that it s true  The thing about beliefs is that they can be changed easily    Quotes I liked from the book  He is too intelligent  He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly  The Party does not like such people  One day he will disappear  It is written in his face    I like this quote because when you really think of it  nowadays such things happens  There are people who are too smart  they know too much  and what happens to them eventually   They get wiped out by the CIA for example    If you loved someone  you loved him  and when you had nothing else to give  you still gave him love     Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars  others devise larger and larger rocket bombs  more and more powerful explosives  and more and more impenetrable armour plating  others search for deadlier gases  or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation go whole continents  or for breeds of disease germs immunised against all possible antibodies  others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water  or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing ship  others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun s rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space  or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat of the centre of the earth  This is a passage from page 223 that describes how scientists nowadays are focusing entirely on developing new armaments that can be used in war  I like this passage because it reflects the reality of most powerful countries  We have reached a point in history where every powerful country has a nuclear weapon  or is trying to develop nuclear weapons  and why is that   it s all for power  Having access to nuclear weapons gives you power over other countries  Now  the real question is  why are they spending huge sums of money on developing weapons that would wipe out humanity   if these weapons are destructible  it is better not to produce them in the first place  but of course that too is impossible  War generates a lot of money  so why should they stop if it is benefiting them   At the end of the passage he mentions a technology that generates artificial earthquakes  and just when I read this  I remembered the HAARP machine  High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program   which is believed to generate earthquakes and other weather modifications  This was built by the U S military  and its purpose is to disrupt the communications  I am not sure whether the HAARP machine exists or not  and I don t want to know anything about it   A really  really good book  It s a classic and it s weird that I haven t read it sooner  Anyway  it s a negative utopian book about what the world might look like if we let things go too far  It s about dictatorship  not being able to feel  to love  to even be a human  It definitely lets you think about it in depth afterwards  It makes you think if that is the image of the future  if future will look like this  It s really worth reading   bdlt hdhh lry  lkthyr mn fkry  lkthyr mn lmwr bd t  yd nZrty lh b d wthn qry ty lhdhh lrwy    tqd ny s qr

to anyone who is interested in world views and dystopian societies  1984 is somewhat of a tough read  with parts that are very long and dry  but it all adds to the overall experience  1984 is about a dystopia where everybody is constantly being monitored and controlled  The main character is Winston  an old man that has some faint memories of a time before the party s control over the masses  He works at a department that changes the past  rewriting it and destroying any record of things being different  He gets more and more restless of the oppression  and after finding the love of his life  they decide to rebel  Winston and Julia rent an appartment seemingly unknown to anybody  where they have prohibited sex and cook food bought from the black market  They are invited to have a brotherhood meeting by O Brian  a member of the inner party  After the meeting  he gets a book from O Brian that explains the way the world works  and how to change it for the better  Winston reads it aloud to Julia  and they are raided by the police  They forgot to look behind an old painting in the apartment  Winston and Julia are taken to the ministry of peace  where they are tortured for what may have been weeks  O Brian is actually not a part of the secret brotherhood  but a thought police spy  Winston is ultimately remolded to fit the party s ideals  Winston and Julia meet weeks after the events  and tell each other that they sold the other one out   It s difficult to summarise one s thoughts about a book like 1984  It has influenced generations and has been interpreted by each differently  There have been scores of novels and movies  and even video games  remember Half Life   which have drawn inspiration directly or indirectly from it  At the outset  it must be said that this dystopian novel is a fantastic read  Even when you ignore the philosophy of it all  simply as a novel this is pretty amazing  Of course  once one delves deeper  there is a thoroughly intriguing and might I add  highly thought provoking  take on modern societies and power regimes and where they re headed  One may not agree with every conclusion the author comes up with but few can dispute the relevance of the book even to this day  the picture of the North Korean defector with a copy of 1984 in the streets of South Korea   Nothing to Envy  by Barbara Demick  immediately comes to mind   Rulers  regimes and governments have since time immemorial been ruthless against the proletariat  And what s extremely uncomfortable and perplexing is the fact that even to this day  around the world  the exploitation of the poorest of the poor is continuing  Somehow we are still stuck with the medieval notions of the higher  middle and lower classes  in one form or the other  And therefore  much to my personal dismay  Orwell s books  especially Animal Farm and 1984 continue to be relevant rather than simply being important works of literature  Though possibly disturbing to sensitive readers  this book is amazing  It s the first one I read that made me seriously consider issues like underhanded politics  the best and worst types of government  the power of multi national corporations  and the implications of the deliberately misleading ambiguity of political language  I loved it and hated it because of the truth I found in it    WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Words that seem confusing and paradoxical at first  but throughout the novel  George Orwell has you convinced  In 1949  Orwell wrote this novel that predicts the future of our world  and as readers read on  they will discover the resemblance between the horrific  empty and rigid society in the novel with our current society with a chill  The most obvious resemblance would be things such as the shortening and simplifying words and languages  we prob all kno tat  but it is more than that  it is evident that some governments would attempt to reword and hide facts and histories so that it is in their favor  they will do anything to make the citizens believe that life is perfect  if not good  and that the government is absolute  The government and rules built in the novel seems ridiculous at first  but as you read on  you realise how real they can be  how easily a lie may become the truth  and how easily we may lose ourselves  our identity  The novel makes you question the past  value the present and fear the future This is definitely one of my favourite novels of all times  partly because I am a fan of books about futuristic utopian and dystopian societies but mostly because it has change the way I view our present society  the advancing technology and human knowledge  I believe this book would leave all readers breathless and its words will haunt you  Big brother will haunt you  I am convinced that if Winston Smith  the protagonist who started as a rebel that is guilty of thoughtcrime  can conform and love big brother  anyone else can  Days after reading the novel  I still have certain phrases and passagesIf you are someone who enjoys novels and stories about Utopian and dystopian societies  because really  there is a thin line between the two   this is your book  this

watch v pSWN6Q    Una novela escalofriantemente desoladora  Pero genial  Una obra que nos despiertas  nos hace vibrar  hace que salgamos del comodo sitio de lector y nos estremezcamos con el camino al infierno de Winston Smith  Obra maestra del siglo XX Non c e da stupirsi se nel 1948  poco tempo dopo un conflitto mondiale che aveva visto scontrarsi i protagonisti dei regimi totalitari europei  George Orwell ha concepito uno dei romanzi per cui risulta maggiormente pertinente la definizione di  distopico  e il cui titolo risulta da nient altro che dall inversione delle ultime due cifre indicanti l anno in cui l autore si accinge alla scrittura Il mondo descritto in questo romanzo e  infatti  allucinato  spersonalizzato  dominato dalla propaganda del partito del Socing  al cui vertice sta il Grande Fratello  storpiatura ormai proverbiale dell originario Big Brother  che significa  fratello maggiore    da un serrato e soffocante controllo sociale e intellettuale  da una rigida suddivisione in classi e da una violenza incontrastabile   http   athenaenoctua2013 blogspot it     As I m kinda reevaluating my worldview at the moment  the only thing I can say is   Holy crap  That was freaking amazing  Doubleplusgood    More to come later  possibly   Edited 9 21 2015 Alright  Now that I ve finished analyzing this book inside out thanks  English class   I can finally sit down and write this  This was the required summer reading this year  and for once  I was glad  I d wanted to read this book for a while  so this was a good opportunity  And it freaking blew my mind  Where do I even begin  Winston  The Party  Big Brother  Oceania in general  I could just go on and on about this book  Strangely enough  most of my class hated 1984  I can t even begin to imagine why  Hm   I suppose I ll start with Winston  Winston Smith is the protagonist of this book  and he is a rebel  Or at least tries to be one   It s a little hard to rebel even the slightest when just making the wrong facial expression can get you arrested and tortured  Or killed  But he does his best while living in Airstrip One  aka London   in the Party s capital and nearest to the different Ministries  Contrary to his neighbors and coworkers  however  he hates the Party  he hates the war s  going on  and most of all  he hates Big Brother   view spoiler   Big Brother is the elusive leader of the Party  As much as the members say he is real  we the readers never find out if he actually exists  or if he is just an imaginary figurehead  The latter is most likely    hide spoiler  Anyway  Winston tries to rebel  but fails   view spoiler   He gets caught and is taken to the Ministry of Love  which deals with war  and is tortured until he becomes a loyal citizen of Oceania again  However  he only truly breaks when he is taken to the sinister Room 101  Good for you  Winston  Your life really sucks    hide spoiler   view spoiler   As it so happens  the rebellion that Winston tries to join is not even real  it was made up to weed out the traitors that may have been in society  Goldstein  the supposed leader of the rebellion  called the Brotherhood  isn t real  and was only made up to find possible traitors and to give the masses a figure to hate  And the person who led him to the rebellion in the first place  O Brien  is a member of the Thought Police and captures Winston  Also  his lover Julia betrays him while being tortured  All in all  not a happy time for poor Winston Smith    hide spoiler  This is one of those books that everyone should read at least once in their life  at a time when they ll truly understand the point that Orwell is trying to get across  It s one of those books that will make you step back and reevaluate your worldview  and with what s been happening in the world right now  I m seeing more and more of this book become reality  Yikes  But beyond themes and analyzing the book  it s just a really good read  The plot was awesome  the characters were actually realistic  and even though it can be very boring in places  it is still interesting  As Orwell says in the book   He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past     lkn l b s  l b s fqd nth  lnDl  wh qd ntSrt  l  nfsy  wSrt  Hb l kh lkbyr  rwy  kthr mn ry       wtsthl kthr mn njmt ljwd rydyz l5   Wow I don t know how to process this book  Scarily how some ideas run true today  It was a haunting and creative look into the future  This book was definitely rich in detail and I would definitely recommend this book   The perfect example that even the most complicated of ideas can be expressed by simplest of words  all you need is clarity of thought  The fact that this book was not a half baked idea but one thought through  adventure  leaps out of almost every page  The more you understand  the less you mouth off Unlike majority of the book universes now  this book spans a real meager number of pages in comparison and still sets up a whole world that you can soak in without feeling left out The whole concept of NewSpeak blew me away  You can see the attachment of the author when once you end the novel and meet the NewSpeak appendix While building up hopes that individualism  not entirely individualism but couldn t find a better term as of right now  can lead to something big  it kills some part of you at the end  And I guess the best tribute you can give to an artist is when you allow them to control your emotions  And I can honestly say this book broke my heart Loved the writing style and the whole premises  Amazing book  One of my favorites ever   http   www fantasyliterature com revi    One of the best books I ve EVER read  The world of 1984 is a picture of what our life might be  The totalitarianism of the party really kills the people  I can t really imagine if I am in the place of Winston  The lines WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH are totally baloney  This is really the best classic book I ever read  Before reading it I must confess that I was a bit afraid that the book would be a massive bore  I had this general idea that it was about politics and that s one subject I m not interested in  even if I should   But I was wrong  The book actually turned out to be about a man that lived in a belic world ruled by the  Big Brother   who was always watching  It is  as wikipedia says  a dystopian novel  an allegory I might add  This man  Winston Smith  manages to evade the mind control  being able to distance himself from all the propaganda sorrounding him  He questions the regime  he even tries to fight it  Of course he fails  Even though you know he s doomed since the first sentence  the book is so masterfully written that you get hopeful along the way  rooting for a happy ending that never comes  In 1984  Orwell did not intend to predict how the world would be when that year came  he intended to warn the people of his time that humanity was receding and that fascism could win About the not so good aspects  I did not appreciate the way women are portrayed in the book  Almost every woman comes off as weak or as a puppet of the movement  Julia was different but still  she was  only a rebel from the waist down   having no interest in understanding the ways of the  Big Brother  and bringing the system down Nevertheless  I enjoyed the book immensely  The last sentence even gave me chills  I won t spoil it  Just go read it for this is a book that will meet your expectations  Even if they are crazy high  Okay   So I really don t know what to say about this one   When I started reading I sort of imagined reading something close to Animal Farm    When I finished I got filled with every dark emotion there is in the world    plus a huge gratitude for the day I picked this novel up    for me  I devided the novel into 3 stages   1 the Dull  boring  aimless movment of action and life in Oceania   2 action started to get a bit faster with the old note book and the  I love you  note     3  we are the dead  we are the dead  YOU are the dead That s when I really couldn t put the book down AT ALL   and that s where the shock and horror started to take place    The last closing lines were Confusing and saddning    The characters were really mere instruments to develope the themes and the actions in 1984   they got nothing    Nothing to make them out standing by themselves  except Names       Even memories aren t true or they are fuzzy   and confusing    How easily they could be changed added a great deal to the horror aspect of the novel    Honestly    It was a Scary read    That was worth each second of reading   the Atmosphere was REALLY gripping    It rises alot of Questions about Humans and how easily could they discard their Human qualities    and if is it possible to change Humans to become mere THINGS in life   Such Questions never cease Hovring around while reading and even after finishing it     A great read       mthlm ktb fy lGlf lkhlfy   rwy  tuqr   thm tuqr  mn jdyd   The ultimate dystopian novel  So much of this has leached into popular culture it becomes very hard to say something that hasn t already been said  How man is eventually broken by totalitarian rule  this is both tragic and satirical   Orwell is beyond human  That is all that I will say   lwl y ny  dm

list of  books you must read  I can honestly say that I went into it expecting greatness but thinking that it wouldn t live up to the  classic  status  like so many over hyped books  I was wrong  It totally delivered  More relevant to today that almost any other book that you can think of    Jo BrandThis quote is unbelievably true  The book was written decades ago and is set decades ago  yet there is a feel that it could be happening in the past  the present or in the future  It could contain no mention of dates and you would still see the relevance  I ve seen a lot of people saying that they  just didn t get it  or  am I missing something   and that s fine  not everyone has to feel the same  I did get it though and 1984 was powerful  thought provoking and frankly frightening  If you want a vision of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face   forever     O Brien  1984  Ta queo par you  A warning and a brilliant price of literature for its own sake Going into one of most famous book from the last 100 years I had doubts  Books like this  you hear things about even if you wish to avoid any prior knowledge  it s unavoidable  Highly though of  political essays and an pessimistic flavour are three things I usually attempt to avoid in literature  I essentially read books solely for good stories But  This had that  A fantastic story in an extreme world  The political points made didn t harm the experience  they enhanced it  as they re perhaps more relevant in today s society  The pessimism even formed itself into a beautiful tragedy because of Orwells flowing writing An essential book to read  if there are any  that I m glad I didn t have to read back in my school days  This should be something you read because you want to  not because you re told to DT 27 03 2014 George Orwell wrote this novel as his health was declining during the final years of his life  His writing reveals noteworthy intensity throughout  and the final product is a great classic of 20th century dystopian fiction  In fact  this book was one of the first examples of the genre  and remains one of the very best ever written The horrors faced by the book s protagonist  Winston Smith  are partly of a psychological nature  and partly of a more direct  threatening nature  These include omnipresent government surveillance  something that has become a reality in our own time   and the knowledge that he is engaged in destroying the truth  about past events  on a daily basis  as part of his job  Orwell s depiction of a man trapped in a hellish reality is a stunning accomplishment  and highly recommended to anyone who enjoys dark  well crafted  intellectually challenging fiction   This book scared me when I first read it  Maybe it is my paranoia that the government controls us and nobody realizes it or maybe it is a testament to just how good this book is  the perfect dystopia Despite this  I think that most people are mistaken in supposing that this book is a criticsm directed at the socialit communist movement  It just points out to the kind of damage that too large a discrepancy between classes can create  Orwell s novel shows what can happen in any kind of society if the public  the proles    the people who  in theory shoud have most power simply through the fact that they are many   become distracted by futilities and lose touch with the world around them and the ideas of the people that are in power  1984 is a very well written book and what I believe to be one of the best books that George Orwell has written in his lifetime besides animal farm  1984 sets the stage by telling us how the world changed to a place where everything is separated into four groups and all of them are the opposite of what they seem to be for example the peace group is all about violence  love group hatred etc and everyone is under the influence of  Big Brother  and they are supposed to love big brother and think only of him or else the thought police will come and make you forgotten   So as the story goes a man finds a journal and starts to write things he s not supposed to think about and as the story progresses he does a lot of things that are against the rules and he is soon caught and tortured until he finally gives in and shouts something I will not tell you because I already gave to much away but anyways i find this book to bee really good but would only recommend it too people who 1  do not have anger issues because the ending will shock you into anger and 2  that love dystopian novels but either way I say it is a book to read through until the very end and to be read from generations to come   Group read for Cocaine Pages   Talking to her  he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no gras whatever of what orthodoxy meant  In a way  the world view of the Party imposed itself most succesfully on people incapable of understanding it  They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality  because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them  and were not sufficiently interestedin public events to notice what was happening  By lack of understanding they remained sane  They simply sallowed everything  and what they swallwed did them no harm  because it left no residue behind  just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird   Reading this book has not been the massive experience I thought hoped it would be  As Tara from my group called it  it was a dry read  not one made more beautiful by literrary effects  But I think that was the point  That was the whole idea  How can you talk beautifully about something so ugly and represent it the same  No  the writing itself must be in theme with what is happening  1984 is pure  cruel imagery  I don t know if it s just because of my imagination or I m the only one who felt this  but it s a powerful book no just in terms of  what could be   but also in terms of  what is   Not just  what ifs   but more like coming to terms with the fact that some of those  what ifs  are already here  I m not saying our world is 1984esque  But it s not that far either  It s already started on that slope and if we start going faster and faster  who can guarantee we won t end up like that  Along the book  I met tons and tons of greatly written lines  of thoughts that were also mine  but in different shapes  As Allan Bennett says in  The History Boys  says    The best moments in reading are when you come across something   a thought  a feeling  a way of looking at things   which you had thought special and particular to you  And now  here it is  set down by someone else  a person you have never met  someone even who is long dead  And it is as if a hand has come out  and taken yours     Here are some of the parts that I really really really really  a thousand really s  liked   Power is not a means  it is an end  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution  one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship  The object of persecution is persecution  The object of torture is torture  The object of power is power He who controls the past controls the future  He who controls the present controls the past The best books    are those that tell you what you know already To die hating them  that was freedom   And many  many others    I found this book amazing  and I wish to read it again soon  It s true  it s harsh  it s crude  yes  but it speaks of freedom and love and humanity  So yeah  my kind of book  George Orwell is just a briliant man  This is one of those books that I will re read  The famous chapter nine was painful but deep  It will cut you open and reveal something that you had thought about before but never truely want to see  Classic  One of the best books ever  parallels with modern society are so great  this could soon   if not already  be classed as non fiction  an exceptional future history  could almost be a manual for that fall of western civilisation  It is rare that I m rendered speechless and breathless by a novel  It is even rarer that I find a classic worthy of more accolades than it has received  Eric Blair  under the ubiquitous pseudonym George Orwell  wrote just that There is much to say about 1984  One could describe at length the unflinching  stark diction of Orwell  or his markedly intuitive ability to pace a story  One could  with great ardor  recount the superb use of ethos Orwell invokes in the reader  Reader  you will find yourself greatly invested in Winston  You will find that walking alongside his wiry  upright frame you will begin to take on the revolutionary s burden he shoulders so humanly  His spirit is not indomitable  nor is his will ironclad or pure or indefatigable  Winston is human  and therefore among the most sympathetic characters I ve ever encountered  The hyper political undertones of 1984 only aid the narrative in fleshing out its portrait of a revolutionary s Sisyphean undertaking No work of art is without flaw  as the artist cannot reach every pedestrian and tailor his work to the public s liking  especially posthumously to suit the sociopolitical climate   In some instances  1984 borders on didactic  In others  Orwell s portrayal of Julia  sexist  The former can be met with understanding that the few select pages it pronounces the politics of the book are appropriate  As for Julia s character  not much can be pardoned  Reader  read this novel critically and welcome it for its humanity  Little is contrived and much is viscerally felt upon reading 1984  That is the mark of fiction worthy of its acclaim  I urge you to crack the spin of this book and mark its margins with ink and theories  with comments and observations  Read this before you read it in an academic setting  Experience it unadulterated by worksheets  prompts  and spoon fed interpretations   1984 is a book that is based on Russia s totalitarianism  The main character  Winston Smith  is the citizen of Oceania  He is a member of the party  which rules the land with their own propaganda  Proles  who are the people that are not in the party  are free from them entirely  The party s leader is Big Brother  nobody has seen him  but everyone in the Party has to praise him  Although Winston is a Party member  he still hates Big Brother and always writes in his diary  DOWN BIG BROTHER  One day  he meets a women named Julia  At first  Winston thought she was a police but she was not  and they fall in love  Because all their houses are being watched by the Party  they rent a room in Mr Charrington s flat and make love there  Everything was going well  until they meet O Brien and build a relationship with him  At first  Winston and Julia thinks that O Brien also abhors the party and Big Brother  However  he turns out to be a member of the Party  and so was Mr Charrington  They both get arrested for a  thought crime   and go through extreme pain and torture  Finally  their minds get refreshed by the party  and they live on like that  At first  I thought that Julia would be a thought police because she was acting weird  I was really shocked at the ending  when they all got brainwashed  It was a bit scary  but it was also very useful to encounter totalitarianism through a book  I really enjoyed the book  except for the torturing part at the end which really freaked me out   l ymknk  n tnhyh dwn  n tsh r bl s    ttklm  n jmy an w k n lktb rsm fy khylh lwH  t br  n lHDr b sw  Hlth   w lmdhsh  nh ktbt  m

thought and action  The narrative follows protagonist Winston Smith who tries to conceal his dissentient thoughts from a government that monitors each and every individual activity  Use of telescreens and concealed microphones to spy on people and the reduction of language to control all thought  it s all relevant to our present times what with the internet and webcams and use of media to control minds  This book is so far sighted  it s uncanny  I sure got the creeps while reading it  Recommend it as a must read for all   1984   Big Brother is Watching George Orwell s 1984 is easily one of the best known allegories written to date  and for good reason  Orwell paints a picture of a dystopian future  a world dominated by Big Brother   an overbearing presence  and ruler of the society  Our protagonist   Winston   is a simple man  Just like any other member of the society  he goes about his daily life in service of the Party  However  Winston is rebellious  and chooses to keep a diary   an illegal act in their society  The rebellious thoughts he writes in his diary make him a target of the thought police  and an enemy of the party  As he grows in his thoughts  and in his feelings for a mysterious woman   Julia   he becomes more and more opposed to the Party s oppression  and eventually starts to sympathize with the Brotherhood  a mysterious organization that acts against the Party  Even though he knows that the Party is out to get him  and he has no hope of escape  he continues onwards   and becomes tangled in a series of events far beyond his control  This story proves to be a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of totalitarianism and manipulation through propaganda  It shows the Party as being completely backwards  as is their slogan   WAR IS PEACE  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   The overbearing Big Brother is the ultimate expression of this danger   all seeing  all knowing  posing as a loving protector  but really a cold comfort  a wolf in sheep s clothing  The citizens can t think what they want to  can t love who they want to   merely disagreeing with the Party is punishable by death  This government  this force  is so overpowering to the common man  and works very well with Animal Farm as a denouncement of communism and totalitarianism  Orwell s novel remains as potent today as it was when it was first published  and if anything is far more relevant now  The society he presents is a brutal and horrific vision of a Hell escapable only by death In the world of  1984   there is no respite  no meaning to life and no happiness  not even for the ruling elite  Whole continents are enslaved to  and worship  a dictator who for all they know could have been dead for years and may never have existed  Oceania is a place where no sane person would want to live  and where no sane person could live  Only the government approved fanatical madness is permitted  and any other thoughts are punishable by death  Not that the other two great empires have much to offer either  they are just as cruel and repressive Through the eyes of the unfortunate Winston Smith  rooted out and trapped by The Party from the very beginning  we see inside the mechanics of a brutal and vile state  designed to become increasingly repressive and cruel over the centuries for no reason whatsoever What defines this book is a sense of hopelessness  Life in the world Orwell envisages has no meaning or purpose  The Party wants power for its own sake  but gains no joy from it  The war continues  but is never won  And when The Party has successfully indoctrinated a dissident into loving Big Brother  they simply murder them  rendering the whole torturous process obsolete While such a depressing story is certainly not uplifting to need  it is essential to make sure that a society such as this one never has the chance to exist  Der Roman schildert eine kunftige Welt  die in drei Machtblocke gespalten ist  sie gleichen sich in Ihrer politischen Struktur  fuhren jedoch zur Aufrechterhaltung der innenpolitischen Machtverhaltnisse Scheinkriege gegeneinander Ein Unterdruckungsapparat  der  Grosse Bruder   verhindert jedwede Opposition   1984  ist ein Buch  das die anthropologische Hoffnungslosigkeit geradezu zelebriert und zu einem Abgesang auf die menschliche Zivilisation anstimmt  wie es ihn zuvor nie gegeben hat  Auch wenn inzwischen mehr als 60 Jahre seit der Veroffentlichung von  1984  vergangen ist  ist der Roman immer noch aktuell und erschreckend zugleich  noch schlimmer  in unserer heutigen Zeit der Uberwachung durch staatlich Geheimdienste und nichtstaatliche Konzerne ist die Existenz des Grossen Bruders im Bereich des Moglichen  ja sogar des Wahrscheinlichen gekommen Man kann nur hoffen  dass genugend Menschen dieses Werk gelesen haben und die Implikationen dessen  was am Horizont erscheint  erkennen    und dagegen rebellieren   This book was great    The action and sexual content got me through the entire book with ease  The way the government isolates all of society has really got me thinking if such a thing could happen in the future  This book creates great scene in your mind when Winston is being tortured  Having not read many distopian pieces of art until this year I was truly amazed at how much a book like this could create such excitement within oneself even though it is just a written piece of text  I would totally refer this book to a friend who is looking for something new to read and wants to have an adventure within a book  Finally  I have finished the novel 1984  It took me long to finish it but it was worth it  The ending was  unfortunately  disappointing when Winston wins the war against himself and loves the big brother  this is the ultimate victory to the big brother   Actually I just came up with a new idea which is a mixture between  1984  and  V for vendetta   I advise to start reading 1984 and when the reader reaches the part where winston gets out of prison to go to the movie  V for Vendetta  and continue as if they were the same novel where V is winston and that president is the Big brother     You will really feel they were very much relevant with a better ending  You re watching a film or playing a game  or reading a book  and the villain s motives are laid out  Perhaps they re the kind of villain who lusts after power and little else  who want to reign at the top of the heap and crush all opposition  We don t often get to see exactly the kind of world the villain wants to make  other than the supposition that it s a markedly worse one than what we currently have  invariably  the heroes burst in at the last minute and foil the evil plan  preserving the status quo 1984 is the absolute  quintessential account of the  what now   after the villain wins Specifically  this  Orwell s finest hour as a wordsmith and as a speculative fiction writer  discusses the kind of world that a power mad villain would create in order to prevent all forms of rebellion and dissent  It is a world where humans have been robbed of the right to the thoughts in their brains  of any form of self expression  this is a world where music and novels are produced mechanically  of the idea of taking pleasure from even an act as essential as sex  and even of the immutability of objective fact and history  In Orwell s vision  the world has become a coffin lined with spikes on the inside  so tight and rigid that the slightest lateral movement is punished In broad strokes  Orwell s vision has gone from futurist to alternate history as the implied time frame of the novel has come and gone  but it retains every bit of potency with which it first was written  Perhaps even moreso  as we can now look back and observe how it foresaw the modern surveillance state In short  1984 is the ultimate political dystopia story in any medium  The Inner Party  who exist like barons in servant tended mansions while all others languish in ratty flats drinking swill  do not have a particular distinct  flavour  to their form of oppression  there are no Quarter Quells or Death Stars here  Rather  their stranglehold over media  surveillance  and every other facet of life is so absolute that they need not demonstrate brutal force or pepper the masses with false hope Rather  they instead are hard at work perverting  suffocating and ultimately destroying the very idea of human communication  creating Newspeak   a linguistic form that trims down language into extremely narrow forms  It is explained in exhaustive  but never boring  detail that  within a few generations  they will have  bred out  even the notion of rebellion through what can only be called linguistic eugenics  Within generations  the concept of rebellion will have been destroyed at its core  because the language will no longer broker the concept  Orwell understands the sublime power of language  of meaning and speech acts  as much as the theoretical master Saussure himself  here applied to show how these sublime things can serve as a tentpole of an evil empire just as much as a world destroying space station So this is why the Inner Party needs not explicitly threaten or make cruel sport to keep the masses in line   Although  the Ministry of Love  with its Gulag esque torture chambers  make a strong impression on those who diverge   No  their game is linguicide  and with it comes the intellicide of all who could make a difference  This is the Inner Party s grand plan to grind to a halt the gears of human history  which have shown that there will always be those lower in society who rise  and those at the top who fall  This is their endgame to ensure that those at the top never  ever fall For us writers  1984 has something very important to teach us  if I might butcher a famous line from another series  a great story is never too long  nor is it too short  It lasts precisely as long as it means to  Orwell s prose goes on at great length about the principles of Ingsoc  English Socialism  the Evil Empire in this tale   as well as about what it means to rebel in a twisted world where even objective history is mutable and the thoughts in our heads are not granted to us  In most other books  this kind of pacing might be seen as meandering  or  insert horrified scream here  didactic  But it is not  because the ideas being expressed are in this case just as important as the actual movement of the plot  Ironically for a series about a society as suffocated as Airstrip One  Orwell knows how to let his scenes breathe The actual plot concerns protagonist Winston s romance with fellow Outer Party member Julia  and their encroaching on the inside of a possible conspiracy to take down the Inner Party from within  to spark a rebellion amongst the downtrodden proletariat  It s archetypal  yes  but there s nothing wrong with archetypes  Quite the opposite  really  it s a tale that s been told time and time again  these totems of oppression and rebellion  but I think it s because these stories awaken something fundamental in us  and remind us that there are things worth fighting for  and that there are sides worth choosing But   without delving into straight up spoiler territory   things retain a gloomy tone throughout  and what spots of hope you may cling to will soon chime a bitter tone  Even before chunks start hitting the fan  the forbidden lovers regard their own fate as sealed  as corpses marching onward to the grave  They regard any move they make towards liberation as creating only tiny ripples  even if that  which will not amount to waves within their own lifetimes  As they resist the doublethink of the Party   the process of willful hypocrisy that a true Ingsoc believer must submit to   they engage in their own self deception  or is it    that of hope in a world where the concept is anathema Because  after all  this is a world where the traditional definitions of hero and villain in a narrative have been shifted  this is a world where the villain has already emerged triumphant  and it is a reflection of the cruel  unthinkable machines that would be required for the villain to keep their power  Perhaps the cruelest thing to happen to our protagonists here is that   again  no specifics for those who haven t yet read it   there was no struggle at all at the end of the day  any more than that of a grain of sand struggling against a violent tide  The climactic  confrontation   if it can be called that  is a struggle of minds  of ideologies  but the Party has well and truly thought out its systematic annihilation of the human spirit  It may well be the most  successful  villain in the history of fiction That is one reason why I choose to view the novel chiefly in this way  rather than chiefly as a critique of Communism or Naziism  as some commenters have said over the years  Rather  it s a look at the villainous nature of extremism as a whole  All extremes  no matter what ideology originally spurred them on  tend to meet in the middle  where torture and thought control are the nature of the machine  They all meet in the place where there is no darkness Incidentally  if you value 1984 as much as I do  you absolutely must check out the film Brazil by Terry Gilliam  To me  it s Gillian s finest hour as a filmmaker  While some elements are different  it really does feel like the best major film adaptation of 1984  even if not  quite  1984  Check out the Criterion edition  which includes both the ultimate director s cut of the film  as well as  for curiosity s sake  the 90 minute version that the studio butchered in a baffling attempt to make it more palatable to  the average moviegoer  As for the novel  I first read 1984 in high school  recommended to me by my teacher when we had a choice of reading material and I found myself unsure  I first read it as a teenager  and most recently read it eight years after that first time  and it has only grown in importance and relevance  I am struck as I read these pages with the impression that I am reading something fundamental  if not to the very progress of our species as a whole  then to the society that we ve spent the last several centuries building up Let us as a society always keep the light lit  to never become Airstrip One  Hyn ykwn lkhyl  kthr wq y  mn lwq     mrj   lqr  lthny   sjlt lmrj    l

the best books ever written and disturbingly actual even after decades from the first publishing  It s a machiavellic book  a manual of manipulation tactics  The concept of the  continuous war  makes me think at the current US policy trying to govern a nation by running unfair wars all over the world just to keep the people in fear  The  hate hours  in which everybody has to watch videos with the Nr 1 enemy of the state remembers strangely the current news where any questionable actions of the governement is backed up with threatening videos of Osama bin Laden  The  rewriting of history  and the  double thinking  is perfectly in line with the current american practice to  forget  that the countries he s fighting recently are countries and fractions he supported and made a danger of  Afganistan  Irak  based on the economical and political interests of the moment  Everybody knows that US founded and trained the mujahedeens and Osama in Afganistan but nobody sees openly the contradiction with the actual state of things Anyway the analogy with US is just an example but the book can be read as an analogy with any disturbed society in disturbed times from Hitler s Germany to Stalin s Russia or Saddam s Irak  It s a great story    I think that 1984 by George Orwell is a powerful story  The novel s protagonist  Winston Smith is a citizen of Oceania  Winston is a member of the Party  which rules oceania under the principles of Ingsoc  English Socialism   Oceania is an oligarchy  under hierarchical rule  The party consists of Inner Party members  who are the ruling elite and regular party members  who are citizens of Oceania  Outside of the Party are the proles who are simple people who live in poverty and are free from Party regulations Everywhere that Winston looks  he sees the face of the Party s leader  only known as Big Brother  Currently  the party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak  which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it  I recommend this book to anyone who seeks curiosity and imagination  The book details an emotionless world fighting with conformity  The book expresses the fear in people to freely express themselves  There are also many interesting themes included as well as universal ideas explored in the book  A fabulous book from a prophetic voice  I m sure every generation has thought this book was most appropriate for their time  and I can t disagree  it must be only more so now  Very well written  a deep look  in story form  into governing bodies and personal freedom  or the pretense of  Throughout history and even now  why have small groups of people taken it upon themselves to dominate and control the masses  Do we rely on the government to think for us  to protect us from each other and from ourselves  How far is too far  The inevitable question is  what really is freedom  This book is not talked about for no reason  When I started readin the book I had formed the opinion that it might be overrated  Now that I have finished the book I can only thank the world that the society that takes place in this book is not a part of our world A deeply frightening and disturbing book that does not dissapoint as a must read  t d hdhh lrwy  mn  fDl lrwyt lty qry th l  lan  ttmHwr Hwl lHdyth  n Hl  lfrd fy Zl l nZm  lshtrky

writing a comment about  Nineteen Eighty Four   not because I have nothing to say regarding it but because only here  in Goodreads  we do have until today 28 140 reviews  Anyway  the first thing I would state is that  Nineteen Eighty Four  is a MUST READ  This is a dystopian novel  written from 1946 to 1948 and published in June 1949  which describes a world of perpetual war  omnipresent government surveillance  and public manipulation dictated by a political system under the control of the  Party  which seeks power entirely for its own sake and persecutes all individualism and independent thinking  The protagonist of the story is a member of the Party and his job is to rewrite past newspaper articles to adapt the historical record to the current party line  The Prols  biggest part of the population  however notice the controls without big emotions because they can survive in a frame of relative freedom enjoying some gossip and entertainment  The scaring but captivating fact about all this is how many of Orwell s visions became reality  We are here not talking about technical development but about a society in which absolute control dominates the daily life  I found mind blowing that Orwell forecasted not only the communist and dictatorial systems emerged after the WWII but the control elements used by some actual governments and the statements with which several wars are nowadays justified   War is Peace   as well  Politicians who act detached from the wishes of the majority  the surveillance without gap of civil communication through the NSA and much more things about we read in  Nineteen Eighty Four  are already reality  This is a very depressing book which brings one inevitably to the question  how free we actually are  I should say I didn t find the story itself amazing as a novel but the worth of this book resides mainly in the construction of a vision which already turned reality   First of all  I cannot believe it has taken me this long to get to this classic and wonderful novel  But in a strange way  it s kind of wonderful  as I get to discover Orwellian genius for the very first time  The story is set in 1984  which was the future when it was written   and presents the reader with a new dystopian world where the original Big Brother  no  NOT the television programme   is supreme high commander and is always watching  We are introduced to our main character Winston  whose job involves editing and updating a multitude of records i e  newspapers  pamphlets  books  to obliterate traces of a past that  the Party  feels necessary  or in some cases  to completely vaporise or re write history to fit the current line of thinking  In many instances  a particular individual is obliterated from the records if required  so it is as if they have never existed  The remit under Big Brother s control is known as Oceania  and mainly encompasses America and Great Britain  Some other parts of our world are now known as Eurasia and Eastasia  one of which Big Brother is bound to be at war with at some point or another whilst informing their citizens that this has always been the case  even though in truth it has a tendency to chop and change One of the main objects of the BB party appears to be the creation of mind controlled  emotionless puppets in its population   this is essential for them to maintain their absolute power  With the implementation of telescreens and microphones in all homes and public places  the Party manages to keep a constant eye on their inhabitants for any signs of dangerous rebellion or indeed thoughts of their own  hence the expression  Big Brother is watching you   Faces must remain expressionless while body language is vigorously scrutinised to ensure no  thought crimes  are carried out  Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling  Everything will be dead inside you  Never again will you be capable of love  or friendship  or joy of living  or laughter  or curiosity  or courage  or integrity  You will be hollow  We shall squeeze you empty  and then we shall fill you with ourselves  Any bonds between parent and child  man and man or man and woman are severed before they even connect  to a degree where you may be terrified of your own child as they are actively encouraged to report any deviant parental behaviours  So our hero Winston is in big trouble when he feels himself questioning Big Brother s methods and actions  On meeting Julia  he believes he has found a kindred spirit and they fall in love  But can they escape BB s ever watchful eye This is such a powerful book  and in my opinion  a work of genius first to devise this terrifying new world  and second to make the pure evil of the Party so gripping  realistic and page turning  that I couldn t go to sleep until I knew how it ended  I don t want to say too much or give anything away  but I ve never read such a brilliant personification of insanity and corruption  Finally  the Afterword where Orwell explores the language of the Party  Newspeak  is truly fascinating and made all the hairs stand up on my arms  Pure and unadulterated genius  this book should be read by everyone  as soon as possible  What s in your Room 101 Please see my full review at http   www bibliobeth wordpress com Amazingly relevant 64 years later  I ve been avoiding this book for decades  and I m not sure why  This book could easily have been written and published today  Orwell was a visionary  E  difficile  almeno per me  parlare di questo libro  In quanto  qualsiasi cosa io dica  non gli rendera mai la giustizia che merita  E  un libro meraviglioso  che ti riempie e ti fa riflettere moltissimo  e per questo vi dico  leggetelo  E  soprattutto  riflettete su quanto leggete perche e agghiacciante  non solo leggere di questa societa  ma anche come questo libro  per certi aspetti  possa essere attualizzato alla realta  Libro consigliatissimo  Debo decir que desde que lei  Animal Farm  me converti en un fanatico de Orwell y debo esto a que como Venezolano  no puedo evitar sorprenderme al pensar que como libros ya escritos hace tanto tiempo describan la realidad que vive Venezuela con la implementacion del Socialismo  comunismo  del siglo XXl que trajo el regimen de Chavez  Como ya me lo habia imaginado  1984 no fue la excepcion al momento de impresionarme Habiendo dicho esto  me tomo el atrevimiento decir que esta novela deberia estar en la categoria de terror  no dejan de sorprenderme las similitudes de la realidad que tienen Oceania y su poblacion y Venezuela y su poblacion influenciada por la ideologia implantada por El Partido en el primer caso y el regimen chavista en el segundo  la represion que hay por parte del Ministerio del Amor  las mentiras por parte del Ministerio de la Abundancia y el ministerio de la Verdad entre otras cosas    O a lo mejor no deberia de sorprenderme tanto que Orwell describa tan bien estas realidades porque la historia ya nos ha mostrado esto  recordando el comunismo de Stalin  Mao Tse Tung  los Castro y Chavez entre otros  Definitivamente el comunismo es el mismo donde sea   Recomiendo este libro como un  must read   me ha marcado definitivamente  Y me pregunto   Sabria Orwell que este libro seria usado como un manual de instrucciones  Porque da la impresion de que lo han estado usando de esa manera  Hahahaluego de leer este libro tendre unas cuantas frases dando vueltas por mi cabeza un largo tiempo   Aquel que controla el pasado controla el futuro  Aquel que controla el presente controla el pasado  LA GUERRA ES LA PAZ  lA EXCLAVITUD ES LA LIBERTAD  LA IGNORANCIA ES LA FUERZA  I do not recall having read a novel that delivered such an on point and direct structure of both plot and words  Extremely well crafted  Nineteen Eight Four is a book like no other in both centralized terror of a potential reality and the total dedication to the creation of a novel with nothing irrelevant   be it excess words or events   Nineteen Eighty Four is a profound novel  It is also a terrifying observation of an alternative history build on mass oppression  pure ignorance  hypocritical concepts and a world that is fundamentally flawed in every aspect  This is a terrifying novel with a devastating conclusion  It took about 80 pages for me to really get interested in this book  and it was difficult for me to focus while reading it  I m not sure if it was due to outside distractions or not  but I like to think so  since I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It s been on my list of books to read for years  but I finally found the motivation to read it when it was assigned in my college English class  It s a nice change from the  happy endings  you typically receive from any story  and the plot is quite though provoking  While reading this book  you can t help but examine the world you currently live in and compare it to the world of the book  It s almost terrifying to see how similar the two are becoming every year  I feel that this book is a must read for everyone  and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that does not have a happy ending and for a story that will really make them think  Horrible   brilliantly written  It will rob you of your humanity  Da sempre ne sento parlar bene da amici e finalmente mi sono deciso a leggere questo libro   anzi capolavoro   Che dire  Orwell e stato un visionario nella descrizione di questa societa distopica   tantissimi aspetti ci riguardano da vicino   dal controllo pervasivo di tutte le forme di comunicazione  basti leggere Sotto controllo  Edward Snowden e la sorveglianza di massa di Glenn Greenwald per capire cosa fanno e cosa possono fare con le tecnologie odierne per controllare chiunque   all esigenza di mantenere conflitti latenti e una situazione di paura  contro nemici talvolta creati da noi stessi  di fronte a cui le persone comuni sono pronte a cedere liberta  di azione e di pensiero  vedi Patrioct Act in USA dopo l 11 Settembre   ad un oligarchia che principalmente non opera per il bene comune ma per preservare il suo potere  Anche la massima  Chi controlla il Passato  controlla il Futuro  chi controlla il Presente  controlla il Passato  e di estrema attualita  lo si vede dai libri di storia  scritti sempre dal punto di vista del vincitore di turno  ai media pronti a distorcere eventi del passato e del presente per compiacere il governo o le lobby del momento  L Impero invisibile  La vera cospirazione di chi governa il mondo e L Istituto Tavistock  L organismo occulto che controlla le nostre menti di Daniel Estulin  Una lettura consigliatissima  anche per i giovani  tanto che sarebbe opportuno leggerla alle scuole superiori  ma creare persone formate e coscienti dei pericoli di un controllo cosi totale del pensiero  dei media e della societa non e sicuramente in cima alla lista delle priorita della scuola odierna  I didn t realize the first time I read it how much this book sorta cheats  The 1st third is a bit of scene setting  which is fine  The 2nd third is a lot of the plot progression  except for  the book  part  which is pure explanation of everything that has happened before hand like it s the stage directions at the beginning of the play  which is weird  Then the third book is essentially an ironic essay written in dialogue  Those are three cool parts to read  so I didn t mind reading it  and thus the five stars  but I get the feeling I would hate this book if I had to read it in one session How did it take me so long to read this  Maybe the most disturbing thing I ve ever read  Totally amazing  1984 was actually a very good read  I find the way that government uses it s citizens to be reminiscent of the most feared powers from the past present and frankly the future  Your on a path that goes left or right  on the left is a field of flowers with your family  friends   and other loved ones  and on the right is the government that you know is evil  Using various aspects like fear  language  and violence the government side looks more and more tempting and safe  But there s something odd you notice on the left side  2 2 4 and on the right side  2 2 5  You pick the left and try to stay there and also lead others that way  but the various ways the government uses to hear you  telescreens and thoughtpolice for example  catch you rebelling against government  You know were not at war with anyone  that 2 2 does not equal 5  that government did not invent everything  Big Brother is a hoax  and you remember a time before the  revolution   But the Ministry of Love using torture and the dreaded  Room 101  makes you give up your loved ones  think government invented everything  Big Brother does not only exist but you love him  and that 2 2 can indeed equal five if need be  So the question remains which way do you go  This is the story that Winston takes around all these obstacles and questions  Very good book glad I read this for school because otherwise I don t think I would have ever heard of it  5 out of 5 stars      that s enough blathering for me today  PS Just as good the second time around    lHrb hy lslm

 as old as 1984 may be  its context seems as relevant as any satirical novel written in the 21st century  Reading the novel at first felt like reading just another dystopian book whose ideas were out of this world  Nevertheless  as the narrator continues to describe Winston Smith s feelings regarding the Party and after we are given a little taste of the Party s intentions  it is not difficult to associate the extreme measures it takes with those that today s governments certainly use  Every part of this book has very interesting elements  the beginning hooks the reader by describing the unbelievable dystopian world in which Winston lives  the middle of the novel gets very exciting as the plot intensifies  and the end makes the reader think  analyze and process the overall meaning of George Orwell s novel  The descriptions and explanations that Orwell uses in 1984 are not boring or excessive  in fact  Orwell s style of writing and of explaining is so interesting that there were many times when I thought that I couldn t agree more with a specific statement  This book is great for readers who enjoy analyzing and critical thinking  which are two characteristics that are of big help when interpreting the hidden meaning of 1984  jwrj  wrwyl  kn Sdyqy fy msft lsfr lTwyl   knt rwyth tmhWd ly Tryq lHy   rwy  nsnyW  bHt   sysy _qtSdy   ttHdth  n l nZm  ldykttwry  wmd  bsh th  1984 is one of the most famous dystopias ever written  And with good reason    this book is incredibly intense  Orwell s picture of the future describes the boot and its stamping of a human face in all the detail necessary to frighten everyone from the pessimistic misanthropes to the idealistic optimists  The book could only be written from the most profound conviction that such a future could indeed happen  a conviction motivated by societies where Big Brother already existed in large part when Orwell wrote the book  But 1984 has become a touchstone of our culture in the way that it functions as a warning  Can we prove the optimist in Orwell correct  and proceed to take the book s warning as a corrective for certain tendencies in our own society  We have survived the bloodiest century in human history without the final annihilation of nuclear war  and without the kind of Big Brother society envisioned by Orwell  although that is debatable  At this point  I would like to say that a self righteous society that ignores warnings like Orwell s in 1984 frightens me Political tragedies  such as this  are published constantly  but 1984 is one of the few that has remained timeless and will always be regarded as not only historical  but also prophetic  The book reminds us of what has gone wrong  what can go wrong  and what will go wrong when government becomes all powerful  It is because of this political and social insight that 1984is one of the best books of all time And to conclude here are few lines from the novel which always make me shudder in fear or perhaps awe     Reality exists in the human mind  and nowhere else   says O Brien          In the mind of the Party  which is collective and immortal  Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth    so u think u have written a fictional story let me tell u you were wrong u have exactly told us what was coming surveillance screens yes we have them in 2014 they r called satellites your country is watching all the world by them the US is watching your country by them any cellphone call is recorded for 319 million person in the US according to NSA which we can call Thought Police plus FBI CIA MI6 a k a Love Ministry the torture you mentioned was amazing but after 60 years we have more Guantanamo prison and all kinds of torture never come to your dreams Abu Gharib prison in Iraq the minipicture of Guantanamo and other prisons and prisoner we still don t know where they areThe falsification of history is still here we have Jews telling us the Palestinian land is theirs and some of us is believing like monkeysWeak Of Hatred we also have one but it s one day here called 9 11 where all the world is cursing Isalm for something he didn t commit At last I fu kin  love your reality man wSf ry   llmjtm  lshmwly      tslm  ydk y  m jwrj the book always scares the poo out of me I was surprised in my second reading of 1984 in that this book is hardly a novel  but more of an essay of the possibilities and eventualities of an end result of a planned socialist society  Government surveillance is merely a tiny  yet necessary  component of the story  It s interesting that someone may rally against their certain issue  say government surveillance  yet simultaneously insist on some other form of controlling other people  Insistence on agreement for the sake of agreement  in all things  is the greater enemy I don t know why I decided to read  listen to  1984 at the same time as The Road to Serfdom  but found it interesting that Winston s reading of  Goldstein s  book was essentially a reworked copy of The Road to Serfdom  If The Road to Serfdom is the blueprints  1984 is the hypothetical construction But now I wonder what Goodreads  aggregator will do to people who have self confessed to reading theses two books in the future  I m sure they ve got a big ol  rat cage ready for my face  Just as chilling and poignant  maybe moreso  as when I first read it fifteen years ago  The build up is so subtle and gentle that the climax hits like a sledgehammer  n knt bd th mn ftr  bs zhqt mnh wTwl m n knt bqrh lHj  lwHyd  lly fbly  yh dh   lklm dh msh Hqyqy   mfysh Hd

como 13 14 anos  lo pedi en la biblioteca del colegio sin saber mucho de este libro  Lo unico que sabia era que era libro favorito de un artista con el que estaba fascinada en ese tiempo    jajaj  Lo lei y recuerdo no haber entendido mucho pero si recuerdo que el libro era muy intimidante y me dejo con una sensacion de miedo  En esta re lectura del libro quede con la misma sensacion  Siendo este libro uno de los precursores del genero distopico  creo que es uno de los mejores junto con Fahrenheit 451 y bueno ya es considerado un clasico en la literatura asi que eso ya dicta mucho  Tenemos como protagonista a Winston Smith  un hombre ya adulto que vive en un mundo terriblemente aterrador  Leer las circunstancias en las que el vivia me daban mucha rabia  sentia que estaba viviendo con el ahi mismo y me sentia tan frustrada   fue super loco  Y es que vivir con el Socing  con el Hermano Mayor  teniendo que aprender a hablar nuevalengua  la Habitacion 101  y TODOS los Ministerios    Quien podria vivir en un mundo asi sin volverse loco Se considera que este libro posee un horror logico y eso tiene mucho sentido ya que todo dentro de la historia tiene una cierta coherencia  Existen muchas cosas que si uno se las plantea  no es algo tan imposible  Si analizamos la construccion de la nuevalengua veremos que es asi  La nuevalengua estaba hecha para disminuir el alcance pensamiento  Por ejemplo  si tenemos las palabras luz y oscuridad  que son antonimos  eliminamos oscuridad pero decimos  noluz  que vendria a significar lo mismo   Para que tener mas palabras en nuestro vocabulario  Para mi gusto  todo en este libro esta bien pensado   lo que no le quita el miedo que genera  Este no es un libro para ser feliz  es un libro donde uno puede cuestionarse muchas cosas  El autor se centra y quiere que el lector se centre en los aspectos morales  en el mundo construido mas que en otra cosa  El final lo dejara con una sensacion extrana  a mi me paso   tal vez hayan partes que no tengan mucha entretencion y que quieran saltarselas pero es al menos un libro que tienen leer en la vida  Yo quede loca con el final  no me lo esperaba y esas son cosas que se agradecen    Dark  claustrophobic and downright terrifying  This is Orwell s masterpiece  a novel which has given the world so many concepts and phrases it s hard to imagine a literary or cultural landscape without it  It feels so familiar it would be easy to start writing it off  claiming that the plot doesn t really tie together  that the characters don t behave the way one would want them to  that the global political situation is absurd and that the apparent non existence of Big Brother as a physical presence undermines The Party  Well  that doesn t work here Unfortunately for the future of humanity  Orwell s points are so logical  well thought through and ingeniously argued that one can t help but be convinced that this could easily come to pass  Cameras everywhere  Check  A leader whose face everyone knows but who is complexly inaccessible  Check  Contracting  ie b stard s ng  the language people are allowed to use  Check  Keeping poor people in check by pumping saccharine music into their lives  Check  check  check  We re not there yet  despite what paranoid people may like to suggest  but the world of Big Brother remains a very distinct possibility This is far and away the bleakest dystopic novel around   Brave New World  shows a relatively benign ruling class who control the population by keeping them in a permanently drugged up state   Fahrenheit 451  is set in a world where your chances of survival are infinitely greater if you don t find yourself in possession of a book   Nineteen Eighty Four  takes these motifs  and others  many stages further  Here  it s not the action so much as an observed subversive  thought  that marks one out for destruction  And while the ruling elites of the aforementioned books  and the other totalitarian regimes of the then contemporary world  may have started with a genuine desire to make their people s lives better  and view sustained periods of repression as a regrettable means to an end  The Party make no excuses  In fact  Winston s interrogator is outraged at any suggestion that their actions are for the people s own good   the only time he loses his cool in the entire book A point I hadn t noticed in previous readings  but which is absolutely crucial  is that there s no definitive proof that the events of the book even take place in the year of the title  But what can we expect  The Party have managed to systematically erase the past  so no one can be entirely sure where and when they are  Winston Smith may think 1984 is the year  but he s an unreliable narrator even before we factor in the merciless manipulation of Oceanic society that goes on here  As the book points out  if you can expunge the past  you can control it  and if you control the past you can control the present  and get people to believe anything you want them to  So what if the all pervading enemy territory keeps shifting  By removing any reference to there being a time when Oceania  wasn t  at war with one or the other rival bloc  no one can question it  or the reasons behind these shifting alliances Then there s the language    This was Orwell s pet hate  of course   twisting words and phrases so they lose all meaning and can be reshaped to form something else entirely  No surprise that this is The Party s chosen method of control  and very convincing it is too  Newspeak is a fascinating concept  and while I wouldn t suggest that this is exactly what our leaders are doing to us  I can t help but see this approach being taken in this day and age  Unintentionally  of course  But  as Orwell invites us to consider  imagine what would happen if someone did take that and use it as a means of control   This is a work of an immensely high standard  It s one of the most uncomfortable books ever written  but it really is essential reading  However much we may try to tell ourselves that this is a world that won t come to pass  Orwell argues his case so well that it feels very real  I don t like it  but we re not supposed to like it  I admire it very much indeed though Genuinely essential reading  What I missed while reading this book was a simple smile  It s dead serious from start to finish  I know that s the idea and any sense of humor would have spoiled the terror that it is supposed to depict  And yet I hoped  until the last page  that the mood would brighten up  even for a single moment  Maybe Orwell hoped for the same thing but he couldn t fulfill it  Some stories are bigger than their author and his readers  This is one such story  rwy  jmyl  ktbh rjl mtmkn jdan  d an wHbk an wlG  fkr

n tuqr   How does one write a book so terrifying and yet so simple  How does one describe terror at its purest form  How does one envision such a complex dystopia where everything seems so natural and real  In his novel 1984  Orwell introduces us to a world where even your thoughts do not belong to you  In his complex and highly intriguing world  terror has a new form  Mind Control  Everything that has been described is so natural and breathtaking  The concept of a thought police  the telescreens watching everyone all the time  The constant alteration of records to change the past completely  concepts of newspeak and doublethink  to think of all this back in 1948 is truly remarkable  What is most terrifying and brilliant about this novel is that it s based on real life events  The arrests of party leaders who are no longer trusted by the party   Stalin s midnight purges  The unperson concept  Again  ideas of USSR under Stalin  The hate speeches  Motivational speeches given in factories  The changing of alliances and alteration of past by destruction of records  Stalin s agreement with Nazi Germany The writing itself is brilliant and the concepts ingenious  The novel does not bore you anywhere despite having a complicated narrative and some concepts which need some time to be clearly grasped  The characters  Although very few  are well written and are  along with the plot  the backbone of this novel Recommended to anyone who loves classics or dystopia    It does not matter whether the war is going well or badly  All that is needed is that a state of war should exist   To imagine living in war  slavery  and ignorance all of your life   In this fictional novel  Orwell describes a world that is divided into 3 dominant regions  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia   but focusing mainly on Oceania  where The Party rules with hate and obsessed with power and control under the supervision of  The Brotherhood   where there is no way to scape it or fight it back   The creepy thing is that the novel was published in 1949 imagining the world in 1984  in which the concepts of it also can be noticed nowadays in 2015  Very dystopian  dark  and epic  Regardless of the repetition  it is worth reading  But remember one thing  Big Brother is watching you  There s nothing I can add to what anyone else has ever said about this book  Moving  dark  gripping  frightening and totally plausible It s not a book I d read again in a hurry  but it is definately a  must read before you die  experience   Este libro es    1984 es como    Fuck   Ni siquiera se como clasificarlo  Es A  Un libro de ciencia ficcionB  Una historia distopicaC  Un thriller psicologicoD  Una mera fantasiaE  Una muy acertada prediccion de un futuro no muy distanteF  Todas las anterioresMmm    creo que voy a elegir la opcion  F   En serio  este libro me volo la cabeza  no solo porque esta genialmente escrito  sino por la complejidad de su trama y la dualidad de que la misma sea a la vez increiblemente absurda y totalmente posible  Mientras lo leia no podia evitar pensar en cuanto de ello seriamos y somos capaces de hacer los hombres  Somos el unico animal en el planeta que aniquila y destruye a los de su propia especie por el solo hecho de que puede hacerlo  Incluso hallamos la manera de justificar nuestras acciones como nuestro derecho  Nuestro derecho de ser monstruos  Este libro me hizo reflexionar a la vez que me shockeaba como la re putisima madre  Es un relato sumamente inteligente y escalofriantemente realista acerca de la incesante busqueda de poder a cualquier costo  El poder como un medio y un fin Mejores citas  Hasta que no tengan conciencia de su fuerza  no se rebelaran  y hasta despues de haberse rebelado  no seran conscientes  Este es el problema  Si la igualdad humana ha de ser evitada para siempre  si los Altos  como los hemos llamado  han de conservar sus puestos de un modo permanente  sera imprescindible que el estado mental predominante sea la locura controlada  Te aplastaremos hasta tal punto que no podras recobrar tu antigua forma  Te sucederan cosas de las que no te recobraras aunque vivas mil anos  Nunca podras experimentar de nuevo un sentimiento humano  Todo habra muerto en tu interior        Estaras hueco  Te vaciaremos y te rellenaremos de    nosotros  Este es un libro muy inteligente escrito por un hombre que fue probablemente un genio y espero no un profeta    Es un clasico que hay que leer  Oh wow   this s a  Double Plus Good  book  one of the most terrifying I have ever read  and yet brilliant   YOU ARE THE DEAD  made me literally jump off my seat and throw the book lol  It might be written for year 1984 but somehow I feel it s still valid to these days  with another Big Brother  Inner Party and Room 101  I have to admit that the ending left me feeling somewhat depressed  I m not into anything political  but I really do appreciate this book   lHrb hy lslmlHry  hy l bwdy ljhl hw lqw  One of the great political novels of the twentieth century  this book tells the story of a totalitarian future in which Big Brother is watching you  The recent Snowden revelations show that the political tendencies identified by Orwell are alive and kicking  I would disagree with a lot of what Orwell has to say  for example  he believes that while we are free to say that two plus two does not equal five  we have not been conquered by Big Brother  and are still free inside ourselves somewhere  This may or may not be so  but Orwell s analysis is always fascinating  deeply troubling and ultimately thought provoking  A great book  Mindblowing  At first  you ll get bored reading this book  Wait until chapter 17  This book generally describes Orwell s concept about a world where big power is ruling the life of every person involved in the territory of this power  No one can ever escape the big power  even your imagination of escaping is an impossible thing to do  The world  which people perceived as a normal world  could be a big scenario which got twisted every time the power needs to do it in order to maintain the power  This book content amazing concept and explanation of the concept  More amazingly  this kind of world could be the world we live in now  I first read this book in the 1970s and I really did not get it at the time  The world was much different and I guess I could not see it ever getting to the point that there was one Big Brother and he would spend the time watching us  So much for my naivety However  after reading the book a second time  I believe Mr  Orwell was off by thirty of forty years  The book should have been called 2014 or 2024  It appears by my math that the world is dangerously close to Mr  Orwell s prediction  Capitalism is now considered by many to be a bad thing while socialism has grown in popularity  Many people have lost their abilities to critically think and spend their wasteful time in social media sites  watching the idiot tube  or playing video games  The government is now entwined in everything we do from healthcare to highways and has been caught spying on people and using the IRS as a bludgeoning club for those who disagree with their politics and policies  Yes  you were right  Mr  Orwell  Remarkably well written  a great classic that I hope is not prophetic  Two thumbs way up   Um livro que me incomodou desde o primeiro dia de leitura ate o ultimo  Passei por insonia  devaneios e outras perturbacoes  mesmo quando nao estava lendo  Diferente dos estilos que gosto  1984 nao tem frases belas e bem elaboradas como os textos de Wilde ou Garcia Marquez  A perfeicao e o incomodo esta em um sentimento pesado carregado pelas ideias  mais do que pelas palavras  Excelente e muito agonizante    lm tkn hdhh lTwf  Gyr dwry

as  Big Brother   Even upon entering a building  a poster oversees him reading  big brother is watching you   Orwell  2   Currently  the area he lives in  known as Oceania  is in war with its counterpart  Eurasia  However  majority of the public does not acknowledge as to why they at war  Winston believes that there is a way out of the system  in totalitarian regime  To his dismay  the  thought  police  follow every word he says and even writes within his journal  Later on within the book  it is revealed that Winston gains feelings for a young woman named Julia but he cannot expose these feelings in the public because according to the government  they are unacceptable  Winston is fed up with the restriction the government has unlawfully imposed upon its people  Winston is part of the Ministry of Truth and desires to break free from the governmental power that holds him back from who he really is  He hears about an organization known as the  Brotherhood   This excites Winston as he finally feels as if he has found the right people to work with  A man named O Brien leads Winston on to believe that he is aligning himself with the same beliefs as Winston  However  this is proven false  O Brian turns out to be a member of the thought police  This meant that everything that Winston has told him  including his romance with Julia is at stake  As a result  Winston is taken in confinement to be tortured  Various cruel acts are done to him  In the end  when Winston loses his last bit of tolerance he realizes that he must  interpose another human being  by which he means blaming it on someone else  He decides to finally screams  do it Julia   Orwell  286   In the end  when Winston is sitting by himself  he is fully content with his life and has love for the Party  This is another dystopian theme in which if the government was to put an indivual in confinement  they are able to  get inside you  as Julia as said  Orwell  290   This is an insight on how an individual s dignity can be taken away even by a simple statement  just repeated over a few times especially in dire situations like this one  This can be proven true especially at the end of the novel because Julia states that a person is always selfish because whenever a disastrous action is being done to them   you want it happen to the other person  because at that time  all one cares is about their own wellbeing  Orwell  292   This book was published in 1949  which was close to the cold war and where communism was under the spotlight  The Western hemisphere  especially regarding Americans  strongly resisted communism  This is because the United States has prided itself of being a representative democracy in which the people are in the  land of the free  and have  free speech  as a natural  human right  Orwell himself is very experienced in writing this book because since he had  witnessed the danger of absolute political authority in an age of advanced technology  by traveling to England and Spain around in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War where he  witnessed firsthand the nightmarish atrocities committed by fascist political regime   In addition  Orwell was present when Adolf Hitler s and Joseph s Stalin of political authority was prevalent which led him to despise it even further  Sparknotes com lit 1984 context  With all of this in mind  Orwell was a very credible man in regards of writing a novel that is centered around a tyrannical government I really did enjoy this book because it was so well written  With every detail of Winton s thoughts regarding the government  I felt agitated myself  However  I still am curious as to why Oceania is at war since that reason still remains unexplained  I acknowledge that the people do not know but because this was in third person narrative  it would have been helpful to know this information  As a person who enjoys reading about history  Orwell has successfully summarized the majority of the American s people fear of a tyrannical government  He has successfully exaggerated the idea of how a government can harm its people  However  I am still wondering how the economy worked as well as other political details and how the government was structured  Orwell s book covered not only political issues but also physiological ones  It was very heart breaking to see how a human can be brainwashed into believing fictions information merely because another person is forcing them to believe it  For example  when Winston is taken into confinement  O Brien questions him by asking  freedom is freedom to say that two plus two make four  and to that Winston agrees and he is punished for it because O Brien s goal is to fully have him brainwashed  Orwell  249   It makes sense to the reader that this statement is not mathematically logical  however  that fact does not concern the Party  Instead  their goal is just to brainwash the public and for them to  convert  any people who do not conform to their society  Overall  Orwell shows how torture can truly break a person  In addition  one last element that I really sympathized with was when Julia and Winston see each other a month later after confinement and they no longer have feelings towards each other  The torturing and conditioning they both underwent both  broke  them as people  In the beginning of the novel  Winston Smith was a hopeful man  however by the end  he is just another dull being  It puts into question how easily it is to strip someone of their creativity and thinking  It makes me wonder how media in western society can brainwash the public and we could not even know it or even realize it  This book in general puts into question what kind of reality people build and how easily it may be torn down by authority  It highlights how authority only believes those who obey are the only ones who are intelligent and those who rebel are seen as trouble makers  I personally enjoyed this book  although it was tragic at the end  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Age of Anxiety  history post World War Two  the Cold War  or anyone interested in dystopian societies   If I remember correctly  this was my third attempt to read this book in its entirety and I was happy to learn that my critical thinking skills have improved quite a bit since I was 15  This time I did not get stuck at Goldstein s manifesto as I had in the past  but ploughed right through it  I found  1984  fascinating and thought provoking  As I read  I felt simultaneously relieved not to be living in the dystopian world of  1984   and terrified that I am actually living in a more subtle version of that world  When Orwell wrote this novel  it was meant as a critique of Communism  but today many of its concepts  The Thought Police  Big Brother is watching  etc   seem very of the moment  In fact  it seems like Orwell has written a piece that is timeless in its social and political commentary  I have to admit that this book left me feeling somewhat depressed  but it also left me thinking about it days after I d finished reading  I would put it in that category of books that everyone should read  lytny qr t hdhh lrwy  qbl lthwr  lmSry  rbm knt wfrt  ly tlk lHyr  lTwyl  wdhlk ly s lqtl rbm knt  drkt  shy kthyr  mbkr wrbm  yD  nny lm  kn l fhmh wknt s ml mnh w trkh wlknh lan jt ltw kd ly

which is either to criticise or praise this book  I shall make use of this in a more  in my opinion  useful fashion  stating  some of  the arguments that both the  yaysayers  and  naysayers  use in their  dis approval of this boringly excellent work of fiction Those who would gladly die with this book in their hands  the majority  have before them a mighty arsenal of arguments  First off  it is Orwell s great insight and foresight  as it were  for what is to come  whether a quarter of a century after his death or a quarter of a millenium  With unparalleled skill does he  subtly  albeit his way of presenting the backstory is quite  straightforward    present what is in store for us  and how our freedom  which we have acquired at so great a cost  will crumble and succumb to the state of semi slavery as is described in the novel  Orwell lays strong emphasis on the inertness which will come  if we bring ourselves to such a state  and even greater in importance is the reason which will have led us to it   the same inertness  And this is the reason why there are so many advocates of this novel   1984 is in fact a help guide  a how to manual  Its use  To instruct us what will take place in case we do what we have grown so fond of doing  nothingOn the other side  the other side of the great acid lake of boiling reviews  we have those who deem this story a bland and unpoetical political babble  which should have been preserved in an academic newspaper rather than disguising itself in the greatest of literary forms   the novel  The prosaic dystopian history of Oceania and Winston s transfiguration and re de  transfiguration  are not the elements a  story  needs  Though I usually refrain from using reviews and opinions by other reviewers  the best way to describe the utter wrongness of this book is to use Vladimir Nabokov s words   A novel has never been so molested and used for other goals than art as it has been done by the horrific  1984  My opinion  A breathtaking story of ideas  which is  as it goes with every book out there  wanting in some aspects  but on the whole  I would humbly describe it as   hmmm   the stuff which defines what we are today  Period  tnfrnZr khbyrdwgnh bwry dmbrdr bzrgbdwn shkh ykhy z khtb hy mndgr trykh hst w qdymy nkhwhd shd  mn b khwndnsh hm ldht brdm w hm mw bh tnm rst shd I make a point to read this book every few years and every few years it freaks me out all over again  It s troubling to see aspects of your reality mimicking such an alarming work of fiction If nothing else  it is a reminder of the value of our freedoms and why our forefathers worked so hard to preserve those freedoms in our country  This is my second book for Orwell  Well  technically it s my first book   but I read it years ago and in Arabic so   m  nh Hsyt Hly  wl mr   qr  lktb nsy  kthyr shGlt mhm  fyh   Okay  that s not why I m here  Dqr t Hkm  l rlf wldw mrswn mr   byqwl    lktb hy lathr l kthr bq  l  lzmn   w bn  l  m sbq fnh bnqdr n tbr rwy  1984  hm lathr ldby  lmwjwd   I m sorry I don t know the exact words in English so I had to write it in Arabic  deal with it   D  Note  This book  as a human being with a mind  you have to read it and reread it and reread it  Such novel should be taught in Arabic schools wallah  but after what happened in Egypt  If it s true or not  they will banned it not teach it   Beware  this is a scary book  Orwell explores the evils man is capable of had totalitarian ideologies succeeded  Unfortunately we see far too many many elements of resemblance with life today  whether you live in CCTV crazed UK or overly censored Saudi  However there is more to this book than just the story  Understanding Orwell s life and the experiences he had as well as the overall feeling at the time helps the reader better understand the 20th century  If you intend to enjoy a good novel or go on quest to decipher the 20th century  this book will be a great companion   I ve known the story of 1984 my whole life   For as long as I can remember  my Mum used to tell me about 1984 and how Brave New World by Aldous Huxley was better   I ve always known about Newspeak  Big Brother and thought crime and I watched the film starring John Hurt several times Strangely enough though  I never read the book up until now   I guess I believed that because it was a classic  it would be too difficult for me to read   Well  it is an extremely easy book to read and it is exciting  romantic  interesting and as relevant today as it was in 1949   This is a timeless  magnificent book but it is really creepy to see that we didn t learn the lessons that Orwell was trying to teach us For the uninitiated  1984 is a novel set in a dystopian future where communism spread uncontested across Europe at the end of World War II   This lead to the development of a totalitarian force governing England and the United States   The Party controls every aspect of both living and working and party members are watched and kept under constant surveillance at every moment of their days   The ultimate aim of the Party is to control thoughts and their greatest tool in achieving this is to control reality an memories by altering all written and broadcast materials to suit their propaganda stories   The population is kept in a state of near squalor with severe rationing continuing far longer than is necessary and relations between people are kept to a minimum   Sexuality and passion are completely controlled and outlawed 1984 is a true masterpiece and I would certainly recommend that everyone read the book   at least once  Amazing  amazingly terrifying  The book keeps you in a really tense mood  especially in the third part   A society where thinking is a crime and privacy is a privilege submerges almost all its members to worship a so said infallible party  led by a ubiquitous figure that is Big Brother  The things that struck me the most were the reshaping of the past and the control that the Party had over the minds of its people  Everybody was living under the impression that what is now has always and will always be  therefore having no element of comparison for their current living standard  The Party was taking care of all the documents that could have proven the existence of a different past  be it a month or even years before the present moment  Controlling the documents and the people s minds  they had complete control over the past  since these two are the only ways in which past events exist Worse than the Inquisition  the Ingsoc  English Socialism  aims to obtain a complete victory over the so called political enemies whose worse crime is  usually  thoughtcrime  Not only do they kill them  but they also change their entire way of thinking through various ways of torture  making them finally admit that reality is a subjective thing and it is completely controlled by the Party  I was surprised to find the idea of relativism in Orwell s book and I found it quite fascinating  going beyond the fact that I have no idea if to agree to it or not  or partially agree  Probably the last option Even if the writing style was not amazing  what mattered were the ideas  the brilliant ideas  War as a way of keeping the population poor enough not to mentally evolve enough to start a revolution  diminishing the number of words from a language as a way of limitating the area of though were equally awesome and mind changing ideas for me  And the ending  completely hopeless  perfect  I d have analysed the political implications of the book too  if I had made any clear idea on them  which I obviously didn t  Dystopia  Disturbing  I was hardly able to read through the middle chapters of Part 3  It was all so grotesque  the imagery  the man himself  the change his mind was going through  the things a collectivist group is capable of  Ew  If that s the right emotion Parts 1 and 2 are shocking  hard to believe  fascinating and frightening all at the same time  It s hard to believe that people would exist in a society as the one depicted  but at the same time  it is easy to understand why there is no revolution  When you have no one to compare yourself to  you tend to resign yourself to what you have  take pleasure in the few privileges accorded on you by the power above  the Party  Big Brother The book by Emmanuel Goldstein is perhaps my favorite part of the book  OR rather  the most logical  I don t know  but it made sense  The explanations   War is Peace  and  Ignorance is Strength   these slogans are enraging when in the Part 1 of the book but they make sense in Part 3 The world makes sense once you know why it is the way it is  I had actually planned to read another Dystopian novel  The Man in the High Castle  I am not sure if I would now  Stay away from Dystopia because it is disturbing  Nah  this is probably one of the few books that people read books for  HSrtny hdhh lrwy  lftr  Twyl    klm ftHt ktban  w qr t mqlan  jdh

   qtbsty hnhttp   emtiazalnahhal blogspot com 20     4 5 tenia grandes expectativas  para el libro pero aun asi me encanto este libro llego  ahacerme sentir impotente  vivir en un mundo asi tan controlado me parece muy descabellado y el final fue tan deprimente      I apologize ahead of time because I m almost certain that this review is going to be tough for me to write and probably a little all over the place  First off  this book left me absolutely speechless at the end  Every time I tried to describe it to my boyfriend the only description I could come up with is  crazy    which means everything from  extreme    disturbing    shocking  and well  crazy   It s not written in any sort of fancy way and it s not a masterpiece based on that  I think it s more important how it is written in such a plain way  after all it s partially a warning and needs to be understood  Once you get started you ll find that the words have the ability to sting and stick with you  even though they are plain  I can t say I liked the characters Winston and Julia  especially not Julia  but they represented two sides of the same coin and it was important to see  One was a rebel for personal gain and the other was a rebel who thought of the future  It was also kind of shocking to see how animalistic and yet some how machine like the Outer Party truly was  and completely insane how much power the Party truly wielded over it s  followers   I think the most shocking thing to me was that everything in this book seems so   crazy  but not so crazy that it could never be accomplished  To think that this was written 1948 and yet see similarities  no matter how small  to some present day governments makes part of me kind of freeze  A few quotes that really hit me   We do not merely destroy our enemies  we change them   There is something monstrous in changing the enemy only to destroy them  something that can hardly be described  Not only are they going to remove you from this Earth as a being  but they are going to remove  you  as the person you were   Until they become conscious they will never rebel  and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   It s one of those vicious circles that requires immense amount of thought  At first you see that maybe they can never truly be conscious  and then you see that to become conscious is to rebel  Now I m going to go sit somewhere and take a lot of deep breaths   This is an amazingly prescient novel  When I first read it  I thought it was science fiction   dark  but   a bit like Kafka   utterly compelling  Then  later  I read it again and perceived it as a political satire  Some of it was   in a gallow s humor way   quite amusing  such as when one of the minor characters is asked what he thinks of the disgusting food they are forced to eat and he says  double plus good   At school I was told it was an indictment of Soviet communism  that  Big Brother  was Stalin etc  Then  much later  I read  1984  a third time and realized it was about the UK   not Soviet Russia  By then I d also read more of George Orwell s writings and a little about his life  He was a son of the British Empire  Educated at Eton   a top Ivy League type school   to become an officer in the system that controlled the empire and  after he left school  he went to India to work as a colonial police officer where his experiences made him interested in the system he was serving   1984  expresses what Orwell spent his life finding out  the spirit  philosophy and methodology behind the British Empire  The reason the book was so prescient is because truth is always prescient  His understanding of how the British Empire worked applies to all empires  You can go back as far as Plato s  Republic  to see the roots of it  How can a small elite control an empire  Well  in  1984  you see how it s done  Yes  the old Soviet Union did it too  Today  China and the United States are doing it  The European Union is doing it  The government deceit  media propaganda  personality cults  wars  economic state control  paramilitary police  indoctrination of children in schools  demonizing and elimination of dissidents  false flag terrorism  and caste system portrayed in  1984  are present today in how our societies are controlled  George Orwell understood government   what it s afraid of  what it wants  and its methods and strategies  Everyone should read this book and become enlightened about the nature of centralized governments   Inacreditavel  brilhante  genial  indescritivel  Um livro que nos faz refletir a respeito da nossa propria fragilidade  Nunca vi nada igual  nada parecido  Talvez tenha sido a obra mais surpreendente que eu ja li   Quanto mais inteligencia  menos sanidade mental   Cool dystopia For me the book changed while reading it  From science fiction to a love story to a utopia and ending as a dystopia   I especially like the idea of doublethink including the fact that the three lines war is peaceignorance is strengthslavery is freedomactually makes sense  This is simply one of the best books ever written  I even got my girlfriend  who is not a fan of sci fi or speculative fiction  to read it and by the end of it she was crying at the injustice and bleakness of it all  She expressed clearly and emotionally what I felt reading it  a want to throw the book away  but an almost magic drawing to the book making me pick it up again and continue reading about the inhumanity and cruelness of Orwell s dystopia  If you haven t read you must  I am convinced that you become a better human being by doing so    This was the first title I read on my new Kindle and the Kindle experience was fine  I added one of the Kindle covers and it s easy to hold and use  I downloaded 1984 from the Kindle store in just a few seconds  I first read 1984 in the early 60s when I was in the 7th or 8th grade  I re read it in the year 1984 because it struck me as very appropriate at the time  So  this was my 3rd reading and I feel that I saw a lot of things this time that I missed before  I am a fan of science fiction and 1984 is essentially a science fiction story  so it would naturally appeal to me  but it s also much more  This is an extremely well written novel  Orwell s use of imagery  metaphor  and simile is masterful  giving his descriptions a life of their own which makes the reader really feel what s going on in the story  Winston  Julia  and O Brien come alive in this story despite being very different from us and living very different lives from ours  Also  the dialog is fascinating  The political interchanges between Winston and O Brien during Winston s  rehab  are so compelling that both sides of the debate can be seen and appreciated  in spite of the underlying scary nature of O Brien s side   1984 was published in 1949 and Orwell died just a few months later  Before I read this book the first time I already had a vague idea of what it was about  having already read Animal Farm  Imagine what reaction the first readers in  say  1950  had  This novel would have had a startling and horrifying effect   I m increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars  Read it again  you ll like it  I came across this book by reading a tweet from Anonymous  the hacktivist group  It said   1984 was a warning  not a fucking guide I m going to take this book as the idea that it represents and not how it is  built   First of all  it is terrifying  Not the  holy shit just wet my pants  kind of scary  but the  holy mother of jesus this is so damn real  kind of scary  And I say this because damn it   we ve never been far away from being 1984  but we re closer to it each day  A totalitarian society  where WAR IS PEACE  which is kind of accurate now a days mind you  We live under the constant threat of a war  we live to be prepared for war  and that my friends  is not peace  because war is the  normal state   FREEDOM IS SLAVERY and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH  strength for the party  that is   There is  thought crime   meaning thinking against the party  There is the Thought Police  and telescreens that watch and hear you   always  A small twitch or trace of consciousness and you re done for  All that we know is human is constricted so you re just an automaton      It is a world where it is impossible to have a trace of humanity left or else it will be stripped away from you by psychological manipulation and physical torture  I have come across many reviews about this book saying its just another book fearing for Totalitarism influenced by the cold war  and or Stalin s form of ruling  But I honestly  honestly believe that more than that  it IS a warning  It is a wake up call  even if we can do nothing to stop it  it s telling us  hey  be prepared   I don t mean to sound like a conspiracy lunatic  but I truly believe this  There are some books that make you question your every move  your every need  This book did that for me  With every page that I read  I felt the world that the  Big Brother  built in front of my eyes  It is an excellent book in terms of storyline  ideas  writing style  characters and just about everything  The feeling that the author tried to create  the feeling of confinement and bondage was spilling out of every word  The way the scenes are set  the way the conversations occur   brilliant  I absolutely love this book There is a lot that I have recorded about this book in my journals  The entire journey is a wonderful one  The heartbreak at the end just added to the realism I experienced this book carried  Not a creamy climax  but I didn t need one to love this one  The lyrics of the song that plays in the background when the two leads converse at the end of the book   You sold me and I sold you    I felt it ringing in my ears  Every little thing the author wanted to create was all jumping out of the book for me  Very explicit  I saw it all and I loved it all   WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHNot merely the validity of experience  but the very existence of external reality  was tacitly denied by their philosophy  The heresy of heresies was common sense  And what was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise  but that they may be right  Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four  If that is granted  all else follows An amazing book  A great account of the future of humanity  George Orwell is a natural fiction writer  with an amazing ability to describe human tragedy    I put this novel off way longer than I should have  simply because I remembered not being of a fan of Orwell s   Animal Farm  when I read it in High School  I was also under the impression that this novel would be far too similar to  Fahrenheit 451  or  Brave New World   but I was wrong  In fact   1984  is the antithesis to  Brave New World  and they should be read back to back   I found the protagonist of 1984  Winston  to be tiresome and boring and the first 100 pages to be slow and frustrating with expected and contrite visions of a tyrannical socialistic society  no doubt conjured up because of World War II   but once Winston receives  The Book   the novel turns into a fantastic exploration of human consciousness and political influence  The second half of the novel is simply brilliant   You really have to take into account everything O Brien says  What is the past but a recollection of memories written down  And those who control the media distributed to the masses  government  the rich  essentially control the past  And those who control the past control the present and the future  Orwell obviously explains his philosophy much better than me  Just read this novel  It is frightening  but it forces you to become a more open minded person   One of the best books I ve ever read  Orwell is a genius  A real thinker  Don t read this book for the story or the characters but the subject matter  The author gives a chilling account of a future world where anything and everything is controlled by the govt  The books sort of open your eyes and makes you realise the importance of certain news events that you hear about everyday now   internet freedom  net neutrality  NSA snooping  section 377  Indian IT act  etc  etc  Kudos to Orwell for imagining the future so well  Even though he wrote it for 1984  the book is just as much relevant today and will always continue to be for the future generations  Do yourself a favour and read this masterpiece   1984 was a great book  It s a dystopian take on a future with a totalitarian government  The government is a form of communism capitalism mix  and is busy taking the worst qualities of the both of them  The main character s name is Winston Smith  and he s a decent character  He doesn t have any super complex personality or feelings  and actually  he s a really simple man  He s also kind of a mystery  but I like him nonetheless  He wasn t an annoying character that made me want to tear my eyes out  and because of that fact  he was enjoyable  3The kind of world they re in is very interesting  The book slowly unveils each fact and idea throughout the story  and it s like a castle of building blocks  Each block is being placed down to form the giant mega complex of Big Brother and the Party  Winston works at the Ministry of Truth  which is a giant work building made to formulate the past  Big Brother must always be right  on every wrongful fact and opinion  If Big Brother made a theory two years ago  and it came out wrong  it was Winston s job to go into the past and recreate it This is what firstly causes Winston s doubt of the party  He knows that nobody can recreate the past  It s not possible to alter the past  The past is the past  But if our memories can only be recorded in physical documentation and in our own minds  Big Brother can change whatever he likes  The story goes on about Winston and his love affair  and his small rebellions to the Party  He believes that something will change  and he dreams about the downfall of Big Brother This is definitely a book to read  It s a classic that has lived on for years  It s worth checking out  I was not bored at all when reading it for school  It was a little slow at times  but never uninteresting  When it gets slow  push yourself through it  and it all comes out at the end    BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU George Orwell saw the oppression of colonialism when he lived in India  and the horror of the Spanish Civil War  Then he witnessed the totalitarian regimes of Hitler and Stalin  This inspired him to write Nineteen Eighty Four about a totalitarian state that uses surveillance  mind control  perpetual war  rationing  persecution of independent thinking  and changes in the records of the past to control the people under its power Written in 1948  Orwell s vision of the future in 1984 is an Oceanic police state called Ingsoc which is ruled by Big Brother and the Inner Party  The Outer Party carries out tasks involving propaganda  revising history  creating the language of Newspeak which removes words associated with rebellion and the past  organizing Hate Week  and constant surveillance  The proles are the lowest class who are kept undernourished  uneducated  and do the menial jobs Winston Smith  an Outer Party member  works in the Ministry of Truth where his job is to revise history  If the past looks like a time of misery and trouble  then the present time under the Party s control looks like an improvement  When Winston rewrites the past to make the Party always look good  he also totally eliminates troublesome people from the records as if they had never been born  unpersons   If the Party tells the people the revised past over and over again through propaganda  it eventually seems like the truth  A party slogan is   Who controls the past controls the future  Who controls the present controls the past  A forbidden love relationship develops between Winston and Julia  Julia rebels against the Party for sexual pleasure  Winston is an intellectual  and believes in the freedom of the individual  His thoughts give the reader insight into how the Party establishes control over society  But their rebellions against the Party come with a high personal cost when they are captured by the Thought Police Orwell created a disturbing vision of the future  and many of his ideas have been seen in governments both before and after the book was published  He was also concerned about how technology would be used in surveillance of individuals  Orwell was brilliant in analyzing the many ways that the state can manipulate individuals and take away their freedoms ___________________________________________I visited the Peabody Essex Museum in Massachusetts a few years ago  They have a Chinese house from the Mao regime in China  There was a loudspeaker at the house which blared propaganda all day long  and the villagers were not allowed to turn it off  It reminded me of the constant propaganda coming from the telescreens in this book   Exista unele lucruri  propriile tale fapte  din care nu ti mai poti reveni  Ceva iti este ucis in piept  incinerat  cauterizat     Due piu due fara quattro solo finche lo vorremo noiInizio con un osservazione estemporanea  proprio non capisco perche  al liceo  nella quasi totalita dei casi venga fatto leggere La fattoria degli animali di Orwell  piuttosto che 1984  Credo che sia un libro che tutti gli adolescenti  una delle categorie piu tristemente schiave del conformismo  dovrebbero leggere per comprendere l importanza dell individualita  della memoria e del pensiero  1984 e un libro che e come un tremendo schiaffo in pieno volto  Raffigura un mondo in cui il passato non esiste perche puo venir modificato a proprio piacimento in qualsiasi momento  senza che rimanga traccia della manomissione  Un mondo in cui tutto puo succedere  poiche basta essere convinti di qualcosa perche essa sia reale  e convincere qualcuno di qualcosa e un operazione estremamente semplice  Un mondo in cui non c e spazio per il pensiero  il linguaggio e ridotto all osso perche diminuiscano le categorie della realta a cui esso si riferisce  in cui ogni momento della vita e monitorato e controllato  qualunque psicoreato vi condanna gia a morte  Non esistono leggi scritte  ma qualunque atteggiamento possa condurvi fuori dal gregge vi vale la vaporizzazione  non importa cio che avete fatto  importa cio che potreste fare Orrendo  caustico  spietato  pessimista  eppure terribilmente contemporaneo  un apocalisse spaventosamente reale vista l evoluzione della tecnologia e la manipolazione continua dei media  nonche il grado d ignoranza e di conformita degli attuali prolet  Un libro che invita a guardarsi dal potere e dai suoi pericoli  che sottolinea l importanza del passato  delle impressioni del presente e del futuro  Un libro che non dovrebbe mancare in nessun caso  This probably one of the best books I ve read  and also one with the scariest message  The fact that Winston becomes compliant to Big Brother at the end made it even scarier  Fear can take you over  and can also be manipulated by others  This book is amazing because it clearly shows that you can turn against you love  view spoiler  like when Winston turned against Julia in Room 101

ve read this book  but I do remember that I loved it  I think I even read it twice  Back in the days you did not have many of those kind of stories  Now   especially after The Hunger Games  although that series was definitely not the first of that genre  as some have you believe    But it became a hype and there are so many A dystopian series now This is a standalone book and it pictures a world where everyone lives in fear of Big brother  Yo know you are always watched  I highly recommend this  especially to younger readers  Great read   To consciously induce unconsciousness  and then  once again  to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed   A general definition of  doublethink   one of the multiple ingenious neologies Orwell created to name the strategies and principles needed to create and sustain the ultimate dystopia Like all fictional dystopias  this was  to an unrealistic extent  very relatable to our real world and awakens the sense of rebellion in you  but unlike the other dystopias  this went down the core and reason of rebellion to find a  cure  for it That of course  as would be expected  roamed around bringing the human down as close as possible to the animal  The way he talked about how to achieve that blew my mind especially the concept of thought and how to limit it by limiting the language And then came alterable past and the definition of facts and realism and power Mind blowing ingeniousness is what I can shortly describe this novel with You know it s fictional  but this novel s ending gets you doubting how much fiction is in it truly  In fiction the rebellious nature of a human is always victorious  but this novel gets you thinking   If placed through what Winston s been through  would this rebellious nature still win  Orwell left the ending of the novel to be reflected upon by each reader s true nature  the reader s nature is what decides the ending  and then of course there is Eric Blair s own nature that will decide an ending that  I guess  we would never know  This is one of my all time favourite books  and I think it s hard to add to perpetual praise for its existence  especially since its inception was barely beyond WWII Its bleakness and desolation has not left me since I first read it  and each time I revisit it it seems more and more astonishing  Reviews about blandness of character are certainly correct on one level   is a dystopic novel about the removal of humanity s connection to each other and our history  Where do you get vibrancy of personality with nothing to feed off  A tiny shimmer of emotion in that world comes out as  I love you   Orwell knew very well what he was doing It is that layer which gives 1984 such bleakness  Any thought of hope or love or anything else outlawed is only allowed to exist because Big Brother allows it  There is no beating the system  there is no possible rebellion  and ultimately  though it feels like it  to me the book isn t about a man yearning to fight his way to a glimmer of freedom and almost touching it  but more a man learning it does not exist  and it never did  There are no happy endings  Happiness has been deleted  Disney be damned  The great author develops obvious influences from previous dystopian works  notable We Brave New World  of fictional totalitarian state founded on mind control through Education  Propaganda and Social Engineering in a fluid and gripping narrative Orwell novel deals with profound metaphysical arguments in a powerful way  Nature of Reality  Solipsism and most importantly Language as identity and limit of our consciousness  His masterstroke is the invention of Newspeak  a deliberately impoverished language promoted by the state which aims at destroying unorthodox  redundant and abstract meanings in order to establish a firm thought control system   Don t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible  because there will be no words in which to express it  Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word  with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten    1 5 23  Syme   Mungkin ending yang seperti itu lebih cocok dengan cerita tapiSaya belajar banyak dari 1984  Politiknya  mamen    Politik ini sungguhan dipakai di era rezim Soeharto dan ada beberapa yang digunakan lagi oleh partai tertentu  1984 ini perwujudan dari kalimat Alan Moore tentang fiksi menyampaikan kebenaran  Dan memang menyampaikan kebenaranlah fiksi ini sehingga ia akhirnya menjadi buku pedoman penulisan politik atau pemerintah di genre dystopia  Bahkan jadi pedoman untuk orang di lingkaran dalam S   kayaknya Ide Orwell sinting dan sintingnya tak lekang oleh waktu  Hasil observasi yang sungguh baik dari mata yang begitu peka  Hasilnya juga sangat baik  Emosi campur aduk  pemahaman tentang manusia  dan semacam prediksi masa depan  Orang sinting  Dan tulisan sinting yang bikin sedih sampai sesaat kembali jadi misanthrope  lolKalau ada yang menyebut ceritanya kurang dalam dan ga bagus  saya kira masih bagus karena karakterisasi masing masing jelas  Dan dampak dari cuci otak itu juga masuk akal  imho Hal lain yang diperoleh dari kitab  yes  kitab  ini  individu tak akan menang melawan sistem  Hanya sistem yang bisa mengalahkan sesama sistem  nhm ln ythwrw Ht  y uw  w ln y uw l b d  n ythwrw  And 5 complete stars to this piece of ART What was really really good about it is contained in the book itself when Sir Orwell says   The best books are those that tell you what you know already  That  Was  SOME  READ    War is peaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is strength  I escaped high school and college having never read any George Orwell and having just finished 1984 I understand what a tragedy that is  This novel is totally brilliant  especially given the time period in which it was written  Orwell s ability to see with utter clarity the mad power grab of those in power as they strive to maintain the hierarchical nature of Western society is something I never  and perhaps this is a fault of my own deficiencies of history and philosophical thought  considered to be as keenly focused it is presented within this book I see so much of what Orwell details in this futuristic dystopia that is London in 1984 as part of our current political establishment in America  When Winston is given the book by The Brotherhood  he reads Emmanuel Goldstein s dissertation on the power structure of the  oligarchical collectivism  that exists in his world  As Big Brother s archenemy  Goldstein lays out for would be activists the how and the why the Party maintains order and it reads  admittedly a bit didactically  almost as a manual for the powers that be of the read world today  He claims that  if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike  the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves  and when once they had done this  they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function  and they would sweep it away  In the long run  a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance   While this thought might be a bit radical  I really feel that many politicians  especially those on the right subconsciously suppress social programs to maintain the balance of power in their own favors  Goldstein s thoughts on war or similarly prophetic   The essential act of war is destruction  not necessarily of human lives  but of the products of human labour  War is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent  Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed  their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed   In his book  he makes the argument to his readers that war in particular feeds the need to keep the lower levels of social hierarchies from achieving a comfort of living that would afford them time to consider their country s leadership while also taking an emotional toll on the people  provoking fear and patriotism  In the context of the novel of course  this knowledge eventually wreaks havoc on Winston s own attempts to rebel and the accuracy of the very existence of Goldstein is called into question  leaving Winston and the reader to wonder if the rumors of rebellion that are characterized by the elusive Brotherhood are merely another tactic of Big Brother in controlling the masses  particularly those intellectuals like Winston So much of the book reads as though it were written in response to today s world and not the world of the mid twentieth century  however elements of it are clearly dated  Orwell s pre sexual revolution male perspective comes through slightly in his depiction of Winston s lover Julia  a much younger woman who wants nothing more than a sexual relationship with Winston  It is not until he sees her with  just a few dabs of colour  make up   in the right places  that he discovers she is  not only very much prettier  but above all  far more feminine   Julia not only represents the dated male fantasy of the oversexed younger woman who is madly in love with the man beginning his midlife crisis though  Orwell sets up the age difference to also brilliantly bring into the play the varying attitudes of different generations to political oppression  Julia is only concerned about subverting Big Brother and the Party in so much as it effects her own pleasure  She could not care less about playing a role in a larger and longer political movement  whereas Winston understands that he will likely never live to see the day that the masses overthrow Big Brother and is still willing to play his part  Winston idyllically tells her that he  can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there  small groups of people banding themselves together  and gradually growing  and even leaving a few records behind  so that the generation can carry on where we leave off   to which Julia responds   I m not interested in the next generation dear  I m interested in us   clearly representing the voice of egocentric adolescence and early adulthood  Winston reacts with an objectifying and biting comment that she is  only a rebel from the waist downwards   again displaying some of the misogyny that creeps into the novel from time to time  perhaps even deliberately on Orwell s part In 1984  Orwell creates a brilliant depiction of an oppressive society that seems far too realistic to be true fiction  something we should all be wary of even as we move further and further away from the actual 1984  Superb     dystopian themes usually leave many loose ends but 1984 breaks that rule The story focuses on Winston Smith  a 39 year old lonely government worker who questions the system and feels he must rebel against it but doesn t know quite how to  Winston eventually finds some allies but things don t exactly end as the reader would want  The supposed existence of  The Brotherhood   a secret group that plans on bringing down Big Brother s government system reveals a book that sums up the entire concept of the book It would be foolish to judge a book great in concept book like 1984  This is a really true classic  even better than Animal Farm   1984 by George Orwell really is the dystopian book  to which all modern ones should bow down towards  It does what  in my mind  a dystopian book should do  which is terrify the reader out of their wits  For if it does this  it has convinced them that the possibility of this happening isn t completely fantastical Orwell paints a dark picture of misery  somehow made worse by the fact that nobody seems to know how miserable it is  It seemed odd how even though  Big Brother is watching you   few people show signs of wanting to rebel against it  This aspect is quite scary  because if nobody realises that they deserve freedom  then the Party really has gained all control  They work on eradicating thoughts and memories as well as just people and the past  so no one knows or remembers anything that allows them to fight back  I also found the portrayal of children quite disturbing  as it shows so clearly what the future holds unless something changes  It s like the next generation is born into thinking what s evil is good  so when they become adults there will be no hope left for society One thing I absolutely loved about this book was the love story between Winston and Julia  It was as though they brought hope to the story  but at the same time making it even more tragic  Possibly the worst part of life under Big Brother is the abolition of love  You re not allowed to feel  Marriage is for children and any caring feelings towards any other except Big Brother makes you a traitor  More than anything  their relationship made me want for a happy ending I was quite confused by the character of O Brien   view spoiler  Were we supposed to think he was good or not  One minute he was in the Brotherhood then he s torturing Winston  I think it would have been clearer if Winston had started hating him for being a traitor  but he really didn t  In fact  he seemed to feel some sort of love towards him  I wish what he d done had been clearer   hide spoiler  Overall I loved the book  I adored the characters  especially Julia  A new literary idol  and it really wants to make me read more dystopian books  I love how thorough Orwell is  I found the appendix really quite interesting  seeing how the language of newspeak is formed  I like that we can see how much work was put into the book through the little things such as this  It s such a well thought out world  although it really is quite terrifying  I believe that this is a book that will always be relevant and should always be read Favourite quote   The paperweight was the room he was in  and the coral was Julia s life and his own  fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal    1984  is the single most personally influential novel I have ever read  It prompted me to study history and language and sent me on my current carreer path  Both an emotionally rivering plot and a setting which is one of the most approachable commentaries on modern world society written in the 20th century  b dh yh mdt khh khtb nkhwndh bwdmyh pyshnhdh  ly z Trfh yh dwsth khwb mnw bh khtb khwndn brgrdwndyn khtb b tSwrt jwrj wrwl khpy brbr Slh dnyy yn rwzhy yrnhbkhwnydsh     khwb bkhwnydsh     Orwell s books is a brilliant proof of what paranoia and imagination can create  but also that people need not invent monsters  for they are ever so capable of monstrosities  The book anticipates the turn of actions such as reality control  privacy invasion and espionage  but thankfully it has never come to be that free will should be obliterated  Yet  as the struggle for control still continues would it be foolish to ask ourselves how long before paranoia turns into good reason  i read this book a few years ago  and i have yet to revisit it s pages  although it s been so long i can never forget the intensity of this book  i m only 15 years old now  and when i read it i had to have been at only 13 years of age  i sometimes question if i understood the full meaning of George Orwell s 1984  but even at my young age the message remains clear  this book is a haunting look into a future that one writer dared to predict  it tells the story of a lone man in a world where the government regulates everything  everything from your job  what you say  and how much contact you have with the opposite sex  even your thoughts and in a world so vast and restricted a man and a women try to get back emotions that have long since been washed from the thoughts of all these people  by the one they call big brother  they seek comfort in each other  and real human contact  and a chosen connection safe from the government that holds them back again  i could be wrong  but i loved this book so much  maybe for the fact that it was heart breaking and terrifying all at the same time  it could happen  people  it could happen  Inequality is the unalterabe law of human life The ingeniousness of George Orwell  which is a pen name  by the way  did you know  I didn t   can never be overstated  1984 is a classic of the dystopian variety and was written in 1948 1949  Orwell Eric Arthur Blair  sounds weird calling my man that  died two years after his novel was published  That is  to me  a very tragic notion  Glories that are earned after one perishes aren t really glories    This novel is amazeballs  Orwell is a golden writer of the English world and I don t think anyone can top him  Actually  I m pretty sure no one can top him  considering the amount of trash and garbage inflow in the dystopian genre these days  Contemporary writings  like contemporary humans  are seemingly decreasing in intellect with every passing year and the rate of decreasing intellect only appears to be spinning faster and faster  Humanity  you displease me  Has it ever occurred to you that by the year 2050  at the very latest  not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now  Well  Orwell my hero  I think you ve pegged that right  I m already starting to see the signs of the deliberate  or even unconscious  degeneration of the language you so lovingly caressed in your novel  The world of 1984 has come and gone  and I didn t live to see it  woefully  but your prophecy appears to become more and more valid than invalid as the 21st century slowly rolls over Rebellion meant a look in the eyes  an inflexion of the voice  at the most  an occasional whispered word I m not going to expand upon the plot line  That is for prospective readers to step on themselves  It s not dystopia that Orwell creates  it could be a more humanized version of hell  more accurately  The crude society presented in 1984 is beyond the tolerance of any of us  To the liberal West  which has come crashing out of the gates of what they thought was a prison  you most definitely will die out in this society  It s a true horroshow   Horroshow  reminds me  the novel bears semblance to A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess  Or  rather  the opposite holds true  since Burgess existed after the cessation of Orwell  Both able writers  both owning a mind with an insight to the worst nature of mankind   They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect  These sentences  they were written more than 67 years ago  Orwell was a modern writer in an aged age  He described exquisite phenomenons  presented convoluted ideologies and spoke of metaphysics  all of which can be safely said to require a comprehension skill beyond that of our developed world s youths  in the very simplest of manners  If this isn t genius  what is So ugly  and yet  so civilized You can t underestimate the emotional range depicted in this book  I myself had never before empathized with the despairs and the desires our character experiences  Almost as if Orwell innovated a whole new set of various sensuality  The very fiber that knits the world of 1984 is fraught with slavery and going against that slavery is a machete in the form of two lovers  Winston and Julia  You will be Winston  You will feel what Winston feels  You will suffer what Winston suffers  You will learn  and then re learn  what Winston learns and then re learns  It s not the deviation in practise that George Orwell pinpoints to  it s the deviation of the mind  Of the very psyche that embodies the human nature  It is  in the lowest form  in kinship with solipsism  Solipsism  a word I ve seen often  but have conversed with only just now  I enjoy talking to you  Your mind appeals to me  It resembles my own mind  except that you happen to be insane  1984 made its dent in my mind  Orwell scratched the surface of my cerebrum Shh Big Brother is watching  Ha  hents  skzbits  el kgtnes iren    Mi k ich  satkats nogh ow howsalk ets

 But yet  the reader can see how our everyday life can be not that far from the book on certain part   Freedom is Slavery  I couldn t believe that a novel written in 1948 will have so many parallels in 21st century world This is a must read   Non pensavo che un uomo potesse concepire una cosa del genere  Ho appena finito di leggerlo e sono ancora sconvolta  perche ben prima dell ultima pagina mi sono resa conto di come fosse angosciante il fatto che Orwell sia DAVVERO riuscito a farmi credere che un modo cosi possa realizzarsi Winston sono io I didn t think a man could conceive something like this  I just finished the reading and I m still shocked  because even before the end  I realized how frightening the fact that Orwell REALLY made me believe a world like this COULD be possible was I am Winston  Este libro ya lo lei en su momento  cuanto iba al instituto  No  no  por supuesto que no era uno de los libros recomendados por el profesor de literatura de turno  La recomendacion me llego del mejor recomendador de libros que conozco  mi padre Recuerdo que en su momento  con mi mente de adolescente  el libro me dejo un poco frio  No es que no me gustase  sino que no le supe sacar todo el jugo que yo sentia que el libro queria mostrar Por eso  unos anos despues y entrado en la treintena  me decidi a darle una segunda oportunidad al libro  Conclusion  Fascinante Ahora si siento que he exprimido lo suficiente la novela para captar las ideas e implicaciones que muestra la distopia creada por Orwell  Veo las influencias de las grandes guerras y movimientos sociales de la primera mitad del siglo XX reflejadas en la novela Sigo pensando que todavia le podria sacar mas jugo al libro  pero mi cabeza no da para mas  Puede que dentro de 20 anos lo vuelva a intentar  Nao ha uma intencao de solucionar os problemas do mundo atraves de uma critica social de como nos organizamos como sociedade e sim em enviar um alerta para que cada um de nos se lembre o quao suscetiveis a manipulacao somos A trama e densa  sombria  profunda e por vezes cruel  mas o texto nunca se transforma em um fardo para o leitor  fluindo sempre com naturalidade sem perder o ritmo  Alem disso os personagens nos convencem com facilidade de que sao importantes e esse mundo tao cruel e cheio de misterio e absurdos tratados como cotidiano nos deixa no minimo curiosos para ver como Winston ira se

George Orwell is one of the most widely read authors of the 20th century for good reason  He has a simple  precise style of writing that reads easily  Combine this with his talent for telling a story rich in symbolism and you have his classic books which have become so frequently read  and loved by so many I ve never met someone whose read 1984 and not been affected by its strong presence  It s known for bringing about a strong reaction in people   I guess that s another reason it s a classic  It s one of those books that stays with you after you re finished  I think I figured out why that is 1984 evokes fear by exposing how vulnerable human behavior is to fear  Everything that happens in the book is fiction  Yet  in the darkest corner of our mind  we can see this fiction as a very real   very dark possibility History doesn t exactly reassure us  The atrocities committed in the name of religion  the Holocaust  the communist purges of the 20th century   George Orwell is good at taking a bit from each and sculpting them into a new world  a world more sinister than anything we ve come to know  He even discusses these historical events in the book   and goes on to say why these power grabs failed   and why this new dark future will be eternal  It s scary stuff to think about Key to the story  is the idea that history can be re written by those currently in power  Language can be manipulated  Add in fear  scapegoats  and propaganda   and you have a world without liberty  a world without free will  a less human world if you will  Is it extreme  Absolutely  Over the top  You bet  But it s almost as if the novel is begging you to prove these things will never happen  In Newspeak terms  this book is a mindf  kI ll post a full review later   George Orwell written this book 1984  in 1948 is a chilling prophecy about the future The Party  Ingsoc   English Socialism  slogan is  Who controls the past controls the future  who controls the present controls the past  BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOUWAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH Here the Party is having all the power  most powerful  than any other and controls the present which made it to control the past and further controls the future too  It can create the persons who are not existing at all  i e   who had never existed in the present are existed in the past  and when once the act of forgery was forgotten  he would exist just as authenticated  like Comrade Ogilvy   In the same way  it can make the real person who is existing  as a person who never existed and unknown and don t have any identity  like Withers Syme   Winston Smith  the lead character  is working in the Records Department whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens with every conceivable kind of information  He finds love with Julia  The Thought Police uncover every act of betrayal towards the Party and both Winston and Julia are drawn towards a conspiracy  as they begin to question the Party For more http   www myrezension blogspot in 20    How is it that I managed to get through both high school and two rounds of university without having read this book  It should be required reading  despite its disturbing content  My only fear throughout was its potential to used as an instruction manual instead of a cautionary tale  I ll be chewing on its content for some time to come  The book that changed my view on the world  Reading this post 9 11 also contributed to it s impact  and coupled with all of the Bill Hicks shows I was listening to  this cemented as a paranoid socialist  The Americans reading might think that sounds awful  But that s why you need to read this book In 1949  Orwell was already recognising the power of Technological Media and its potential for use in propaganda A small  very small  spoiler is that there is a book that our Winston is given  This book describes how his world works  No wait  isn t it this world  No  it s his       strange When I picked up the story  I imagined racing through to a triumph  The Hollywood ending if you d like  Big Brother however  did not allow me this  Instead you find a crushingly realist saga  made sweet only the fact that this is not your world  despite its haunting similarities and you still have the chance to rise above conformity  You still have a free mind  The Thought Police and the Ministry of Peace may be fiction  but their unborn ghosts wait to be birthed  Don t let them  Dizer que   1984    de George Orwell  e uma obra que possui uma fortissima atualidade  ja todos nos sabemos  e alias  o aumento do numero de vendas do livro nos EUA depois do escandalo da NSA ainda auxilia mais esse facto   Ao afirmar que a historia distopica e  apenas figuradamente  futurista sobre Poder  Opressao e Manipulacao e um alerta para o lado mau de qualquer ditadura  tambem nao estou a acrescentar nenhuma novidade opinativa sobre esta obra prima literaria  E ainda  ao manifestar a minha consideracao de que o valor da historia e das situacoes de   1984   torna o uma peca de leitura obrigatoria para qualquer ser humano  tambem nao poderei acender novas luzes sobre esta narrativa  De tao bom que e   1984   e de tanto que ja se disse e se escreveu e se debateu sobre o livro  parece impossivel acrescentar lhe alguma coisa de novo  no meio de um mar vasto e infindavel de opinioes e interpretacoes que existem sobre a sua construcao e as intencoes de Orwell  E eu  um simples e ingenuo leitor devorador de livros que me despertem a atencao como este me despertou  nao poderei dizer mais nada de interessante ou relevante sobre   1984    Dai eu ja ter lido a obra ha uns meses e so agora e que consegui escrever alguma coisa sobre ela   mas infelizmente  nao esta a sair nada de jeito Talvez reste apenas a experiencia do leitor  Sim  porque lemos as opinioes sobre um determinado objeto cultural especial e particular  mas quando o consumimos e quando o sentimos  entramos noutra dimensao interpretativa que nunca cabera em qualquer ensaio ou dissertacao ou conversa que se possa ter sobre ele    1984   e um desses livros que nos deixa perturbados e confusos  e que desperta em nos um certo desejo de querer mudar o mundo  E uma delicia ler cada pagina da ficcao  tao veridica  inventada por Orwell  e tao bem traduzida para portugues pela Antigona  e percebermos que este e um dos poucos livros que nos despertam os sentidos como os  vulgares  nao conseguem fazer  sensacao parecida com a que nos oferecem os grandes filmes  os grandes albuns  as grandes pecas  etc  Mas apesar de   1984   ser o livro mais famoso de Orwell  convem nao esquecer que ha outra obra prima  mais curta e mais incisiva  mas que e igualmente recomendavel    O Triunfo dos Porcos      A Quinta dos Animais    numa traducao mais recente e que segue literalmente o titulo original   Ambos os livros lidam com a sociedade e os jogos de poder que se criam entre classes e  chico espertezas  politicas e institucionais  Duas pecas literarias que sao um murro no estomago para o leitor  e que devem  ou melhor dizendo  tem de ser lidas  Depois de descobertas estas duas obras  talvez fiquemos a perceber um pouco melhor os grandes males que atravessarao para sempre este nosso mundo    This book scares the Bejeezus out of me  Bye  Bejeezus  wherever you may be  kutb  ly Zhr lGlf nh rwy  tuqr

lo que diga le hara justicia  Sin exagerar  me sacudio hasta los huesos  Al ser venezolana  no pude evitar ver las similitudes entre la ficcion y la realidad  las masas idolatrando a un hombre  aceptando todo lo que se les dice sin importar las contradicciones  y  lo que es peor  la imposibilidad de una insurreccion En palabras simples  1984 es la distopia mas escalofriante de todas las que he leido  Es mas  es el papa de las distopias  Es increible que  habiendo sido escrita hace mas de medio siglo  siga metiendo tanto miedo y acercandose tanto a la realidad  Solo de pensar en la posibilidad de que la realidad pudiera ser alterada al antojo de unos pocos y que la mayoria aceptara las mentiras ofrecidas sin reparar en las contradicciones hace que sude frio  Pero no hablo de una simple alteracion de los hechos  sino de una reescritura completa  de un borron e historia nueva Quien controla el pasado controla el futuro  Quien controla el presente controla el pasado Puedo continuar citando la novela  pero como dije en un principio  nada de lo que diga le hara justicia y sospecho que esta resena carecera de estructura porque el libro me entusiasma demasiado  Sencillamente  es brillante  Asi que mejor me limito a callarme y recomendar 1984 a cualquier persona que me encuentre por ahi de ahora en adelante  En serio  tienes que leerla Oh  una ultima cosa  la ultima frase fue un martillazo en toda la cara  Advertidos estan  A classic for a reason Set in a  future  where humans  every thought and action is monitored and scrutinized  a man named Winston journeys through an everyday life in the Outer Party  George Orwell presents this strange futuristic lifestyle to the reader in a normal  unphased manner  implying that the Hate Week and telescreens are  and always have been  a normal and unquestioned part of life in Oceania  Yet Winston  our protagonist  finds himself curious and doubtful of the government  or  Big Brother   and we find ourselves sympathizing   empathizing with him  In a sense  the reader becomes Winston I must admit  the history part of the novel   presented in a reading of Goldstein s book   bored me to sleep  It took many an hour to get through those dreadful pages  and I was terrifyingly tempted to skip the entire thing  Some of the novel s suggestive parts induced quite a blush in my cheeks  but their existence proved necessary in developing the relationship between Winston and Julia The ending s twist was astounding and emotional  It left me sad and with a sense of feeling unfulfilled  but the story still remained an incredible sensation  Such a heart breaking novel   Right up there with the best books I ve read  I don t know why I hadn t read this book before  I read Animal Farm as a teenager and adored it yet never picked this up  It is  of course  brilliant  It s been so widely evaluated over decades that I doubt I have anything new to say here  so just go and read this important piece of work yourself  Keep Calm     Big Brother is WATCHING You  I used to read this once a year  however  lately I ve been noticing that life is imitating art a little too closely  As brilliant as Orwell is  I m starting to see a little too much of our own lives in it for comfort  Muito boa leitura  Uma trama bem encadeada que prende o leitor  Ate onde e possivel controlar o pensamento e as opinioes coletivas e individuais  Sera que o ser humano e capaz de anular sua individualidade pelo poder ou sera que a ideia de que a educacao e o progresso e que sao os entraves de uma sociedade feliz  Felicidade x Liberdade    George Orwell is brilliant  1984 is insane   5 stars  As a reader that doesn t like futuristic books  I really enjoyed this one  The focus was not on sophisticated IT machines but on the human struggle  The plot was so well constructed that I never guessed what would happen next  The end killed me  see my full review https   www youtube com watch v kTYhD    1984 is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever read  Although by the end of it a certain feeling of sorrow  almost sinking feeling as if drowning in a sea of complete despair  lingers in your thoughts  The book s raw characters  events and emotions keep your mind hooked on it where you desperately search for someone who read it just so you can have an in depth conversation of its contents  This is a must read classic that I am sure will consume your every thought until you have absorbed its underlying message  Great job George Orwell  I seriously don t know what to say of this book  It is so terrifying  especially the second last chapter  that I nearly screamed in my mouth  I have had some experience with dystopian cinema  but none of it can ever come close to this  The real terror comes from the fact that it is so very convincing  Winston finally breaks down  and the ugliness in the chapter that I mentioned above  was so harrowing and heart rendering that you must read it yourself to know what I m saying A daunting read  Read it at your own risk  I have no legitimate excuse to justify the fact that it s taken me 30 years to read this book  Perhaps I could blame it on the small town  backwoods high school I went to for the fact that they did not cover it within their curriculum  Or perhaps I can blame myself for going to a technical college where I spent the vast majority of the time studying the language of operating systems  which are now obsolete mind you  rather than cracking open a few classics for a required English Literature course at a  normal  school  Regardless of where the blame is placed I finally decided that it was time to take the plunge and I m glad that I did  I won t even attempt to write a proper review of a classic novel like this as I ll most likely just end up regurgitating what has already been said in countless other reviews over the years  In a nutshell  and a very tiny one at that  what I found most amazing about this book is that while it was written way back in 1949 it is incredibly pertinent to the world we live in today   which makes it all the more frightening  That s all I got  So stop being a prole and read the damn book already  GoodReads is watching you  Hsnan     hnlk b D lkutb lty tj l mn SHbh khldan     wlw lm yktb jwrj  wrwyl l hdhh lrwy  lkafath kthr  ml qmt blHtfZ bb D lmqwlt mnh

weren t the only thing that shivered  This was soul stirring  Masterfully written   even though if our physical reality is not what has been described   the ground realities are the same  as George Orwell thought in 1948 There are some books you remember for a while  and talk and laugh about later This is not one of those  Because there is another kind The kind that makes you think  The standard by which all dystopian literary visions are judged  it is predominantly seen as a treatment of totalitarianism and government surveillance and control  But the most profound  far reaching  and relevant aspect of its troubling world is the concept that  as Orwell says   He who controls the present  controls the past  He who controls the past  controls the future    Though Fictional  a worthwhile read   Whether you enjoy science fiction or not  Orwell s 1984 is a must read  Orwell writes like Monet paints  in that his description of 1984 is opaque yet colorful  mysterious  and beautiful Throughout 1984  the reader follows Winston Smith  who lives in Airstrip One  The world is subdivided into three major super powers  Winston lives in Oceana  which is run by Big Brother  Three ministries govern Oceana  The Ministry of Truth  Ministry of Love  and Ministry of Peace  Winston works for the Ministry of Truth  and it is there he meets Julia Much like Orwell s description of the scenes themselves  he creates a world in which the reader feels they are looking at Oceana through a sheet  Orwell never describes Oceana or 1984 in too much detail  though  in his descriptions of Winston s relationships to the world he lives in  Julia  and Big Brother  he writes with enough description that Orwell s vision of the future becomes more apparent with each page The most striking scene is when a poet is thrown into prison because he refused to take out the word   God  from a poem he transcribed because no other word fit  No matter a person s spiritual background  the critical person should find it uncanny that in 1949 Orwell imagined a world in which the name  God  would become illegal Though  we do not live in a world in which three empirical superpowers govern us  the critical person should wonder if we are closer to Orwell s 1984 than we realize  Or  perhaps  ideologically  we are there and realize it  though  we have become so accustomed to living in Orwell s 1984 that we willingly give up our rights and personal identity in the name of government sanctioned security and equality   George Orwell s dystopian opus 1984 is a wholly terrifying piece of fiction  There s a palpable sense of reality here  and the way it can be connected to our modern world is almost unreal  Everything the Party does can be reflected in our governments today  It s not hard to see other countries such as China or North Korea go to the extreme measures presented in 1984  In fact  the NSA s recent security breaches almost resembles the constant surveillance done by the Party Orwell was an intelligent man  He knew enough about how politics and the human mind work to construct a story that masterfully examines both  This is not a simple black and white story about a man who knows that his government is oppressing the people  That s certainly there  but it s not what makes it special  What makes it special is that the book shows the futility of such struggles  While Brave New World displayed similar themes  it was firmly nestled in the realm of fantasy and sci fi so as to lessen the impact  1984 on the other hand does not hold back  it grabs the reader by the neck and shows him the very real possibility that this can and probably will happen and there s naught we can do to stop it when it does  And what makes it worse is that  unlike the the year the book was written  1948 for those of you wondering   we have the technology to emulate the Party  1984 s edges have been sharpened  rather than eroded  by the sands of time  and the cuts are deeper as a result This is truly a brilliant book  and if for some insane reason you have not read  I encourage you to do so  It is a frightening little tale and one that speaks volumes more than sixty years after its publication  1984 warns us that ignoring the violent side of human nature can cost us our individual freedom  Difficult political ideas are expressed in a very simple and elegant style  Almost all the language associated with the Party is extremely ironic  Big Brother is a cruel tyrant  not a loving  protecting friend  the Ministry of Truth manufactures lies  and the Ministry of Love tortures  kills and destroys   Similarly  the contradictory party slogans  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength  reflect the inherent absurdity of the party policy itself  lrwyh mrhqh l  Hd b

one that will not soon be forgotten  it creeps into your pores and reverberates there  gently   I really thought that this was a 4 star book  because for me  there were parts of this story that seemed weighed down in excessive  philosophical detail  I mean I got it already  heavy  But in the end it was simply this story and its continued relevance today that had the greatest impact on me  What more could a writer ask for  2   2   Five Full Stars   Hay libros que se viven  Libros que se sobrevive a ellos  Este no es ninguno de esos  Es imposible vivirlo cuando estas atrapado en un mundo gobernado por el odio  en el que no existen el amor  la pasion o la confianza  Un mundo distopico que estuvo a un paso de hacerse realidad  pero del que ahora nos alejamos para llegar a algo quizas peor  No puedes sobrevivir a un libro que esconde en su innegable optimismo un pesimismo tan putrido que te repugna y te provoca nauseas  Es imposible hacerlo cuando cada palabra se te clava como un punal en el corazon porque intuyes el desastre que se esta urdiendo entre cada linea   Que clase de libro es este  entonces  Para mi es que ni siquiera es un libro  Durante algo mas de tres meses ha sido mi almohada  mi sustrato  mi fuente de los deseos y mi fuente de pensamientos incendiarios que se avivaban con cada satira  con cada critica  con cada piedra lanzada a su propio tejado  Es pura filosofia  mas alla del fondo politico tambien se entrecruzan ideas metafisicas y epistemologicas  aderezado con antropologia y etica para dar una obra de dimensiones monumentales  Podria concluir afirmando que esta novela es un monumento y aun me quedaria guardadas muchisimas ideas en la alacena de mi corazon  pero creo que esa palabra  monumento  la describe con acierto  Porque es tan hermoso  tan horrible  tan repugnante y tan maravilloso que  sin duda  merece un hueco en la eternidad  Aunque el pasado no exista  aunque un solipsismo desmesurado me asegure que este libro es un mero producto de mi imaginacion  Es dificil cerrar un libro que te ha gustado  pero lo es mas aun cuando entre sus paginas has encontrado el consuelo de saberte cuerdo en un mundo de locos para acabar en mitad de un vendaval de miseria y decadencia humana  de traicion y de odio  cuando te ha hecho plantearte hasta tu propia existencia y tu vida  si es que ese concepto existe   Sabeis que es lo que se con certeza  Que este libro se me ha clavado muy dentro y no quiero que salga nunca  Quiero que sea este libro uno de los que lea a mis hijos  nietos o sobrinos para que se duerman  uno de los que tendre siempre en la mesilla de noche por si me apetece releer cualquier fragmento de los muchos que he marcado  uno de los que se han ganado las mejores palabras que he podido encontrar en mi mente confusa y debilitada por la magnifica  aguda y certera prosa de mi  desde ahora  adorado George Orwell  Que livro  Agora percebo as excelentes criticas que sempre ouvi a seu respeito  George Orwell desenvolveu o futuro da humanidade de uma forma que merece destaque  a opressao em que vivem os habitantes da Oceania conseguia fazer se sentir  quando mais nao fosse se me pusesse a pensar no que tenho  na forma como todos nos vivemos  e se em determinado momento praticamente tudo o que adoramos fazer  aqueles momentos de liberdade e lazer que nos fazem agradecer o privilegio de estarmos vivos  simplesmente desaparecessem  E se o simples facto de ler  1984  fosse um acto contra o Partido  quase como crimepensar  Outras das coisas que me agradou bastante no livro  foi o facto de eu  leitor  tal como o personagem  Winston Smith  termos sido enganados durante praticamente todo o livro  Ambos pensavamos que os seus segredos  de Winston  estavam bem guardados e nao estavam a ser observados  E esmagador imaginar que pode haver um final feliz  que A Fraternidade existe e vai haver uma luta para restaurar a liberdade  e em certo momento tudo cai por terra  nada consegue derrotar o Partido  Nao ha nada a fazer  apenas o conformismo e aceitar os factos  nao como eles sao  mas como nos ordenam que sejam  Uma obra prima  ntbtny ldhsh   ndm  lmt  n jwrj  wrwyl ktb  1984  fy  m 1949 fy mHwl  lltnbw  bm

Blair is the last book he wrote and it completely blew me away  It was kinda boring at first even though it was totally creepy in the whole concept of the word describing the miserable world they live  and pretty interesting  But boring  I was reading it slow  But then the part of the book by Goldstein amazed me  And I couldn t put the book down until I finished it  The whole world of totalitarianism just plain frightened me and changed my view in a lot of things  I knew that the world hasn t seen anything yet  And hopefully it won t come even close to this  even though this is just an imaginary world  Crept the life out of me  After reading this great book  I look at the world a different way  In the book everyone was terrorized by the government  The Party  and just how much security was implemented to their citizens  Even though I don t live in a world like Winston s where we have to worry about our thoughts or not being able to love and show affection to a person  I feel like we are heading at that direction  And the reason for this is because of how many cameras are around the world just watching us just like those damn telescreens  Some of the reasons why I liked the book was because of how the author s point of view of was of the future  I also liked it because of the plot twist near the end  I had persuaded myself that he will die after the torturing that O Brien did to Winston but in the end all he did was  cure  him  Another reason I also liked it was because of the personality that he made for O Brien  Just the way that he works like a double agent a horrible nemesis but also a great friend to talk to is just something not seen in most books nowadays  All in all I just loved the book for the characters and the plot line  I just hope that one day our government doesn t turn into a communism like The Party was in 1984  Wow I will need some time to recover from such a powerful book  George Orwell takes us on a tour around London  but it is not just a normal holiday tour  It is a tour around the London he speculates will exist in 1984  if Britain is overcome by a totalitarian party  In this dystopian novel  we are at once made aware that privacy is impossible  war is continuous and freedom is imaginary  The reader learns of Winston s dreary routine  his smelly apartment  his unappetizing meals and of his hatred towards the party and towards Big Brother  There never was a book which made me feel as insignificant as a human being as this  I shivered  and almost exclaimed out loud that the party is not fair  that this is not how a country should be led  That I am a human and as a human being I deserve rights  That I need my privacy  That just like the Inner Party  I need comfort  and good food  Certain scenes made me shiver with indignation at what Winston went through because of what he believed in  But I know it is true because I know that even nowadays there are countries applying this form of ruling to their people I absolutely detest how this book made me feel   useless  worthless and perishable  Vivid  graphic images exposing how powerless the human body is  I actually took a day s break from the book because I could not stand the way it affected me  However  if I ever got the chance to meet Orwell  in the afterlife perhaps  I would tell him with regards to  Nineteen Eighty Four    Well written  comrade  Bloody well written   I just finished teaching this novel that I had not read for at least 30 years  Much of what I would otherwise have written here I got to discuss in my class so I ll limit myself to noting two things  1  This is a truly terrific and very important novel both in terms of its devastating and utterly necessary political message and also in terms of it s sharp and often beautiful prose and 2  I believe that 1984 is about love I once wrote a prose poem that s premise stated   Love is the most subversive act in which two or more people can engage   1984  in my opinion  constructs a political party and system responding to that theory  If love between individuals is the ultimate expression of human freedom  then of course the most oppressively totalitarian state would have to seek to isolate and alienate us all and  ultimately  demand not only that we conform to the norms of its ideology  but that we end up like Winston Smith in the last line of the novel  conquering ourselves  all that we are as individuals  and learning to love Big Brother  the state s probably fictitious poster boy  To further prove my thesis  I would have you note that Smith is caught and interrogated not when he begins to defy the State by writing or through thought crime  but only when he begins a love affair with another party member  and that the interrogation process takes him step by step through all of the things that he has come to love in his clandestine search for individuality  culminating with the renunciation of his lover  Julia  under the most hideous of all tortures  only then can Big Brother move in to become the one and only object of love allowed in a State that demands our all  our love at the expense of all other objects of affection Only flaw in this novel is the lengthy interjection of passages from Emmanuel Goldstein s book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism in the second section  These passages slowed down the plot unduly and went over a lot of ground that had already been so much more cleverly disclosed through the narrative in the novel s first section  We did learn a few new  interesting things about the world situation  within the novel s fiction  but I did not find the trade off worthwhile  red pencil  please  the novel forsees the future with its very details    One of the best books ever  I hardly ever reread  but this book is probably my favorite and I m so glad I picked it up again to remind myself of how brilliant it is  There s not that much action  but the ideas this story presents are incredible  and kind of terrifying  How people can live being constantly watched  in a society full of nonsense  but where everything  as crazy as it may be  is accepted if the party says it is true  The party has the power because it controls everybody s minds  and no one can t escape  they won t let them  It terrifies me how someone could be so powerful as in to make their opposers absolutely change their minds  practically become different persons after they torture them and wash their brains for months  That s what happened with Winston  and even if his story is not hopeful  it s so worth the read  1984 was not a book I enjoyed very much  It was more of a large description of what Orwell imagined the future would be like  I feel that the story itself was very simple  Orwell s writing is very clear and easy to understand  but I wasn t particularly fascinated with the dystopian world that he created  I wasn t engrossed in the world that he created  One good thing that I liked about the book was that the ideas that he wrote about were interesting If only the plot of the story was better  Overall  the book was a good description of a totalitarian society of the future  but was not very interesting  Dear God this book is absolutely frightening  I wanted to fight through every word  every horrible truth telling words   I read this book both for school and because I d read other distopian books that had been written over the past few years and enjoyed them  Now  that I have read 1984  I look at the Hunger Games  the Matched series and the Eve books with distaste and astonishment  How could I have thought those were even slightly good  The way in which George Orwell wrote this book is phenomenal  He took separate ideas that on their own are brilliant  unique and cut right to the core of what society could turn into and arranged them so that they formed a stunning  breath taking  mind boggling and quite simply beautiful book that challenges ones beliefs  ideas on society and thoughts on oneself  Ideas like Newspeak  Thoughtcrime and Doublethink are something  like Winston said about the book  that are in front of us but we don t realize  This is one of the best books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading   Satirical novel of a political fiction about a society in Oceana who was oppressed by the Party with a totalitarian doctrine perpetuated by  Ingsoc  or English Socialism  This institution was founded by the  Big Brothers  who regulated the system to the name of the greater good But Winston Smith is very industrious  and proficient worker who s having idea of an outbreak towards the Ingsoc totalitarianism  He thinks that the world view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapble of understanding it  They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality  because these people never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them He was infrangible and didn t concede to the totalitarian regime for him to die was freedom  which is a very sad ending  Read the review Thoughts on a Dystopian Classic  http   classiclit about com od orwell     La mayor de las herejias era el sentido comun  Y lo mas terrible no era que le mataran a uno por pensar de otro modo  sino que pudieran tener razon  Porque  despues de todo   como sabemos que dos y dos son efectivamente cuatro  O que la fuerza de la gravedad existe  O que el pasado no puede ser alterado   Y si el pasado y el mundo exterior solo existen en nuestra mente y  siendo la mente controlable  tambien puede controlarse el pasado y lo que llamamos la realidad  No creo haber leido antes un libro con tanta fuerza  tanta coherencia en principios inverosimiles  aterradores y sin embargo  muy posibles  La tortura a Winston resulta realmente macabra  tanto como el fanatismo desmedido del Partido y culminando con el aterrador final que  sin embargo  inexorablemente siempre espero   lo mas terrible era que pudieran

qbl  Os ultimos capitulos sao assustadores e de certa beleza intelectual por parte do autor  Tem um final consistente com a proposta do livro  mas de uma digestao nao muito saborosa  Vale a leitura   Oh this book  Everyone has to read it in high school and for good reason  It s the best book ever  Not only can I forever say   I was born in the future    1984 is my birth year  but I also learned what it means to question authority and think for myself as a teenager  I remember this book being so truly cool  I should probably re read it as an adult   Un gran libro  una historia no muy apartada de lo que es la realidad en nuestros dias  Increible como este autor logra captar el interes del lector con una historia que es ficticia pero que cuenta tantas verdades  super recomendado  I m not sure how much I can offer on a review that hasn t already been said before about this novel  First off  I felt like I was the only person on the planet who hadn t read 1984 yet  I must have missed it somewhere on my required high school reading list  I had started it a few times in the past and never finished it  I was finally ready though to explore all that 1984 had to offer  and wow  I am glad that I did There are some slower parts   some may enjoy the doctrines or the explanations of war   but that was tedious for me to get through  Going into 1984 I knew about some of the themes like Big Brother and the telescreens   but I had no clue where the actual plot of the story would go  There are some fascinating moments with Winston  the main character  and his love interest  Julia  These moments give you the slightest glimmer of hope that maybe  just maybe  there might a happy ending for some people in this world Without giving away specific details on how the story progresses   I will just say that I have never been so uncomfortable and terrified while reading a book in my life  1984 gives you food for thought on the way the world is run  how to be aware of your choices  and hopefully how not to repeat the same mistakes of this world  Throughout the story I had a sinking feeling it would not end well  I didn t see how it could  I had never wanted to be more wrong  Unfortunately  it ends the only way it could in this world filled with complete and utter control over one s mind  body  and at last  heart   Was expecting this to be dull and impenetrable because friends of mine had done it at school  But it wasn t it was clear  and up front  and bleak and fiercely intelligent  This is an intellectual s dystopia where an intellectual elite are in charge and seek to control every person s perception  Shot through with a contempt for the lower classes  Very powerful  I read my old review about this book and I couldn t help cringing from how pathetic it was  It does this ass kicking novel no justice at all  1984  is the kind of novel that stays with you  even after a while  When I first read it  I was new into the whole  reading frenzy  stuff  and it s actually the first novel I ever read  fully  And at the same time  this novel started my love affair with reading in general  and helped slay the unsubstantiated idea I had that reading books was boring   because I ve read a lot since I was a little girl  but not books  I ve read from the Internet    This I owe to my sister  who came to my aid once I asked her to recommend me books  This is the first one she recommended  without hesitation  the second being   The Brothers Karamazov   by Fyodor Dostoyevsky  which I immediately jumped to after devouring this one  I ll be eternally grateful to her for the day she recommended these two books to me  They  in a way  touched me and changed my perception in many things  To this day  the intro words send goosebumps throughout my skin    It was a bright cold day in April  and the clocks were striking thirteen    I can write them from memory  No  not because they re easy to remember  but because these are the words  though being the first in the book  that drew my complete attention to the book and didn t allow me to put it down  This fierce novel is  perhaps  Eric Blair s best handiwork and a powerful warning against the dangers of a totalitarian society  Torture to brainwash citizens  the Two Minute Hate and the worship of Big Brother  all these elements are made to craft walking zombies for citizens  Some people say that a gloomy and extremist environment such as the one in  1984  isn t possible  but I think it is  and that it s already here  North Korea  for instance  functions as a single party state under a totalitarian dictatorship  where the citizens are brainwashed  tortured by famine and obliged to worship Kim Jong un as a God  Big Brother  much    and though they don t have the Two Minute Hate concept  North Korea s government does a fine job instilling hatred towards the United States in their citizens  blaming the US for their situation and pain  not allowing them access to the Internet with the pretext that they re protecting their citizens from harm  when in reality  they re protecting them from the truth while scattering lies and ignorance  to create more ignorants in the process  North Korea government   the Party and Big Brother The United States   Emmanuel Goldstein and his followers The lies instilled in the citizens to hate the US   Two Minute Hate Now that I ve been thinking about the novel  this is what I presume and feel  Complete totalitarianism is here  and  1984  was a fierce warning towards a totalitarian society government  What a terrifying prediction it was  Another aspect of the novel that fascinates me is how thought and language mould and shape the human mind and the control of it  One of the major themes in the novel is power and control  and language forms a major part in the doing of both elements  Half the tool of controlling is language and the other half is torture  Every aspect of Oceania s society is controlled   even the impulses of love and sex  Jesus  it s like Half Life 2 all over again  There is no personal space  no free thoughts as even thoughts which are wrong in the Party s eyes are a crime  thoughtcrime   It s a compelling aspect   specially when many elements are being played out perfectly  like a divine plan  in real life  I suppose that the political oppression Blair observed in both Germany and Spain was bad enough for him to think it wouldn t get better  he exaggerated many aspects in his novel but was still accurate in his  prediction   Hoo ray for prophets It s not easy to do justice to a novel that s changed your perception in many things  specially when it conveys you a river of emotions and you can barely put them in order one by one and explain them  so bear with me for the sloppy review This is an amazing read and I d recommend it to anyone  without hesitation and in a heartbeat  not because this is a classic and classics are considered by many to be books everyone s supposed to read before they die  but because we re talking about a book where there s a futuristic political hierarchy which transmutes even the simplest concepts  Where the antagonists create an insane amount of ministries dedicated to transmuting all aspects of a social life  in the case of the protagonist  the Ministry of Truth dedicates to reshaping every historical occurrence and manipulates them so the past adjusts to the version they want to convey  hence making their brainwashing easier  They are literally re writing history  hence the phrase   Who controls the past  controls the future  who controls the present  controls the past   Book I  chapter III   This insane creativity makes the novel a wonderful read  and I d recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat because whether you enjoy the novel or not  it will enlighten you and offer you an interesting perspective  It will contribute something to you    If you want a picture of the future  imagine a boot stamping on a human face  forever  And remember that it is forever  The face will always be there to be stamped upon    O Brien  chapter III  page 277     War is Peace  Freedom is slavery  Ignorance is strength   1984 is a story written by George Orwell that takes place in the future for his time which he wrote to be   1984   The story takes place in a fictional region of the world called  Oceana  Everyone in this region is constantly being watched by the government also know as   Big Brother  through telescreens located everywhere in the public  This way  if someone tries to commit a certain crime or illegal activity  the government will find out immediately through the telescreens  The world in 1984 is very horrid and difficult to live in because of the different things that the government does to the people which is basically taking away their freedom and rights  For example  the government takes certain words and phrases out of books and if an editor decides to keep the word in the book that the government doesn t want  that person will be arrested and vaporized erased from history   The main character Winston Smith works in a department known as the Ministry of Truth that deals with rewriting history and documentation so if the party decides to erase something from history so people will be oblivious to it  they may do so  A quote from Winston states   People simply disappeared  always during the night  Your name was removed from the registers  every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out  your one time existence was denied and then forgotten  You were abolished  annihilated  vaporized was the usual word   15   Winston is written to be in his middle age years because the government keeps people unknown to what their actual age is  He lives in an apartment by himself and tries to write a diary about his life but this is a risky thing to do because it is a crime to record things that will remain throughout history  Winston develops a disliking for  Big Brother  once he notices how much the government ruins people s lives  This book has a lot of political and social messages that are very interesting because they show the reader a scary perspective of the government having complete control over everyone and everything also known as totalitarianism  The main character Winston lives somewhat of a depressing life just like most people in the book because they don t have any privacy and they live by rations of food  drinks and other items like cigarettes  The book is very suspenseful because Winston starts to do risky activities that would get him in trouble with  Big Brother   The fact that this book was so suspenseful and politically influenced makes it a great story and a classic  The most suspenseful part of this book is when Winston fell in love with a girl who is a lot younger than he is and the risky part was meeting up with her because he could be easily caught by the telescreens  Political messages in the story include the slogans that the government makes up for the people to remember like   War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is strength   This slogan is made up in the book to show the people that the government is more superior to them and that what ever the government says people have to live by even though it might be harsh  Another political message that the author put in the book was the political system which is called Ingsoc  English Socialism   The people in the story are under governmental rule known as English Socialism which is basically the political system where the government has total power  The reason why George Orwell included it in the book was because during the time he was writing the story  the English government wanted to make Socialism their primary political belief and George Orwell wrote it in the book to show how horrible it would turn out it to be if it became the main type of government  This book definitely deserves a five out of five stars because of its beautifully written pages about political and social suffrage  It is such a memorable book that will leave the reader with a really good impression  1984 is not an easy book to read and understand so its recommended to be read by adults or teens  This is not a children s story because it has some political messages that would just be too hard to understand for a child under thirteen  Also some parts of the book can be inappropriate for younger kids because of the sexual references and violence  1984 is a book that everyone should read because it teaches people the predictions of people like George Orwell had for the future     tqd  n hdhh lrwy  lyst mjrd rwy    nh nZry  mtkml     flsf  qy m  bHd dhth    tjrb  tSnf nfsk bqbl wb d    qbl 1984    wb d 1984    lbd  n tqr  hdhh

whole novel of 1984 is in  it s purest form  an essay about totalitarianism governments  Still a really good book  though  The book gets fairly boring during the middle and leading up to the end    But part 3 is where the pace begins to pick up again  It s essentially a novel that fits well into the time of when George Orwell wrote the book  a little after World War II  where a bunch of crap is happening to the people and our good Orwell here is trying to remind them to avoid some stuff so that they can avoid the government like in George Orwell  It s been over 70 years now that this amazing piece of English literature has been released  and I think is a novel that everybody should read  It s a book that will remind us why language is an art  that as long as we can still think for ourselves  we are free  and that we should remain loyal to the ones we care about    Because if language is taken away  if our freedom of thought becomes oppressed  and our language is narrowed down to have a smaller vocabulary  then we d probably be in 1984   This is the first book that gave me actual nightmares  so that s saying something Out of all the worlds I ve read about  this one definitely scared me the most  And why  Because it is so close to today s world  And knowing that this book was written more than 60 years ago  just shows how big of a genius Orwell was  What made it even more scary  was the ending  At first  I felt iffy about the ending  But after giving it some thought  I felt like it was the perfect way to end the story like this one  It just made the book that much realistic One of the most terrifying books that I ve read  so far   but also one of the best  And even though I loved it this much  I don t think I ll be re reading it anytime soon  This should be a must read for everyone  I ve been reading quite a bit of dystopian fiction lately  but this book can t really be called dystopian and the events within it aren t even really fiction      It s called a utopia  but I can t call it that either  When it was written  it was probably a frightening future  but at this point  even though the year 1984 has come and gone  this book is what I could easily see society becoming in the near future  I m not going to get too much into this  but the phrase  War is Peace  really struck me as something our current politicians would most certainly say and even seem to have convinced us of  As simply a novel  1984  is well written  I enjoyed Winston and his voice  His confusion comes through quite well  I also enjoyed the descriptions about Julia  even though I did not particularly enjoy her character  The story unfolded in a way that was easy to follow  yet impossible to not be touched by  Dystopias of today generally end with the hero overcoming the evil overlords and establishing some form of new  more free order  This book does not end so hopefully  but it felt realistic as the world that Orwell built  or predicted   does seem to be somewhat indestructible   I love dystopias and I was obviously expecting great things from this book  inumerous times mentioned as  one of the best books ever    a book everyone should read    a must read classic    one of the most disturbing books ever    one of the most influential books in history    one of the best philosophical books   etc   etc  etc  The point is  whatever list it integrates  it is always right in the top  Both speacialists and teachers  and bookworms in general  agree that this is a book not to miss You just can t deny that this is a great book  If not because of the great story and the great plot  at least because of the message it carries and the study of human behaviour Orwell needed to have done in order to write those perfectly brilliant essays on war  freedom  social hierarchies  politics and so on It is quite clear why any dictatorship would ban or censor this book  It is a threat  In the reading of this book  the reader gains a whole new perspective of life  a new understanding of the foundations of totalitarism and political power If our history has shown us anything  it is that deep human nature does not change throughout time and in studying it without being afraid to put our finger where it hurts  we can answer all our questions on human character  We have the tools we need in order to make this world an awesome place to live in  there is only one inconvenient keeping us from doing something about it  ourselves Because I simply adore to find out more about how foul and addle our species is  I found this novel a treat  Our very worst is here exposed with such rawness  I just can t help but to be captivated and ultimately fascinated Relativism is taken to a new extreme here  there is just no way you can ever know anything for sure  The past is constantly altered  as the  truth   Any demonstration of feelings can get you slayed and you are always being watched  Affection is discouraged  even between family members  in fact  parents usually end up being sent to the Ministry of Love  where the torture   and I mean  real heart wrenching  nerve racking  what the fuck is wrong with this goddamned people torture   and slaughter go down  by their own kids  which are put in groups meant to format their minds into what is desired since the very begining Constant warfare is necessary in order to maintain peace  having the freedom to act and  more importantly  to think  will enslave you to unimportant vices and feelings  and  at last  remaining ignorant about what really is happening around you will be best for you  cough  cough  for the Party  cough  cough  I d already understood this after reading Animal Farm  1984 just confirmed it  and I have to say it  Orwell is was just a fucking genius Compared to the system he created  all fascist regimens that ever existed since there is record  you know  those we learn about in school  lead by those fine specimens of the human race that were Hitler  Stalin  Mao Tse Tung     can be ridiculed for having such big  obvious and easily avoidable flaws  But hey  I m glad they were flawed  I may be misanthropic but I ve never been further away from being genocidal  The world presented here is absolutely horrifying and depressing  It is dark and hopelessly realistic  What is even more terrifying is that some of the things in the novel are inspired from real incidents  A classic masterpiece  Highly recommended  will re read    Great book  Not exactly a typical novel  Truly progressive thinking and warnings from Orwell  Given his background and personal history and experience  this is quite fitting coming from him  He creates a society that could potentially exist if humans gave into the importance of power and domination over everything else  over humanity itself  I wonder if our current technology and the encouragement of materialism and vanity may produce a society that places humanity below these  Certainly the availability of information and over sharing by people can cause one to be more narrow minded than open minded  to buy into only the ways of thinking that serve the individual  We must continue to strive for a balance between the individual and the collective  As we gain more freedoms for all groups in our society  does it really make us more free or more bound by some need to control these freedoms  I hope that we will always have a place for love  community  and gratitude that will overcome hatred As a writer  he is thoughtful in his descriptions and even within such an intense subject matter delivers bits of comedy and beauty   Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face  His powers of sweating were extraordinary  At the Community Center you could always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the dampness of the bat handle   pg  55 Book  Skyline College library book  lys mhman sm  lakhryn Swtk   bl bbqy k slym l ql ymknk mwSl  Hml ltrth lnsny kyf ymkn  n tbrhn

A revolucao dos bichos   Animal Farm  Orwell escreveu o livro em 1948 e o situou em um futuro longinquo  1984   Ou pelo menos assim parecia entao  pois 36 anos e um tempo razoavel  seria como um futuro imaginado em 2016 para 2052  parece longe  A mudanca de posicao dos dois algarismos parece ser um indicador de que estaria tambem se referindo ao seu proprio tempo Podendo ser considerada como um classico da distopia e ate na ficcao cientifica  entre outras coisas  a obra e principalmente uma satira politica  que critica com veemencia os mecanismos de poder e os regimes totalitarios  O mundo acabara de derrotar uma ditadura terrivel  a da Alemanha nazista  mas ainda enfrentava outra tao ruim quanto  o da Uniao Sovietica comunista que  ao fim da II Guerra Mundial  dominou todo o leste europeu No livro  o regime totalitario alcancou a perfeicao  domina tudo  Por meio de telas  um certo lider  o  Grande Irmao   que inclusive deve ser idolatrado  vigia a todos  o tempo todo  Note se que em 1948 nao havia sequer televisao  muito menos telas de computador  tablets e celulares  E conhecida a historia de que  no regime sovietico  quem caia em desgraca era removido de referencias e mesmo de fotografias  coisa facil hoje para qualquer usuario de Photoshop  mas artesanal na epoca   Na ditadura do livro  o sistema ja esta muito adiante  todos sao treinados para repensar tudo o tempo todo  e o  duplipensar   doublethink  no original   a verdade passa a ser aquela que e determinada a cada momento  Por sinal  existe um Ministerio da Verdade  A propria lingua e reestabelecida permanentemente  e a newspeak  traduzida para  novafala  ou  novilingua   conforme a edicao  E o mundo foi reduzido a tres paises  Oceania  Eurasia e Lestasia  que estao aliados ou em guerra entre si   mas isto tambem muda a cada momento O futuro remoto chegou  e ja se passaram mais quase outros 36 anos depois de 1984  E o mundo  como esta  Se formos ver  a vigilancia sobre os cidadaos atingiu niveis inimaginaveis  As telas e camaras de vigilancia se multiplicam  e isto em regimes que nem sao totalitarios  E de onde voce acha que tiraram o nome do tal programa de TV em que todos sao vigiados o tempo todo  O regime de Orwell avisava pela  teletela    O Grande Irmao esta de olho em voce     Big Brother is watching you    1984 entra em qualquer lista de grandes livros a serem lidos  Foi um sucesso de vendas no lancamento em 1949 e permanece assim quase setenta anos depois  Esta edicao da Companhia das Letras  por exemplo  e de 2009 e  em seis anos  em 2015  ja estava na 26a reimpressao  Atualmente  a editora publica a obra de Orwell em portugues  em edicoes muito boas e atraentes  que contem textos de apoio  sempre importantes para melhor compreensao da obra  Neste caso  tres posfacios  de Erich Fromm  1961   Ben Pimlott  1969  e Thomas Pynchon  2003  Excelente leitura  Sempre atual  para pensar sobre limites de sistemas politicos  E uma obra impactante  ninguem deixara de se sentir atingido Frases escolhidas de 1984  Guerra e Paz Liberdade e Escravidao Ignorancia e Forca   Quem controla o passado controla o futuro  Quem controla o presente controla o passado   Cada registro foi destruido ou falsificado  cada livro reescrito  cada quadro foi repintado  cada estatua e edificio renomeados  cada data foi alterada  E o processo continua a cada dia  a cada minuto  A Historia parou  Nada existe exceto um presente sem fim no qual o Partido esta sempre certo   O passado foi apagado  o apagamento foi esquecido  a mentira tornou se verdade  Veja mais informacoes  Livros de George OrwellLivros de George Orwell na Companhia das Letras  1984 A Revolucao dos Bichos In my opinion this is the classic dystopian novel and the standard by which I compare all other books in this genre  It is frightening in a way that will destroy your belief in humanity because of its sheer honesty  But the scariest part is not the horrors this futuristic society inflicts on its citizens  but the moment when you realise you see the beginnings these attitudes in own society  1984 contains an uncomfortable amount of fact embedded in its fictitious world This novel is the a not casual bedtime reading book  because to read it requires a level of thinking that is difficult to reach without being fully awake  One of the themes is the necessity to control a person s mind in order to control the person themselves and this is done simply by inhibiting free thought and thus said person doesn t think  So I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes or wishes to think about humanity  society  power etc  Side note  If I ever wanted to take over the world 1984 would be my first choice for a handbook   mnth  l jb lm tqr lrwyh hw nk tHs bnh tktbt mn Hwl

distopia ambientada en Inglaterra donde se muestra la mas cruda expresion del poder  revelando cuan catastrofico puede ser cuando es ilimitado  Por otro lado exhibe sin tapujos una mirada a la verdadera naturaleza del hombre  Es interesante ademas porque define al liberalismo mostrando lo que no es  Lo recomiendo bastante  Reread for EN4413  Reading the 1940s  2011 2012 I loved this book   if it s possible to love such a bleak story  It reminded me a lot of Margaret Atwood s  The Handmaid s Tale   which I read when I was in high school and also adored  I thought that I d given up quite early into this book but when reading it I remembered a lot more than I d imagined and I think I only gave up about 3 4 of the way into the story when the main character reads the book he s been given  To be honest  I found this section hard to trudge through even on the second reading  I think my only displeasure with this book was the torture scenes  which I found very difficult to read  But I will admit that I m a rather sensitive soul  perhaps too sensitive sometimes  and not everyone will have issues with this part  We debated a lot in my study group as to what the end of the book truly meant and none of us could really agree  Perhaps not as entirely relevant as it was in the 1940s but still provides a lot of food for thought  9 10   First attempted to read in November 2006 but gave up I attempted to read this book when I was fifteen but really struggled with it  I think the main problem was the time that I was trying to read it  I was on a work experience placement for school  and I kept trying to read this in my lunch breaks  But the other girls at the nursery would talk really loudly about the articles in their gossip magazines and it became really difficult to concentrate  Eventually  I had to return the book to the library before I was finished  but I shall go back and read it again someday as I was enjoying it  Long Live Ingsoc  Or Long After 1984 Big Brother Still WinsWarning  Drenched in Spoilers Long after 1984 has come and passed  Orwell s book still remains relevant if a little dated  I was highly tempted to give this book four stars instead of five  In a way  the book has been outpaced by the times  What made me change my mind  Great details and a very riveting and appropriate ending  but also perhaps the notion that Ingos  Doublespeak  and Big Brother may be with us in ways we have yet to realize  see for example Hardt and Negri s Empire   Even though Fukuyama declared the End of History and made reference to the last man  we are left to wonder if liberal democracy really did  win  and whether there is not something strangely Ingsoc about our own time  After all  we continue to see examples of doublethink and doublespeak in our own politics and times  see for example the works of Derek Gregory and other Critical Geopolitics scholars  There is also no reason to believe that the conceits of domination through party rule are over  It seems to me that our postmodern times contain the seeds of many transformations including those that render us dominated by party or a kind of Big Brother  As I was reading this book  many people commented to me   Didn t you read this book in high school   Certainly  the book seemed a bit dated  After all  while I was reading it it seemed that I had read the book without ever having really read it  The words doublethink and doublespeak  to say nothing of Big Brother  were already familiar without having read the first page  The scenes and nomenclature of Orwell have been used a number of movies and TV shows from Star Trek to that weird gun Kung Fu movie with Christian Bale  I m not sure if negative utopian books  Fromm s word  though wouldn t  dystopia  be more apt   have really ever evolved beyond 1984  But even if the book is too familiar for most readers  it still did have a few surprises  especially at the end  Many of the political landscapes are familiar  We saw them in Hitler s Germany  Stalin s Soviet Union  and still see it today in Kim Jong Il s North Korea  But the details have an infinite ability to amuse  How can one ever forget a world where machines write novels as humans toil in fields  It is not until you hear O Brien s rants and see the lengths the party goes to control the inner reality of a person that the book really earns its fifth star  The political philosophy of the book is also highly evolved  Orwell makes the bold claim that a socialist world will still have a proletariat and that despite our best wishes  they will not save us from corrupt oligarchies  The proletariat never revolt is the message throughout the book and even in the end  the author does not waver  sorry for the spoiler    It s also good that we arrive at the book in 1984  though we cannot be sure of the time  and not later  As O Brien explains later  Winston is the last man  though this is somewhat in dispute   Julia might be the  last man  as well  but she seems totally uninterested in understanding the system she rebels against  only the carnal pleasure of rebellion  One of the things that is essential for this book  the one area where you must sustain your disbelief at  is that there is a human at the center of it  In other words  there is someone who is not a product of Ingsoc or Party ideology  Eric Fromm s conclusion states  Orwell assumes that humans have something innate inside them that struggles for peace  justice  and liberty  Whether Orwell believed this or not  he probably did  it is absolutely essential for the novel  You have to care about poor Winston and his varicose ulcer  You have to feel his suffocation and long for freedom as he does  And you have to see his transformation at the end  In order for the book to work  there has to be things such as love and orgasms  O Brien and the party of course have vowed to eliminate the orgasm   By the end of the book though  we are left to wonder if there will be anything left human to carry on a story in another ten years  After all  O Brien calls Winston  the last man   This of course may not necessarily be true  since O Brien  and it is assumed other members of the inner party  are aware that there were once things that existed outside the party and the demands of Ingsoc  The end of the book reminded me very much of Shusaku Endo s Silence  perhaps because both books end with torture and the obliteration of a person s inner self  In that back too  the novel ends with the main character a shell of a person  One of his friends too is a shell of a character  Much like 1984 also  the main character is forced to work on a project which upholds the credos of a regime he doesn t believe in  in this case xenophobic tenets of Tokugawa Japan  It s not an easy thing to read  but if the author has done his work and made us care for the character  hope that he can somehow resist  then we endure the torture with him to a degree   I read this in high school and remember thinking that 1984 was so far in the future it seemed impossible for some of the issues in the book to be relevant  It is amazing how many things have come true  or are comprehensible now  I think the border between  political correctness  and the concept of  thought crimes  is actually scary  I am also amazed at the role of the media  Until the last 20 25 years  the idea of a biased media was something I never thought I d see  I remember talking in class about propaganda and thinking it couldn t happen here and now I am all too aware of  interpretive journalism   Once a country loses the objective voice of truth everything can be manipulated  1984  isn t fanciful thinking  it is the natural extension of things that are taking place right now  Some have called our government a  nanny states  and the government in 1984 is a logical extension of that kind of thinking   Big Brother knows best    and then  Big Brother is watching   Disclosure I get this nice edition from the well known website of Planet eBooks  It was a nice attempt to reach something that was impossible to reach during the hot Political days  I have it in PDF Form My Plot First of all  this not a real story that happens  It is just an Imagination of the world after the war the Orwell used to participate in  In fact it was all a world that consist of three powerful states  Oceania  Eurasia  and Eastasia  Our main focus lay on Oceania the country that was Ruled by the INGSOC the Abbreviation of English Socialism  Inside Oceania was the Protagonist Winston Smith  a functioned outer party member who used to work as a Rectifier in the Department of Records in the Ministry of Truth  Our Protagonist used to lead a life full of fears and hatred due to the constriction level that the INGSOC Party used to implement on its citizens  Oceania divided into three main social entities  Big Brother at the top followed by the Inner party Members followed by the Outer Party Member and finally the Proles who last the Social Pyramid  Anyway Winston was leading a normal life at the beginning of the story  until the day when he decided to write a diary to the future  It was obvious that the Citizens were forbidden from such a thing including writing diaries and Thinking of the pasts in addition to the falsification of the facts that the party said  Winston go against these norms as a rebellion  This fact annoyed the Inner Party member called O Brien  and thus he pull the trigger saying to Winston that he  will meet him in a Place where there is no Darkness   Winston grows hasty with this statement  He get enthusiastic with O Brien  Days past when he fall in love with Julia an outer party member  there meeting first began with Hatred toward her till he get the small paper saying  I love You   They pass some fine days together in a secret way  Winston lent a room in Mr  Charrington Junk shop  There he spent most of his time Julia  Until the date when they both met O Brien  Winston shows an ardent feeling to get against the party and to rebel over it  O Brien gave Winston a Falsified sort of the BOOK that Emmanuel Goldstein pretend to write  In fact Winston put a blind thrust toward O Brien and that s what leads him to be arrested and tortured by the Taught Police in the Ministry of Love where O Brien was his chief torturer  In the End Winston and Julia both got enough Torture and Winston had a brain wash  In the last Chapter Winston became a daily customer of the Chestnut Tree Cafe  he get another Job in the making of the Newspeak dictionary  Finally the shot him secretly and thus was the Finish line of the story Positive and Negative Aspects I would say that this story was the worst of all time  It was obvious that the INGSOC was somehow like an imitation of the Russian Socialist party during the Soviet Union  but the Laws used here in the book were exaggerated  People were deprived from thinking and from learning  from every aspect of good life  Besides it was unsuccessful attempt to imagine a party that was going to kill the sex instinct and the language as well  the INGSOC was trying to kill all the Human aspects of life and to make from the citizens as dog that do not dare to say anything front of the Party  Everything the party said is right and ineligible to be discussed  Besides falsifying the past was not something new to us  Indeed It was negative to imagine a world that will never stop from war  It was a Horror inside Horror but this time in an imaginative way  Another bad aspects inside the story  was the Chapters of Goldstein s book  It was a devastating to read a long meaningless Chapter that O Brien deceived Winston s with  I read them and I feel a Headache inside my Head  Because it was a Book inside a Book  Finally It was meaningless too to read the last appendix of the Newspeak  because nothing is worth reading inside it but a minor Glimpse of how the party changed it language form My Personal Reaction Actually I wasn t fond of the story so much  Besides I was negatively impressed especially by the manner of Torture that the Ministry of Love used toward every convicted inside it  I expect George Orwell will deny any sort of torture but in fact he was teaching the world of how to implement these kinds of torture  I put a shame to the world  because much of the methods that are used by the party in the Book are used nowadays in the world of our Generation especially in the Arab world  where the King represent the Big Brother who can t get be reached to or he should not criticized  or so on and so forth  I was waiting from the writer to ban these forms of killing the human nature but he was otherwise reviving the weak instinct of Power inside every ruler today  The Death of Winston represent the status of human who want to live with mind and Logic  It was a nice symbolizing but a worse teaching for the other part  In another way I gave this book 5 stars just because of its literature attempt  but in fact the contents according to the Newspeak are DOUBLE PLUS UNGOOD Recommendations I don t recommend this book to anybody  Otherwise it should be banned  due to its negative teachings of such negative forms of life  It was a Book full of worst aspects of life and full of political problems  If someone read it I am sure he will get full of Intoxication  Without forgetting that this Book used to be Banned in several countries  All I would say is that for people who want to read it should care much of themselves by not implementing the methods of life used inside it   This was the first adult novel I ever read  I must have been 13 or 14  I had borrowed it from the library  I remember reading it and getting to the rough parts and looking around to make sure nobody was looking over my shoulder  It was the early part of the early decade of the century and as a young conservative american I was wading chest deep in propaganda for the newly minted Iraq war that we were assured would clean up as nicely as the last one  The book resonated with me on a carnal level that I wasn t able to articulate quite yet  and I m glad I read it   it sowed seeds in me about war
