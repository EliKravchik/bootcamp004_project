Amazing book  Funny  interesting  intellectual  yet understandable  With the amount of interesting adventures and hobbies Feynman mastered during his life up to that point  it makes me wonder if professors actually do any work  But of course they do Richard Feynman  physicist  professor  Manhattan Project er  Nobel laureate  amongst many other prestigious titles  writes about his many shenanigans as he grew up that did not stop even until his professional adulthood  He portrays his sense of wonder  persistence  which is why he mastered so many things like cracking safes  painting  and playing the drums   and humor throughout the whole book as we get a glimpse inside the mind of one of the greatest scientists in human history Just read it   smile  Amazing tales and insights from one of the greatest minds of the 20th century  Feynman is so down to earth  you can t help but admire his lifestyle and philosophy on everything he interacts with  A must read  What an incredible joy to read this book  His enthusiasm  humour  and curiousity jumps out vividly from the pages as if Feynman himself were telling you his story  I loved every chapter of it   A classic  One of the first  auto biographies I ever read  from my dad s book shelf   which may explain my ongoing fascination with Richard Feynman   Reading this book really feels like I m having beers with Feynman himself   I have to say  he is one of my favorite authors and probably one of my favorite thinkers  I like the way that his brain works and the way his mouth conveys thoughts directly   This is one of the best books that I ve read lately  It s incredible to see how a Physics Nobel Prize Winner had such a curiosity and tried everything  from playing drums to painting  Funny   lots of life lessons to take away  Loved this book  It s an easy read and still full of insights  Feynman is pretty amazing  definitely recommended for everyone not just readers with interest in Physics  This was one of those consistently solid books that built up to an even solider ending  so solid that it deserved a sustained slow clap  if only the author were still around to hear it Feynman as a narrator is hilarious  intelligent  mischievous  adventurous  and   perhaps most importantly   honest  I get the strong impression that these are traits that would have described him as a human being  an artist  a scientist  a friend  and a musician as well  No matter what he tackled  he seemed to approach it with the same humble confidence  the same commitment to truth and discovery  the same self deprecating nonchalance  From lock picking to fluid physics  he was afraid neither of pretending that he knew more than he did  nor of admitting that he didn t know as much as he pretended  His devotion to inquisitiveness  to trying and questioning everything  led to a remarkably unique and influential life  An inspiration to scientists everywhere I recently finished a biography of Paul Erdos which talked about Stanislaw Ulam s contributions at Los Alamos  and it was fascinating to tie it together with insight on the project from Feynman s perspective  All these phenomenally interesting minds  In one place  At one time  Knowing that such minds exist even today  as yet undiscovered  even   gives me an eager anticipation for all the collaborations  explorations  and conversations I can look forward to as I move ahead in my field  The last chapter particularly spoke to me  as a student of psychology   which Feynman describes  in his 1974 address  as  cargo cult science   I feel like I learned more about myself as a scientist than I did about Feynman in reading this book  And I learned a hell of a lot about Feynman   Hilarious and fun to read  Both funny and informative  Feynman is a physicist who worked on the Manhattam project and won the Nobel Prize for his important contributions to quantum mechanics  The book contains various incidents from his life  tragic  interesting  and amusing  What a great life lived   Can you imagine being in this physics class     It would have been AMAZING  Great stories from a man who truly found the live in his work First memoir read here  really really good likely because Richard Feynman is an easily idoliazble character  Loved Leighton s transcription decisions  did evoke a sense that Feynman was orating these stories  a favorite chapter story  Meeeeeeeeeee   might be the best titling  too  and the whole thing s title was fitting  as I m sure they thought  Found the bits of math tricks and science wisdom delicious trivia  like to get the squares near 50 you subtract 100x the difference of the number from 50 squared and then add double the difference to that Found Feynman s exploration of art wonderful and inspirational  brought back the drawing exercise of not looking at what you were drawing which I ve heard before His dabbling in music  both Brazil and drums  delighted as well  His attitude toward things like that inspires  right  He exploited pretention and laziness nicely  and he admits his mistakes too Feynman is incredibly lucky at points  which might or might not be true  but makes a good story  so I was on the look out for  makes a good story  twists  biases Chapter notes He Fixes Radios By Thinking   Inventing his own math symbols and realizing it wasn t great for communicating to others  String Beans  Innovation is a very difficult thing in the real world  at least for him as a kid surrounded by adults  He read the Life of Leonardo Who Stole the Door   deaf dumb dance anecdote  Latin or Italian   Made me think of Life Is BeautifulAlways Trying to Escape  Fun experiment with dreaming  lucid dreaming  and the teacher s Charlie Brownish droning   Meeeeeeeeeee   Hypnotism recounting A Map of the Cat  Why do you memorize muscles  or bunches of things you can look up Mindreaders  Or  how they work The Amateur Scientist  Nice anecdote with ants  ending with a way to get rid of ants humanely Testing Bloodhounds  An investigation into the powers of human smell Los Alamos from Below  Fun with censors  other issues with military bureaucracy  meeting Bohr  has the wonderful skill

deficiency is good if the army s involved  sort of The Dignified Professor  Brilliant ideas is  if people expect something of you  it s on them  not you  if you don t live up to it  You have no

http   www youtube com watch v N1pIYI5JQLEMakes me smile to see that after I spent time with him  you don t analyze such sunlit perfection you sit back and just bask in its warm and splendor inexorably delightful    To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement  I reread it endlessly growing up  and it is one of the few books that ended up shaping me as a human book  Feynman s stories are an ode to rule breaking  original thought  cleverness  and the general pleasure of being a gadfly  Beneath it all  you can sense the feeling of wonder Feynman has for the universe and its laws  This is the book I d give to any science minded adolescent   Undisputedly the best book I have read so far  If you are a avid reader and haven t read this book  then you haven t read anything at all  Having heard about Dr  Feynman from my friends so many times  I was curious to know why all of them were such big fans of him and this book gave me all the answers  The book is so well written that you feel that you have been part of Feynman s life somewhere sometime  The concluding paragraph was icing on the cake    So I have just one wish for you   the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described  and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization  or financial support  or so on  to lose your integrity  May you have that freedom    Excellent read  Don t worry if you aren t into physics  this book is all about simplicity  Feynman will trance you with his wild ways  so you will surly enjoy  This book is awesome  Extremely intelligent  funny  well written and above all  a shining example of what being unique can bring you  I put this aside after reading only a few chapters  He seemed to be so enamored with his abilities  and his bragging turned me off  However  I eventually went back to finish it and I am so glad that I did  I enjoyed it tremendously  Maybe my attitude toward him changed or maybe as he got older  it is sort of chronological   it didn t seem that he was bragging as much as sharing with the reader what he knew and how he went about learning about almost everything  It would have been most interesting to have known him  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know a little about a lot  written by someone who knew a lot about a lot  Super easy and fun read from a genius mind  What a guy Feynman was  He showed in innate genius at a young age that persisted throughout his life  Just the few things I really admire about him   instead of going on sabbatical he completeley switched disciplines from physics to biology and actually did some pretty interesting experiments  He was incredibly clever and managed to crack several safes with some of the most top secret information about the Los Alamos project and the atomic bomb which he worked on  He taught in Brazil  played in a Samba band at Carnival  then upon leaving the University at which he taught gave a talk about the fact that the Brazilian higher education system was basically a joke and that students were only memorizing a bunch of things and never actually LEARNING anything  He went from being completely inept at drawing to actually selling portraits  which totally blows my mind because most people would say  well I can t draw  that s it   When he won the Nobel Prize  he didn t even want it  This book is packed with these fabulous anecdotes about this intelligent  witty  clever  innovative genius physicist  My favorite part of the book is the last few pages where he talks about scientific integrity  He says   If you ve made up your mind to test a theory  or you want to explain some idea  you should always decide to publish it whatever way it comes out  If we only publish results of a certain kind  we can make the argument look good  We must publish BOTH kinds of results   When I looked him up on Wikipedia I found that he developed two rare forms of cancer  Liposarcoma and Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia  dying shortly after a final attempt at surgery for the former on February 15  1988  aged 69  His last recorded words are noted as  I d hate to die twice  It s so boring   This book is simply a reprint some of the material from the wonderful  The Pleasure of Finding Things Out  For anyone who s read that book   I wouldn t bother reading this one  There s very little new material in it and it s less detailed Despite that  it is still a fantastic read  For anyone who hasn t read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading As a scientist  I can tell you that Richard Feynman s Horizon episode from 1981   from the transcripts of which  much of this book is taken   is one the main reasons I became a research scientist  I ve watched it a million times  This book is the written form of that  It s a perfect description of what it really is to know something  Of how to accurately determine something   not just in science but in everyday life  It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking  It is a very human account of a man who  even to other great scientists  seemed god like in his intellect  how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems  though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals  From a more shallow perspective  this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy   Narrator Raymond Todd really launches into this classic work with gusto  making it my favorite edition of this oft published work  Combined with these stories appearing in his lectures and other anthologies  many of these tales are like old friends  I delight in hearing of his pranksterism and insight and anti establishment behavior  From Los Alamos a bomb research to university academia to the Nobel prize  there is a lot of arc to the professional side of his life  From his wife s death in the 40s to bar girls and bathroom bar fights  there is a lot of not much held back personal life  too  Some of my favorite parts are his exploration of his potential in percussion and drawing as well as taking an objective  scientific approach to picking up bar girls and understanding the ways of a professional gambler  Also high on my list is his experiments in John C  Lilly s sensory deprivation tank  Something that still rings true is his rant against  Cargo Cult Science   even if there are doubts his quoted rat experiment medical research and even softer sciences like psychology Why am I always irascible after reading Feynman  Thoroughly enjoyed this book  A magnificent exploration of the breadth of this man s curiosity  Life affirming  education boosting  reality questioning  wonderful   I still can t believe how funny this book is considering it s written by a physicist  The anecdotes are one of a kind and you actually learn a few things along the way   Richard Feynman u ovoj knjizi ne pise o kvantnoj elektrodinamici  polju u kojemu je dao najveci doprinos fizici  Ovo su  kako i sam podnaslov kaze Adventures of a Curious Character  avanture znatizeljnog neobicnog lika  Feynman ovdje pise o nekim njemu najzanimljivijim dogadajima iz zivota koji su zabavni za ispricati  O tome kako se  vec kao mali  poceo interesirati kako stvari funkcioniraju  Poceo je s rastavljanjem jednog radio prijemnika  a uskoro postao majstor za njih za cijelo susjedstvo  Feynman je sudjelovao i u razvoju atomske bombe  dok je istovremeno pokusavao provaliti u sef jednog od vojnih zapovjednika   ne zato da bi nesto ukrao iz sefa  nego samo zato  jer su mu rekli da je taj sef nemoguce obiti  Taj dio je i jedan od najzanimljivijih u knjizi  Samo od toga bi se mogla napraviti dobra komedija Mnoge stvari su ga zanimale  pa cak i kako mravi komuniciraju i kako znaju pravi put do hrane i da li se moze istovremeno govoriti i brojati u sebi  Feynman je svirao i bongo bubnjeve  Bavio se i slikarstvom  I uz sve to dobio Nobelovu nagradu za fiziku  Knjiga je stvarno uzitak za citanje  ima puno zanimljivih situacija i humora  Nevjerovatno je da je to sve jedan covjek uspio prozivjeti  Rijetko je koji fizicar teoreticar imao tako uzbudljiv zivot  Feynman takoder pise otvoreno i iskreno  pa se  uz zabavu  moze saznati i nesto o samom covjeku  njegovom karakteru  pa i o njegovim manama  Nakon citanja knjige cini mi se da sam barem malo i upoznao samog Richarda Feynmana  Barem onako  iz videnja   Surely You re Joking Mr  Feynman  are the memoirs of Richard Phillips Feynman  a very interesting man and incidentally a noble laureate in Physics  Ralph Leighton collected these narrations over a span of seven years when the two drummed together  It is hard to believe that a single man can do so much in a lifetime as Feynman did  These are his experiences with the world in general seen from the perspective of a very curious and scientific pair of eyes  told in just the same flamboyant and uninhibited manner which is the hallmark of Richard Feynman  Feynman talks about his journey from repairing radios in his childhood to MIT and Princeton days  to working on the atomic bomb  gambling in Vegas  learning to play music and paint to the point of being famous  visiting strip joints in America and beaches of Brazil  and what not  One cannot help but wonder  how audacious a faker could he be  Could it be possible that he has been faking all along  as far as the book is concerned  Read Full review at Aesthetic Blasphemy and do drop in a comment to let me know what you think     I was never a big fan of biographies  or autobiographies for that matter but Mr Feynman definitely changed that  He has a way of telling some short chapters of his life that brings the reader into that time of his history  feeling like an old friend of the physicist  Not only that  but the content of the book will also wake on the reader some weird ideas  I at least couldn t resist trying to find which object my friends had just touched just by smelling their hands and then the objects in the room  It s simply fantastic  to know a little bit of the world through the mind of a simple but highly intelligent fellow  Certainly I d have liked to be Feynman s pupil  I ve had a lot of fun reading this book It s been my first contact with Mr  Feynman and I can say now that I m a big fan  Rarely I ve seen an individual with his desire to learn new things and explore everything for himself  It s a reminder that life can be so interesting if you keep an open mind  a curious disposition and give everything that you can in all that you do   Thought I hated biographies before this book  Delightful  From the wonderful rascal physicist  Best chapter title  could be  Alfred Nobel s Other Mistake    I guess dynamite would be the first one   Feynman apparently thought the Nobel Prize itself was a joke  though he himself won that prize for physics  This collection of marvelous stories gives insight into the intellectual independence and curiousity that could be considered a hallmark of great scientists such as this one  After having read this book it feels like you got to know Richard P  Feynman  And I think he has written some interesting thouhgts in this book  However  most of the book is about how he did quite some amazing stuff Science  drawing  going in bars and more  and how he felt doing it  Awsome book  and its really fun to hear about his life and the contrasts he had as a physics professor and what he did  An interesting read which can completely change your perception on scientists  What a man and what an inspiring life  Who said nerds are boring  P  S  Couldn t help relating him to Rancho  sans the friendship part  from 5 point someone  This is the first book I read about Feynman  which made me want to read everything written by him and about him  Great book  highly recommended to everyone  whether you have a physics background or not  I think so highly of Richard Feynman  and love this book  It s written in a light conversational style  Strangely  it had the feel of a self published book  I m sure if he were still alive  he would be ruling self publishing world  putting out a few books a year  The man was definitely an overachiever I wrote a rather long winded post about him and the book on my blog  It s a little too rambley for Goodreads  Click over if you feel like reading it  You ve been warned   http   palomameir com 2015 10 07 sure    Delightful read  offering humorous insights into one of the original scientific minds and multiple faceted personalities of the 20th century  Articulate  funny and kind  A wonderful book  Richard P  Feynman is a scientific genius  Nobel Prize winner in physics  a genius of mischief and an owner of insatiably curious mind    this makes for the funniest and thought provoking book at the same time  You don t have to know anything about physics to enjoy this book  Feynman is so brilliant that a book about one of America s top physicists doesn t ask the reader to know anything about science beforehand  The book starts slow  but it quickly becomes apparent how rich a life Richard Feynman lead  His tendency to seek new experiences is inspiring  He reminds me very much of Bill Murray  Scientist are funny  No really  We are  Feynman lived such a big and diverse life  It is fun to get a glimpse inside his very hilarious and brilliant mind  Neveroiatno ostroumnye istorii ot vydaiushchegosia cheloveka

kakuiu nibud  shutku samogo Feinmana    Thank you Mr  Feynman for the incredible experience I had while reading this book  I hope that finally you re able to strike up a conversation with that beautiful girl in the hot tub in heaven   if some one asks me what is the title of the book you most enjoyed my answer is definitly  surely you re jocking  Mr Feynman  Richard Feynman is an amazing person  He personifies fearless intellectual curiosity  creative ingenuity and an emotional openness  His intolerance for pretentiousness and willingness to find simple  direct solutions to complex problems are delivered in a writing style that is clear and accessible  Inspiring but also first rate entertainment  Tip  catch him on YouTube speaking himself  He s joyful and adventurous  Perhaps as important a twentieth century figure as all  maybe including Einstein  Father of nanotechnology among many other accomplishments  Egocentric even for a compilation of memoirs  Nonetheless  Feynman has convinced me that he was indeed a badass  Great book  Love Mr Feynman A marvelous book you can read just over the weekend  I purchased this one from University library many many years ago  around 2004  This and other Feynman books are much less expensive and describes the curious character of the most talked about scientist of the last century who is considered in the top 10 list of all times as a scientist  Here he spans the book with marvelous humor and personalized anecdotes  His wit  character and intellectual as well as scientific honesty had made him the eye candy of every scientist and geeks world wide  His life was the most studied and most criticized  It does not leave him below any criteria although you will occassionally see misinformed and overzelous people making unfounded remarks about his mental inclination  Befiting of a worldly genius   Funny stories from my favorite physicist  Including some from the Manhattan project  I freakin LOVE this book    It makes me want to rip apart a radio  udivitel nyi chuvak  etot Feinman kstati  po knige sniat fil m  no tam tol ko dramaticheskaia istoriia s zhenoi otobrazhena  i vsiomozhno voobshche ne smotret  After reading this collection of stories and anecdotes told by Nobel laureate Richard P Feynman about his life  I have become a Richard P Feynman fan  I ve just recently been introduced to Dr  Feynman  This guy is the whole package  Smart  funny and thought provoking  His anecdotes are all entertaining  many are informative  I was not aware he worked on the bomb  his stories revolving around his time in Los Alamos were among my favorites  His ability to pick any problem apart and think about it logically is pretty inspiring  Recommend this book to anyone  people should be reading books like this by amazing people instead of self help books by dubious authors with the wrong intentions   Funny and intriguing  It s definitely worth the reading  ainhnangsuue elmniiaesdngaihehnthuengchiiwitthiimiisiisankh

attachment to the ever demanding and boring  according to laypeople  field of Theoretical Physics He can learn to make good enough paintings to be shown in an one man exhibition  He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre carnival seasons in a city of Brazil  He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award  He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena  He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination  analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep  by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry  He can learn many languages  He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls  He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to  Despite all of this  he can still win a Nobel Prize Richard Feynman  the coolest Physicist ever  shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child like curiousity about the world and don t let it fade away with passing years of your life  Before reading this book  I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don t want losing my other fields of interest  So one of the greatest teachers  Feynman  showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time  you can pursue whatever you want This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people  who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate  One of the reviews on Goodreads says that  the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself  I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that  I could do it   he is showing that  it can be done by you too   So much rant for the ignorant laypeople Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman  having fun   the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo science and scientific integrity  He experimented with much of pseudo science including psychics  hallucinations and dream interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena  He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo science  About his remarks on scientific integrity  it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science  and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system  He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants  You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be  If you don t be what they want you to be  it s a failing of their judgement  not your own   A quote that could be misinterpreted too  but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words  After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project  he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics  He was teaching Physics but he didn t think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him  That s when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it  He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize  The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring  if my elaborations here don t make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part In conclusion  this is one of the books which you can include in your list of  Life changing books   You can read it again and again  everytime you ll learn something new  Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life  Everytime  you ll see how to live a life that is full of Life   Start here to learn about physics  the scientific method  one of our great physicists and so much more  Then you can move on to his other works      Read this in high school and it stuck with me  Really funny stories of a math physics freak This is a MUST READ because Feynman is fascinating and funny and because you must read to begin to have any understanding of what happened and what s screwy  Did this via audiobook and hated the narrator  but absolutely loved the stories  I read this book  actually listened to it on audiobook  while going through an uncertain time in my life  where I was searching for meaning  Feynman was a great inspiration to go back and learn to play with life  and to challenge myself to understand more about everything  I am in university now working towards a research scientist degree  as a non traditional  i e  OLD  student  in no small part because of the inspiration I received from this and several other Feynman books and lectures  If you read the stories as Feynman being alone in being exceptionally talented in everything  then I m sure he does sound annoying  If  however  you consider that most everyone has some degree of talents such as these that they just don t bother pursuing  I think you may find that  like me  you can get inspiration here to do more with your life  Great learning experience through Feynman s anecdotes  Really liked his writing style and learned quite a few things applicable towards successful problem solving in the field of physics  what a man  pure genius   and so wonderfully written    A great collection of short biographical works by one of the greatest physicists in the 20th century  While they are short and sometimes reused the los alamos one shows up in another collection  they do give great insight into a genius and how he viewed the world  The part that stuck out to me was that he was always curious  Which is essential to science  Great memoirs and a must read for any aspiring scientist or anyone who likes reading about them  In this book anyone might find a fantastic approach to life  the universe and everything else   What a hoot  He is so funny  The best book I have ever read  I d recommend this book to any self doubting scientist or engineer  like myself  By reading about Feynman s attitude towards science  you realize that he starts on the same page as the rest of us Also  a very entertaining read  Rarely you see books about physicians  that are written so funny  By the way he has written it himself  so it s an autobiography  which is all the more astonishing A really good book  oh man  what a phenomenal book  so good  I d like to keep all its secrets  humor and life lessons for myself  NOBODY READ IT  From one of the most fascinating minds of the 20th century  Feynman weaves an amazingly true account of his life  replete with tragedy and success   and a bit of ego  These are truly the adventures ofa curious character which will have you laughing very hard indeed  BTW  I bought his lectures on physics which explained some principles to me  sad to say  for the very first time  this man had a grasp of the very simplicity of the universe along with its immense complexity  The amazing part was that he treated them exactly the same This is the guy who brought down the liars at NASA and Morton Thiokol over the Challenger disaster by submerging an O ring in a glass of ice water and then breaking it in half in front of a television camera  proving that it became brittle when cold  Just an amazing mind  Had it in my library  I find I go back and read it over again and again throughout the years   Brilliant  Very funny and educational  Its a great book nice and mathematical Plus important encore  il a vecu une vie interessante   His amazing character  intelligence  and passion really shine through in this book  If you like Richard Feynman  his lectures  documentaries or his quirky personality  then you will love this biography  If not  then there s no way I could even begin to explain to you why you should read it The book itself is a collection of anecdotes as told by Feynman over the years  transcribed by Ralph Leighton  Therefore it reads like a night out in the pub with your friends  but in a more organized and sober way By reading this book you won t get much insight into how scientists are as people  because Feynman is a truly unique character  But it gives you fleeting epiphanies  because by reading this biography you will come to understand that which makes scientists tick is science itself  And this theory of mine is best expressed by a Feynman quote that you won t find in this book    Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself  The principle is that you must not fool yourself  and you are the easiest person to fool    Of course  any such theory should be not taken at face value  but put under the test    Because if it disagrees with experiment  it s wrong       I m paraphrasing Feynman here  I recently re read the autobiography   Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   I first read this book in high school  and was fascinated by his stories of his work on the atomic bomb  Since that time  I ve achieved my Bachelor s degree in Physics  and it makes me laugh even more  Whether you re a theoretical physicist or a brick layer  or anything in between  this book is full of insightful humor  only some of which is caused by a Physicist s unique way of looking at the world and not understanding the social requirements of certain situations The title comes from the response of a very British woman asking if he would like milk or lemon in his tea  He asks for both  Anyone who has mixed milk and lemon juice knows it would ruin whatever tea it was added to  Who wants to drink curdled milk Feynman s insights in the book range from his experience cracking safes to cutting layers of red tape and why  as well as a passionate call for a return to pure science  This section at the end had a greater impact on me now than it did in High School  all the more because it hasn t been heeded in the intervening decades  I echo Feyman s call for true science to make a resurgence  When science is held at the mercy of the businesses who fund it  the businesses can pick and choose the results they want  thus destroying the validity of the study altogether  If you run an experiment 100 times  you will probably find one run that indicates the opposite of the other 99 This is a fun and interesting read  no matter what level you have at understanding Physics    Would you like cream or lemon in your tea  Mr  Feynman   It s Mrs  Eisenhart  pouring tea  I ll have both  thank you   I say  still looking for where I m going to sit  when suddenly I hear  Heh heh heh heh heh  Surely you re joking  Mr  Feynman   The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman s career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university  The dean s wife is serving and asks him the above question  Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does  little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it  A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman s life is that he had no time for formalisms  rituals or societal views  He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing  His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape  He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize  To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings It s no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist  but he also had many interests  And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work  There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way  The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas  there s a story about this time  waiting for a showgirl to finish work  He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton  a drumming pal of Richard s  Yes  Feynman played the bongos  So while you have this brilliant man  in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted  there ares some hints that he is a man of his time  Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser  He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in  And so when someone from the twenty first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy  I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them  Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes  But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him  The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life  There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project  There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life  There are also a couple of great chapters on education  one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region  I d recommend this read to most people  It is extremely accessible  with little jargon or technical physics  It talks more on his philosophy of living  learning and how to deal with the world around you  He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on  This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube  It s great to know that we still have so much of him around And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom  There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel  So far as I read further through this book it becomes more apparent that the author does not want to think of this book at a biography but a funny way of denoting Feynman s accomplishments through out life whether small or large and young or old  It has a witty demeanor to it and lets the reader think more into the information presented in the book than what is actually there  Am inceput sa o citesc acum mai multi ani dar nu am ajuns prea departe  Chiar si atunci am tinut minte sfatul implicit din titlu  fii subtil cand altii fac un kkt  Am luat o din nou si am descoperit o inteligenta si savuroasa  Tipul era un geniu atat fascinant cat si bland  Un om care radia de acea carisma care te face sa te gandesti  uite un om care se bucura din plin de viata   It s the author  It s him reading it  My hero      One of the most fun  down to earth books  funny  sad  honest and sometimes humbling annecdotes of this Noble Prize winning genius  His child like awe and curiosity of the world is an inspiration  Particularly love his hatred of pompous fools  and any kind of  Honours  How ironic that he achieved the highest honour of all for a working scientist  It s Feynman s autobiography  Not sure who the  author  is in this version   I really enjoyed this book and learning about this man  Just the kind of guy one would love to have as a friend  Such curiosity  Such lack of pretension  Marvelously enjoyable book   The funniest but intelligent book i have ever read in my life try this  you will read it again  Beautiful  Inspiring  delightful  mind awakening with profundities slipped in that can change your outlook on life  Reading this is like having a funny  charming and sexy theoretical physicist for a companion Don t be misled by the date I finished this book below  This is my second reading  First was about 15 years ago  It s even better now Plus  you can find some of his lectures described in the book on youtube so you can see and hear him tell some of this great stories  What a fun book to read  It reminded me of when I was younger  and my world revolved around Science  The most important chapter for me was the last one  which was about being an ethical scientist  Listen up I haven t even finished reading this book  but I can tell you one thing  READ IT  READ THE DAMN BOOK   I normally don t read through an autobiography or a biography  but this book is the exception  This is the book which will teach you to not give a damn about whether there are other people around you  and to laugh out loud  Seriously  I have not laughed so much and so frequently than the  Mr Gum  series  which is a book still unparalleled with its laughter  inductiveness capabilities  But Mr  Feynman comes a close second   I have no way to guarantee this  but I swear that while yur read this book  you ll add Richard Feynman to the list of dead people you wish you had met at least once  or start a list with him in it  Feynman s autobiography is a funny and insightful journey through the life of one of the greatest minds of our times  Feynman was an extremely witty man in real life  and his humour carries over into the book  He s not afraid to make fun of himself  but at no point does he sell himself short  For anyone interesting in studying physics  like me  Feynman s journey through schooling and his brief descriptions of the works that made him so famous are just priceless  His love for physics really shines through everything he did  and it just makes me want to hit the books and learn everything   An excellent funny  entertaining and interesting collection of stories  This book is amazing  Inspire me  Follow your curiosity and your heart  what makes you happy  No matter what   Do not ever believe your own lies This is my favorite one of all I ever read in my life    I thought it was a fascinating insight into the man whom his peers rated as a genius  Inspiring stories of the life of a genius  Witty and amazing  This book is highly readable   even without a background in science   and gives an insight in the amazing encounters  moments and way of life of a remarkable  and very funny  man  Surely amazed by the life of Feynman  He loved many things  but above all  he loved his thinking  his mind  Enjoyed every page of this book  Feynman the genius  Feynman the physicist   Possessing an excessively curious mind  Richard Feynman has tried out almost everything under the sun  He is the one guy  I can say confidently  who has lived a full life  without any regrets  He has repaired radios and hosted radio talk shows  tried to introduce ground breaking innovation in kitchen appliances  harassed waitresses  spoke fake Italian  interpreted dreams by trying to observe them closely  worked as a chemist in an electroplating company  blew up glass carboys while attempting unsuccessful experiments  took a biology course  validated mathematical theories by simply forming a mental picture and gut instinct  worked as a mechanical engineer in Army  broke locks  assisted in making the first nuclear bomb  chased girls   holds the patent for nuclear airplane  nuclear reactor and nuclear rocket  played  frigideira  in Brazilian Carnaval  played poker with other people s money  took drugs and alcohol only to abandon it later  lived like a Japanese  rocked theoretical physics  made portraits of  many live nude models  argued with Rabbis  fought a losing battle over the deteriorating standards of school textbooks  tried refusing the Nobel Prize  deciphered Mayan Hieroglyphics  played bongos  got people to induce in his mind hallucination      This book has inspired me to do whatever I ever wanted to do so that the day I die  I end up with  practically  no regrets  Feynman was a fully rounded personality  never bound by social conventions in his lifelong pursuit of always satiating his unbridled curiosity I dare you to do more     Incredibly witty and fun to read He was a funny smart man  He really was a curious character  I wish more people were as curious as him  Each chapter talks about a different part of his life  Some of my favorites him as a child working on raidos  his codes between him and his wife and the government intercepting him  and all the practical jokes he played  Highly recommended book  What a fun book  What a funny character this guy must have been  Winning the Nobel prise in physics as well as winning a samba competition in Brazil   Surely note many that have achieved that  not to mention cracking safes and learning from scratch to draw and paint so well as being able to sell drawings    and playing bongo drums for a San Francisco ballet  I recently read a book called  The hundred year old man who climbed out of the window and disappeared  by Jonas Jonasson  It s a wonderful adventure about a guy who meets all kind of interesting people and even gets on the Manhattan project and helps building the atom bomb  A bit unlikely of course  but then again it is a novel  But Feynman does all that and that is a true story  I got the feeling that Jonas Jonasson got the idea for his hundred year old guy from reading about Feynman   A very down to earth and inspirational book  this book is a must read for anyone who hopes to go into the field of modern physics  Richard Feynman was one of the largest figures in the development of modern physics through the 20th century  However  his success was not only in the academic world  but also in the adventures he sought out and his particular way of thinking about problems  Through this cleverly written autobiography  he exposes his truly human way of tackling problems  leaving the reader amazed at his wit and skill  Even if you don t wish to go into the field  it is a remarkably amusing book filled with anecdotes that will keep you giggling  Love the book  3  love the man  3  Feynman made the term  mad scientist  sounded tame  hahaha Un mito  in carne e     cervello  A funny physicist  You bet  Feynman was like not other  Brilliant  funny  human  This is a wonderful inside look into a genius  Don t worry  you don t need a physics degree to enjoy it  Just a love for science and intelligence  I m sad he s gone  physics was moved ahead by this special mind  quantum theory   A short and fun read  Highly recommend it  Great light read  Fantastic book  Must read   A Wonderful  hilarious book by Nobel Prize winner Physicist  Wow  What a life   That man was incredible  truly an inspiration About the book  It is a really funny book and it s about the man s life not about physics  Easy paced and written in a way any man would undestand   Surely that s the Feynman s Way Wheter you like science or not you should read about this amazing man s life  The best book on personal adventure I have ever read  A set of people are genius  but Feynman is a Magician  a safe cracker  practical joker and story teller        Besides he was also a winner of nobel prize in theoretical physics and was part of building the first atomic bomb  I wonder how do you squeeze so much into one person        But that is how magicians are made  This books cannot be described in mere words    it was an experience  Too sad that I am not a student of theoretical physics  didn t have the merit to become one     But may be if I had read this earlier  I may have studied hard enough to become one  gbvtgvf gv gb tbvtthhgghbfffhhh Incredibly funny and light hearted  I have had the pleasure to be smitten by people of Feynman s character type   generally have left their presence drooling with admiration and a certain sort of blessed reassurance that there is sanity in this crazy world This book is not one I would characterize as an  easy read  especially if you don t have a basic   general background in all of the sciences  I consider myself to have a basic background and while grasping most of the stories   quips involving Feynman s fascination with biological concepts  I pretty much got glassy eyed when stumbling through quantum theory  theroms and what have you Nevertheless  this book is very entertaining and gives insight into the workings of a man of enormous curiosity   intelligence and whit It is written in short chapters   each one could be read as a separate story all of which are rich with adventure  sound scientific thinking and humor I think every student from 5th grade through college level should be encouraged to read this book as it is a great lesson in how science is a process of sound thinking  logical reasoning  debate and discussion  success and failure Pick this one up  It is an exceptional insight into a brilliant mind  an interesting character and some background on his   other s contribution to our own American history  The book is written in Feynman s voice and will leave you feeling as if you knew him and begging for the chance to go back in time and have a cup of tea with him  Great book  It s a very fun read  but more than that it shows you how much you can achieve by constantly challenging yourself  Recommend it to everyone  Not so much a book  really  as just a bunch of random anecdotes from one of the most brilliant dudes ever  I really felt like I got to know the guy and the way he thought  Klasika  kdyz to ctu  vzpomenu si  proc mam rad skolu a mysleni  Made me fall in love with Feynman  I loved this autobiography of the short stories of Feynman s life  It is a very interesting collection of stories that show how Feynman learned many different things  He becomes very accomplished in a diverse and different number of activities  Then as he gets better and better at something he begins to show off  The book is very funny and I would recommend it to anyone who likes funny non fiction books   There are many reasons why Richard Feynman is one of the most loved scientific figures  Never mind the importance of his discoveries   he was a great person  which is revealed throughout this book  which has practically nothing to do with science  by the way   The stories are usually entertaining and show his mischievous  fun loving  girl loving  music loving    life loving side  Beyond that  one catches a glimpse of his genius  and of what it means to be a scientist in the purest sense of the word  to always put truth first  and in that respect to never be affected by popular opinion  authority  or one s own personal prejudices  Great read about a great man that s the role model of most physicists  including yours truly    must read book for people with analytical thinking Surely You re Joking Mr  Feynman  1985  written by Richard P  Feynman himself is a biography about his life before he was known for his work with quantum mechanics as a theoretical physicist  The novel is hilarious and had my attention from the very beginning to the very end  The novel highlights some of the times where Mr Feynman used his intelligence to solve problems throughout his life  One of my favourites parts of the novel is when he learns how to crack codes and locks  It was extremely interesting to see how he did it and the science behind how locks work  I recommend this book to anyone who has a sense of humour and loves science  This novel is a easy 5 5  Inspirational    Prin urmare  va doresc un singur lucru   sa aveti norocul de a ajunge intr un loc unde sa va bucurati

Va doresc sa aveti parte de aceasta libertate   Incredible  I have said surely you re kidding too often in this book  This book showed me just how incredible mr  Feynman really is  He is my hero  Damn funny   I really enjoyed this book  I was expecting a lot more references to physics in this book  but the fact that it wasn t the geek out I was expecting did not detract from the allure of the book in the slightest  Feynman was not only a brilliant physicist but also an especially clever  trouble maker   Reading about his various antics made me realize there is an incredible amount of life that we miss living from day to day  I am inspired to make a little more trouble  have some fun  on a regular basis so that if a book were to be written about my life  it won t be boring as hell  http   sibipranav blogspot in 2014 07   During school days  one of my favorite subjects is Physics  For various reasons  not to mention some of the best teachers I ve had  it has remained a favorite subject ever since  I still remember reading books on relativity  QED etc without understanding a single word in the entire book  The Soviet publications on elementary Physics were cheap and easily available  It was just that I have had to read a lot more on basics before even attempting reading one those big volumes  That s when I came across NBT s introduction to basics of Physics series  Thus  a journey into a fascinating world started At some point  my interest moved from physics to the physicists  They were no less interesting than the subject itself  Especially the physicists from the period 1910 30  when giant strides were made in Quantum mechanics   Astronomy   Particle physics etc  The leading physicists of this period starting with Einstein  Bohr  Dirac  Oppenheimer  Pauli  Heisenberg  Schrodinger  Fermi  Born were fascinating by themselves  Each of their biographies is much more interesting and the eccentricities of them and their days are interesting reads by themselves Richard Feynman comes into this list a little later than all these giants  He grew up in the 1930 s depression era New York and studies physics  His semi Auto biography  Surely You re joking  Mr Feynman  is actually a fascinating collection of anecdotes from his life and few of his lectures on education etc  The eccentricity of the genius is what makes the whole thing interesting and the inner workings of the life towards the research he does is as fascinating as the man himself  But the book is not about physics or about the physicist itself  It is about a very interesting person who goes through a lot of crazy situations in life and comes out of it always laughing  While re reading it recently  I was wondering whether it is possible to convert the adventures into bedtime stories for the kids It is a long time habit of mine to tell stories to the kids before they go to sleep  Now that Sibi has grown up and Vanathy knows more stories than me  I do not do it often  But there are days the kids want to hear a story and we usually take turns to tell stories to each other  Its fun and there is nothing that makes going to bed more interesting So I tried to start the experiment by first breaking up the story into incidents that can be made into little bed time story capsules  Following is the list bed time stories I could make out of the book 1  He Fixes radios by Thinking2  Who stole the door 3  The deaf and dumb ball4  Latin or Italian   Vanathy loved this5  The Chief Chemist6  The Princeton episode 7  The first visit to Brazil   Learning Portuguese8  Los Alamos   Adventures9  Safecracker Feynman10  Second visit to Brazil   Carnival episode11  Nobel laureate 12  Painter FeynmanEach of these episodes will not run beyond 5 10 minutes in narrating and makes for a fantastic story in each itself  After the second one  the kids were hooked and Vanathy started asking for  more Feynman stories    Still Life    FeynmanWhen I read this book first in March 1999  I happen to mark the books with dates and place I bought them   I threw open the door to a person whom I ve admired for his curiosity and for not taking life too seriously  It also showed that not all scientists are dour and the fascinating life of Feynman makes it fascinating  What I told the kids is that if they can get through life with that same kind of curiosity and  live life in full  then there is nothing more they will want  There are many morals that are inherent in each of these stories that are hugely relevant to today s students if only we care to tell it or ask them to read the same  A great book that still surprises me and more importantly gives me joy every time I read it  This time the joy multiplied through the kids   Physics is like sex Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man  known as a teacher  lover  master safe cracker  who stole papers of Manhattan Project   fan of Las Vegas s strip clubs  exceptional liar  musician  artist and probably the most brilliant  influential  and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post World War II era How does one define a role model  A prodigy  hard worker  achiever  winner in the field one is interested in  right  Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P  Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists  He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher  But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist  he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries First let me just mention some of his works During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U S  atomic bomb project at Princeton University  1941 42   He was co awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work  Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology Enough with the facts already  Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing  you should leave mysterious clues  Feynman was a master of desk wiping  lock picking and safe cracking  He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster  He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind  Why  Oh just for the fun of course If you have to lie  lie with full confidence  It doesn t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not  Even if you are unsure  don t show it  Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation  Example  Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language  When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong  he replied that the man didn t understand the depth of the recital If you re in Vegas and short in money  act as drunk friends of the strippers  I don t even have the courage and experience to explain this one Love what you do and do what you love  In his own words   Physics is like sex  sure it may give some practical result  but that s not why we do it  Know yourself  find where you belong and embrace your faults   I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something   That s the trouble with not being in your own field  You don t take it seriously   All the time you re saying to yourself   I could do that  but I won t   which is just another way of saying that you can t  And most important of all  don t lie to yourself   The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool  Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband  Feynman was a phenomenal teacher  yes  this man was everything one wishes to be   His series of books  The Feynman Lectures on Physics  is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having  simplicity  beauty  unity     presented with enthusiasm and insight  Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects  he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life  To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described   I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there  A boy who knew how radios work  a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding  an undergraduate who stole a door  the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test  Trinity test  without wearing glasses  and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn t like to answer too many phone calls   Mr  Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together  Why  For the glory of knowledge of course  He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths Thus like many many other students of physics  if I m asked about my role model  it is none other than R  P  Feynman  a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things  Reading about all his life and life s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face  The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance Read this semi autobiographic book to experience something like never before In his precious word  a person should live a life   where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization  or financial support  or so on  to lose your integrity  May you have that freedom    A best book to learn about a practical genius of twentieth century One of my favorite books of all time   My favorite of the Feynman Lectures and most thought provoking  For anyone looking to go into physics  this is a must read  It will give an entirely different take on the entire subject  A classic book by the famous theoretical physicist  Real life adventures in the technical field and life lessons  Recommend for technical people  This is one of the few books written by the physicist   one of the most brilliant persons of our time   for everyone  It is not only readable  and enjoyable  it is even lovable  and a must for anyone who is even remotely interested in anything interesting  When he was on the manhattan project he learned about locks and was able to pick most locks without much of tools  and in fact took out number locks easily  As a result they took action   not to make themselves safer  which was his intention in demonstrating his skill  but in passing a memo to the effect that he should not be allowed near anything locked  Feynman had a brilliance that shone in whichever direction his conciousness turned  and this is manifest in this book in more than one way   that the book is brilliant would be an understatement  and that it was by a brilliant man equally so  He writes about all he did and tried to do  and one can see how well he did how much  He is finally able after many years to write about what affected him deeply with hurt  the loss of his first love and first wife at a very young age  They married knowing she was dying shortly  It is a moving episode  and one sympathises with his silence about it  with his dealing with it till he came to terms with it emotionally  One respects him for not jumping into another relationship with a hurry  a boomrang action most ordinary males not only take but are in fact actively encouraged to do so in almost every society  Feynman did not cheat on anyone who was even a one night stand  in that there was no pretense and no sleaze  With the radiant persona that was him  that would have been out of the question  A replica of a supreme detective could be seen in Feynman  You might think it is absurd  but think what a detective does  he uses the know facts on clues and gets the case closed  I am a fan of really good detectives  and their arch rivals too  His experiments whether with ants or with call girls were all the same  He came out as a learned man with new facts  I envy him  and adore him and I know him only by his book  He had truly opened up his heart and told every little thing that he had experienced  Being a bright student and smart individual is not related to how monetarily successful they are  but how rich they are intelectually  If you want to know someone who intellectual  dare devil  curious  scientific  hilarious  careless  lives the life for what it is  then READ THIS BOOK  I just knew of the existence of Professor Feynman about one year ago  When I was a child and then a teenager  I used to read the biographies of some of the finest minds in the world  In that way I met Newton  Leibnitz  Einstein and others who by now I can not remember their names  Those books always gave me the impression that those scientists were depicted as semi gods  as apostles of the science  almost as saints  only virtues  no defects or mundane stuff  But it wasn t until recently that I started to look for biographies which could give a more human point of view of the lives of those people  I started my search looking for womanizer scientists or drunken scientists or very sociable scientists  people far away from the stereotype of the scientist  I found Richard Feynman and he captivated me  Even I found in the web a picture of Richard Feynman sitting on a table of a topless bar chatting with one of the girls of the place http   electricspacekoolaid tumblr co   The things I can conclude after reading his book of anecdotes is that he was a very passionate man  he liked his physics and his girls  he gave a try to almost everything  sketching  playing bongos  biology  etc  He was a man who didn t fear to fail  to make mistakes  that is very important for me  and who didn t fear to challenge the authority  He did things in a playful way  only for the pleasure of doing them  He was a man always willing to share his knowledge and with the skill to explain things in plain English to the layman  In sum  a very charismatic and approachable character  I have not read it  My error  Glavnym delom zhizni vasheiMozhet stat  liuboi pustiak Nado tol ko tverdo verit

Richard Feynman was  and by the end I was completely charmed  A must read  I was hoping for something closer to a biography  which this isn t  but I  really  liked the book  Quite entertaining  and I certainly will be reading more about Richard Feynman   I ll never make that mistake again  reading the experts  opinions  Of course  you only live one life  and you make all your mistakes  and learn what not to do  and that s the end of you  I can usually tell when I m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign  I can t shut up about it  Well  I couldn t and can t shut up about this book  it was simply great  This greatness sort of snuck up on me  I d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist  A Primate s Memoir  and found it rather disappointing  plus  the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist  without learning any actual physics  seemed silly  But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter  I was entranced by the man  absolutely fascinated  and remained so the whole time The subtitle of this book is perfect  because the two meanings of the word  curious  converge to encapsulate Feynman  he was curious in the sense of being odd  as well as curious in his love of learning  I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman s personality  and this is the best I ve come up with  Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist  The qualities that make Mark Twain s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me  mischievousness  curiosity  cleverness  honesty  naivete  friendliness  frankness  and an uncompromising moral principle  Like Huck  Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations  and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind  like Huck  Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks  but all without a hint of malice  and like Huck  Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right There are some hilarious stories in here  which I won t spoil  But what was more impressive to me  was the amount of serious thought that could be found  Feynman s criticism of the Brazilian school system  which relied overmuch on memorization by rote  and concentrated overmuch on passing tests  instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them  applies equally well to many aspects of the current U S  school system  Equally relevant was Feynman s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system  it was a Kafkaesque farce  But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension  reputation  convention  snobbery  prestige  and authority In my own life  one of the most interesting  and also most difficult  lessons that I ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they d like you to believe  When I was a kid  I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things  I thought that if an  expert  said something  it must be true  I assumed that there was a particular  expert  in every type of activity  be it business or science  to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to  In short  I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes  ensuring that things ran smoothly  The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while  after all  that s the whole basis of advertising   but it wasn t long after meeting people in the  real world  that this illusion imploded  the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident I include this bit about myself because I don t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience  In a way  a distrust of all authority is Feynman s central social message  He is constantly running into  experts  who haven t the slightest idea what they re talking about  He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags  he trusts the results of other people s experiments  and later finds that they were seriously flawed So any time somebody makes a claim  he decides to test it out for himself  and the few times he doesn t do this  he gets into trouble  This realization  that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority  is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations  Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things  So this central insight  to always check for youself  is both the heart of his scientific attitude  as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world  His ability to crack safes  for example  wasn t due to his knowing a lot about safes  but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly  not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious  Most of us assume that we couldn t figure out how to crack a safe  but Feynman did what he always did  and saw for himself whether he could  and he could I honestly wish that this book was three times its length  Now  I must know more about Feynman  My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped  and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense  Well  perhaps it is  but the only way you ll know for sure is by reading this book  and checking for yourself  Amazing guy  I realised that s already read it but I d forgotten loads of it  eg  Art drawing  reviewing maths books for schools  What s the total temperature of the red blue green  red and violet stars  Aargh   One of the best books I have ever read  smart and funny  A lot of highlightening  so it was a excellent book Ele diz    Feynman  isso e muito interessante  mas que importancia tem  Porque esta a fazer isso     Ah     digo eu    Nao tem absolutamente nenhuma importancia  Faco o apenas para me divertir              Os diagramas e todo o assunto que me fizeram ganhar o Premio Nobel originaram se nesse meu entretenimento com o prato oscilante    This was highly entertaining  Very funny and Feynman is as humorous as he is brilliant   Readers unfamiliar with Richard Feynman might envision a scholarly  soberly theoretical physicist scratching away on a blackboard full of formulas so complex that only he and  perhaps  Einstein can understand them  However  after finishing Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   readers discover a radically different side of the Nobel prize winner  Whether Feynman is breaking into Los Alamos safes  drumming in an amateur band as part of Brazil s annual carnival  or having the time of his life in a Las Vegas strip club  he remains fantastically dynamic  Throughout  the language in the autobiography is rather simple  yet one hears a truly genuine voice behind the words  In my opinion  this is a must read  even for non physics fans  since it traces the story of a genius in such a non conventional  exciting way    Agata S  15 Feynman s no nonsense approach is refreshing  How wonderful it would be to find one of his drawings  Brilliant book  hilariousphysicist  womanizer  artist  safecracker  codebreaker      Simply a wonderful book  I don t pretend to understand physics or math although I wish I could  But just reading about Dr  Feynman s ways of thinking about problems is fascinating  And the book is funny  I would give it ten stars if I could  A humane  funny  and moving self biography of one of the greatest minds of the 20th century  A truly inspirational book which is at the same time laughing out loud funny  You won t learn much science in this book  but you get a lot of the puckish Feynman  funny  interesting  brilliant  maverick   Enamored  I read this book after seeing a brief bio of Feynman at the high school where I was subbing in Science  I immediately fell in love with a dead physicist  I still am   A great insight into the creativity of Feynman s mind  His writing is simple yet engaging  I could not put this book down  The anecdotes of his youth are both brilliant and funny  Its inspiring to see what he accomplished by just hard work and a determined mindset  He paints the picture of the past really well  and its fascinating to imagine the world in the forties and fifties  Membacanya  kadang kadang mengingatkan saya kepada Sheldon Cooper  FUNNY AND ECCENTRIC  READ IT  Really good  Good insight into the mind of a genius  An awesome piece of work  I had seen the reviews and remained skeptical by Richard Feynman had me laughing over and over     normally about situations where people overwhelmed with his apparent genius that they missed the obvious  e g  file cabinet lock picking   In other cases  the tables were turned on Feynman like how to mix paint     hilarious  I am even laughing about why the title is what it is   an awesome piece of writing providing a glimpse inside the man  just loved both his books Every physics student must read at least the last chapter Read this book  Just do  It is fantastic  Read when I was 13  I m still often reminded of some of the anecdotes  Very enjoyable read  A wubba wah  a wubba wah    I am a big fan of chatty science books in plain english  and Feynman is the king of them  This is more like anecdotes from his life  though  It s a great look into the mind of an everyday genius  Excellent autobiography from the famous person Maybe the best book I have ever read  Pretty much  I think Feynman is an asshat  I don t find many of his antics all that funny  Creating a laugh at another s expense is never OK in my book  But  despite my personal objection to his version of humor  I enjoyed getting a look into the goings on in the physics community during his time  And  sophomoric humour aside  he does make some very thoughtful observations in regards to science AND to people  This book will definitely find its way onto my shelves  This book was pretty hilarious  Feynman shows everyone that he s awesome  yet oddly humble  There s something quintessential about his style of writing  combined with the writing  that makes this one awesome book  This collection of anecdotes from Richard P  Feynman was retold intermittently and informally to Ralph Leighton and transcribed and edited by Edward Hutchings  This book is not going to explain the origins of the universe but it is a masterful insight into the nature of scientific investigation and experimentation  The book also exposes Feynman as one of the most colourful and charismatic characters ever  He was   in no particular order   a Nobel prize winning physicist  an artist  worked on the Manhattan Project  bongo player  practical joker  safe cracker and a non conformist genius  Genius is often a word bandied about to describe sports stars and actors when the description is not really justified  in Feynman s case the word does not begin to describe what he was capable of  As well as possessing an immense understanding of his subject  he was also able to relay that to others with an infectious enthusiasm that just makes it a pleasure to find stuff out  A masterpiece  Must read for everybody  Holy crap  this book will change your life   I read this back in college  almost 20 years ago  I should probably read it again  but I remember admiring the man and his impish curiosity  Hilarious yet inspiring personality  Astonishingly told life story of mischievous Mr   Feynman A humble person who rose to become aurguably the century s greatest physicist  Salute to the great mind  a must read  defines feynman s genius    My review  5 stars My sister recommended this book to me and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it  Although it s not the type of book I usually read  I m very happy I did read it What can I say  Feynman was a very  very funny man  The ways in which he presents his stories had me laughing at many points  Not only was he exceedingly smart  but he seemed to be a very fun person to be around  This book taught me a lot about him and his life that I didn t know before  and some little tricks that could help me Don t worry if you re not a physics person  A very basic understanding  i e  maybe around GCSE level  will be fine  for the majority  of this book  I m only doing my GCSEs now and I could understand it  And don t worry about it being a boring autobiography by a boring man   this wasn t dull at all and I got thoroughly engrossed in it I would definitely recommend this book  and I will be reading more by him  Richard Feynman was quite a character as well as being brilliant  This book covers various stories from his life including his childhood  his time at MIT  Princeton  Los Alamos  Cornell  and Caltech  and the time he marched through the streets of Copacabana playing a frigideira with a samba band  He tells fascinating stories and has a great sense of humor  This conversational account of Richard Feynman s development as a physicist is disarming  you are so busy shaking your head over his goofy practical jokes and constant curiosity that you almost forget this is one of the most brilliant scientists of our time  No matter what the puzzle  Feynman wanted to figure it out  A must read for anyone hoping to solve puzzles of their own  A delightful read  I got this well worn copy from a fellow Feynman fan  I enjoyed it so much that I passed it on   A very clever man  far too clever for me however hard I try and however many times I read it  He s also incredibly funny and eloquent discussing his work in physics and his practical jokes  I read the introductory section about his childhood experiments to my son while giggling loudly  Exactly the sort of person I d like to go for a drink with   An delightful collection of anecdotes about Feynman s life  hilarious yet inspiring  This book makes you to love physics and its human side  It is written in a very kind way so that every layman can consult into life of one of the greatest physicist of the 20th century  A must read by a man of science who had great passion and tremendous sense of fun Wonderful vignettes from the life of the Genius  Its funny  its memorable and its a highly entertaining read  Physics   fun  I wish more scientists could speak and write as engagingly about about science   Inspiring  hilarious  honest  He s also kind of an asshole about women  But he s kind of a genius at most other things  Simply amazing  This book showed me deep curious nature of the man and scientists in general  He has this sense of exploring everything from Science  Art to Music  And he was really practical with his explorations Although he sounds full of himself sometimes  i say  its still worth it I deeply Enjoyed this book  Richard Feynman possessed one of the most interesting personalities  While  also being a genius in physics  It is not a surprise that so many people have felt attracted to him  As was demonstrated by the big crowds that attended his famous lectures on physics  according to what I had read   I loved reading this book  it was such an incredible experience for myself  I was laughing with his stories  but from time to time I stopped reading just to think of the lecture I was receiving through such a conventional and mundane stories  I can recall several stories from the book  but one that I enjoy remembering  it is the way that he rejected the offer to become a professor at the University of Chicago  This book provides a lot of laughs and also plenty of stories to think about the way we approach science and learning  In Feynman s words   They learn the concepts  but don t know how to connect them   Also  Feynman made some criticism of the way people in science perceive the way science should be tough  The last chapter of this book where Feynman talks about the cargo cult is one of the chapters that I have reread the most in my life  I already lost the count  and I can almost recite it by hard   This book is delight  The semi autobiography written in the form of witty anecdotes with loads of humour and a dash of cunning is a pleasure to read  Dick Feynman was undoubtedly the coolest guy ever in the field of science    albeit a rascal a Noble Prize winning one at that    From the picking of locks to picking up girls    from repairing radios by  thinking  to making an entire door vanish    not to mention visiting  ahem   topless bars  he seemed to have a finger in every pie conceivable  In the words of the great Hans Bethe   Feynman was a magician   Indeed he was  perhaps the only one of his kind  And this book too   is one of its kind  Very funny  Re read after a number of years  and enjoyed it even more  Feynman gave the  Messenger Lectures  when I was a freshman at Cornell in 1964  This book will be discussed at my book club  April 9 2012 Dr  Feynman really show you don t have to conform to the stereotypic mold to be a physicist  Also how much fun and beautiful physics and science in general is  Just as a piece Picasso artwork is beautiful   I have never loved many books this much  One of my abs fans  My all time favorite scientist  I love his unique personality  This book will make you laugh confused  wondered  sad  anything   This is one of my all time favorite books  I ve always been a bit of a science groupie and loved getting a peek into the head of a genius  Feynman tells his story in such an accessible way  and it s an amazing story  From his days as a student to his courtship and marriage  to his days at Los Alamos  it s one man s perspective of a very important crossroads in our history  Feynman later went on to head the Challenger Commission that investigated what caused the 1988 explosion  and he died shortly after that  His  Feynman Lectures on Physics  are still sought after by students and laypeople alike   I am convinced that Feynman is my spirit animal  But on a serious note  I feel so inspired by his attitude towards life  scientific integrity  and exploration of his creative side  I was slightly rubbed the wrong way by some of his antics in the woman chasing department  When respect fails in approaching women  that they don t dispense sex after drinks are inserted  resort to being a jerk  I guess in that era  the idea of consent wasn t really well fleshed out   but at the same time  I was positively wrecked by the love and sense of loss I felt from the recounting of his first wife s death  He was a flawed man  but was more fascinating for it  I can only hope to live a life so filled with mirth and discovery  If you ve ever had the pleasure of watching a video where Mr  Feynman speaks  his characteristic style comes through in his words  This book is an absolute pleasure to read  not only because of his fun and upbeat style  but because he plainly shows the world that his intelligence is all about his curiosity and wonderment with the world around him  Inspiring and fun  this one has laughs  science  and amazing history as told by one of the 20th century s greatest physicists and scientists A recommended read for the curious  I ve read it six times already  and I decided to pop the audiobook back on today  Such an amazing life for such an extraordinary man  It reads like a good novel  not a biography  Very light on physics and mathematics  it speaks a bit about his Nobel prize winning discovery briefly  but the rest of the book is pure antics   it really attempts to portray the human side to the mathematical genius that is a hero to so many of those of us who love physics  If I could be half the man that Feynman was  my life would hardly be wasted   Surely You re Joking  makes you laugh  and then it makes you want to join in the fun  A good read  Disclaimer  I am a nerd  and I am made even nerdier by my enjoyment of reading biographies of nerds past  But as scientist  auto  bios go  this is one of the best The good news for lesser nerds than I is that the style is not overly science y  but it is definitely indicative of the way Feynman s mind work  Many of the stories are great anecdotes for whipping out at cocktail parties  i e   Feynman used to do work over lunch at strip clubs because  he claims  the food was cheap and people tended to leave you alone there   A fun read even for the non technically minded  All the stories are HILARIOUSbut people need to KNOW a little college level of math to understand this doesnt mean you have to be in college    im 13 yrs old  A must read for science nerds   Liogkaia  no glubokaia kniga  Feynmann was one of the best science writers out there and he did wonders to complex ideas brought down to earth  Who would have thought the man also had a scintillating sense of humor and wit  This is a book well worth reading many times  Richard Feynmann was an incredible man  judging from this book  A great  quick read if you are looking for laughs and inspiration  I loved this book  Feynman s like the lovable quirky uncle who always has a good anecdote to share at the dinner table  and this book feels like a collection of all the anecdotes with a bunch of insights into his thinking process and opinions  Reads well  and is quite enjoyable  Feynman was a genius  A hilarious  inquisitive  odd ball  modest genius  This is not a book on quantum physics  nor a bragging autobiography of how this Nobel Laurette succeeded in so many ways  it is a book about the thrill of asking questions and trying to find the answers  about clever mischief  and an occasional lock picking prank or bar fight here or there  One of the greatest physicists in history tells his tale in a fun and matter of fact kind of way  When you read things like how he would go to a strip club to work on physics problems  you sometimes have to think  surely you re joking  Mr  Feynman  This is probably one of the funniest books I ve ever read  and it s about science  Well not really  as it is about a scientist  namely Richard P Feynman  winner of the Physics Nobel Prize and hilariously witty genius  I loved this book  I loved the anecdotes  I loved the wittiness  I loved Mr  Feynman  Read this book  Now  Even if you have no clue about Physics  because I sure as hell haven t  and I enjoyed it very much  Sorry  Richard  I d like to say the reason I read this was because I wanted to know more about inner workings of a scientific mind  Truth be told  it was because I d just finished my book club book and was still in the mood to read something    this was at arms reach  Why this was in  my  office  I don t know    my husband is the Caltech grad  Feynman was one of his professors Though not a scientist  I ll admit I am a enough of a geek to enjoy all the Caltech Ditch Day stories and  ok  I m a bit  starstruck  whenever I hear friends and family refer to personal encounters they ve had with science heavyweights  Feynman  Einstein  Hawking    A Wikipedia knowledge coupled with such anecdotes sufficed through the years till I picked this book up  Some say he comes off a bit egotistical  True  but his voice is so casual and the anecdotes are so laugh out loud funny that you find yourself forgiving him  His autobiography doesn t require deep physics knowledge    for me  that was a positive  I don t want details on why he received a Nobel Prize    what I wanted to know was where he was when he got the news  what happened at the ceremony  etc     basically the tabloid coverage  Shallow  I know  but I m being honest here  After finishing the book  I asked my husband so many questions about Feynman  He pulled a volume of the Feynman Lectures from one of his shelves and said  Want to see something      He then showed me an inscription saying  Thanks for the music  Dick   What does that mean   I asked   I made a music cassette for him  Why are you asking so many questions about Feynman anyway    No reason  Just something I read    Last chapter  Touched  Other chapters  Mind blown  What an apt title for the book  Jaw dropping  eye popping  simply amazing  We ve all had curiosities and eccentricities  and we ve all seen those fizzle and die out as we grow  In Feynman s memoirs I found what an inexplicable joy it would bring only if we keep fueling our curiosity  our thirst for learning He s funny  he s charming  he s a bomb of energy and inspiration  Having a penchant for drama  and a flair for showmanship  Feynman vividly brings alive those moments when he astonished his co workers by opening their safes   when  as a child  he left people slack jawed by  fixing radios by just thinking  and when he left a military building again and again without appearing to be entering it Feynman touches upon a wide range of topics  each more interesting than the others  Hypnosis  lucid dreaming  isolation tanks  tribal rituals  folk music  education system  conventions and customs  scientific integrity  mind reading     you name it  Feynman would have something interesting to offer  Thoroughly entertaining  highly inspirational  and  at times  thought provoking  all I can think abut this book is  Why didn t I read it before    What an amazing character  I found Feynman s adventurous approach to life highly entertaining and enlightening  What a wonderful life and book   An absolute classic for me  This was probably my tenth re read  and my first in a number of years  His views on women are a bit antiquated  but it s all part of his  what do you care what other people think  philosophy  A must read for anyone serious about science or education  This has always been one of my favorite books  I wish I had found it earlier in life   it might have had an even bigger impact  As someone who has to figure out how everything works myself  it s great to know that this is a positive attribute  Feynman is just brilliant    it s that simple  Richard Feynman was an amazing fellow who accomplished great things  Yet  while reading his not really autobiography  you really feel like he s just another buddy at the office  A very smart  kind of odd  buddy  but a buddy none the less  Feynman is not just a great teach about physics  but also about life  A must read for any aspiring scientist and a good read for everybody else   It was a damn good read  He comes of so darn humble even though it s obvious he is one of the most accomplished geniuses of our time  Love the book  I don t mean to overstate  but this book changed my life  I should re read it  A great book where Feynman describes his adventures though life  Always searching for knowledge and always being mischievous  this book contains many anecdotes that are genuinely hilarious  Brilliant  His approach to everyday questions was especially interesting  I m inspired to pursue my casual interests with more intensity and to ask more questions when people make absurd sounding claims  All excellent things   doc hoi ky  tu truyen cua nhung thien tai nhu nay chi cang thay nhung thu thien tai la do thien dinh  D Loved it  Not really a biography per se  but a collection of wonderful anecdotes about Feynman s life  Feynman was a brilliant physicist with a zest for life  a mischievous streak  and a decidedly un scientist personality  Read this book if you want to laugh  to be thoroughly entertained  and to learn a little something about how to live life  Very interesting biography  funny  informative   Even if not a  sciency  person   this is entertaining  informative  and makes me want to be the type of person he describes himself as  A    says me  I love this book so much  I really want to give it 6 5  I read and re read it often  and Feynman is one of my personal top heroes     Surely   one of my all time favourite books ever  I used to be an engineering student who does not enjoy physics classes and I wondered why some people loved it so much and what is so interesting about it  Then somehow I found this book Feynman s mind  somewhat socially awkwardness  yes  the book s name is about that subject    his curiosity  his writing style  everything made me think and enjoy  changed so many things for the better way for me This book is simple  funny and beautiful  I guess so many readers will love this curious childish soul   Richard Feynman was really  really cool  In his book  Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   we get a collection of stories in a loose time line from childhood and up until he won a Nobel Prize  Most stories focus on humour but also focus on learning through understanding and curiosity The writing is very casual  as if Feynman himself were telling you the story in person  Despite my favoring exceptional writing over anything  this collection really worked for me  Feynman has a lot of interesting experiences and his eccentricity was easy for me to relate to   and maybe that s why I enjoyed this so much  It s a rare occurrence when I read about something and can really relate to it  It s nice  I plan to read more about him  An Excellent insight into the mind of the one of the most famous physicist of all time A view into the great curiosity and way he enjoyed his life   Simply Entertaining  Brilliant and witty  Feynman reviews scenes from his life and at the same time reveals how to live a good life in science  This book is amazing  This book is not about physics  Instead  it is full of extremely funny stories about one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century Some overlap with the book  Feynman   The Pleasure of Finding Things Out   Most people involved with science have probably run into Feynman s lecture on  cargo cult science   which makes up the last chapter of this book  The whole affair is like that  casual  funny  deeply insightful  It s not really about physics  it s extremely accessible and written in an informal  spoken style  peppered with onomatopoeia and capslock  His thoughts on the Manhattan project are especially gripping  I can t recommend this book enough   One of my favorite snippets   While on the Manhatten Project  Feynman and his fellow scientists were kept under heavy security  with a guard carefully tracking their comings and goings  Check Out  Check In  Check Out  Check In  But Feynman found a hole in the fence  Check In  Check In  Check In  Check Out  Check Out  Check Out This is also where he perfected his safe cracking technique   One of my all time favorite books  This book has entertainment  life style and state of mind wrapped around some of the greatest moments leading up to modern physics Feynman is well known for bringing elegance and simplicity into science without losing its awe inspiring luster  I would argue this book shows he was just as capable of doing the same for everyday life This is also a great book to come back too  I have this book straight through at least 3 times and have periodically dipped into a chapter for years Brilliant  Quick fascinating read by a Nobel Prize winner who remains an everyman when he clearly is not  What a guy  Led me to read several other works about him and by him   Genius  is another biography about him which is worth a read  Can t remember the author  Tom maatr prre shess krlaam  Surely You

 Great  An insight into a genius mind  It is always the fun and enlightenment to read Mr  Feynman   He words still possessed the power that can influence our minds   Witty  and funny  I wish I would have been in student for few years  Richard Feynman was a noble prize winning physicist  This book is his autobiography  which he tells mainly as a series of anecdotes  This isn t a scientific treatise  but more the tales  adventures and challenges of a man who lived life to the fullest while contributing significantly to humanity  It s highly accessible  so you don t need a degree in Physics or Mathematics to enjoy the book although that may help with a few sections The reason I enjoyed this book is because of Feynman s curiosity and interest in life and the world  He learned various hobbies such as picking locks which he used to pick locks at Los Alamos  or playing drums in a Samba band in Brazil  He deeply enjoyed his work and had a dedication to the truth  His integrity and honesty is refreshing  especially in our modern era of carefully managing our reputations and monitoring what we say  I highly doubt a modern physician would admit to going to a topless bar to get work done  and then testify in favor of that bar in court to prevent it from being closed  I highly recommend this book  and it will definitely inspire you to be more open minded and try new things or hobbies   Inspire  Feynman je Nobelovac  O njemu kriticar Timea kaze  Neobuzdano    Feynman ispucava svoje pustolovine u fizici  biologiji  umjetnosti i glazbi    Lancana reakcija nije losa usporedba za Feynmanom zivot  Iz kriticne mase sive stvari grunula je u svim smjerovima  proizvodeci i toplinu i svjetlost Izdavac istice na koricama  U svijetu nuklearne fizike i dobitnika Nobela  ne postoji nitko poput Feynmana    Ova knjiga divna je serija kratkih kadrova  uspomena jedne karijere    Prvoklasno stivo   i poslastica za one koji mozda jos ne znaju za Feynmanovo profinjeno ludilo Treci veli  Ova je knjiga puna vinjeta koje oslikavaju covjeka opsjednutog i odusevljenog zagonetkama svake vrste  od vjestine provaljivanja u sefove do otkrivanja fizickih zakona beta raspada    Uzitak za citanje Evo  kad sam sve ovo naveo  bit ce vam svima jasno zasto preporucujem ovu knjigu  Richard Feynman is a personal hero of mine  who through his personality led a life most of us would be envious of  This book   the follow up were written for the casual reader  and are very enjoyable  My all time favorite   So what if he is a little full of himself  It s Richard Feynman for crying out loud  He gets to be ok  Frankly I thought this book was hilarious  I loved reading about him cracking safes especially  I thought that was just too much  Best biography autobiography ever  This was so lighthearted and fun  and anyway who doesn t want to be this guy  I do  Great book about life of great man Such an intelligent scientist with an amazing character  Highly recommended  If the crew from Big Bang Theory was hired to do a Dos Equis commercial  they would star Mr  Feynman saying  Stay Thirsty  My Friends   He is the Ernest Hemingway of science without the depression  He explains how a scientist thinks and conceptualizes things in such an engaging  insightful way that this this book should be required reading for all science educators  I should say that this was another time  and at times he can come off as a bit of a cheauvanist  but overall a great read  I don t always read biographical short stories  but when I do  I read this book   Humor  The joy of learning  even complicated things   Creativity  intelligence  integrity  discipline  humor  risk taking       Richard Feynman is a teacher to us all   I think this book to be an essential read for aspiring scientists  such as myself  and everyone else  It is both humorous and inspiring and is a beautiful insight into the life of someone who sincerely loved his field of study and lived out his existence to its fullest   Although this book constantly makes the reader laugh aloud  it also contains some serious topics such as the matter of scientific integrity which Professor Feynman discusses at great length in the last chapter  All throughout this book  but especially in this last chapter  you can see the incredible extent of love and devotion Professor Feynman had for science   It is true  as I ve read in many negative reviews  that Professor Feynman tends to skim over his relationships with other people  making this book seem rather self centered  However  I think that aspect is part of what makes this memoir autobiography so real and interesting  After all  we are all the center of our own lives and the suns of our personal solar systems   Physicist Richard Feynman  1918 1988  gave insight to many aspects of a physicist s life  Funny  brilliant  bawdy    this book tells the reader that it s not all about lab and equations  Slice of life anecdotes are available as well as more science y topics  Very entertaining book of essays writing by a nutcase who s not afraid to admit that he s a weird  and funny  nutcase  Also he is brilliant  Great little surprising anecdotes from a different time and a very different mind  Richard Feynman is a character and his ever curious way about the world is inspiring   My favorite Feynman  Michelle  the wife  and I had a book swap where she picked a book for me and I picked a book for her  I made her listen to this one  See her review of it for how non scientist persons may like this book  As for me I loved it  Feynman was a very inspiring writer  he just makes you want to go out and discover and experiment and ask  why    I find his personality to be almost childlike in curiosity and naiveness  I find his books to be very genuine as he s able to make feelings into words that I often cannot  Plus it was just interesting to hear of so many stories from a man that led a rather interesting life   for a geeky scientist that is  Classic I thoroughly enjoyed it  slowly falling in love with mr  feynman Portrait of Richard Feynmann  one of the smartest people in the history and a very humarous person at that  Highly recommended Dr Feynman is truly a lifetime genius  the book is incredibly amazing and inspiring for all types of readers   In this book  physicist Richard Feynman recollects various interesting and funny anecdotes from his life  Such as his physics research  childhood  beautiful females  topless bars  art  music  languages  winning the Nobel Prize  universities  life as a professor etc  This guy is surely one of the most interesting characters I ve come across  I m a Feynman fan now  You just can t leave this book until you finish it  Very inspiring for Physicists  Engineers and Dr  Feynman s fans  This is my favourite biography of what can be described as a maverick life  The stories were both humourous  entertaining and educational  I learned about physics  relationships  cracking safes and living life adventurously  I wish I could have met Richard Feynman for he is now one of my greatest role models  Two words  absolutely brilliant  I think most of the appeal stems from the fact that you just don t perceive a Nobel prize candidate as a  normal  person  Well  think again  Feynman talks about different episodes from his life  some of them good  some of them bad  but most of them   unusual  fun and   as the title has it   curious  Fantastic read  and I think I found my new role model  The restaurant soup scene and the bit with the suckers are priceless  You would never guess that one of the foundational figures in American physics is such a card  A really enjoyable read  Feynman  otro de los inventores de la bomba atomica  nos muestra en esta divertida autobiografia como su epoca de Los Alamos fue solo una de tantas anecdotas asombrosas que compusieron su vida  Esta mente inquieta y creativa no podia conformarse con llevar una vida ordinaria    y rompio todos los moldes  Altamente inspiradora y recomendable  Great book  Physics for the common man     I read this book some time ago  I very much enjoyed reading it again  There is a great deal to learn from Feynman  and it isn t just physics  He is a great role model for trying to think outside the box  and for developing critical thinking skills  The stories are not well written in the conventional sense  which makes sense when you realize that they are extracted from his spoken versions of these events  But that is no matter to their value  My favorite story  I think  is the one describing his adventures in Brazil  and learning to play a Brazilian instrument and parading in the Carnaval  just for the fun and experience and learning  While Feynman was goofing around and doing crazy things like that  hanging around in a stripper bar  learning to be an artist  he was doing work that qualified him for a Nobel Prize  Which he wasn t too happy about  as it resulted in people treating him too deferentially  Definitely on my list of people who I would like to meet  were he still alive   This is a very good book  I found it entertaining and funny  I have known many brilliant minds in my life and most of them are just like this  The book moves quickly through stories and adventures  I sometimes had to put it down to let my brain catch up  I would have loved to have coffee with Mr  Feynman and this book is just like that  One of the best books not only about interesting aspects of science  but also about very inspiring person  great physician and cool man  you definitely would be happy to meet  Never has a book made me feel so dumb  That s not a bad thing though  and this book is engaging  hilarious  and often thought provoking  He reminds me of myself when I m at my best  interested in the world and eager to try out new activities and solve the puzzles that life presents  Thanks Feynman for the reminder of my complacency  One of my  the favorites     what a pleasure  Richard Feynman s passion for science was remarkable the man who talk science  breathe science and think science but still because of his unquenchable curiosity and eternal skepticism  he led an adventurous life which is arguably inspiring and humorous in parts  i wonder that time at Los Alamos when greats like Einstein  Bohr and Feynman were together from there modern science took a giant leap forward  Feynman thanks for making me believe that passion only leads to hard work which in turn results in success  finally i will culminate this by lines of his dear friend Hans Bethe There are two types of genius  Ordinary geniuses do great things  but they leave you room to believe that you could do the same if only you worked hard enough  Then there are magicians  and you can have no idea how they do it  Feynman was a magician It s an interesting life to say the least when one person learns to be a safecracker  able to steal top secret government research at whim  But that same person also traveled overseas to join a samba band and played on the beaches of Rio during Carnival  Then he learned to sketch and drew models including a playboy centerfold  getting good enough that he sold his work  And there were the experiences of sensory deprivation where he tried to induce hallucinations by being immersed a dark tank of water at body temperature Oh yeah  and there is his work on the Manhattan project and the Nobel Prize for Physics that he won  Richard P  Feynman had a curious spirit  always asking questions  learning something new  He loved the way things worked and wanted to know more about them  often questioning the basic assumptions that we all take for granted  From fixing radios as a boy to learning the norms of polite society at Princeton and European royal courts  Feynman s anecdotes had me often smiling and sometimes laughing at the seemingly ridiculous situations he found himself in  I read this book 10 12 years ago  and came back to it again recently  enjoying it even more the second time  There is some talk of science  and a knowledge of the topic will likely enhance your enjoyment  but the anecdotes are clever  many of which will put a smile on your face  Awesome  Great read from start to finish  Extremely funny and inspiring  I loved the stories in this book  Richard Feynman is the man when it comes to common reasoning in science  Everyone can indeed fix a radio with their mind  This book  written by Richard Feynman  a Nobel Laureate in Physics  is one of the most popular books written by a scientist and undoubtedly one of my all time favourites  Here  Feynman recounts his capers from the years spent at Princeton  Cornell  Caltech as well as anecdotes in connection with work on atom bomb  the Manhattan Project  at Los Alamos Throughout the book  Feynman comes across as an extraordinary combination of high intelligence  sharp mind  unlimited curiosity about every aspect of life  and above all  a fine sense of humour Vivid  lively and unpretentious  this is one book that you return to time and again  Enjoyed it completely What a treat    Anyone who has dabbled with science or technology and has pulled practical jokes will get a kick out of Richard s funny anecdotes and problem solving  A perfect quick read intro to the passion of physicists and why some lay people really love a good physics book   What started out as an overly scientific recommendation from Reddit turned into an incredibly enjoyable journey through the life of one of the most interesting men ever Every story Feynman told in this book had a moral and a purpose  His views on learning  understanding and just being a decent human being  and not a faker  are spot on  I ll definitely be reading more from him in the future  Recommended for everyone  A collection of stories from an adventurous and open minded man who also happened to be a Nobel Prize winning physicist  With excellent quotes such as  Gee  How am I gonna get started talking to this beautiful nude babe   It was a really  really entertaining read and I may end up reading some of the other Feynman books as well  to see the world through his mind   it was wonderful   This was one of the greatest books I ve read in a long time  Richard P  Feynman inspires readers to love the both the scientific method and his  grab life by the horns  outlook  His breadth of experience is simultaneously dumbfounding and inspirational  Even for those with no familiarity with the field of physics  like myself  this book is wonderful I will certainly be reading What Do You Care What Other People Think  next  For an autobiography  something out of the ordinary  Recommended  Excellent insight into the mind of Richard Feynman  Incredibly entertaining and a pleasure to read  A wonderful read  Although Feynman sounds pompous  Its worth reading  I wish I had read this book as a kid  Certainly has changed my outlook   Richard Feynman is hilarious  His stories are wonderful and takes you on a journey of his life    through academia and through his work in New Mexico during the making of the atomic bomb  Just started reading this classic  Much more personal than those economics to explain it all books genre  Turned out to be a great book  or the right book at the right moment  It is a series of anecdotes from a smart and irreverent person on events that shaped the way he does or think about things  Inspirational in some regards for the different  adventures  he took in learning Spanish  Japanese  Drumming  Drawing  Safe Cracking and thinking about the idea which eventually won him the Nobel prize  The five star is warranted because it revitalizes a part of me  to say the least  and may well be the trigger to some future changes in my life   I was expecting something a little more dry and with fewer strip clubs  The shenanigans he gets up to are top notch  however  A surprisingly fast read with periodic jumps into physics   What a fab book  The book is not written in a flowery language as one would expect from a Nobel Laureate  its simple candid  plain conversational  Feynman talks about all his experiences and achievements in such a matter of factly manner  A Physics Nobel Laureate  Painter  Safe cracker  Drummer  he surely was a magician   Highly recommended at times when you feel low in your research life  I ve just read this  quite illegally  on http   www gorgorat com   somewhat to my bemusement  I wasn t really intending to read the whole thing    I remember how impossibly long it seemed my first time through  when I must have been 8 or so  Actually  it was so impossibly long  I didn t get through all of it  I distinctly recall I found the chapter  7 percent solution  difficult to follow  But it s funny reading this again  I just kept tumbling along from story to story  and all sorts of memories came tumbling back  I had a fat  fat  paperback edition    too fat for its own health  it was held together with duct tape    and I must have read it during recess  ensconced in a pile of coats at the edge of the cement yard  indulging my unsociable proclivities  My dad gave me the book  it was pretty far from my usual fare  the mythology section of the school library  occasional mind warping 19th century girls  bildungsroman   but I ended up reading it pretty closely  It was formative A favorite book  Odna iz luchshikh biografii  chitaetsia legko  Avtor ne lishen iumora i samoironii  V kollektsiiu  This guy is hilarious and brilliant If the quality of life is measured by the number of stories you have to tell by the end of it  this man surely led a splendid life Stories after stories  Richard P  Feynman s life is marked by a raging curiosity  a love for learning and a never give up attitude  While the beginning of the ride was a little bumpy  owing to the abrupt and concise nature of the narrative  it got better as I came to terms with the idea that these are anecdotes  of course they re going to end abruptly and the next ones start with no relation to the previous ones  The content makes up everything else  I swear All the times he delights with his various adventures   from his tinkering to women to art and music and bombs and of course Science  there is an underlying theme of education and learning  with Feynman questioning the norms and conventions everywhere  This made me wonder  How much was he a product of his environment and how much due to his own inherent self  I d like to think the environment is a factor too because then we can teach kids this   to question  to never accept things on face value and to persist in thought and action  Oh  just the idea gives me goosebumps Once again  I can t help but feel grateful towards the idea of books  that I can live with a person whom I d have never even seen otherwise  I recommend this book to those who love science  those who don t or simply  those who love life  I would also love to hand a copy to every child in my vicinity if not for the slightly misogynistic tones  But I forgive you  Dick  Because the times were such  Simply amazing   I haven t read such a wonderful book for a while I don t event have enough skills to express my feelings about this book in the writing form  I even created special bookshelf to put this book to I remember I found reference to this book during some forum discussion about good literature for scientists  I come up to the book in my Kindle during short flight and started to read it   and I just couldn t stop  One could simply made a movie based on his life experience  I admire Mr  Feynman I have seen comment that he is too egoistic or too  jerk  and that is definitely true  Hey  the guy is one of the greatest scientists of XX century he has a right to be eccentric  But the book itself and stories it covers worth reading   One thing reader should be aware of  sometimes it requires advanced knowledge in math and physics  It happens rarely but the book is about Nobel laureate in physics after all  Again  amazing reading  Richard Feynman shows a exotic mixture of charisma and intellect the kind that few have The book is a kind of autobiographical summary of his life with brutal honesty of varied topics such as meeting women  upbringing  culture among scientists  prejudices  working on Los Alamos for the Manhattan Project and of course  physics This is  naturally  a very simplified summary of the themes  but equally relevant and interesting as the actual themes are the qualities found in between  the utter pursuit of truth by experimentation and observation  and how much joy he found by working things out by himself There are however certain remarks that could be regarded as misogyny but then again  he was human after all  and those were different times back then Overall excellent read   I think you can gauge my response here  http   bjhess com blog feynman  Potriasaiushchaia kniga o zhizni odnogo uchenogo  rasskazannaia samim uchenym

person in several interviews and while playing his bongo drums  What a character  Really inspirational book  There was a theme of honesty and integrity throughout the anecdotes  Lots of very clever and funny moments told in a matter of fact style  An absolutely amazing book that is going to influence the way I think for years to come  A must read for anybody with a curious mind   both entertaining and insightful  I was totally inspired by reading this book  Something about the joy with which he learned    Highly recommended   This book contains no science  Instead  it s a collection of recollections from one of the foremost physicists of the last century   on everything but science  It s an account of how a life was lived  It s very entertaining  He talks about learning instruments in Brazil to participate in Carnival  practicing his drawing in a strip club  and playing practical jokes on the guards while he worked on the Manhattan Project  The book is an excellent contradiction of the stereotype that scientists  lives begin and end with their fields  What I loved most about this book was the ability of a person of clearly outstanding intellectual prowess to share their science  and ideas  in plain text  There is a temptation in writing that I imagine many are familiar with to delve the depths of vocabulary and grammar to produce language as art  While this is valuable for sense  it is not so valuable for communication  Feynman s memoires are an excellent example of good old communication  and regardless of what you think of his social views  the anecdotes and lessons are wonderful to experience  Kniha ktera zmenila muj pohled na svet So fun  I had to really laugh out loud while reading this  Got addicted from start to end  and I felt it ended way to early His pranks are marvelous  and his curiosity is inspiring  I too have engaged in lock picking for the exact same reason  the puzzle they provide is addictive I heard of Mr  Feynman as a great teacher and thought I would like to know more about his persona  His humor  curiosity  and honesty shown in this book  has made me buy more of his books  I look forward to do the Feynman lectures one day  very funny book  you do not need to read lots of stuff about physics when reading a book of the physicist  but maybe some info about how lock work  some basic math would be helpful  anyway  a good book to read through the whole day thanks to its funny stories the most inspiration would be doesnt care about your responsibility toward the society in which you live  because

recollections made by Richard Feynman  Strange as it may seem that the semi autobiography of Nobel winning scientist is so humorous and a great pick for light reading The single most best thing about the book is that it doesn t have any plot  you can flip open to any chapter and start reading  This book contains a series of pranks that Feynman pulled during his time as a student at M I T  his time with his three wives  his lunch time at the strip clubs and the atom bomb  Reading this book one realizes the person and the personality called Feynman  I thoroughly enjoyed this book right till the end  and it also managed to raise a few smiles   A must read for everyone looking for something witty and funny to read  this book moved me  i don t know what to say about this book  this book is inspirational plus the best part is you can get into the head of Richard Feynman  I became a fan of him reading his lectures  he s one of the reason why i chose to do my bachelor degree in physics  so it was great to get a peek into his adventurous life  so at end of the day its a great book      Mr  Feynman can make anyone laugh and love Science  Exactly the point  A real person doing real things  Feynman is spectacular in his pedestrian descriptions of the most extraordinary goings on  and becomes such a story teller of his own life  I have given this book to graduating high school seniors who are enthralled with physics  The others get  The Fountainhead   Intinya adalah  mempelajari science adalah dengan pemahaman  bukan hafalan  Memutuskan sesuatu adalah setelah mempelajarinya sendiri bukan hanya setelah mendengar apa kata orang  Beliau prihatin dengan orang yang males mikir  Doh  saya memang memprihatinkan    Ada yang bilang buku ini menunjukkan egonya yang besar  Aku tidak melihatnya seperti itu  Kalaupun iya  tidak apa apa  Dengan kualitasnya yang seperti itu kata orang Jawa cucuk lah  Ora mung waton  D  Intelligent and cutting   he seems to have a reputation for embellishing his stories though  so I d like to know how accurate it actually is  This book was a pure delight  The subtitle  Adventures of a Curious Character  is spot on  Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life  thought a series of stories One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things  You would think a world famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics   but Feynman was curious about everything he saw  He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show  he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them  he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling  he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women  he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun   the list goes on  My take  you should have your passions   but you should also have your hobbies  I think I need a new hobby   I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system  He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to  I think this is not a unique problem in education Another lesson learned from Feynman s studies of science is to never take any data for granted  Always always question the sources  Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re generate many of the numbers on his own   even if they had been published in other places  For many things we are  and not just in science  standing on the shoulders of giants  The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with  I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist  with real integrity  And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles  This book was a light hearted attempt to point that out   not to mention  a very entertaining read   So I have just one wish for you  the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described  and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization  or financial support  or so on  to lose your integrity  May you have that freedom  A good ending quote  This man inspires me to pick up more hobbies and to approach them with the intent of becoming good excellent at them   Very funny and inspiring  Feyman s curiosity in subjects other than science music drawing languages  are very interestesting too  Definitely a must read for anyone curious to read an inspiring book  Makes physics fun and interesting  Funny  inspire and plain as water  A talent scientist and a wonderful storyteller  Feynman is  This book proves physicists are smart   and funny I have a new hero  A light  inspiring  fun read  Feynman s insatiable curiosity is a revelation on how to view the world  I ve already started paying closer attention to phenomena  and mundanity  that I have previously ignored  and am finding great satisfaction from doing so  Highly recommended  I can t get enough of Mr  Feynman s boyish antics and inquisitiveness  Funny and entertaining and amazing   An excellent overview of Richard Feynman s life and how he thought  Reinforced much of my anti intellectual stance  simply knowing the names of things is not the same as actually knowing the subject material  Touches on the concept of how difficult it really is to  know  something   Richard Feynman was a true genius  and I believe the joking and humorous way in which his autobiography is written captures it in a way that is both informative and captivating for all audiences  An excellent book which brings very nice picture of the mindset that belongs to someone who is really smart  talented and curious  Moreover  if you think scientist are crazy  you re quite right  but boring  Far from it  I ve had great time with this book and I caught my self laughing quite loud quite often  He played Bongos  I play drums     EL MEJOR HASTA AHORA      I am not sure how to review this book  The stories are inspirational  and absorbing  Seeing how Feynman thinks is an insight into the functioning of a quite marvellous mind  and he is an excellent story teller  He intersperses stories about his fascination with science  with stories about the flaws he sees in academia and education  with just really fun stories  And even then  they re all really good fun  I ll be giving this to all of my friends  Really interesting and hilarious  You don t need to be a math science major to read this book  Great  This was a really wonderful book by a truly brilliant man  Feynman regales the reader with tales of his adventures without a hint of pretention  Though he discusses some mathematical and scientific ideas  any lay person can easily enjoy the book the whole way through  Reading this fun and funny anthology is sure to instil the virtues of curiosity  problem solving and adventure in the reader  De in 1988 overleden Richard Feynman was een enthousiast en intelligent persoon die geen enkele mogelijkheid schuwde om de wereld beter te begrijpen  Deze leergierigheid uitte zich niet alleen in een Nobelprijs voor de Natuurkunde maar ook in vele andere mooie verhalen  Feynman repareerde al als kind de radio s in zijn omgeving  werkte mee aan de atoombom  Manhattan Project   kraakte de kluizen van zijn collega s  maakte indruk op Brazilianen met zijn Portugees en danste  s nachts al trommelend om de bomen in het bos  Uit al deze avonturen komt een sympathieke wetenschapper naar voren die als boodschap meegeeft dat je het gelukkigst wordt als je je persoonlijke integriteit zoveel mogelijk weet te bewaren  A brilliant mind shares stories of his life  Intriguing  funny  savvy  It makes you want to go out and discover things  A must read  even for people who don t understand a lot of modern physics  Kniga pro chto ugodno  no tol ko ne pro fiziku  Mankhettenskii proekt  nobelevskaia

barabanakh i zanimaetsia chert znaet chem eshchio  Very entertaining  Light hearted  Learned to have a different creative look at life apart from work  Apart from being a nobel laureate in physics he tried drumming  drawing  playing some Brazilian instrument and many small things to have fun in life   fascinating  fun  I wish I d have known him  A look into the brain of Richard Feynman  Feynman s full of mischief   This book is what started me on the road to becoming a physics major  This book is from a Nobel Prize winner s point of view about several interesting and funny experiences he had  It talks about how he likes experimenting and how he noticed how some people learn by memorizing  and they don t actually understand what they re learning  Some parts are confusing and hard to understand  but overall it is funny and very interesting  so I recommend it  Richard Feynman wrote a very entertaining autobiography  Open eyed and prepared to question everything  and to be honest about what he saw and felt  he upset many people while making himself indispensable to others  He was also something of a trickster  He worked on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos  New Mexico  a very junior researcher who soon had the ear of the  heavy hitters  because he was unafraid of their greatness and reputations  and they could count on him to give an unvarnished assessment of their ideas  He taught himself to pick locks and made a mockery of the base s security The love of Feynman and his wife  who was hospitalized with cancer while he worked there  led them to create a code to evade the censors so they could communicate honestly with one another  His intuition was accurate and surprising  When he was sent to inspect a TVA facility  he looked at the blueprints  never having read one   and put his finger on a particular symbol   What about this   The particular valve he pointed out turned out to be central to the problem they were having with a nuclear power plant  Later he was on the committee investigating the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster  and through experimentation and curiosity  posited an O ring on one of the gigantic fuel tanks had failed because it was too cold to function properly  He was right If you think science  especially physics  is dry and boring  you really ought to give Richard Feynman a chance to change your mind   No low level baloney in this book therefore a fantastic reading  I gently ask you to power the five stars I left here to the number of stars in the universe  thanks  Now there is a guy that really knows his stuff    and has a humor about it that made me laugh almost at every page  Get to know a nerd type kind of a guy who is so smart that it ll blow your mind     Actual rating 10 10One of the most entertaining memoirs compilations of anyone s life I ve ever read  There is so much to learn and appreciate when reading this book  that you can t come out of it feeling like you haven t gained something  Whether it was a little more insight into a great mind thirst for knowledge a respect for scientific and logical integrity  or an appreciation of each invaluable moment in time we have  to create and love a world we want to live in  Superb experience in reading this book  How the hell can anyone have so many interesting adventures in a single lifetime   Surely you are a genius Mr Feynman       So I have just have one wish for you the good luck to the somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity        and where you you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organisation  or financial support  or so on  to lose your integrity  May you have that freedom  Period Loved reading it all through and amazed by the way Feynman  one of the best theoretical physicists did with his life enjoying all through  Pentru acest titlu stelele de pe goodreads sunt prea putine o duzina ar fi fost mai potrivite  Da  Feynman este destul de plin de sine si se considera superior celorlalti  dar  in definitiv  asa si este  nu  Sa discuti cu Einstein si cu Bohr de la egal la egal  sa participi la proiectul Manhattan cu descoperiri si inventii stiintifice constante  sa iei un premiu Nobel  care face cat o casa de vacanta   dar si sa participi la Carnavalul de la Rio  sa fii un spargator de seifuri redutabil  sa inveti sa pictezi si sa ajungi sa vinzi tablouri si sa refuzi salarii astronomice de frica sa nu iti ruinezi casnicia nu e putin lucru  Povestea este excelenta  fluenta  comica  interesanta  Singurul defect pe care il gasesc cartii este ca se termina prea curand  O recomand elevilor si studentilor care duc lipsa de modele si de timp pentru a afla cate se pot face    If I turn out half as cool as Feynman  my existence will have have been vindicated  Absolutely delightful  It is funny  irreverent  easy to read  and a real page turner  And at the end of the book  great advice  Most favorite book  This is a great auto biography of a physicist who won a Nobel prize  with a great sense of humor  A genius book about a genius  I am always buying this book for friends  one of my favorites ever  Highly recommended  This book is so good I can t believe Richard Feynman did all the things he said he did  and this doesn t even include his achievements  just the fun stuff he must ve been one hell of a person to know and work with  Very interesting and motivating reading  especially for aspiring scientists such as PhD students  even if their field of research is not physics   What an utterly fantastic man  Before reading this book I could hardly fancy the idea that anyone  much less a Nobel Prize winner  could do so much and acquire so many skills in a lifetime  But there he was  learning to play samba music  becoming a drawing artist and so many other things that had nothing to do with physics  his main interest  And all that just because Feynman was a man who liked to live and more importantly  loved to think  Ever pushing  sweating  grinding  Leading by example  here depicted at its best  Funny  What a fun story about the life and times of the famous physicist  What sticks with me most is how he approached every problem in life so optimistically and found enjoyment working through the problem and not just in solving it  Though the positive perspective may have been something that came to him later in life it s inspiring to think about the benefits of deeply engaging life s challenge with such of an optimistic attitude  I also found relief in how all the entertaining and goofy story of Feynman s life  It s easy to think all scientists are nerds who don t engage life on a social or emotional level but Feynman reminds us that everyone wants to have some fun even when tasked with such a critical responsibility as developing an atomic bomb  Great insight into a great mind  and how he thought  I do prefer this series of snapshots by himself to a proper biography  Really enjoyable journey  Don t take life too seriously  have fun  learn new things  expose yourself to variety  and do silly things from time to time  To anyone looking for a book about a man who did learned all the right lessons  took all the right courses  mustered his ability and really made something of himself   this book is not for you Granted  Mr  Feynman is an award winning Nobel Prize winner  and comes across as brillant and well respected  But the book is not about his  successes   or god no  it s about Mr  Fenyman s stubbornness  openness  sexual prowess  and hilarious deviance that lands him in unusual situations His early anecdotes start auspiciously with his ability to get into in good respectful positions and starting his passion with physicas  But the story becomes so much more interesting  as he  loses the story  His child wonder turn from academic accolades to the pursuit and conquests of women across the world  Fenyman has this great dichotomy of being in tune with his passions but this academic disconnect in his social situations  Other cheeky endeavors get him into unbeaten paths   a rich artistic career  a drum aficionado  a disruptor to educational conferences and general DIY dude There s life lessons to be had too  Not from any canned advice  but from living in principle  living with integrity  and not being afraid to experience the more extreme parts of life   one of my favorite books of all time   This book is a series of anecdotes collected from Richard Feynman by the editor  Edward Hutchings  The subtitle   Adventures of a Curious Character  really is an understatement  While I am not sure if I d have wanted to date Feynman  he definitely sounds like someone who d have been fun to meet and get to know Highly recommended for those interested in finding out more about the people behind the sciences and for people who enjoy funny stories  A very quick  enjoyable read  a book that lets you take a peek inside the head of a genius  Amazing   Tak tahle se projevuje skutecna radost z fyziky a pritom uplne neztratil kontakt s normalnim zivotem         citace        Napadlo me  jak je to pozoruhodne  ze behem peti minut musi   a muze   byt rozhodnuto  zda bude Oak Ridge zasveceno do tajemstvi atomove bomby ci nikoliv  Takze mam pred temito chlapiky z armady veliky respekt  ja totiz nejsem schopen udelat dulezite rozhodnuti  i kdyz k tomu mam casu  kolik chci Maliri jsou ztraceni  nemaji zadny namet  Mivali nabozenska temata  ale v Boha verit prestali  a ted nemaji nic  Technickemu svetu  v nemz ziji  nerozumeji a nevedi nic o krase skutecneho sveta   sveta vedy  Takze v srdcich nemaji nic  co by malovali  I have a man crush on Mr  Feynman    Seriously  this guy is amazing  A genius  open minded  curious  a practical joker  he s so funny  Read this if you want to hear about one of the greatest and entertaining minds that ever lived  A Nobel Prize winning physicist explains how he learned to draw  lose bets  crack safes  get laid  play bongos  and about a dozen other things unrelated to physics  I have to admit that it is difficult to me to perform an unbiased critic over this book  Feynman is one of my favorite scientists and I have been a big fan for some time now  Trying to be objective I can say that the book is nice  not boring  super fun if you are into science  and super interesting  It should be obligatory for everyone studying science  I consider the chapters about his time in Brazil and the last one highly valuable to any student in general  I can only say that the book kept me with a smile in the face all the time  The book will make you love science and can help to dismiss some of the myths about scientist  introverted weirdo guys   I love the book and will recommend it until the end of my days     not joking   Everybody should read this book  I originally read parts of this as a teenager  in Russian translation and it was entertaining  with the stories of opening safes and finding flaws in uranium refinement facilities  Reading the full book  I found more entertaining stories  like about playing drums at Rio carnival  And then I finished the book  and things clicked together into something more important Feyman has accomplished quite a lot  so what can we learn  Between funny stories  we see that he was gave focused attention to everything he tried  even such things as playing drums or cracking safes or painting  He did not care much about social norms  visiting strip clubs to drink some 7 up   or impressions  calling stupid ideas as such right away   or being organized  nearly sleeping in a pile of fallen leaves once   The last chapter say the most important thing is to be  utterly honest   By the contrast  social ideal these days appear to be a person who is serious  polite  socially acceptable and is into  getting things done    but does not necessary tries his best to check the important things   much like book reviewers Feyman describes  who gave A rating to a book having nothing but empty pages  And later  such people become just  pompous fools   We all need to try staying as utterly honest as possible  and making it into key social norm  above all forms of pretense  The most amazing thing about this book is how little it has to do with what he is so famous for  Instead it is filled with anecdotes that will make you laugh and then make you think  Somewhere between the samba band and the Japanese geishas Richard manages to impart some serious wisdom that changed how I think about the world  GREAT book on Physics and a great Physicist  My first biography book that i read    and    Richard Feynman was very interesting person  His enthusiasm for physics was amazing  An excellent read   very entertaining  I ve definitely got to check out some of his other memoirs and writing   Feynman served  along with Henry Higgins from My Fair Lady  as my early role model for how to be a man  This would be the best autobiography you ve ever read It definitely was for me Richard Feynman wrote about his life in the same way you would sit down with a friend over a coffee after a long time apart and just spill over what has been going on in your life  Mr  Feynman talked about his childhood  his school days  math  physics  the Manhattan Project  the Nobel Prize  how to draw  how to play drums  how to gamble  how to pick locks  how to flirt with girls at bars  how to educate  how to inspire kids  how to masterfully troll the rich and the prideful and the fools and the gullible and the people who are in theory smarter and wiser than you As you can see  Mr  Feynman was a life long learner with a life long curiosity for new things and new skills Long story short  Richard   or Dick  as he preferred    Feynman was a legit magnificent bastard  And this book was a magnificent ride  The autobiographical accounts of Mr  Feynman are witty and insightful  They provide a glimpse of Feynman s adventures with regular people   Most of the stories are commonplace  but Feynman s curiosity  intelligence and funny attitude turn them into adventures  About Mr  Feynman  he enjoyed his life by doing things that he mostly loved  I liked his  cut the crap  attitude  I did not get surprised by the fact that he was multi talented in various forms of arts and music as he was a great learner  Many scientists are multi talented  but his showmanship was rare  Probably he was a bigger showman than Einstein  and that was a killer combo The book is easy to read  Enjoyed reading all the chapters  This is now the 2nd time I ve read this book and it still remains my favourite  Loved his character   The book is written in a very simple style Richard Feynman inspires me  I aspire to have that little touch of crazy and lifelong dose of curiosity  Spustia gody  perechital po angliiski  Ochen  vdokhnovliaiushchee chtenie  avtorskie idei i zhiznennaia filosofiia  prosto otdel nye frazy  prosto super  Nado skazat   chto to li iz za kuda bolee medlennogo chteniia po angliiski  to li prosto iz za izmenivshegosia vospriiatiia  ili nakonets prosto effekta vtorogo prochteniia  nashel dlia sebia mnogo novogo   This is a great book to read even if you have no interest in physics or science  He had a great outlook on life  Read this one in college  Loved it then  Feynman was a genius  not like  oh  that guy s a genius  but like  no  really  he was a legitimate genius   as well as a hilarious dude  which makes this collection of anecdotes about his life a fun and inspiring read I don t understand science very well   I ve tried his book Six Easy Pieces and I just don t find them easy   but I admire the man so much for his honesty  integrity  and curiosity  He s one of my heroes  Ademas de compartirnos sus anecdotas hilarantes  Feynman nos da una leccion de lo que se puede lograr mediante un pensamiento libre  es decir  aquel que se motiva por nuestras pasiones intelectuales y no por lo que  debemos  aprender  Una lectura comica y educativa  Great book about thinking about the world in an inquisitive way   Absolutely gorgeous one from a great mind of 20th century  Gives insight into how Dick Feynman s brain was operating and how he made certain decisions in his life  It s amazing how he always used his geeky  scientific mind even in solving real life problems like finding a date or avoiding an unnecessary meeting All of us could learn from his stubborn geeky attitude of trying to complete anything that got into his hands  trying to solve any puzzle that he takes upon  hating to give up in any situation  even learning to play african bongo drums  Lastly  I think I start seeing a trend  each great book written by an outstanding individual is a heck of a fun reading  EN Realy great book about on of greatest brain in human history CZ Skvela knizka ktera popisuje vtipne a inteligentni prihody pana Feynmana  genialniho matematika a vedce Kniha letmo popisuje jeho detstvi  nejvice se soustredi na jeho pusobeni v Los Alamos pri vyvijeni jaderne bomby  Best book ever  He s now my favourite scientist and I think everybody should read this book  Motivating beyond words  Shows you the path to success and gives you a quick look into the happy life of this great scientist   I used  scientist  not  physicist   I m left with the impression that Feyman lived a full life because he was comfortable and honest with himself  This is a book within which Feynman boasts about demonstratively proving to upperclassmen frat boys at MIT that it is actually quite possible to piss while standing on your head   As well as learn percussion in the favelas of Brazil  enjoying the freedoms of Las Vegas  and doing whatever it is that he feels is worth his time and conscious effort  In that way it reminds me Arnold Schwarzenegger s auto bio  two talented pragmatic individuals that didn t dither about questioning their decisions when tenaciously pursuing goals  Unlike Arnold s auto bio Feynman continually mentions  absent self conscious emphasis  that he is an idiot  under educated  acted like a fool  his cover was blown  he can t remember things  and he has benefited from a lot of luck  His  hardwork  is obscured because he was lucky enough to have the freedom to find and pursue things he enjoyed as ends in themselves instead of in service of a social or political goal   This is how I learned    drums  drawing  mayan astronomy  sensory deprivation     All the stories share a mindset that the world can be lived as an adventure and there are no optimal plays which we need to worry about divining and matching to our personal scores   Feynman s stories are equally interesting and hilarious  From his work on the atom bomb to hanging out in topless bars  Feynman leads his life with little worry about the opinion of others  A must read  I wanted to meet him   It was an absolute delight to read about Feynman s life  I loved his book of bizarre and wonderful anecdotes  He was truly a curious character   Otto  Een prachtig boek  Moest regelmatig luidop lachen  Hilarious  engaging series of anecdotes from one of the most iconoclastic persons of the modern era  Completely accessible even to those without a significant background in Physics    there s very little in the way of formulas and equations outside of a few clever arithmetic tricks  A total pleasure to read  and a window into one of greatest minds of all time  Can t wait to read his other stuff  From safe cracking to deciphering Mayan hieroglyphics to helping build the bomb at Los Alamos  Mr  Feynman lived a very full and interesting life  It is written very casually and he will write about picking up a receptionist in the same paragraph as explaining complex mathematical theories  I enjoyed how he explained the difference between learned and applied knowledge  His curiosity was sparked by anything that he could not explain  whether it be how the human sense of smell compares to a bloodhounds or how to fix transistors on a radio  It was really cool to read about his experience at Los Alamos and how he communicated with his ill wife through secret codes  The book is a series of short stories making it an ideal read while you are working on another book  I read this book when i was very young  12 years old   and i have to say it struck me as something great  Not the book in itself  but Richard Feynman  It was this book that made me a great student  and though i didn t follow his field  i liked physics but i was always much more interested and better at humanities  he inspired me in a way none of my teachers could  I remember  being in a small portuguese town  that me and a friend who introduced Feynman to me  wondering how it would be to receive a Nobel prize or to have a PhD  Now  with 23 years old  he s finishing med school and i m a clinical psychologist preparing to enroll for a PhD in experimental psychology  And when i think of it  it s interesting to know that all this interest  all this need for science and enlightenment came from those pages in a book that is now lying in my bookshelf  May this book strike you in the way it stroke me   This book was SO funny  I love biographies  history  and non fiction but I know nothing of science  I purchased this book during a sale at Audible a while ago and it sat for a while before I started listening  What a surprise and a joy this book is  I didn t understand the tech jargon but I loved the insight into a brilliant brain and the humor and curiosity We are amateur astronomers and we are always laughing at the lack of humor that the  brains  in the club are missing  I might be a bit insensitive  but academics sometimes are not blessed with a funny bone  I was very sad when the book came to an end  An Inspirational blockbuster of a Green alive daring truthful person for all those who wants to live their lives resourcefully  a peek into a beautiful mind  God  do I love this man  That one of the grand physicists of the 20th century could be so completely human  so entertaining in off the cuff remarks  so side splittingly funny  so genuinely self deprecating yet as genuinely arrogant    I don t know anyone like him  but I wish to hell I had known him while he was alive As a Brooklyn Jew  he comes across as a melding of Jimmy Breslin and wacky Uncle Moshe  In rapid fire recountings  complete with verbal sound effects  he traces his upbringing  academic meanderings and total inability to accept formality and hypocrisy in the world  Growing up constantly unsure of himself  especially in the social world  he continually fell into situations in which he expected to blunder but found  because of his intense  around the corner way of viewing reality and his uninhibited need to experiment  that he almost always came out not just OK  but firmly on top With no background in art  he blundered into drawing and ended up a respected painter  With no ability to read music and no idea of music theory  he became a leading figure in a Rio samba school band and a whizz on African drums  Feynman was the perfect ad for  just do it     don t think about it  just do it In his  official  career  he turned quantum mechanics on its side  if not its head  with truly innovative ways of viewing the most abstruse issues in physics  As a teacher  he gained the respect and love of his students  The e version I read gives no hint of where  when or how the interviews took place that caught him in such a wide  receptive mood  Maybe he was always that way  but I d love to know how they came about What  in the end  did Feynman most want out of life  Considering the amount of time he gives to the topic  it may have been to get laid  Excellent book that makes you revisit basic things in life and re evaluate  Surely Mr Feynman had a content life  considering that he was able to do such diverse subjects such as play bongo  learn to paint  learn foreign languages  safe cracking etc etc  while at the same time excel at his core specialty love i e  physics and get a Nobel prize  Its a must read  preferably when you are still in school  Fatastic read    Loved this book  This is one of the books I like to re read  Bongo roll for Fenyman  This man knows what life is about  It takes a masterful troll to live a life as interesting as he did   and get away with it  I guess being a tenured professor and winner of the Nobel Prize can help you with that  Makes me wonder if I d enjoy math more if I did it in strip clubs   This is the kind of thing my father had me read when I was young  and I wouldn t have wanted it differently  Feynman was the quintessential curious character  genius  physicist  musician  artist  amateur safe cracker  etc etc etc  In  Surely You re Joking     and  What do You Care What Other People Think   we re exposed to a bouyant personality who is driven by a desire to understand the world and the people in it  a person who is light hearted  adventurous  and never willing to compromise their belief in the wonder that exists around us all the time  Everyone would be a better person for reading this book   Not strictly an autobiography   Surely You re Joking     reveals more about Feynman s genius than any conventional blow by blow account of his life possibly could  It is hilarious  completely unbelievable and massive page turner  Another thing worth noting is that  whilst occasionally referencing scientific principles  the work isn t burdened by them   so it is suitable for physicists and non physicists alike  Read this book  Loved this book I can understand now why there is such a fan aura around Feynman s stories readers  He was a fascinating person in just about everything you can consider and I d bet he s one of the most cited famous persons as  Dead person I d like to meet   He d try anything just to see if he could do it  and how far he could do it  How many scientists passed as a somewhat successful musician or painter  at a near professional level  without actually applying all the necessary work for that  The stories in this book are both hilarious and unbelievable  He was both an intellectual and social genius  the fraternity chapter is what I mean by  social genius   Great story  There isn t a logical sequence between the stories  but most of them are very interesting  enlightening  curious  hilarious    and this is just one set of his amazing stories  I can t wait to read more  and  for those interested in physics  his lessons are  probably  terrific from all I ve heard  One of the most entertaining books I have read  Loved it   tell funny stories with the life philosophy  One of my favorite educational characters  This man knew how to teach  A spectacular account of a life in science  Anything Feynman makes me happy  A wonderfully candid autobiography  Not a paragon  but an earnest and honest brilliant man trying to make the most out of his life  Mr  Feynman was quite a character as evidenced in many of his books  This one is no different  An in depth look at one of the greatest minds science ever has  or ever will see   Feynman is a great story teller  a true curious individual and a most interesting character  One who lives a life so full of adventures can say that he has truly lived   Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman told by Richard Feynman is a book containing the famous physicist s funniest and most exciting anecdotes  Feynman was a physicist who worked on The Manhattan Project and eventually became a professor  He is a very clever and determined person  which makes this book hilarious  All of the stories made me laugh  For example  Feynman was trying to become an expert safecracker while he was working at Los Alamos  Eventually he knew how to unlock almost any safe  He said   I opened the safes which contained all the secrets to the atomic bomb  the schedules for the production of the plutonium  the purification procedures  how much material is needed  how the bomb works  how the neutrons are generated  what the design is  the entire information that was known at Los Alamos  the whole schmeer    149   Feynman was able to break into these safes all by himself  This shows how funny this book is  Another funny moment is after Feynman had his physical before entering the army  The book read   I started looking at the papers the psychiatrists had written  and it looked pretty serious  The first guy wrote  Thinks people talk about him  Thinks people stare at him  Auditory hypnogogic hallucinations  Talks to self  Talks to deceased wife  Maternal aunt in mental institution  Very peculiar stare   161  This book made me laugh every chapter  Another reason this book is great is because it teaches you about science and math  One example is when he shows his classmates that French curves  stencils in a specific shape  are special because no matter how they hold it  the lowest point on the curve has a tangent that is horizontal  The book says   They were all excited by this  discovery   even though they had already gone through a certain amount of calculus and had already  learned  that the derivative  tangent  of the minimum  lowest point  of any curve is zero  horizontal    36   This book has some humor  with some education along with it  This book is great because it tells the adventurous stories of Feynman in a funny way  It also teaches math and science  The stories are very interesting and never kept me bored  This was a great read  This my supreme most favoritest book ever of all time    Nebyl to zadny skryty zert  co vyvolavalo jeho usmev a ohnicky v ocich  byla to fyzika  Richard Feynman  1918 1988  byl americky fyzik  ktery v roce 1965 ziskal Nobelovu cenu  Kniha je jeho vypravenim spousty  ve valne vetsine az neuveritelnych  prihod ze vsemoznych oblasti zivota   detstvi  studium  badani  cestovani  uceni  seznamovani se se zenami  vyvoj atomove bomby a tak dale Myslim  ze na cteni neni treba byt nejak vic vzdelan v oblasti matematiky nebo fyziky  kde se to prekladateli zdalo vhodne nutne  doplnil knihu poznamkami  a ze vsem muzu Feynmanovu knizku vrele doporucit   Nemate tip na neco podobneho   Rikali  ze se proslavim  sotva tam prijedu  tim  ze udelam nejakou hloupost  Takze jsem se snazil o trochu dustojnosti a vahave jsem se vzdal myslenky na prespani v te kupe listi   Kdyz se lidi spolu bavi  zacnou se vrtet a tak  Tenhle novinar zase okopaval zarazku dveri  takze jsem rekl    Ano  tohle je ta prava zarazka ve dverim zrovna sem   Zarazkou byla ctvrtmetrova polokoule ze zluteho kovu   ze zlata  abychom byli presni Doslo k tomu takhle  Potrebovali jsme experimentalne zjistit  jak ruzne materialy odrazeji neutrony  aby nam neutrony neutikaly pryc a nespotrebovali jsme prilis mnoho stepneho materialu  Vyzkouseli jsme spoustu ruznych latek  Zkouseli jsme platinu  zinek  zkouseli jsme mosaz a take zlato  A z testu se zlatem nam zbyly kusy zlata  nacez nekdo dostal chytry napad pouzit zlate polokoule jako zarazky dveri v mistnosti s plutoniem   Zacal jsem ten clanek cist  V jednom kuse se tam mluvilo o extenzorech  flexorech  gastrocnemialnim svalu atd  Sem tam nejake svaly byly sice pojmenovany  ale nemel jsem poneti  kde se nachazeji vzhledem k nervum a kocce samotne  Sel jsem tedy do biologicke knihovny a pozadal knihovnici  jestli by tam nemela mapu kocky   Mapu kocky  pane   opakovala zdesene    Patrne myslite anatomicky obraz   Od te doby koluje povest o jednom postgradualnim studentovi biologie mdleho rozumu  ktery shanel   mapu kocky  Kdyz jsem prisel na radu s referatem na toto tema  zacal jsem s tim  ze jsem namaloval obrysy kocky a zacal vyjmenovavat ruzne svaly Ostatni studenti me hned zarazili    Tohle vsechno zname    Jo  vy to znate   povidam    Pak se ovsem nedivim  ze vam i bez ctyr let biologie klidne stacim   Promarnili celou tu dobu memorovanim takovychhle veci  ktere si clovek muze behem patnacti minut vyhledat   Bylo mi nanic a vysilovalo me  kdyz jsem se musel v restauraci rozhodnout co si dam sladkeho  Tak jsem se rozhodl  ze to bude jednou provzdy cokoladova zmrzlina  a uz jsem si s tim nikdy nedelal starosti   tenhle problem jsem mel vyreseny     In short  here is Feynman s life in all its eccentric glory   a combustible mixture of high intelligence  unlimited curiosity  and raging chutzpah   After reading Feynman  the comic book biography of Richard Feyman  I was rather interested in reading this autobiography  With my own background in chemistry and scientific research  I knew that I would enjoy hearing his philosophy behind his own research  but what I got was much more  This book allowed me to see inside the mind of one of the smartest man of the past century  Not only was he smart in terms of physics  but he excelled at most everything he put his mind to  With a never ending curiosity  he learned how to do everything from samba to drawing to safe cracking  I think that I would be great friends with this man  even though it sounds like he may be quite vain  It would also be difficult going to a bar with him  because it seems that he was quite the womanizer  although most people say they have more luck with women than they actually do   I appreciate his desire to understand concepts  instead of just knowing the concept itself  I think that this book should be a must read for people in high school or atleast for those entering college  If only more people went about learning the way that he does  I believe we would have a much improved educational system and a more interesting social world Takeaway   ask why  don t be afraid to push through comfort zones  explain why something doesn t work  instead of only why it does  always stay interested  travel Short narrative pieces that make up a fantastic life  Every time I picked it up it really stimulated my imagination  It s great to see how a person can live in a world of facts and correct answers  and still have such an abstract curiosity  A must read for any brain torn between the creative and analytical which will make you feel right at home  Provides an amazing perspective on even the smallest things in life  Mr  Feynman was a genius who actually appears to have related to and understood ordinary people  This is an amazing book  The world is a poorer place without Mr  Feynman in it  Surprised how such a person manged to win a Nobel prize  They are supposed to be boring people  right   Never did I know that such an absolutely brilliant person could be so funny     and so incredibly diverse in his interests  Mr  Feynman is an inspiration to all scholars that not only is it completely fine to passionately love whatever it is that you love  but to remember there are other things in life to enjoy  yes  even pursue towards mastery  I had two major takeaways that personally impacted change in me  First  his intense curiosity  It s easy to slip into either a  I m too cool to be bothered with such things  mindset  or a focused mindset that is too narrow to handle outside interests  Both limit our capabilities and potential  Second  his mindset towards theory development  Finishing my own PhD  I was struck with his comments on scientific integrity  and how we should seek to invalidate our own theories  Also  he noted that  the idea is to try to give all the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution  not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another   I do believe that all scholars are aware of that fact  but he really made it incredibly relevant with his own stories  Richard Feynman is the epitome of what it means for me to have lived an exciting life  So amazed by all his accomplishments and his personality  The big takeaway for me was how he was always just curious about everything in a very childlike  innocent way  Questioning everything and trying everything  From working on the atomic bomb to participating in a samba school to lead a samba school in Rio to learning how to pick up women at bars to winning the Nobel prize in Physics  He certainly is a extremely Fine Man  Real pleasure and inspiration  Laughed throughout the book  This is a short review  While I did always know the likable and amazing genius of Richard Feynman  I finally managed to read this book  after delaying forever  If there s one point I want to highlight here  it would be that Feynman was amazing not because of his intelligence or smartness  which are pretty great too   but because he was a straightforward thinker  a curious soul  and unbiased explorer  These are things I ve partially thought about in the past myself  and have wanted to incorporate into my own life  and reading this book only gives me inspiration that I was right  In a very comical and fun way  he also debunks all the unnecessary and strange norms of behaviour and society  His vast range of interests and dedicated attempts to do well at everything interesting is also very inspiring  Great personality ever  So much to learn from a single man  He always did the things that he liked and not because of need   Feynman demonstrated the philosophy of a life well lived and this book captures his intellectual bravura as well as his overriding humanity  it takes the format of a collection of vignettes staged over the life of Feynman including his childhood  his time at Los Alamos on the Manhattan Project  his career as a trailblazing physicist as well as the tragic passing of his first wife  all the time you get a sense of the fun of living alongside him and his extraordinary mental faculties which forced some paradigm shifts in our understanding of twentieth century physics  at a time when particle physics was perhaps showing a tendency to  tread water   It spares us the gory details of equations and mathematics  meaning it s ridiculously easy to read  An engaging human interest story for science geeks and book lovers alike  by the end of the book you ll feel you know Richard Feynman and his life s work  there is nothing missing  a very well written book which makes you want to live as vivaciously as the man himself  forced u to think I could almost not put this book down  Dr  Feynman was an incredible person  who I think has experienced almost all the things life has to offer  So many of his views resonate so strongly with me  Being a Graduate student  his book has already opened my mind to so many concepts of scientific thinking and learning by understanding  I think this will be the first non fiction book that I will add in my all time favorite book list  His take on life  work and enjoyment is something I wish to emulate and wish some of my friends emulated too  His fun loving attitude towards everything is one that more people in life should do  I am so glad I chose to start this book  and I recommend it to pretty much everyone  Very    refreshing  A new perspective on a working physicist of the current generation  It was a pleasant and human journey  contrary to many accounts of people who work in technical fields   3 Brilliant  A lot of great  fun stories which show that not all scientists are boring geeks  It would ve been a great inspiration to meet a man line mr  Feynman  but I m still happy that we can meet him through his books Full of hilarious and sometimes outrageous anecdotes  I was laughing out loud throughout each chapter  Feynman  as portrayed in this book  lived the way many of us would like to  but perhaps don t have the guts to  This book is really about his personal philosophy for life  which is described through personal parables and anecdotes rather than direct specification  Feynman comes across as good natured  brutally honest  and uncommonly curious  These core characteristics take him on many adventures  from safe cracker  to bongo player  to atomic bomb builder  I loved reading this book  Feynman was a great scientific genius of his time  but these memoirs reveal how human he was    his love of learning  his prankster nature  and his interest in a great variety of subjects  I look forward to sharing this with my boys  when they are old enough for us to discuss his cavalier attitudes toward picking up ladies  Ah well   even the great have their faults and foibles   What a great book  This isn t an autobiography so much as a series of anecdotes from his crazy life  The whole tone feels like you re sitting next to him at a bar listening to these great stories  Feynman had a truly brilliant mind and unique personality  Highly  highly recommended  One of the greatest characters in human history  And he was not imaginary  If I had a time machine  I d choose being a part of at least a one of his numerous adventures  Feynman helped invent the nuclear bomb alright  but his character can go no wrong in my fan eyes  This book was a great beginning to my journey of discovering a great scientist and a great man  My favorite book until now    The world is filled with extraordinary people  Some of them stay hidden or keep a rather low profile  while others get all the fame and world appreciation  This is rather unfortunate  as we can t even imagine how much we lose by not knowing what all of these amazing people have to offer to the world  Go for a walk on the street and ask a random person if he ever heard about Einstein or Newton  and in the majority of time you we ll get an affirmative answer  They might even provide some clues related to their work and the importance of their discoveries  Ask them the same about Richard Feynman  and you ll probably get a confused look and no idea for an answer  unless the person you ve just ask studied physics or has a good general knowledge  Before I started reading this book  I did know a little about Feynman  perhaps I even watched a couple of videos with or about him  I kind of knew that he was an atypical character  famed for his free spirit  but that s about all  Thanks to  Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman    I have discovered one of the most interesting persons of the 20th century  He encompassed so many qualities one could search in a role model and some of his ideas or views on life I identify with  Sure  he was the boy genius of the 20th century physics and ended up winning a Nobel Prize in this field  but the book is not about his discoveries or a popularization of science  It just describes some of his best memories  as he recalls them  while offering his view on knowledge and teaching  art or picking locks  That s right  picking locks  Always on the search for learning something interesting  and finding a great pleasure in tricking other people  he developed a passion for puzzles and stuff like lockpicking and code breaking  that would allow him to jest with his colleagues or other persons  What seemed like a funny game sometimes brought his  victims  to despair  and as his fame grew some people were even trying to avoid him in fear of his pranks  Most persons appreciated him for his honesty  his ability to always speak his mind  Niels Bohr or some army generals would choose him from a group of scientists and ask for an opinion or advice because Feynman was not afraid to say what he was thinking  Once a conversation would start about science  everything else seemed to stop mattering and the truth was all that was left  even if it was a little harder to accept by the ones who started the discussion  His trip to Brazil is also relevant to this aspect  Displeased by the way students learnt there  he gave a speech that ended up changing an entire system  Even though he was satisfied with the idea of not knowing all the answers  he always pledged for a search of knowledge and truth  Not taking things for granted  without any evidence  He advised his students to keep their scientific integrity  and wished them to be in a place where  you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization  or financial support  or so on  to lose your integrity  May you have that freedom  But his affinities where not strictly related to science  He seemed interested in everything  to learn to play some instruments  to dancing or painting  even to discovering the wonders hidden behind hallucinations or some sort of out of body experiences  I particularly liked his view on alcohol or drugs  even though he wondered what the effect of some drugs would be  he claims that he never tried them because he likes to much to think and wouldn t want anything to affect that  On a similar situation are his relations to women and the chapters that describe some memories related to them are quite amusing  I really liked this book and how it presents this amazing person  That is exactly what books should seek  to present you places or people that will impress you  and that can have an impact on the reader and on the way he sees the world  And the more wonderful they are when they describe a real person  someone that loved life in all his aspects and never said no to learning something new   Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman is an autobiography of an accomplished physicist and a Nobel Prize winner Richard P  Feynman  We might judge him as a guy who was obsessed with physics and maths  we are partly right  but there were more  He was so curious about everything around him and liked to learn new skills  A long ass of adventure  from learning to hypnotize  to cracking safes for fun  playing pranks on colleagues that spies had stolen the secret of atomic bomb  altering education system in Brazil  learning to speak Japanese  earning the skill in art which he had sucked at school  solving maths and preparing lessons in strip club  drawing women  expressing his love for music  and many more  I expected the book to be full of maths and complicated concepts of science  but no  I didn t see it coming  The ways he narrated his adventures are humorous and entertaining  Readers can enjoy the story of his journeys and learning life lessons at the same time from the man who spent most of his life interrogating what he wanted to know  I m grateful that I chose this book as the first one among his others  I cannot wait to dive into his next masterpieces  Funny book about a very interesting man  full of anecdotes and inspiring thoughts I read it in Croatian translations and I have to add that it seams it was not proofread at all   never before have I seen so many grammar and sentence structure errors in a single book  but I could not let that influence the book rating because it was really a great read  Although I would fire that proofreader  you can found out her name yourself  P  This guy is my hero  unpretentious attitude  brilliant mindI have a simple mind  Therefore I like simple people  I like simple people with brilliant mind even better  That might be the biggest reason I like this book Being one of the most distinguished physicists in 20th century and a Nobel Prize winner  Mr  Feynman surely has a brilliant mind  That is great  but doesn t interest me as much  What makes me wonder is he sees the world like a child   he plays with physics  enjoys it  has lots of fun with it  When I read his anecdotes  I feel the same curiosity and energy I see in my 7 month old Elizabeth  everything is fresh and new to her and you just can t fake that  Mr  Feynman likes girls  he doesn t hide it  he talks about how he learns about girls  understand them  making sense of their behaviors  he enjoys doing that just like he enjoys understanding the rest of the world But you are mistaken if you think the anecdotes are trivia therefore of low value  Simplicity if powerful  Mr  Feynman is unpretentious  yet between his lines  you find his deep thoughts  His thoughts on why Brazil doesn t have  any  physics education apply even today to many  His experience on debating over offers from Cornell and Caltech and his two lines of comment on that hit me like a rock My biggest takeaway from the book  Simplicity is powerful  Be loyal to yourself  Of course  that s my word  And Mr  Feynman s word is much more fun   Great book   A fascinating read  and also surprisingly hilarious  I didn t expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that s what ended up happening    Feynman definitely was a first class prankster  Although physics are often mentioned  you don t need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book  this is more about his life than his work  It s a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning  not only physics but also music  bongo player    painting and so on  Makes you just want to learn those things you ve been postponing for a while  I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book  but if that s how the women he met really were  there s nothing really to do about it  you can t rewrite history I would really advise everybody to read this book  Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner  worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about  Really  what I m going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on  What an amazing collection of stories about Feynman  He is really engaging and lives the life we all want to live  I wish I had the chance to meet him in my earlier life and wish I would ve found this book years ago Favorite quotes 1   You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish  I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be  It s their mistake  not my failing  2   Ordinary fools are all right  you can talk to them  and try to help them out  But pompous fools   guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus   THAT  I CANNOT STAND   Probably the only book I ll write a review for  This book changed my life and inspired me to study mathematics  On top of being one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century  Richard Feynman was a damn good writer and an overall incredible human being  Funny and poignant  this is my favorite book of all time  Highly recommended  If you ever want to understand the working of an analytical totally unbiased  cool mind  this is the book  Reading this book instills an attitude  that might perhaps come with years of research  A priceless gem  You can see why a generation of sketchy Internets businessmen are in love with this book  Richard Feynman was the OG haX0r  and in fact I think he actually did hack a computer back during the Manhattan Project era  when a computer was the size of a small building and you had to feed tape in it  He had that mentality that was all about figuring out ways to game the system  prank people and come up with novel solutions for problems  Sometimes this manifests itself in the form of brilliant scientific breakthroughs  and sometimes it s just goofy stories about trying to pick up chicks in bars  He s also just a masterful storyteller  These stories more or less span the course of the 20th century  and you can t help but get kinda verklempt once you get to the point where he can t have much longer to live       unless he s somehow found a way to cheat death  This was such a delightful read  makes you fall in love with the Richard Feynman  Such a genius mind  such a playful mind    really loved reading this one  Gives you a great insight into the life   minds of one of the most brilliant personality of last century  Had fun  One of my all time favorite memoirs  You feel you re walking alongside Mr  Feynman  whether he s in his childhood neighborhood or through the halls of NASA  Perfectly written book  I want to be a theoretical physicist after reading this  But obviously I can t  So  I just continue my study in Computer Science  A lot of reviews on this site say that Mr  Feynman sounds like a selfish man  who takes pleasure in the pain and misfortune of others  Ican certainly see how  but I really enjoyed his view on science and education  Richard Feynman is a rare combination of intelligence and exuberance  The book gives a sense of both of these qualities  I found myself laughing aloud as I read it  an unusual quality for a nonfiction book  absolute genius   utterly funny   immensely thought provoking    Very unique read from a genius   and what a character    Funny  wonderful autobiography  It is both deeply personal and still deals with his concepts and ideas as well  You can simply enjoy it as a good story  The anecdotes of Feynman s antics create an entertaining profile of a curious  brilliant  and often hilarious mind  One of the great geniuses of the 20th century spins inspiring anecdotes about beans  Brazilian music and codebreaking  And a bit of physics   Interesting Book  This is a delightful book  I would recommend it to everyone   to get introduced to a remarkable man  You don t need to know about science and physics to appreciate Feynman s intelligence  passion  open curiosity  thirst to learn anything and everything new  his unorthodox way of thinking  In one lifetime  how much can one man learn and do  If you are anything like Feynman  diverse and plenty  that s leaving aside the Nobel   The book tells us accounts of Feynman   how he had an experimental laboratory at home as a child and also fixed radios  how he learnt to pick up girls  and how he learnt to pick locks  how he learnt foreign languages   Spanish Portuguese Japanese Cantonese  how he learnt to play samba music and played in a carnival  how he learnt to sketch and actually put up his own art exhibition  how he played with Physics in day to day life  how he learnt numbers for fun  how his wife and he managed to circumvent the censorship at Los Alamos through codes  how he challenged the education board    In his words   pick up something and see how far he could go  Amazing stories  I  for starters  wish I had learnt my basics in science  physics and maths the way he did   The mind of a genius  probably slightly exaggerated  but loaded with tidbits of useful information  Incredibly inspiring  Feynman was a great scientist  but what stands out in his memoir is his try anything attitude  He writes with an artless grace about the Manhattan Project  growing up as a nerdy Jewish kid  hanging out with bookmakers in a bar I wouldn t be caught dead in  playing bongo drums  science textbooks  and a whole lot more  This book  needless to say  covers a lot of ground  It s history and science  and it s funny as anything  http   blog nishantmodak com 2008 05     This is a hilarious book   literally had me laughing out loud throughout  I kept thinking of more and more people I wanted to recommend it to as I was reading it before finally deciding that everyone should  It s funny  has content on math and science  social topics  honesty  and integrity in science  I surely hope there s something for everyone in it  I was first introduced to this book by a dear friend in college  Then it primarily amused me  While it is still incredibly amusing  its main impact upon me now is more inspirational  Below the level of a lot of amusing stories  you get a sense for a really incredible guy  I keep feeling  I d like to be more like that I admire Feynman s sense of fun  his curiosity and his basic sense of benevolence  Those things permeate each story and make for a great read  Feynman is one of the coolest people I ve had the pleasure to read about  He s a safecracker  bongo drummer  nobel prize winner  ladies man  professor  physicist    it just goes on and on  Very enjoyable stories in an autobiographic style  Feynman writes like he speaks  very direct and witty  There are a lot of great anecdotes in this book  like his famous analogy of cargo cult science  I find a lot of what he wrote very inspiring  e g   spoiler alert   You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish  I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be  It s their mistake  not my failing   All the time you re saying to yourself   I could do that  but I won t    which is just another way of saying that you can t  The book had it s lengths for me at the beginning  when he talked about his years as a kid and teenager  but his time when he was building the bomb and afterwards made up for that  This book was hilarious  I am a biologist  and some of the technical physical stuff I wasn t familiar with  but it was totally relatable and the stories were interesting  It seemed like he was willing to try just about anything  it s a kind of life that would be fun to lead  Only drawback was I kind of expected him to have spent a bit more time talking about how horrible it was to have been part of creating nuclear weaponry  Would definitely recommend the book to others  even if you don t think of yourself as a  scientist    awesome Brilliant  inspirational and very funny  There can be no argument that Richard P Feynman was a genius  He has been a hero of mine since I was very young  probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud  Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age  He would always want to know   How does that work   or  Why is that the way it is   or  Is there another way to do that   He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it  and to do it really well  For example  witnessing the bongo playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio taught purist  He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion What made Feynman a genius  Well  there were lots of factors that contributed to his status  many of them discussed in other reviews of this book  but  my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five year old  That is TRUE genius I have read this book many times  It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die  If you haven t read it already  you should  You really need to read this book  I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life  Inspirational stories about a fun and interesting way to live life  Ho scoperto Feynman recentemente e mi ha creato immediatamente una fascinazione che non capita spesso  mi sono ingurgitato decine di minuti di suoi video su youtube  e ora ho letto questo suo libro  e ora ne vorrei altri  e altri ce ne sono  quindi smetto di scrivere e vado a leggere  Ciao  il libro merita  probabilmente nella vita reale in alcune situazioni l avrei riempito di schiaffi  ma gli si perdona tutto  This man is as fascinating as he is brilliant  I m not normally one for biographies  but this one I had a hard time putting down  One of the most inspirational books I have read lately  Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist  this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning  thinking and experimenting in life and academics career  Feynman comes across as an honest  courageous  fun filled character who had certain child like innocence and curiosity in his spirit  The writing will make you laugh  wonder and think  Feynman s free spirited nature  his attitude of questioning status quo  his insatiable curiosity  his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring  to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure This book demands a permanent place in your library and re reads  Hilarious and inspiring  Feynman tells us how to remove ants without killing them  how to build a nuclear bomb  how to crack safes  how to play bongos  how to make fun of MENSA snobs  how to figure out a space shuttle explosion with a glass of water  and how to pick up women  among many other of his skills  What a great mind  Inspiring  Remarkable    An entertaining read  Feynman is certainly quite the character Surely this book is one of the best things I have ever read  Interesting  funny  most of all   it shows another way of living your life  by enjoying every bit of it  Feynman talks about a lot of the problems in our system and I loved the last chapter about science integrity and principles  Nowadays there are really few people who would bring that in discussion or try to point out the problems  because it is socially  unacceptable   but Feynman was never so dependent on the opinion and norms of the society  he was interested only what was effective for it  This bloke is like super clever and talks about cats and stuff  How life should be lived  Brilliant  Rekindled my love of asking questions for the sake of asking questions Fun and unique stories from a legendary character in science  but an even more interesting person     La finalul cartii am ajuns la concluzia ca  daca Feynman este foarte important in lumea fizicii pentru descoperirile sale  atunci ca fiinta umana nu este mai prejos  Cred ca principiile dupa care  nu numai ca se ghideaza in viata  ci si le practica in mod consecvent  ar trebui sa ni le asimilam cu totii Din randurile scrise cu mult umor  aflam cum in viata de zi cu zi incearca mereu sa fie onest si integru fata de sine insusi si  implicit  fata de ceilalti  Acest lucru il face sa astepte  destul de natural  aceleasi lucruri si din partea societatii  ceea ce de multe ori ii sacaia si nemultumea pe cei din jur  incurcandu le socotelile  Aflam cum trateaza pasiunea centrala a vietii sale  fizica  ca pe un joc care merita facut numai daca exista curiozitate si placere  Invatam ca  daca esti autodidact si perseverent  poti ajunge bun in domenii in care nu ai nicio experienta  Feynman a invatat de la zero portugheza  sa deseneze  sa cante la tobe si multe altele   Descoperim ca nonconformismul sau provine din faptul ca ii placea sa inteleaga si sa gandeasca fiecare problema intai singur  prin propriile puteri  pentru ca abia apoi sa consulte parerile celorlalti  De aici si autenticitatea si creativitatea sa atat de abundente  Si  nu in ultimul rand  invatam ca inarmati cu umor si deschidere putem trata viata ca pe un joc  astfel incat sa avem parte de o continua aventura Nu pot incheia decat afirmand cu entuziasm ca ma bucur ca mi am gasit un nou model de urmat in viata   I forget whether this book or  Why Do You Care What Other People Think  was my first non technical Feynman book  I started into  Six Easy Pieces  as a freshman  but was not yet enchanted by physics   Regardless  I read both in close proximity  and credit them  or rather  Feynman  with influencing on my choice to pursue a degree in physics  This book is part of a collection of Feynman s life stories that  while not technical  illustrate what it was about Feynman s personality that made him an outstanding scientist as well as such a popular one  While all of Feynman s books should be required reading for aspiring scientists  this book does not require a technical background  though it doesn t hurt to have one   Instead  the book illustrates Feynman s adventures  which can be appreciated by scientists and lay people alike  Certainly  in the book  Feynman comes off a little smoother than he actually was  friends indicate that his Nobel Prize  did  actually mean quite a bit to him  However  Feynman isn t shy in sharing stories that make him look silly or foolish  though there are not too many  or lecherous  Regarding the last  this is probably a PG13 book  Also  my one slight criticism of the book  or rather  Feynman  is his almost rabid atheism  though apparently that tempered over time   Overall  a fun read  One of my all time favorite books  I raised my daughter on Feynmann  Have given many copies to as gifts  first to boyfriends and then to young people   He is one of my heroes   I really enjoyed reading about his antics An amazing book  Feynman life is extraordinary  and shows you you can be smart and have lots of fun  girls included    I had soooo much fun reading this book  It s as if you re sitting in a room with Feynman and you re just randomly telling stories  Very natural  very rich  inspiring and  well  what I enjoyed the most of course  his views of life felt often times aligned with mine  so what s not to love about that   PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did  His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing  and a random person who simply knows facts about art science news but can t use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever The book is funny and clever  I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life Here are some quotes that I really connected with  And  just like it should in all stories about philosophers  it ended up in complete chaos   There were a lot of fools at the conference   pompous fools   and pompous fools drive me up the wall  Ordinary fools are all right  you can talk to them  and try to help them out  But pompous fools   guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus   that  I cannot stand         I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I d like to see the Sistine Chapel  I got there very early in the morning  bought my ticket before anybody else  and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened  I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment  in silent awe  before anybody else came in   This is Awesome  He s a natural writer with some great stories  Real person related stories    he s a bored  genius  who doesn t really consider that title to be who he is  but more of a  working title  for his projects and work  kind of like  manager  or  grunt    One of my favorite aspects of this book  and what it focuses on for a major part of the book  is about his tinkering with  breaking int  and cracking locks aka  safe cracking   Fun read about role play as a genius    4 5  One of the best biographies ever   never imagined such a cool scientist living a cool life but by no means ordinary    and the pace of book is such that it never makes you feel bored   finished it in flat 4 days if i remember right   was completely delight of a book Hilarious anecdotes about life  physics  science  college  sex  love  everything  A brilliant man who treaded equally lightly amongst minds of high mathematics and showgirls alike  and all in between  Quite interesting and amusing  May rekindle one s innate curiosity about the world around us  I think it is also useful in terms of learning better ways of thinking  Awesome look into one of the most amazing minds the world has seen  Richard Feynman was a brilliant man who looked at the world from a different angle  one that not enough people do today  This book has a great blend of intellectual topics  interesting stories  and great humor  Absolutely hilarious and inspiring  This book is an absolutely delightful read  His mischievous playfulness in attempting to dabble in all sorts of myriad things  other than his baby  physics  that he finds interesting leaves one admiring him all the more  I loved the way the book is written too  in the form of anecdotes    they seem like short stories of wonderful scientific adventures  I love the way he imbibes the scientific way of thinking in every little thing he does  and his ever present learning attitude to see how far can he get in any field  not just physics  Truly an inspiration as a scientist as well as a teacher  I m going to read his Lectures next   Just  Awesome  Narrated by  Raymond ToddLength  11 hrs and 37 mins Publisher s SummaryWith his characteristic eyebrow raising behavior  Richard P  Feynman once provoked the wife of a Princeton dean to remark   Surely you re joking  Mr  Feynman   But the many scientific and personal achievements of this Nobel Prize winning physicist are no laughing matter  In addition to solving the mystery of liquid helium  Feynman has been commissioned to paint a naked female toreador and asked to crack the uncrackable safes guarding the atomic bomb s most critical secrets  He has traded ideas with Einstein and Bohr  discussed gambling odds with Nick the Greek  and accompanied a ballet on the bongo drums  Here  woven with his scintillating views on modern science  Feynman relates the defining moments of his accomplished life  An entire honest  at times overwhelming  engaging yet entertaining  and thoughtful record of a near perfect life of a science man   this is the second time I read this book    albeit with a little more depth  a little more time trying to figure out one consistent theme in prof  Feynman life  And for me it was perseverance with an uncompromising stand for what is right  And this time I was not intimidated with his brilliance  I felt more at home that if I were somehow just work on the levels of perseverance and candour I have today  I might not win a Nobel or crack safes or even play drums et al  I would still be really happy and content with whatever I choose to do  So thanks prof   What more needs to be said  This is the Feynman    If as little as 25  of his retold antics had actually happened  the man would still be an inspiration  I fell in love with Richard Feynman and the world of Physics with this and its sequel  What Do You Care What Other People Think  I never get tired of reading about Feynman  His attitude and character is an inspiration  This book in particular reminds me of how to approach science  and the principles by which I try to investigate the world  That is  figure things out in your own way  but never ever let your own ideas fool you about what s true  It seems only natural to begin my thoughts on this book with a quote from Feynman  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself  And you are the easiest person to fool  These words capture the essence of what formed Feynman s portrait  Someone who questioned all the established notions and believed in science to be ultimately a trial and error method to arrive at the truth  His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense  What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible  It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny  intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension  For a man who won a Nobel  worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit  he is entirely unassuming  He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas  This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives  If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book  I would pick the attribute of curiosity  You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious  The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life  From what I can recollect right now  he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival  how to gamble like a high roller  how to play bongo drums  how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on  If you look at these things he learned  they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him  All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn  It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime  Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in  Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence  Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name  in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was   Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests  Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies    I know it is the way the Government works   well screw the Government   I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings  And unless I am treated like one  I m not going to have anything to do with them   These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah  but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it  This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls  A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being  Recommended   Feynman is just the limit a person can reach when he aspires to be both a physicist and an adventurer simultaneously  This is so far the best biography i have ever read  Full of witful jokes  emotions and a journey of a human which seems more like a science fiction  Lo mejor que lei este ano  who knew that physicists could be funny  at least Feynman certainly is   This book is amazing  Trust your own intellect  Take you time  Reading about Feynman s life made me feel more confident in my own life and intelligence  They are great stories  Best book I read uptill now  Could easily relate to him carrying out all the mischiefs and boy it kept me hinged till the last page  A must read   A bunch of short stories about Feynman s life   including stories of picking up girls and solving physics puzzles  Inspiring and entertaining  So funny and great A humourous  anecdotal biography of Nobel prize winner physicist  The book is not about physics  but about unfathomable curiosity  undamping enthusiasm  bubbling energy  quick wit  exceptional brilliance  and charming innocence  Makes you want to live your life   in style   The first principle is that you must not fool yourself   and you are the easiest person to fool  Fantastic  Feynman is one of my personal heroes This is one of the most brilliant autobiographies I ve ever read  Big fan  highly recommended  Truly one of the best books I have ever read  I had a smile on my face 90  of the time I spent reading this wonderful collection of stories from the fascinating life of Feynman  The passion  humor  and wit of this genius is unparalleled  I didn t like the font type in the book  It was too small and looked dull but I went along with it somehow  Apprehensive about the outcome I started reading it and felt engaged and I warmed up to the theme of the book quickly  As the title suggests it has humor and I did burst out laughing quite a few times reading it  And I am happy to share that I completed it in over a weekend i e 350 odd pages covered in 48 hours P S   I wrote a small blogpost on it  Please visit http   musingsmith blogspot in 2014 1    Takoi milyi diad ka  vsemirno izvestnyi fizik  soavtor atomnoi bomby

 Potriasaiushche  vdokhnovliaiushche  poznavatel no  Prosto ne otorvat sia ot chteniia  Rekomenduiu vsem   This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life  It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics  In retrospect  this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940  but nowadays it s a tough slog in physics  both money wise and also discovery wise  I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful  though perhaps these string theorists put my foot in my mouth   I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24  but all is not lost  physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines  and all has worked out for the best  I retain a deep fondness for this book  and rereading old passages brings me comfort  If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile  I recommend that you read this book  All will work out for the best for you too   It s an amazing book  Starting a little bit boring  but gets much better later  I think that some parts of this book should be given to children in school to inspire scientific thinking and general interest to science   jiibnttaa kibhaabe baacaa ucit aar pRthibiittaake kibhaabe dekhaa ucit shikhlaam    maajhe besh kyyekbaar haaste haaste grraagrri khelaam

character  Lots of important lessons sprinkled throughout  Adore anything written by or about Richard Feynman     Awesome  Feynman is the man  and this book proves it  He is so cool about everything he does  and he s good at it  but not egotistical  a really interesting autobiography Richard Feynman hablando de La Bomba  putas  tocar samba en Brasil y esa vez que gano un pequeno premio llamado Nobel  Hilarious    but sciency Such a fun fun read   There we re laugh out loud moments and passages that I couldn t help but read aloud to my husband  A great read    I ve recommended this book to many friends and family  This is a book I re read probably 10 times thanks to short memory and enjoyable quality of the storytelling  As I m reading it now  an older and perhaps wiser man  I see not just funny and clever stories that used to cheer me up but actual lessons on how people work  on how science works  One for the Cannon  Highly recommend the audio version  you ll get a peek into an genius s hilarious way of thinking  This fantastic collection of anecdotes reminded me of Tom Sawyer and at times Catcher in the Rye  I rarely laugh out loud while reading  but Feynman is so over the top that I couldn t help myself with this book  Feynman personifies science and the free spirit of discovery  Just extraordinary   The stories themselves are quite funny  interesting and make you think at the same time  which is quite hard to achieve  but somehow   Mr  Feynman does it with ease  I love this book even more reading it for the second time  I remembered a few funny bits and wondered if I should pick up the book again  I m glad I did  He s brilliantly smart yet entertaining and hilarious  I have decided that Richard Feynman is the most entertaining  amusing and colourful character I have ever encountered  and will ever find in future  I am quite certain  in either fiction or non fiction  He should have been awarded a prize bigger than the Nobel Prize for being the character he was I enjoyed the whole book very much  Somehow  I ended up highlighting some random sentences paragraphs in the book  I never drank ever again  since then  I suppose I really wasn t in any danger  because I found it very easy to stop  But that strong feeling that I didn t understand frightened me  You see  I get such fun out of thinking that I don t want to destroy this most pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick   Well  Mr  Frankel  who started this program  began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about  It s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work  The trouble with computers is you play with them  They are so wonderful   Don t be ridiculous   the men said   Even Feynman wouldn t be that crazy   on the occasion when a man was found drumming and singing alone in the wilderness and someone suggested that it might be Feynman  I love Feynman  Richard Feynman s  Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   is a very well written book  which gives a picture of what kind of human being Feynman was  It doesn t focus on physics but instead on different stories from his life   Some very funny  others interesting  and others again actually discussing some pretty serious issues  All of the stories have some kind of depth to them  which is nice and adds depth to the book  The way the book is structured is very clever because some of the more serious stories  where Feynman can come off as kind of an angry  old man  is placed in the books final chapter  At this point we ve already gotten a pretty good picture of who Feynman was and we understand why he acts this way  meanwhile if it was in the beginning of the book  it would most likely have been a turn off to some readers   Who wants to read about a person who is merely pissed off Overall  the book is very entertaining and I highly recommend reading it  This book truly unravels the genius of Mr  Feynman  I struggled to put the book down  right from the beginning The book truly sheds light into the kind of man Feynman was  special  He was the anti stereotype the kind of life a physicist lives in a good way   He was a first class scientist who derived his happiness from discovery and invention yet outside the scientific world he was just hilarious  I would recommend it to anyone who is literate  Very unlikely biography for a theoretical physicist  One may expect it to be full of theories and experiments  but this guy talks about things like learning a musical instrument in a local band of Brazil or stealing a door of fraternity house  I don t think an autobiography can be more honest and funny  oh  his sense of humor   Mr  Feynman kept claiming that learning certain things took time  energy  hard work  and above all Curiosity  At some point  we just stop wondering about things around and prefer to live in a life of routine and safety  but he never stopped wondering at all the phenomenon of the world  He leads to the questioning of validity of our knowledge  I wonder if I ever studied or will study something with intensity and interest as Mr Feynman had in studying physics  Highlights      they didn t put two and two together  They didn t even know what they  knew     People often think I m a faker  but I m really honest  in a certain way  in a way that often nobody believes me   If the idea looked lousy  I said it looked lousy  If it looked good  I said it looked good  Simple proposition  I ve always lived that way  It s nice  it s pleasant  if you can do it  I m lucky in my life that I can do this      they could pass the examinations  and  learn  all this stuff  and not know anything at all  except what they had memorized    I ll never make that mistake again  reading experts  opinions  Of course  you only live one life  and you make all your mistakes  and learn what not to do  and that s the end of you   I understood at last what art is really for  at least in certain respects  It gives somebody  individually  pleasure  You can make something that somebody likes so much that they re depressed  or they re happy  on account of that damn thing you made  In science  it s sort of general and large  You don t know the individuals who appreciated it directly   Ordinary fools are all right  you can talk to them  and try to help them out  But pompous fools guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing other people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus THAT  I CANNOT STAND  An ordinary fool isn t a faker  an honest fool is all right  But a dishonest fool is terrible     The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool  So you have to be very careful about that  After you ve not fooled yourself  it s easy not to fool other scientists  You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that  Amazing adventures     I couldn t imagine what a normal person a physicist is  And I could never know what they were tending to do while physicist were calculating nuclear fission factors  But now I know  And I learned how to live free even if I m a scientist  I absolutely loved this book  Enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end  The best man I ever knew  DSmartest man on earth  no ordinary genius  magician and brilliant physicist of all times    This is a book of lessons that really should be read more than once to fully absorb   Number one  Take nobody s word for it  Work the answer out for yourself  This gives you a deeper understanding of the subject and a better way to apply what you know    Dissect a concept till you know exactly what it says  if can t say it in common english  you probably don t know what you re talking about  especially if you haven t explicitly defined your terms   Look for the adventure in figuring things out  This passion for knowledge fueled all of feynman s adventures  He loved to experience things  not just hear about them  Apply your knowledge so you can grasp the principles  not just the methods   Wonder about the world  Think of why things are  Try and figure out if you can solve the puzzle  and challenge others to do the same   When you go to Japan   be in Japan as much as possible   This applies to everything you do  Search for genuine experiences  recommemded Always entertaining  frequently laugh out loud funny  but the really great stuff for me was the insight into what it was like working inside the Manhattan project  as well as the experiences of Princeton before World War II  Dr  Feynman is a character   if anyone thought that scientists are dry  boring old men  this book will introduce you to an alternate reality and show you the personality of one of the most interesting  and brilliant  men of the last century  And the best part is  you can see the logic in everything he does  A beautiful collection of interesting anecdotes  A window to peep into the world or Dr  Feynman and how he explain the beauty of this universe using science  Truly amazing Richard P Feynman was a very unique and extraordinary man  As I rapidly devoured this book  his ability to tell the wonderful stories of his life were a great source of entertainment and insight  The novel  it seems part autobiography  part life philosophy manual  progressed more or less chronologically  He highlights the laboratory of his childhood  higher education  working on the Manhattan Project during WWII  becoming a  non stereotypical  professor  life journeys to Brazil and Japan  and many other exciting adventures I get the sense that this man was a happy realist  He experienced the world with  A Different Box of Tools  and genuinely loved life  Aside from his contributions to science and technology  Mr  Feynman showed the world how to UNDERSTAND  how to live life to the fullest  how not to fool yourself  and how not to be fooled by others If you enjoyed the book or wish for a taste of his style  Richard Feynman has many lectures and interviews floating out there in cyberspace  He was a great teacher and great speaker  He has a way of communicating and getting you to really question the question in order to find deeper meaning of the subject at hand  Though I didn t have any interest in physics  the author is a physicist  and physics is brought up multiple times  when I picked up this book  I enjoyed the narrative  I first read this book as an extra credit assignment for a math class my first year of college  I now own the book  and read it regularly  Feynman is a genius  and he does a fantastic job of telling stories that are funny  understandable  and interesting  This book is an inspiration to me as a scientist to work harder and to be more well rounded  An amazing    way of thinking  Read it and get crazy  A lovely collection of anecdotes especially during the Manhattan project narrated by the genius himself  Feynman was popular due to his application of physics in daily life so simplistically that it made everyone think he was a magician  In this book the man himself shows the human side of himself  how he faltered  how he recovered  how he went about his life  very lucidly as a collection of stories  What amazes you is even when he was a part of such a top secret project he played around and had fun and also got serious work done at the same time  The little kid inside him could be an inspiration to all of us to emulate  I loved this book  Richard P  Feynman is such an interesting   straightforward person  His stories always make for good reading  I guess this is what genius is like   Lovely  funny  narratively written biography with somewhat of a red thread  One serious good concept that I put in my toolbox was the  cargo box culture  concept and that really makes you reflect on perspectives  For people like me that loves popular science this is really a good read   This book is a HOOT  And physics lite  for you physics phobes out there  I was really interested to hear about the old computers the scientists used at Los Alamos to do their numerical integration and calculations and how they would run these computing cards through the  computer  for months on end to get an answer  And then  of course  Feynman began to innovate and find faster ways to do things  This book helped me remember to cherish that child like fascination with how things work and discovery  Un libro maravilloso  se relata parte d elas vivencias de Feynman mediante anecdotas que le han ido sucediendo a lo largo de su vida  I very much enjoyed this collection of anecdotes  One sees Fenyman s intelligence and mischievous nature but also that he is aware of his shortcomings and that he is very human   I just finished this book again last night  I read it the first time in about 2002  It is so good  He mixes trivial life stories with physics and math  He speaks his mind not caring what others think I listen to a lot of books Audible com has a free book offer with This American Life http   www audible com adbl site temp    Everyone has a collection of favorite stories that they enjoy telling  but it s unusual for the stories to be so good that a friend insists on writing them down  so that other people can appreciate them too  When I read this book  I almost feel that Feynman s telling the stories himself  Well  when that happens in real life  you always want to join in  here s my personal best effort at a Feynman type anecdote  I hope it s now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side  if they happen to stumble across this page by accident STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000  and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California  I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications  The guy whose idea it was had started up the group  recruited me and two other people  and then left to join Microsoft Research before I d even arrived  So everyone was looking at us suspiciously  Why did NASA need software that you could talk to The rest of this review is available elsewhere  the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons  Even with my decidedly limited knowledge of Physics  this was a delightful insight into the mind of a brilliant man  I think Mr  Feynman expresses the feeling of commitment with science   and how it is spread through the world   really well in his book  That said  the book also tells amazing stories from Feynman s days   most of them out of the university space   that will make you laugh out loud  showing a person who does not care so much for labels created by the people  It was amazing to read his insights about the way our world is organised  and I was really upset as I was seeing the book was ending This book really blew my mind  Definitely a must read for every human being  You don t have to be into science to read this delightful book on Feynman s adventures in physics  You just need to be into life  A very inspiring book  Feynman s passion and curiosity enabled him to lead a happy and interesting life  As demonstrated by this book  he never lost his sense of whimsy  If I have a life with half as many stories as Feynman s  I will consider it to be a full life   Awesome  The best  and perhaps the only book about Feynman s life itself  It s as close to an autobiography as there is  taken from his various notes  conversations  etc  Simply awesome  Also look up the Nova special  The last journey of a Genius   Really entertaining stories from Feynman  got me excited about science  Really easy read  This is definitely one of my favorite books  Richard Feynman is such an interesting character and there s a lot that can be learned from him  He also pulls many zany antics which makes the book all the more fun to read   I really enjoyed these memoirs  Some could call Feynman a trickster  some probably doesn t like his attitude to people  But I can t deny his thirst for knowledge and experiment  and mischief too though   If these stories won t be so funny book probably could be boring  I didn t wait any revelations from it  but I got some interesting ideas from author though  I was astonished with his curiosity and somewhat his naivety  in scientific sphere   I think probably this naivety helped him to keep his thirst for knowledge  his almost childish passion with science  In conclusion I can t recommend it for every one  Some could say this book is shallow  just some loosely connected stories  Well  yes  but these stories are fun and bonded with ultimate love to science  This was a kid who was in the middle of the making of the atomic bomb  But the picture you get here is of a restless and youthful soul open to hard work tempered by good fun  How can t you like the guy  Great character  raconteur  adventurer  physicist  Fantastic read  Fascinante compendio de anecdotas e historias de uno de los genios de nuestra epoca  poco a poco se va descubriendo el modo en que esta mente operaba  Recomendado 100  Great stories about a brilliant man  Just a fantastic description of how to view the world as a journey of fun  curiosity  and exploration  If you ve ever found yourself questioning social norms  have a love for science  or just enjoy a goofy story  this is the book for you  This quirky novel by Physicist  Richard Feynman  gives readers some insight into how the mind a genius works  Little anecdotes of Feynman s life are written in choppy thought bursts  much like how Mr  Feynman was said to speak and teach  I found myself belly laughing at his dorky stories  for he is the type of genius who doesn t marvel at his greatness  he s hardly aware of it  As he struggles to learn social cues  and solves impossible puzzles  he astounds all who he meets  He jokes  plays clever tricks and even gets a few girls  This is a charming book  by a lovely man   Hilarious observations of life by a brilliant man  Laugh out loud funny  Every scientist will recognize traits of themselves or their friends in these tales  If not for copyright laws  this book could easily have been entitled   Oh  The Places You ll Go    This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth Mr  Feynman has done it all  I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant  Nobel prize winning physicist s life  A little eccentric yes  but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner  which is a style I like very much   From his early life  to his work on the atomic bomb  to his ability to crack safes  I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success  This  nerd  even had tremendous success with the ladies  Therefore  on behalf of nerds everywhere  you are our hero He  like Robert Todd Lincoln  was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history  The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events  Truly  there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents  admirable life  and impressive success  Among the many biographies I ve read  only one other person gets this summation   Remarkable   a life well lived   That person  Abigail Adams Cracking book  Scientists can be extroverts we see  he had a colourful life  Chock full of interesting anecdotes  Plenty to learn and be inspired about here  Superb book for me  very fantastic for his life  The fabulous Dr  Feynman was as brilliant in physics as he was in life  If only present day scientists could lead a fun life life without having to worry about funding  they still wouldn t be as brilliant as he  but would be at least half as happy   Nemas odgovornost opravdati sto drugi ljudi misle da bi trebao postici  Nisam odgovoran biti onakav kakvog oni ocekuju  To je njihova pogreska  ne moja   An amazing book   Wish I had read this book earlier    I would have had more interest in Physics     I found Mr  Feynman to be super funny  This was a good one  A fantastic journey through the childhood and young adult portions of Richard Feynman s life  He s fun and witty  and you are taken on a journey of lock picking and college antics  It s a fun perspective of one of science s smartest physicists  So many funny stories  What a great character  Worth reading  It s one of those books after which you think  WHAT  I can only give 5 stars to it And then you think you should give every other book less stars  because they are not as awesome as this one And THEN you think about the inspiring character this book is about and that he is such a positive person and never would give other people get less  just because he is so awesome  And then you are just sad that the book are over and thankful that you could read it      One of the all time great books  Making the life of the mind a lot more lively for the non scientist in all of us  this book is a wonderful read  It will remain one of my favorites  An amazing life written in a very interesting language and will inspire me forever  Everyone s got a viewpoint  a way of looking at the world through the lens of their own experiences and intellect  Many lose this with the passing of time  some barely manage to hold to their viewpoint against the resistance of conventional wisdom  RPF not only held it  he had a firm grasp and unsurprisingly he excelled at what he did The book is written in a fun way and entertains with the turn of every single page  or every tap of screen for e books   Things keep getting more interesting with each passing anecdote told  I received this book from Schuyler for my 24th birthday  I didn t really know who Richard Feynman was  but now am a huge fan of the Nobel laureate physicist  Feyman takes a stroll down memory lane in and is able to tell many remarkable stories from his life with a humble voice  In addition to a touch of genius in physics  Feynman also found himself an accomplished biologist  mechanical engineer  safe cracker  drummer and artist  His grounded perspective on life brings humor to almost every story  which suspiciously includes him being the clever antagonist    the book is hard to put down  A light read  and a lot of fun  A frank and open revelation by the genius himself  One of the greatest scientists of our times  it is amazing to know what a versatile character he was  Very interesting read  Keeps you hooked till the end  Oh what joy  This book is very funny  a great tale of adventure  and also strangely heartwarming  Po par letech kniha  ktera me uplne dostala  jako ctenarsky zazitek  Na jednu stranu jde o anekdotickou sbirku kurioznich zazitku fyzika Richarda Feynmana  jehoz seriozni zivotopis jsem tu nedavno doporucoval  V hlubsi rovine je vsak jedinecnou sondou do duse nevidane zvidaveho a chytreho cloveka  ktera s vami muze pohnout necekanym smerem  Pri cteni knihy se mi spojilo hodne veci  osobnich i vedeckych  Pritom je ale obrovska legrace a zabava  kdyz s Richardem muzeme sdilet jeho nadseni z poznavani a neuveritelne historky  ktere ho  zda se predchazely i provazely na kazdem kroku  i kdyz slo o tak nezertovne veci jako projekt sestrojeni atomove bomby  To nemyslite vazne  pane Feynmane  je s prehledem jedna z nejlepsich knih  jake jsem cetl  Nejen pro svuj ostrovtip  ale zejmena pro neopakovatelny zpusob  jakym dokazala priblizit zdanlive chladny svet fyziky rovine laskovneho vypraveni  Smal jsem se u ni rad a na cele kolo  Jako anglicka audiokniha s vyraznou humornou dikci nemela chybu  What a pleasant read  This book made me guffaw every few minutes  I love Feynman  His honest  unapologetic and sometimes  downright snobby behaviour is absolutely delightful  I really like how at least one word in every hundred is italicised  stressing on things here and there  Such expressive writing  I would recommend the book to anyone who likes intelligent and charming people   Oh there s a lot of science and math in the book  Be warned   Very interesting autobiography  So many great kernels of wisdom and insight I love his story of how he watched the first atomic bomb by standing behind a windshield  He knew the glass would block all the dangerous UV light and was likely the only one who actually saw the blast s full effect  Most witnesses did not look or used super dark glasses which blocked most of view Feynman had so many funny stories which made the book a great read  This was recommended reading for one of my engineering classes  What a great story about a genius  Hilarious  down to earth  brilliant  witty  and simply entertaining  If you have any interest in science  physics  or Richard Feynman  I highly recommend this book   I liked very much  Just fascinating  even to a non science oriented reader  It s fun   It s like just another chat with someone   so light   Recommend this to anyone    Entertaining stories and insight to the thinking of a remarkable man   I LOVE Richard Feynman  This is his first book of personal anecdotes of his incredibly interesting life  He was a man driven by a child like curiosity  which led him to make amazing strides in physics and eventually win a Nobel Prize in physics He was not only a successful scientist  but also picked up Brazilian drumming  drawing  lock picking  dream control and much more  He inspires me to be curious about   everything  Even if I don t have his brilliant mind to fully analyze it  I had soooo much fun reading this book  It s as if you re sitting in a room with Feynman and you re just randomly telling stories  Very natural  very rich  inspiring and  well  what I enjoyed the most of course  his views of life felt often times aligned with mine  so what s not to love about that   PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did  His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing  and a random person who simply knows facts about art science news but can t use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever The book is funny and clever  I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life Here are some quotes that I really connected with  And  just like it should in all stories about philosophers  it ended up in complete chaos   There were a lot of fools at the conference   pompous fools   and pompous fools drive me up the wall  Ordinary fools are all right  you can talk to them  and try to help them out  But pompous fools   guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus   that  I cannot stand         I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I d like to see the Sistine Chapel  I got there very early in the morning  bought my ticket before anybody else  and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened  I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment  in silent awe  before anybody else came in   I love this book and pick it up to reread fairly often when I m home at my parent s house  Totally nerdy but also hilarious  Yay  Oh I love this book  It s 5  stars for me  favorite shelf   you get the idea  I read some negative reviews here and I have to agree  Feynmann probably was a freak in some senses  but he was not mean  nor unkind  nor cunning  he was just a freak  or curious character in his own words      And I love freaks  I love people who are not afraid to think and try and do  What I was fascinated with was his personality  his love to play with things  to discover new ways of doing stuff  his interest in learning different subjects quite removed from the field of physics  so many things actually Highly recommended to anyone  Do not be afraid to read  not much physics there going on  rather life of a brilliant guy  Mr  Feynman was a character  His stories made me laugh and I kept thinking   Why didn t I think of that    Absolutely loved it This book talks about a scientist as a human and does a good job conveying the passion he has for his profession  I really liked that he talked about The Manhatten Project in a playful way  making it al lseem fun  as it probably was  and later realizing how influential  and dangerous  their work had been  This is one of those books which bring a turning point in your life  and make you reevaluate it  much like Randy Pausch s The Last Lecture and Steve Jobs bio for me  Made me take interest in physics around us again    Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives  how could anybody live so much  Physicist  safe cracker  artist  frigideira  an instrument used in Samba music  player  nobel prize laureate  drummer  and more  His mischievous nature and varied interests  exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation  e g   were inspiring in a way As a scientist  he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters  O Americano  Outra Vez   later part  pg  211 onwards  about state of science education in Brazil at the time   Is Electricity Fire   on Jewish  dis interest in science   Judging Books by their Covers  review of school math books  and disappointment obtained from them   and lastly  Cargo Cult Science  the last chapter A must read for any science loving person  Mr  Feynman shows such innocent exuberance in talking about science and his life that one cannot help the desire to go out in the world  kneel in the grass and study something  anything just to share the joy  the pleasure  of finding things out  This is the story not of a nobel laureate  but of a remarkable individual with a limitless thirst for knowledge and adventure  This book single handedly turned me towards a career in scientific research  I read a threadbare copy borrowed from a friend s brother when I was in the final year of high school  and what I learnt has outstayed anything that I have learnt from science textbooks throughout my student  and now professional  life  This book has an amazing motivational capacity  that science can be fun and scientists pranksters were unknown to most of us leading a humdrum student life in a congested  humid city in India  The anecdotes  while fascinating  also throw enough light on the character of the remarkable protagonist and his sweeping world view  Right from his famous safe cracking episode at Los Alamos to spending a night at a brothel together with Freeman Dyson to escape driving through flood and discussing QED   Feynman shares it all here  I have read a lot about Feynman and his science  papers  to be precise  and I can safely vouch that this book stands head and shoulders above any other memoir of a scientist  A must read for people in need of motivation for a career in science and also for those who think scientists are nerds  What a fun  light  excluding the math and physics  book  If only I could look at life and puzzles through Professor Feynman s eyes    Fascinating    One of the greatest and most entertaining reads to ever come out of a Nobel prize winner  So funny  This book makes me want to become a scientist   Surely You re Joking Mr  Feynman  by Richard P  Feynman is one of the best memoirs that I have ever read in my lifetime  The book itself is a collection of short and curious adventures that had taken place in his life  In this sense  there is no real beginning  middle  and end  or many of them if you want to view it in a certain sense  so it was very easy to pick up and read a chapter or two daily I personally  really enjoy this kind of writing style  His sporadic stories scattered all over the place may seem very confusing and annoying to others but I think that people naturally think this way  One story reminds you of something else  which reminds you of something else  something that we see in our daily conversations  This unique way of writing really appealed to me  One thing that people have to understand is that Mr  Feynman is a person of science and some people may not fully understand his curiosity of things relating to science  Mr  Feynman is a good prankster and a person who s natural qualities include playfulness  but you need to appreciate science and the world around you to fully understand him Although I consider it a great book  I wouldn t recommend it to that many other people  I feel most people would consider Mr  Feynman a condescending and random character  and there is some truth to that  I would recommend it to people who like this kind of writing style as well as people who are OK with him calling other people dumb  which I believe he is fully correct   I also think that there is an extreme amount of truth in this book  I could imagine some memoirs to sugarcoat a lot of things  Mr  Feynman doesn t do anything of the sort  Not to say that he is open to all the dark secrets to his life  For instance  Mr  Feynman had multiple wives yet he never really talked about the divorces he had with them  although he did talk a little bit about the his first wife s death   Mr  Feynman speaks the truth in what he writes and only writes what he wants to write In the end  I considered it to be a great book of curious adventures  but I don t think that everyone will enjoy it the same way that I do  I would suggest that you pick up the book and read a chapter or two to see if your OK with his writing style  If you are  I think that you would like the book a lot  Amazing  Must get this book on audible  So fun to listen to  I can t imagine trying to read this because of the unique way Feynman wrote it   Recommended by my oldest brother when solicited for inspiring reads and this really delivered  Seriously entertaining  This guy was a literal genius  a nobel prize winner  a truly independent thinker with a brilliant mind and a zest for finding answers to questions that would never occur to my thick head  I wish I had him as a science teacher  It would definitely have changed my interest and awareness of everything around me  A gem of a book  Hope kids read this in school  I know I wish I had  I remember loving this book  but not much else  To re read soon  Irrepressible  And I hated physics in school  probably the fault of the curriculum as well as my own limitations   Again Mike Kelly rears his ugly mug but this time for aplomb in recommending authors to read  Feynman wasn t just a great physicist  he was a great man  Reading about him  peoples remembrances and his writings is simply eye opening  This first one covers his solution to the Challenger disaster  his bongo playing  lock picking and many other intertaining and insightful anecdotes  juz fantastic      Must read  Brilliant book  I love this guy  Feynman rocks  This book is amazing  Feynman s sense of humor and humility makes him my superhero role model  I LOL d on sooo many occasions  Feels like reading a real life James Bond story  Fantastic  absolutely fantastic From siphoning ants away from food to defining hard core science  while learning techniques to picking up girls in a bar and playing bongo with a ballet  this book is a fabulous journey   start to finish  An absolute cracker Frolicsome  yet enlightening  This is an absolutely must a read  If you pay good attention  you ll learn valuable lessons as well  Do not miss out on reading this one  A very inspiring man  A really interesting book about him  Easy to read  and you learn some science as well  Smart  yet funny and easy to read  The subtitle tells it all Adventures of Curious Character Yeah he probably had great ego  so what  I had a feynman crush reading this book  His curiousity  hackery  and unpolished narrative flow all charmed me  Then Robin told me that he would reveal himself to be a chauvinist by the end of the book  I have yet to hit that part  but I m not excited about it  Oh  and http   xkcd com c182 html after reading this  i think i would give my left toe to have known dick feynman  holy crap this guy is amazing  it s not so much that the book is a sparkling literary achievement  it s not   it s that it  a  chronicles an incredibly amusing and diverse series of events  and  in doing so   b  conveys an unparalleled and overwhelming combination of intellectual rigor and curiosity  a look into the mind of a true renaissance man  Hezky sepsane zazitky z zivota jednoho neobycejneho fyzika  ktere misty pobavi a jinde vedou spis k hlubsim uvaham    Moc hezke  V nekterym prihodach jsem dokonce i videla sebe   I have a very close friend   college buddy   who s a physics professor at a western university  When he was studying for his PhD  I developed an interest in physics  He was reading the serious stuff and I was reading the popular versions for the lay market   Hawking  Gribbens  Sagan  etc  but also the classics like Einstein  Weinberg and of course  Richard Feynman Few people have a sincere passion for their work  Mr  Feynman certainly did  If you have any interest at all  I urge you to seek out the audio version of his Six Easy Pieces lectures  To hear his lectures in his own voice  and his own humor  is inspiring   Seriously enjoyable  At first I was surprised by the short  unconnected anecdotes of what had looked like an autobiographical account  but soon I couldn t get my fill  I admired Mr  Feynman more than before and I am looking forward to reading some other books by him  What an interesting and thought provoking book by someone who had a truly amazing life  Even as I laughed over some of the crazy anecdotes Feynman tells  I was impressed and inspired by his never ending intellectual curiosity  After reading Feynman s story  I hope to incorporate more of that into my own life  This collection of Richard Feynman s experiences shows how ingenius he was not only in his academic work on physics but also in his daily life  It also shows how sincerely he loved physics  not chasing for his honor or money  I admire his pure love of physics which is based on his curiosity as the subtitle of this book adventures of a curious character shows  His anecdotes from his young age explain his life as if comic book describes  When I read this I felt really excited not only because of his amazing academic work but his hilarious moments at his hometown  MIT  Caltech or Cornell  He also remembers his serious moments in his life when he joined in Manhattan project  making Nuclear bomb Most people usually think physics is boring  tedious and hard but his ingenius explanation of hard concepts in simple language can change the view of most people  This book made me find more books written by him and most of them are really interesting as this book is  I would recommend  lectures on physics     Genius    The pleasure of finding things out    Feynman is the most likable person you might ever meet  A humorous account of one of the greatest men of the twentieth century  A must read if you are a nerd or enjoy a company of a nerd  Feynman is one of my heroes  He is responsible for my deep interest in science  and physics in particular   All time top ten books for me  Physicist  artist    lockpick     bongo drum player    This is a fun book at the life of a true Renaissance man and an important scientist of our time  He s got to be on a very short list for the most interesting person to exist  A wonderful book  Tells you how to understand things as opposed to memorizing things  Never knew Feynman was such a versatile personality  drummer painter etc etc to name a few  Very entertaining read  Gives some insight into a man who was quite the curious character  It was a pleasure reading about a guy who clearly enjoyed living and interesting experiences  A wonderful book  with one important note to make  this was actually not designed to be a book  It is a set of anecdotes  selected seemingly at random  taken off tape recordings  There s no chronological order  no embellishment  nothing you d usually find in a biographical book  Feynman just recounts what he feels is interesting about his life  without going too much into details  Some may not like this style  I do  It feels like chatting with the man himself over a beer  and Feynman is someone I d be really happy to know personally if I could  with his endlessly curious  nonconformist and a bit stubborn mind of a child that he somehow managed to keep into adulthood  As a Jewish scientist  I am amazed at the parallels with his personality and mine  This guy really revives my desire to expand my understanding of the world in a fun way  An amazing insight into one of the greater minds of the last century  and a curious character indeed  I was deeply intrigued by this portrayal of the life and the view point of a fascinating wisecracker scientist  and also a lock picker  painter  bongo player  pick up artist and whatnot  Nobody lived life as fully as Richard Feynman  and this book captures some of his adventures beautifully  Great reveal of Feynman   the man behind the science   Awesomely funny and thought provoking  One of the most brilliant minds of our time   This book made me think about what I am learning when I learn Am I learning something that I understand Or am I learning a mechanism that I can use to answer and pass an exam This opened my eyes completely  and now I always try to understand what I am trying to learn and understand it in a meaningful way  a way that I can explain to myself in examples and in pure form  instead of just learning mechanically what to do like a robot without any knowledge of what I m doing This is a MUST  READ  Fun  interesting  and eye opening  Great fun  Terrific At Caltech  especially among physicists in the 1990 s  Feynman was spoken about in such awed tones  it was difficult not to resent him  a little bit  That s probably why it s taken me 18 years to finally read this book  What a sensitive ego  huh That was silly  of course  He was a man  a man obsessed with experimentation and tinkering  in the lab  in social situations  everywhere  but still  a man I especially appreciated the last part  his Caltech commencement address on the scientific method  and how we fail to use it in life  and  too often  in science  itself  Empiricism is a big part of why I ve started my company  and why I remain so passionate about it  Absolutely fantastic book The writing is simple  yet engaging  It s fascinating to know that a Nobel Prize winner could play the bongos  pick locks  experiment with ants  radios  dreams  hallucinations and could even draw  This book has the funniest collection of anecdotes I ve ever read and will keep you hooked till the end  Really enjoyed this book  despite my hatred for Physics   What a character  I love this guy  Some of those stories just make you laugh Basically  Feynman is just too smart for this world  He doesn t have the time or inclination to learn how to behave  but he is a generally nice and interested guy  the result is he ends of becoming an incredible character and  amongst other things  a master locksmith  What a guy  Surely one of the funniest books I have ever read  Feynman is an experimenter be it science or life  When Hans Bethe calls Richard Feynman  a magician  he isn t exaggerating  A brilliant physicist an outstanding mathematician a remarkable painter  a musician  an astounding personality with experience ranging from astrological theories of Mayans to confronting the queries of the likes of Einstein  from experiments on Biology to testing concepts on psychology  this man of million tongues knew how to take people by awe  A brilliant book giving beautiful insight into the life of this scientist full of wisdom  humor and passion  A must read for book lovers of all taste  Very light  being taped conversations after all   I feel like I ve become good friends with Mr Feynman  and I couldn t help chuckling out loud more times than I d like to admit Beguiling  entertaining  and inspiriing all at once  this is one book I would recommend to anyone who wants to meet a great  and fun  man  One of a kind   Avtobiografiia  ot avtorai feimanovskikh lektsii  on otlichnyi rasskazchik  umeiushchii ob iasniat  prosto obo vsem  ot atomnogo proekta do kvantov  Interesno ne tol ko dlia fizikov  Honestly  my review of this book is likely to be skewed given that I am a Feynman fanboy  I absolutely loved having some insight into this man s life  I was left wanting more stories    Recommended for everyone   you don t need to know any physics to enjoy many of his anecdotes  Great read   If you were not a fan of Feynman yet  you ll be afterward  I should not use words like  delighful  in reviews  but delightful  this book changed my life in my aspects  he s a great  proud character with quirky stories to tell  I like that it s set up as a bunch of short stories so you an read as many or few a you like at a time  Most have a moral  but some are just entertaining    Loved the book    It brought me many happy moments  Feynman s love for life at its fullest is contagious  Dying to try some things from the book like discovering how strong sense of smell is   Richard Feynman has a quirky voice  adeptly captured in this book  I hope that someday I ll have a quarter as many good stories as he seems to have  One thing that I truly admire about him is that he is completely open and is always up for a new experience or adventure  My favorite is the one where he wants to volunteer when they tell the student body that a hypnotist will be coming to the university  There are quite a few that are really funny  but this one cracks me up when I imagine it happening His approach to life is something that I aspire to  Although I m not very physics minded  it was cool to read about the work he s done and get a glimpse into how his mind works  He always thought of things in practical terms  and especially when thinking about physics problems he would ask for a real life example to work through in his head  He is one of those people who just needs to know how things work  how they actually work  What about the things he has done for the military  He does talk about his time at Los Alamos  but mostly doesn t go into the details of the physics or the gravity of what the work was  One of the major concepts I like from him is that of cargo cult science and waiting for something to come that will never land  He explains it by going back to when tribes on desolate islands would be visited by cargo planes full of supplies and things they needed  The people would then become taken by the idea that some cargo plane will again come and give them what they need  So they wait around  build landing strips  for a plane that is not coming   Brilliantly written  amazingly hilarious  and something which make you wonder   How could one man be all of this     A refreshing book that made me spontaneously burst out laughing many times  this is usually not expected when you are reading the stories of a Nobel price winner and that too of a person considered the worlds greatest theoretical physicist  Its tempting to draw a judgement of his character based on some of the outrageous incidents mentioned but I would think its unfair considering the time and location and perhaps the social acceptance at that time  His curiosity and his amazing ability to think on varied topics left me spell bound  The experiments with dreams and out of body experiences is also intriguing However the story presentation is for some reason not in chronological order and it confuses you a bit and it takes you back and forth a few times   marked it as to read My favourite scientist ever  And a brilliant writer as well  One of the best birthday gifts I ever got  The book was awesome and gave me very good insights  An enlightening first hand view into the life and mind of Richard P  Feynman  A curious character indeed  Feynman has the mind of a hacker  a hacker of nature  in physics   but also a hacker of puzzles  locks  women  social situations  and life in general I loved to read this  and I would advise it to anyone interested in science  looking for a both interesting and entertaining  personal and easy read  Functions equally well as a collection of funny anecdotes as well as a serious take on what it means to truly like and live science  It s full of advice masquerading as a look  behind the curtain  into a dedicated  analytic  lighthearted mind  This isn t meant as a proper review  but just a note on the  prose  after eyeballing a few of the comments here  this book is a compilation of transcripts  From the preface by Ralph Leighton   The stories in this book were collected intermittently and informally during seven years of very enjoyable drumming with Richard Feynman   These conversations were taped  the audio of the interviews is actually available  per a note in the book for interested readers   So bear that in mind when wondering about the  questionable prose  or whether the book was  ghost written   Raw and meandering story telling  transcribed by Leighton  is what you re getting here  As for Feynman s arrogance    I more than agree that his almost childish vanity can be grating  particularly when Feynman s  self confessed  ineptitude for the humanities contributes to his maddening opinion that fields such as English and philosophy are of dubious worth  However  by the time I finished the book  I found I d forgiven Feynman to the point of wishing he d been a friend  He is spectacularly genuine    as unabashedly as he clobbers his audience with his robust ego  he equally honestly remembers his blunders  He even confesses a few Clouseau like scenarios in which his own ignorance or stupidity inadvertently exposed some previously unrecognized problem  leaving colleagues marveling at his  insight   Feynman also doesn t hesitate to explain where a discovery or achievement was primarily the result of a lucky break  unbelievable coincidence  or even pure cheek  And he admits moments where he himself recognized his arrogance    for instance  he recalls as  stupid and silly  his brief plans to upset Swedish royal protocol to  show how ridiculous their custom was  Feynman was a genius and he knew it  but his arrogance and self confidence never gave way to pomposity    how many other Nobel laureates would relate their misadventures in trying to get laid Finally  I strongly disagree that Feynman was  showing off  by tallying his accomplishments in music and painting  Not only does he remind  frequently  that his achievements were still largely amateur  he conveys an enviably childlike happiness in his varied lives outside physics  Feynman was a resilient and joyful person who never forgot how to play    I find his attitude toward life infectious  On that score  his energetic  irreverent life is inspirational even to clods like myself who could never hope to understand theoretical physics  Feynman s palpable enthusiasm is contagious  It is a wonderful book  Anyone interested in Physics must read it at least once   Upon reading this book  I really felt that I had missed a lot in life by not studying in one of the universities in US  I like my country and my culture  but I have to accept that US is far superior in education and technology  We study lot of things and memorise only to get marks  We hardly apply the knowledge and we are not taught to do so  Richard Feynman is a genius and makes science funny and simple in his essays  A crime thriller would not have been more interesting than this book  very fun and funny  great insight into a brilliant man who was a real mensch  I ve picked this book up  and it s twin   What Do You Care What Other People Think    and read from them every few months for the past 20 years They never fail to delight and amuse   completely Regardless of your education  experiences  interests or background  I recommend these books to everyone and anyone I m an unapologetic fanboy of the highest order when it comes to my favorite theoretical physicist from Far Rockaway Pick them both up as soon as possible    brilliant book explaining the life of a true rebel in academic world  I always thought academics are introverts and eccentrics  here I met a very social physicist  A brilliant book that introduce us to the world of a Nobel prize winner  We look at different sides of his adventurous life and get to know many surprising stories about him  Also I should add here that I really liked the last chapter of this book  Cargo Cult Science  which he talked about scientific integrity  it was very touching and he points out a few important things for those who want to do a scientific work  a perfect example of how you can be cool while being nerdy and sucecssful  Not to mention njoi the life  Mr Fenyman   you are an inspiration   This isn t a book about physics  It s a book about a very interesting and brilliant man who can teach lessons to hustle Richard Feynman is my hero Laughed out hard while reading it  I think the version in Chinese translation is even better  more vivid and funnier  than the original English version   D  D I d like to be such a humor scientist as him  My favourite person ever possibly I found this book by accident when I was browsing the always available bookshelf on my libraries digital service and I loved it  It was fascinating to see how his mind worked  I especially enjoyed the part about his hobby of safe cracking   I can t tell you how much I loved this book   every couple pages I d either be laughing out loud or telling my husband how much he would love it needed to read it  Feynman s perspective is absolutely endearing  I m incredibly grateful my friend Amy recommended this to me  This book is great  It puts us on the head of the great physicist  Mr  Feynman  He tells us how he picked up girls in Las Vegas  how he started drawing and selling paints  how he lock picked  played drums  and most of all  the reasons of his hating for the educational system  teaching  and supposedly intelligent mans  His life was so complete and fascinating    He s unique I came to the occlusion that he s a humble man and an example to follow  Reading this motivates me to stay true to myself  do what I want and enjoy  be free and don t give a f about the others When I grow up  I am going to be Richard Feynman  A must read  Un genio che si autoracconta con qualche tocco di egocentrismo ed esagerazione  Divertente  affascinante  motivante  Lo consiglierei ad adolescenti  Great book of anecdotes from a curious scientist  I sometimes wonder if Richard Feynman was some sort of collaborative fantasy created by a bunch of Harvard students pulling random words out of a hat to see how absurd things could get before people stopped believing that one person could have done all of that and won a Nobel Prize as well Not only is this a glorious collection of incredible anecdotes from a life that had more packed into it than any ten normal people  but he even manages to teach you a little bit of quantum theory along the way without you noticing There s a laugh on virtually every page  along with primers on safe cracking and bongo playing  A model of how to do it   always assuming that your life is as crazy as his  which seems a remote likelihood  An amazing biography of one of the greatest minds of the 20th century  Fonte di inspirazione  La vita di Feynman e raccontata con divertenti aneddoti che fanno emergere l indole dello scrittore fornendo buoni spunti di riflessione   There was no importance from what I was doing but ultimately there was   With this phrase Feynman described how a spinning plate sparked his curiosity and how by deciding to work out some of its properties  just for the fun of it  he was led to insights which ultimately resulted in the Nobel Prize in psysics  It reminded me of childhood  how intriguing seemed the simplest of things  how many hours could be spent playing or curiously doing things without any practical outcome  just for the sake of joy and pleasure But most importantly it manifested how many hours can still be found for hobbies or for the pursuit of silly but fun ideas  all while one works  learns  teaches  socializes  womanizes  marries a couple of times  raises kids and altogether succeeds in combining an exciting personal life with a remarkable career  That was Richard Feynman  and whenever I feel I m getting  too busy  I will think again  Eventually  seeing how Feynman s adventures and life worked out suggests that good things can come if one follows such an approach  You will most likely not get a Nobel prize  your life story may not be be as interesting or worth mentioning and even if it all doesn t quite work out as well in the end  at least you will have had a nice time in the meantime  Rediscover and cultivate your curiosity about all things  don t fear the awkward or the time wasting  throw yourself in difficult situations and push through with childlike enthusiasm  Be sceptic but eager to meet all sorts of people  That was for me the essence of those stories  What an inspiring book and what a refreshing way of looking at life this new year   Wildly entertaining collection of short witty stories  Mr  Feynman was a brilliant man  This is a great read about a physicist s adventures  while trying to make sense of the world around him  Each time I read this it reminds me how concerned I get with dumb stuff  Feynman didn t physically sit down and write this book  Rather the content comes from interviews between him and a fellow musician  Also  very entertaining if you get the audiobook for long trips  This book is unique  It s hilarious  it s amazing  it s thrilling  it s curious   Wellcome to the life of one of the most wonderfull minds and most excentric man Richard Feynman is mainly known as a Noble prize winner and a central piece at Manhattan Project  the one that lead to the first atom bomb   He s also known as a science divulger  But he was also a drummer at a carnival band on Rio de Janeiro  an artist  a philosopher  a safe box opener   The title is what you repeatedly will think while reading the book  That can t be real  surely you re joking  Mr  Feynman  How scientists should be  I love this man   My favorite audiobook so far   Loved his story about critiquing the physics courses in Brazil  What a brilliant man  My all time favorite book    One of the best books I ve ever read  Feynman lived an extraordinary life and had an extraordinary mind  but his simple  matter of fact and hilarious recitation in this quasi autobiography makes one feel like anything he did  the reader can do if they just think about it enough  It s a very inspiring set of anecdotes   great book by a brilliant guy Absolutely brilliant man and funny account of his life  Worth reading   Excellent book about an astonishing mind and eccentric character and his work  It was amazing because he was  Richard P  Feynman was an extraordinary man  Even though it s him who tells how he lived  I couldn t help wish I d met him  This book also taught me a few valuable things about live and people  apart from being good fun to read       Este libro es magnifico porque Richard P  Feynman fue un hombre extraordinario  Aunque sea el mismo quien relata como vivio  no pude evitar desear haberle conocido  Este libro tambien me enseno unas cuantas lecciones valiosas sobre la vida y la gente  ademas de ser muy entretenido y hacerme reir    Not only is Feynman a genius  he s also quite a character  He s well aware of his intelligence and doesn t shy away from telling the reader all about it  This book is a semi biographical collection of experiences and energetic short stories  The reader is given the opportunity to empathize with the ecstasy Feynman feels from fueling his own curious drive  science I just read a few chapters of this marvelous book  and it reminded me just how fun a book it is  It amazes me not only how brilliant Mr  Feynman was  but also how childlike and mischievous he was  He simply loved life and loved physics  My favorite chapter is the one where the wife of a traveling entertainer teaches him how to pick up girls  at a hostess bar  and he is shocked when it actually works  we all have the funny stories of our lives  that we tell at parties and dinners  but we don t necessarily think about publishing them  feynman did and it came out awesome    the main message that seems to bind everything together is that you approach things methodically you can master anything  and feynman illustrates his point with stories from various aspects of his life  conquering ladies  playing the drums  drawing and painting  speaking fake japanese  and making music   Mr  Feinman  a Nobel prize winning physicist  is an incredible intellectual  a true adventurer  and quite frank and humble  All characteristics make for a wonderful auto biography  Interspersed with tales of his escapades in science  as a philanderer  and awkward forays in to culture  are these incredible gems of wisdom  He expounds on true science  education  and intelligence  From a historical standpoint  the book is also interesting  Mr  Feinman worked on the atom bomb at Los Alamos during WWII   Lydbok  Utrolig bra  Oppleseren  hva kalles folk som leser lydboker  var utrolig flink   innlevelse  og hver gang det var snakk om utlendinger og fremmedsprak hadde han alltid aksenten rett  ihvertfall skal jeg tro det  Feynman har levd et utrolig morsomt liv  og hadde masse artige og interessante pafunn  Hobby a dirke opp safer pa Los Alamos mens han jobbet pa atombomben  for eksempel  one of the most enjoyable autobiographies I ve read yet  though I admit I ve read given up only a few  still    Great book       Myslel jsem si  ze pracujeme den za dnem  cvicime a pochodujeme kvuli karnevalu   ale kdyz tu karneval byl  velka cast kapely se neobjevila a nesoutezili jsme moc dobre  Dokonce  kdyz uz jsme pochodovali po ulici  nekteri lide z kapely zbihali  Byl to podivny vysledek  Vlastne jsem to poradne nikdy nepochopil  ale mozna ze hlavni zabava a vzruseni spocivalo v pokusu zvitezit v soutezi plazi  ktera   jak vetsina lidi citila   odpovidala jejich urovni  A mimochodem  taky ze jsme tuhle soutez vyhrali Behem toho desitimesicniho pobytu v Brazilii jsem se zacal zajimat o hladiny energii v lehkych jadrech  Celou teorii jsem vypracoval ve svem hotelovem pokoji  ale chtel jsem si overit  jak vypadaji experimentalni udaje  Byly to nove veci  kterymi se zabyvali experti z Caltechu v Kellogg Laboratory  Takovych peknych prechodu je kniha plna  Pouze 1 volny radek deli od preskoceni myslenky  od holek k elektronum  od bubnu k elektronovym hladinam  od samby k malovani  k vyuce  zpet k holkam       Na Feynmanovi se mi moc libi  ze kdyz si neco umanul  tak se do toho zakousl a trenoval a dokazal to posunout na uroven  kdy si toho nekdo jiny vsiml  At uz to byl cizi jazyk  hra na nastroje  kresleni  Kniha je vtipna  optimisticka  Opravdu jsem se velice bavil  Moc hezke cteni  This book is the most inspiring autobiographical book I ve ever read  It inspires new ways of thinking about the world  and it s an amazing portrait of a man who did a lot of interesting things which were in no way limited to science Everyone should read this immediately  it s really interesting about math  physics and Feynman s story life I can only hope I lived as Feynman in my previous life  Inspiring  Feynman is a truly cool person and a multitalent  A fantastic read  An insight into the mind of an amazing scientist  His thinking  and thought process plus vivid imagination of how to look at problems is a sight to behold  The man lived an extraordinary amazing and enlightening life  An amusing read  written as an assortment of anecdotes  the book  though not a proper biography in its traditional form  depicts the wit and the humorous side of one of the best scientific minds of twentieth century  Not laden with mathematical equations and physical abstraction  the book is a must read for the scientific minded faction of the general population  Awesome experience  How can a man touch so many things in his lifetime  is the question left behind   Brilliantly written and hilarious  I will definitely reread again and again   This book was so good  It has some silly stories  fascinating historical perspectives  and some serious science talk  but my favorite parts were when he talks about realizations he came to at particular points throughout his life  It was all just so inspiring Maybe I am liking how relatable it was too  I m not completely sure  but just writing this review makes me want to read it again  for a third time   The late and great Richard Feynman meticulously and beautifully takes us on a journey of his wild  adventurous and intellectually gifted life in this collection of his adventures  This genius and Nobel Laureate was one of the great minds of the 20th century and demonstrates in this collection of his personal experiences why it is not necessarily WHAT you think but HOW you think that makes a great mind  If there is any reading that I would highly recommend to others  it would be this funny witted collection for precisely the aforementioned reason  A wonderful read and HIGHLY recommended   Udivitel nyi  potriasaiushchii  neveroiatnyi chelovek  Richard Feinman sobral vse kachestva  kotorye mne nraviatsia v liudiakh  Ego liubov  k zhizni  uvlechennost   umenie dostigat  sovershenstva v

chitat  obiazatel no i meniat  svoi vzgliad na zhizn   It was very  very interesting  It was extremely interesting   c  Sometime back when I read my first Feynman book  What Do You Care What Other People Think    I was thinking if some of his other works would be as interesting as that book  Clearly  I was wrong because  Surely You re Joking Mr Feynman  is an even more amazing read  Feynman talks about his life  his thought process and his mischievous nature during most of his life  Although you need to understand there is not much Physics talk in this book but the book does talk a whole lot about his sexist nature  his childhood  experiences and the challenges he faced entering the world of famous physicists  While reading the book  it is easy for us to see Feynman as a Egoistic person but combining it with the other book  I do believe that he was a Genius in every sense of the word  A must read   A really inspiring book  A little slow and random at times but it shows you what interesting things you can do with your life  Feynman is a strong advocate of science and reason and calls bullshit on the crap that the world is full of  He was a smart man who attained much success and through this book we see that he did it with much fun in between  Richard Feynman is a brilliany physicist but also a great writer  This autobiographical book about his memories made me giggle more than once  He is one of the not so many  unexpectedly fun  scientists   Amazing book  No words to describe Feynman s attitude and i liked the way it was narrated to a person and then penned down  Hilarious book about one of the most intelligent people of the 20th century  The beginning of my crush on the gregarious physicist  Cheered me up considerably  Mr  Feynman seems like a very sensible man   What a fun book to listen to  So many of the stories had me laughing  Kudos to the narrator  Will definitely recommend  Great collection of Anecdotes about a great man of science  Very easy read and can be enjoyed by anyone   Otlichnoe proizvedenie  Pro zhizn   nauku i mnogoe drugoe  Vremia ot vremeni perechityvaiu povtorno  If you happened to like A Brief History of Nearly Everything  this will be right up your alley  Surprisingly hilarious read  Who knew a physicist could be so funny  Un libro interesante por conocer como pensaba uno de lo grandes fisicos del siglo XX  La curiosidad era su mayor pasion y a lo largo del libro nos lo muestra con cada una de sus  aventuras   Seriously fun  it made me wish even more that I d been taught physics by Richard Feynman  He is a genius explainer  a brilliant bongo player  and the most inquisitive person I ve ever read about  Reading this will make you want to figure out why everything in your house works  I always liked Feynman  which is understandable  nobody can deny that he was a really interesting fellow  But this book is just too much    oh boy  how I underestimated this guy  I can t even begin to describe how much I enjoyed it and although I m obviously biased  I highly and sincerely recommend it to everyone  at least for the laughs you ll get from his stories  Awesome  Just a crazy interesting guy  No words can describe how excellent this book is  Brilliant book about a brilliant man   Simply brilliant  Turns out there is a difference between a great scientist who writes well and a great writer who knows science well  This book made me proud to be a scientist  even if I m not a physicist    I really admire Richard Feynman s integrity  sense of humour  knowledge  and talent  This book is absolutely inspiring and amusing to read  This is a great travel book  Some people might be put off by the author and think it s another drab science book or some other dense research that professors and Nobel laureates would love to push out  But this is nothing like that It s a very casual  fun and gripping collection of adventures of a very distinguished scientist of our modern times  And far from being a technical book that few might grasp  I m looking at you  A Brief History of Time   most people with a high school education will not only understand  but even come to love the tales that Feynman describes  From growing up  to attending university  to being a professor and a scientist on the atomic bomb project  to being a traveller and an all round fun character   Feynman puts a lot of exciting and enlightening incidents in this little book If there s one thing that I take from this book  it s the author s constant desire to learn and try new experiences  Far be it from him to refuse an opportunity to do something new  And he was genuinely excited about it too Highly recommended  especially as a growing years book for young adults  although ageing cynics too can find tons of learning and new direction from this little publication  These are the autobiographical essays of the coolest nerd of all time  I don t know many science geeks who haven t heard of Feynman  and of those  all admire him  Well  apart from Murray Gell Mann  who claimed the stories were to some extent fantastical  but they re still a source of tremendous inspiration  enjoyment and laughter  At least to me  The storytelling is in Feynman s typical layman fashion  and I find I can read it in almost any state  at almost any opportunity  Every time I read one of those stories  rather  as soon as I start reading them  I m transported into a world where physics is hard  but a passion  Nature is devoid of miracles  yet intensely fascinating  and life is filled with cockiness and one upmanship  However fabricated these stories are  they relentlessly and unfailingly  re open my eyes to the joy of science  Excellent  Worth it for the  Ant ferrying  chapter alone  I recently read this book aloud on two car trips with Andrew up north  We laughed a lot  and did not fall asleep while driving  Feynman is just so damn smart and funny that it s impossible not to love him  and this book is impossible to put down  It was after reading this that I decided I wanted to major in physics when I started my first year in college  He really proves that one can live life doing everything and anything they want to do   Finishing this book was like saying goodbye to an old friend  Richard Feynman was intelligent  passionate and quite an inspiration  The way he explained science in the most simple and beautiful form  and I quote him   I was an ordinary person who studied hard      Richard Feynman is the most interesting person that you ll never meet  but at least you ll get to read his experiences and adventures  The book is written by the man himself  Richard Feynman  the man who worked in the notorious Manhattan project  the man who won the Nobel Prize  the guy who constructed the theory   Sum over histories   This man is an absolute genius at what he does  but what really grabs you is his goofy and delightful persona  His stories are out right shocking at times  and I found myself laughing at loud several times throughout the book  I also found his thinking  although purely anecdotal  extremely enlightening without going too overboard on the philosophy  He really humanizes science in a way that everyone can really appreciate and get excited for  and also shows just how far curiosity can really take someone   There are three books which I have for at least 20 years constantly pushed on all my friends who read  almost without regard to their own tastes  The autobiography is one of them not because of any theme or message  although to the extent that it has some I heartily agree   but solely because it is such rollicking good fun  Feynman is by far the most fascinating person whom I have ever regretted not meeting  and every book I ve seen about him is a great read  However  his voice and that of his ghostwriter  Ralph Leighton  make the already great anecdotes all the more fun  For most of us  there can be no higher aspiration than to have lived his life for just one day  and to write about it with such incredible elan  Richard Phillips Feynman was an American theoretical physicist  He is ranked as one of the greatest physicists who ever lived  A brilliant character  a mathematical genius and a delight of a person  Feynman will lure you in with charm and charisma and will wow you with his unorthodox approach to life and problem solving  He is a child at heart who loves discovery and playing with problems brought to him by nature  I love this book but I prefer his audio interview called Los Alamos From Below  If you ve never heard of it  please do yourself a favor and listen to it  You can thank me later This autobiography paints a broad stroke on the life of Feynman  He talks about his time at Los Alamos with the atomic bomb project during WW2  He talks about his tenure as professor of physics at MIT  Caltech and Cornell  He also mentions his adventures all over the world from Brazil to Tokyo and all the people he meets along the way  from bars  clubs in vegas  parades in the streets and science conventions with the greatest minds of the 20th century  This is the adventure of a curious character indeed  I don t usually read biographies but I made an exception for Richard Feynman because I know he is a unique individual  Glad I gave it a shot  it did not disappoint  Fun  witty and always brilliant  Funny and inspiring I listened to the audio version  Book covers various phases of Mr  Feynman s multidimensional personality Really enjoyed the book  It covers details from his childhood  when he was professor  while working with the team to invent atom bomb  noble prize  his second marriage  learning fine arts  playing bongo and many more interesting incidents  This is a great book about the antics of an unbelievably smart man and his observations of how life works while developing nuclear weapons and manipulating humans  I love physics and nuclear technology  and first read this book years ago  I was interested in finding out more about one of the brilliant American minds in physics and someone who worked on the Manhattan Project The book is written in a casual  offhand style  almost so much that you think   THIS is Richard Feynman    but the relaxed narrative method works and makes it almost seem more like stream of consciousness  as if you re getting a deep glimpse into the amazing man  He lived quite a varied and interesting life  and you see his human side   the death of first wife Arline   to how varied his interests are  he threw himself into life and as a result had some amazing experiences  There is some tech thrown in  but not so much and to a degree that a casual reader couldn t get along fine without knowing it  Feynman seems very human   talking about inadequacies he felt he had  and relating mischief he caused   that the book makes you feel oddly comforted and okay being the unique person you are  Dick Feynman  great mind in physics  learned how to crack safes and wasted lots of time in Vegas  A great  fun book   It is an autobiography  sort of  one that does not focus on deeds and achievements as much as it focuses on interests   obsessions  and impressions  so after reading it  instead of feeling that I know about the man I have a feeling that I have known the man himself  that I can picture him in various situations and guess how he would have acted and reacted This is the man that I got to know  A strange man  indeed  At first I  judged  him a bit arrogant  always thinking how he s better and smarter then everyone else  those silly philosophers  biologists  mathematicians    but soon I changed my mind as I kept on reading  He does not care about being judged  and so he puts no effort at praises to himself or false modesties  He is either so sure of his place and reputation  or he does not care about them at all  that he would tell any story  however unexpected or controversial And he loves telling stories  and at moments you do wonder if he is joking  or making them up  I mean  can it really be a single man to take  a small  part on the development of radar  to take  a greater  part on development of atom bomb  to know and interact with some of the most famous scientist of his day  to be himself very successful scientist at several fields of physics and acknowledged by piers as such  at the same time to live the life to the full  to play in a Samba school  band  during the Rio carnival  to play bongo and other percussions and also to collaborate on writing and playing music for a ballet piece  to be an amateur painter  a one that sells  gets commissions and manages to put up a successful solo exhibition  to report that he managed to control his own dreams and managed to induce hallucinations and out of body experiences  There are probably some aspects to Richard Feynman that I missed to mention  but even with these  he lived lives of at least ten different men all condensed into one  Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman  is very interesting and easy to read  It s a pity that a story on his plans to visit Tuva was not included    This book  was terrific   Feynman is the most interesting nerd in the world  Read this book and bask in his awesomeness  witty  funny  honest    inspired me to experiment    What was wonderful for me about this book  something that I believe few others could claim  is that when I started reading it  I had almost no idea who Richard Feynman was or how big a hot shot he was or anything  I didn t even know he d won the Nobel Prize  So I had the great pleasure of learning about his life as it went along  When I was impressed by something he did  I was impressed because of what he did and not because of who he was  So when he s talking about picking locks  I m thinking  that s way cool   but it s not cool because he s The Feynman   I d have been just as impressed if a friend of mine had done it  And I m sure that is how he d have wanted it  So I had a wonderful time reading about the adventures of  to me  a wonderful man  who was very intelligent  very curious and not afraid of being who he was  but he s also a man with insecurities and prejudices and everything else that human beings have  I wasn t even impressed by the science   mostly because I know nothing about it and I skipped right through it  I was happy there wasn t much of it because I d have missed out on reading a great book about a great person  I felt like I could be very objective about his life and his book because I had no notions about anything  and I liked him entirelyfor the person he seems to be and I like the honesty with which it s written  I felt I had to add this last bit because of some of the other reviews I read  Did I think Feynman was annoying  arrogant  full of himself  Sure I did  Very much so  But just because someone is arrogant and annoying doesn t mean that they aren t great people and don t have great stories to tell  He is and he does   Amazing book  lifestyle guide for every scientist    the anecdotes of my absolutle idle well worth a read  I m not a fan of biographies usually  but this one I thoroughly enjoyed  It reads more like a collection of short stories  He is quite a character and yes  it can seem a little annoying at times  but I liked that he didn t shy away from showing his flaws either   he is telling his story afterall  I got this book from a friend I met on a roadtrip through the USA and it couldn t have been a more perfect ending to an incredible adventure  Just the kind Dick Feynman was a fan of himself apparently  Actually I originally read this book when I worked at Scribners in 1989  but remembered how great it is and reread it a few months ago Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton  worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize  He s also a complete hoot  The book is a series of autobiographical stories    pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos  teaching himself to paint  scientific discoveries he made  his three marriages  how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect  they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that  He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he d imagine conversations with his foreign born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents    but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all  So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn t  This was entirely typical of Feynman s wide ranging curiosity and intelligence  but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts  His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this  What I love about Feynman    first of all  his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment  The great joy he found in working things through  he said that the reason he d never tried drugs  though he was tempted  was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn t want to risk that   Also  he s clearly so very intelligent and reading his book  his thoughts seem so easy to follow    it makes the world of science seem accessible  I ve loved this book  It is hilarious  I ve started reading parts of it to the kids and they think it s so great that they keep begging for more  My only criticism is that Feynman is a womanizer  but it is pretty easy to skip the chapters where he s in a bar and just enjoy the rest   One of my favorite books of all time  Richard Feynman shows that people who go into science are not boring  humorless people   Probably my favorite book ever  I love how he thinks  Brilliant  entertaining and insightful  I read it a long time ago  but it was so good that to this days I find myself in the library  open it again and read a few lines This is an autobiography  I love autobiographies   Of a physicist called Richard Feynman  It gets to all sorts of things  especially insane things  that Feynman did in his life at the university and elsewhere  The narrator is Feynman s drummer friend  who recorded their conversations and the amusing stories of Feynman while they were drumming together He tells us  in a very entertaining way  about his experiences of cracking safes  painting a naked woman  go out looking for adventure at clubs in Vegas and all kinds of hilarious and fun things  until you start to think physics is not as boring as it seems Feynman s life are full of intelligence  courage  prowess  because of his boundless curiosity  This man gets to see the world and meet all its glory and beauty in exceptional occasions This book stayed with me and will remain with me all the time  It s the kind of book that follow you well into the future I definitely planning on reread it  someday  A journey into the mind of one of the 20th century most important scientists  And hey  this book is about so much more than science  Damn  Feynman was cool   I peed my pants a little this was so funny  I enjoyed reading about Mr  Feynman  What an amazing life he had and what a character  Fantastic book  If you even understand nothing in physics I promise you will be glad to read this book  It s not about physics  it s almost about great man who had very wide area of interests from physics to music and painting  This book obviously will inspire you to new steps in your life  This is what physics is all about  Discovering the world and living the adventure of it  This doesn t mean necessarily that mathematics is involved  only common sense    I often had this problem of demonstrating to these fellas something that they didn t believe  like the time we got into an argument as to whether urine just ran out of you by gravity  and I had to demonstrate that that wasn t the case by showing them that you can pee standing on your head     Richard FeynmanThat s right  he used SCIENCE  The man has a Nobel  A part of me hopes this is why  Unbelievable adventures of great scientist   Adventures of a Curious Character   says the subtitle  It is apt If you are also curious   about practical jokes  physics and philosophy  or just cracking all the safes at Los Alamos National Laboratory   this is for you  Some hilarious anecdotes about one of the most interesting characters to ever occur in real life  this is a fantastic book full of anecdotes from the wildly unexpected and curious life of richard feynman  he wasn t a stereotypical scientist of the time with rolled up shirt sleeves  a tie  and black plastic glasses  he traveled the world  asking questions  intentionally getting himself into strange situations just for the experience of it  and the story to tell later  it s a book that inspires to go and do that thing that might seem strange or unpopular  the story you ll take away from it will more than likely be worth it  I found myself unable to make fair judgement about  Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman  Adventures of a Curious Character  One day I gave it three stars and another five  I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process s  My desire to write a review of this book are threefold I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff s After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster  Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr  Feynman on a flight to duty stations  In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals  Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather  I also watched the media s involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch  I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink  As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government The lightness that Feynman s stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making  It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears    The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva 1988  which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US Let s learn from Feynman  The humility to listen and learn  life experiences  with radio  ants  smelling  the value of all knowing what is going on vs keeping in the dark  Fermi  Oppenheimer  the value of challenging dialogue vs yes men  picking locks  the bomb  4f  drawing nudes  pompous fools  averaging of book scores  coco cabanna music  text book reviews and lots more  What is learning  science based on theories that dont work and science that is not science  This book is a delightful collection of stories which at once instruct and amuse  The guy is so freaking smart you can t even read his funny stories without getting smarter  There is no good reason why you haven t read this book  The ultimate read for a nerd who wants to be entertained  Feynman was amazing  Oh Mr  Feynman  he was truly amazing and very interesting to read about  He loved to learn but most of all enjoyed everything he was learning  He quickly became a master safecracker  a Zamba dancer  a musician on bongo drums  and an amateur artist from simple curious interests that he followed through  And these interests where definitely out of his comfort zone  In his eyes  and sometimes others   he was the BEST in that expertise  All because he enjoyed everything and didn t give up until mastering each technique skill  each paint stroke  or dance twirl  Besides his quirkiness  Feynman s personality screamed louder than anyone in any room  His bluntness is something that became a theme to me in this book  From accepting his Nobel Prize  reviewing chemistry books  and stating the freedom to your scientific integrity when experimenting  Feynman always let others know where he stood  It s what made him very respected  Feynman truly inspired me to follow through some of my curiosities and experience NOW  especially out of my comfort bubble that I live in  After reading this book  I picked up a new language  and I have to say I m getting better every day   joined a non profit organization to tutor children in science  and scheduled a trip out to another country for adventure education experiences  This is the notorious autobiography of Richard Feynman  winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing the Quantum Physics Theory  with a bunch of other people of course   This guy is even funnier than Kary Mullis  and extremely practical  He also worked on the Manhattan Project  and broke into top secret files by picking locks for kicks  and gives a lot of information on that  Fabulous  energetic read  Awesome dude  This is what science is all about  to be curious and piddle around  I had been reading Feynman s book  QED  when I decided I wanted to know more about Feynman himself and bought this  I was still living at home and I remember laughing my fool head off and my mom asking me what I was reading  When I told her it was an autobiography by a physicist  she could not understand why it was so funny  but Feynman was funny  And a great teacher  Most of my joy in the book was because it was the first time I d read about all the wonderings and daydreams and funny stuff everyone has in their heads from someone with a genus level intelligence and no filter  Still a great  fun read     This is the book for people who love the idea of Richard Feynman but who hold no hope of understanding why he is an important scientist and human being  A brief  feel good read    I ll return to give a better review later   Dr  Feynman tells some of the funniest anecdotes I ve ever read  He s an incredible mix of raw intelligence  simple pragmatism  and insatiable curiosity  he s an accomplished physicist  but also someone with an appreciation for a diverse array of subjects  and the people who spend their lives studying them  His insights  into education  governance  scientific discovery  politics  art  relationships    even biology   are just unparalleled  I will be re reading this many times  I m sure   Such a great sense of humor and such humility  It would have been a joy to meet Dr  Feynman and worked with him  Entertaining stories told by an amazing character  Feynman is the clever and amazing genius most people wish they could be  Anyone who admires the power of curiosity and the places where it can lead should read this book And I would say to some of the more negative reviewers  if Feynman seems a little self centered or egotistical  it s only because this is an autobiography and he is one of the 20th century s greatest scientists  So he has a reason for seeming smug  The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life   just finished reading  Surely You Must be Joking Mr  Feynman   Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet  A person who was relentlessly curious  and not just about his own craft  but about almost everything he encountered  An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously  but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately  Feynman was obsessed with solving problems  and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in  and that s a very large universe from machines to drumming  from school education to picking up women in a bar  from art to Mayan hieroglyphics  Above all  he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him What bothered Feynman the most was people s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand  Most of us believe we understand a few things  especially things that relate to our professions  but do we really  Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know  which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life  but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to  where everything fits together and makes perfect sense  where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity  is mostly missing  Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are  Most of us  as individuals  and sometimes entire professions  suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged I wish I read this book many decades earlier  because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life  I believe it should be a must read for all young people  especially those that plan to take up a scientific  or for that matter  any intellectual profession  Looking back at my childhood  I had very similar curiosities as Feynman  and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical  However  I was not even nearly as smart  but more importantly  I did not have his perseverance  Many of us are curious when we are young  but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately  Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources  To Feynman  every idea had to make perfect sense to him  and until then he simply would not accept them  I  on the other hand  grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some  beliefs  is a virtue  These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom  and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices  The funny thing is  if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties  I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had  except I really did not practice it  What a remarkable human being   almost unbelievable  I have never met or seen Feynman  Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech  I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell Mann  who is often mentioned in this book  Another astounding mind    Buku yang lucu sekaligus mengharukan  Cerita masa kecil Feynman yang ajaib  Paling lucu waktu dia kerja di cafe punya saudaranya     Dan paling sedih waktu Feynman akhirnya bisa nangis setelah kehilangan Arlene   He sounds a bit exhibitionistic but it s impossible not to be amazed and enamored by him  The best thing about being genius  i discovered from this book  is that you will never be bored because you can see and learn so much from a line of walking ants   One of the best book that I have been red A must read for those who need immediate inspiration while doing research work in any field of science and want to know how to do it the  right way  Stories come from experiences and Mr  Feynman is a fountain of stories Find a safe place to read this gem where no one will be bothered by your frequent bursts of laughter  Adventures of a curiously character  is an apt tagline for this unique  auto biography Occasionally the description would wander off the topic so far ithat you have to remind yourself time to time that from where it all started but it is worth it  About the Character  One of the Think tanks in Manhattan Project   A great advocate of learning by understanding rather than by  heinous rote method  Modesty oozes from the quotes like  Publicity is a whore  while in the limelight due to Novel prize   Child like inquisitiveness till death   Curiosity to every aspect of life not just science  e g  Safe cracker  bongo player  learning different languagesMemorable Quotes    If you can t explain it simply you haven t understood it well enough     Death is boring  I wouldn t want to die twice   Nerd  Prankster  Genius  and Ladies Man Richard Feynman leads a dream life for a scientist  His high paced prose consists of story after story ranging from his safe cracking at Los Alamos to his nude paintings at cal tech  We hear about the time Feynman left a quarter tip in an upside down glass for his waitress  how the motion of a wobbling plate led him to a Nobel prize  and how he became a world famous ballet drummer  Feynman tells his stories quickly without pause for reflection but along they way we are inspired by a few important lessons of his life 1  Teach to avoid complacency2  Be sure you are motivated to work by the fun of it  not the importance of the problem 3  Science requires the integrity to report bad results In all its a great book  one you must read to enjoy the enthusiasm of   What can I say about one of the greatest individuals in the history of science  Probably that he was a scoundrel  a smart ass and a trickster  Feynman presents his life as a series of riddles and puzzles to be solved only to uncover more puzzles and riddles  The trick in this regard  is to always maintain your curiosity  He takes curiosity to a whole new level as well as taking it sideways into the realms of  my  what a curious thing to do   This  probably the best autobiography ever written  looks into the life of the drumming  underground samba musician  artist  safe cracking  physics slinging  self proclaimed smartass that never loses his scientific integrity  yet seems determined to master everything the world can possibly even suggest throwing at him while having an awful lot of fun  I read this for NPR s Science Friday Book Club  Yeah  I m that kind of nerd  but somehow I wasn t at all familiar with Richard Feynman  I loved the complete lack of plot  the scientific vignettes and Feynman s unique thoughts on just about everything  His work on the Manhattan project and being a Nobel Prize winning physicist are folded into stories about bongo drums and hallucinations  It is truly a must read  This was very entertaining  The stories Feynman tells  Wow  they show one of those over the top personalities  Think Jim Carey meets Carl Sagan with a touch of Richard Dawkins snarkiness  He truly was a great Physicist who did not take life too serious and loved to learn all the time  and pushed others to do the same  When I finished I just went back over it again laughing at his antics  It reminds my of Leon Lederman s  The God Particle  If the Universe Is the Answer  What Is the Question   with Leon having conversations with people from the past visiting him at the Fermi Lab  Richard P Feynman is a mathematician whose work in quantum physics in the 50 s and 60 s led the way to understanding that atomic particles were not stuck in space  Although not seen at the time QED shifted paradigms in thinking about the power of math and physics His writing style although folksy draws the reader into his thinking about problem solving and ways to explore problems His work on the STS 51 disaster was monumental thinking well beyond the rubber stamp preconceived ideas of other panel members including the chairman  This only came to light when he refused to sign the report which absolved Morton thyocol of responsibility so their part in the deaths of the astronauts one of whom was teacher Christy McCauliff It was Feynman s thought processes formed during his early days including  Surely You re Joking  and  What do you care  that made him such a lateral thinking innovator  The big thing that comes from Feynman is that you can solve a lot of problems by reading books   NOVA produced Feynman  Portrait of a Genius  a great documentary  Richard Feynman has a great storytelling voice and some hilarious adventures to go with it  Each of the chapters is really an independent glimpse into the personality and life of this unique and enjoyable character  A lovely and illuminating read from the great man     very human   warts and all  This definitely makes the list of my favorite books of all time   Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   is a glimpse into the mind of a bold genius who never stopped thinking  even when he wasn t working  Instead  he turned his mind to any pursuit that seemed interesting or amusing to him  whether that was picking locks  ferrying ants  or playing the bongos  The book is a collection of short stories written by Feynman himself  retelling some of the more interesting incidents in his life  The writing style is very conversational and accessible  The stories are often incredibly funny  At the same time  they offer new perspectives on seemingly mundane pursuits and occurrences  I would highly recommend this book to anyone with curiosity about the world we live in   Incredible  May Feynman be an inspiration to us all  Tsiu knizhku meni stil ki raziv radiv mii khoroshii drug Petro Nek  shcho

and even I  a sworn feminist  will admit that a man who is brilliant  irreverent  and charming can get away with a bit of sexism  as long as it s based on a love for women   Some sexist men are that way because of hate and jealousy   But I digress    The book is a great way to learn a little about physics  math  history  safe cracking  puzzles  pranks  art  drumming  academia  you name it  The best parts of the book are when he s making fun of colleagues or institutions that are fake or stupid  I can t wait to read this book again  Richard  Dick  Feynman is a notorious prankster  as well as a Nobel Prize winning physicist  Perhaps the greatest prank he ever played was composing a book where the reader requires no knowledge of either physics  or how to prank people  Rather  one requires only the desire to read this thoroughly hilarious and equally fascinating autobiographical story of one of America s most interesting and brilliant minds  Surely You re Joking Mr  Feynman is a funny  entertaining memoir by the Nobel Prize winning physicist  Richard Feynman  He describes the adventures of his life  from a twelve year old with a home made lab to becoming a distinguished professor at the California Institute of Technology  The reader follows his travels and experiments  from Brazil to Japan to Los Alamos and Las Vegas  One can appreciate his no nonsense view on life  his fascination with nearly every subject  except psychology   and the mischief that he gets into his entire life As a high school senior who plans to major in engineering  I thought it was fascinating to read the life stories of such an obvious genius   and I can t help but wish that I was as smart as he was  I was inspired by his story to explore any opportunity that came my way  no matter how crazy it is  because that s how Feynman was able to meet so many interesting people and have fabulous adventures  If my career will be anything remotely like Feynman s  I ll be a very happy person Read this book with an open mind  if you would be disturbed by an esteemed professor s attempts to pick up women  semi illegal activities  and highly opinionated manner  this book isn t for you  If you re looking for a humorous read about someone who doesn t take life seriously  then you ll have fun with this book  You ll never view scientists as antisocial people again  Readers don t need any prior knowledge about math or science to understand the book  but if you are familiar with Feynman s work  you ll probably be able to appreciate his work even more  I can t compare it to any other memoir that I ve read  because instead of focusing on a hardship  he talks about all the opportunities that he had and the people that he met  There isn t a real  struggle  that he has  though he does have some nasty things to say about textbooks and other professors  For example  there s one point where  in front of a panel of important people  he exclaims   The main purpose of my talk is to demonstrate to you that NO science is being taught in Brazil   I m sure that many people will enjoy this book  and I highly recommend it  Fantastic bloke and a ridiculously interesting life  great book  I read this a long time ago  I m glad I read it again  The memoir of Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman  What a character  He marched in a Brazilian Samba band  had a one man show of drawings  worked at los Alamos  He lived by his own rules  and had a great time of it  What a sense of humour   A must read  You just would not expect to encounter so many adventures by a theoretical physicist   the uniqueness of R  Feynman personality comes out stronger after each chapter  and he is still able to leave you with a  can t believe that  all the way through the end of the book A deeper look provides extremely strong message to the reader  curiosity and perseverance  along with good brains and a big dose of luck can make you a winner in countless situations  This is my take away of this highly entertaining book  which should be read without the modern  politically correct  attitude in mind  or you will lose half of the fun  Liked author outlook on life  This fun biography  written by a friend  but in Feynman s voice  talks about his myriad interests that go beyond physics  lock picking  samba music  painting  hallucination  experiments with ants  The picture that emerges is of someone who was eager to try all sorts of experiences  and immersed himself with great joie de vivre  Clearly  in some of tales he tells  the other person in the tale would think of him as a pain in the neck  like when he insisted he be paid his 1 dollar for a patent  and the person gave it to him from his personal money  Still  nothing he narrates strays from being prankish    nothing ever vicious He seems to have been willing to take social risks  volunteering to do things he was not quite ready for  or criticizing someone s holy cow The book contains a lot of implicit philosophy  His attitude toward life and science are refreshingly upbeat  There s also some great explicit commentary on epistemology and philosophy  They re scattered and the reader has to find what s offered and put it together  yet  it pays off  Given the nature of the book  it is hard to know if the author exaggerated  but even if it were completely fiction  it would be an enjoyable and inspiring read   A must read for student   Feynman was a incredibly talented person  In this book he tells his story from his perspective which is eye opener to how his way of thinking   I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book  It really gave dimension to a man I ve heard so many stories about from my father in law  My husband got a kick out of seeing me read the book too  He had read it a few years ago and after I would finish a chapter he d want to chit chat about what I had just read  Brilliant book  It was fun to know that one of the best mind in the history of science had various kind of interests and tried them by himselves  I also enjoyed episodes of his being in Japan  Some of his insights about how to learn maths will help me when I learn it and when I will teach maths to my daughter in the future  I became a his fan and want to read more about him   Absolutely loved this book  It brought back wonderful memories of my physicist father  who knew Feynman  One of my favorite books  As I was reading it there were so many things about him that were so much like myself   the way he did things  things he did as a kid  his approach to solving problems  his interests   it was really bizzare to read  Later  after having read the book  I came to find out both our birthdays are May 11th  This was read on a friend s recommendation Even before I was finished all the way through the book  I had made up my mind to rate it as I did it In the beginning it appears to be a waste of time reading memoir of someone Bit that s where the fun lies I guess especially with this one Some things really leave those indelible marks in your memory to carry on further  This book carries something for everyone take away It an eccentric mix of science frivolity mostly  and the innocuous nature of the author There s a certain truthfulness associated From his childhood adventures with science to drumbeating to painting and what not Mr Feynmen is a grand package at your disposal I even feel a certain amount of reverence for him till the end There s something sagacious about most of what he says All in all I loved the book Go for it  Understand this   Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   is not an autobiography  at least  not in the strictest sense  This is not an overview of his entire life  This is a series of anecdotes  It was compiled from a series of taped sessions  arranged for publication by a friend  Ralph Leighton  then edited by Edward Hutchlings  So it s not a comprehensive view of his life  It s a bunch of stories told by a gregarious fellow  anecdotes he thought were  for one reason or another  amusing or interesting  We don t have access to the tapes from which these stories came  so we don t know whether he also told stories that weren t about him  or how smart he was  So some who read this book think  Hey  these are just stories that this guy thinks are interesting  That s not an autobiography at all   And they re right  But it s not really the book s fault for not being something it isn t   Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   is subtitled  Adventures of a Curious Character   And that s what it is  It s a series of adventures  They re told like reminisces  so they jump around in time on occasion  They re probably about as true as any collection of reminisces being told to you by someone at a party  which is to say I m sure they re stretched a bit  But  so what  Some of the stories aren t great  on the one hand  he clearly had respect for his sister and I don t think he was directly misogynist  on the other hand he was willing to manipulate women to get what he wanted   once someone taught him how to do it  He also was a jerk to waitstaff  but I m sure it was intended all in fun  He was a smartass  It happens  Some of the stories are fantastic  such as when he talks about how to make yellow paint  or about fixing radios  by thinking   I think you need to take the stories as they re meant to be taken  reminisces about interesting things that happened to him  and times when his way of thinking either helped him or hurt him  and he learned something as a result  It s one of my favorite books  particularly the beginning and the end  When he explains his involvement in the Challenger explosion  it s rather interesting  though he goes into greater and more interesting detail elsewhere    Wonderfully candid  From insight into the building of the atomic bomb to dating and learning to draw  this book runs the gamut of Fenyman s life and is delightful and insightful throughout   fantabulous book This book encapsulates Feynman s way of being  It s like hearing him talk about physics  but he just sweeps you away on the adventure that was his life  Excellent read  An inspiring and amusing book of Feynman s anecdotes  The stories constantly pointing out that living one s own life takes a lot of ignoring the disparaging comments of the conventional mind  A series of autobiographical anecdotes from the life of the father of modern quantum physics  Feynman is simultaneously witty  engaging and instructive   The book is full of a joy and a happy curiosity that is so contagious it is difficult not to catch  I found myself smiling as I read about the slightly Munchausen like antics of this person who seems to have been good at everything  as has been pointed out in the comments above  My conclusion is not that Feynman was  full of himself   but that it is possible for someone clever and invested to be good at many things at once  One merely needs to be curious and determined  Feynman put in a lot of work into every  life experiment  described here  but the thing is that he enjoyed the process  not only the result  Really enjoyed this  What an original character  Also fun because it felt like a time capsule  He speaks in a specific 50 s era way   at least that I recognize from 50 s era movies   that s so different from how people speak now  But what a fresh perspective  Very fun   So funny  What a character Richard Feynman was   Fantastic storytelling  constantly entertaining  and an interesting insight to some of the formative years of the US s technical prowess  The book has had little trouble in making it into  My best books ever read  list  I read him at just the right time  starting college  and he s partly responsible for my going into physics It is said that Feynman was smart  Sure  he was  But how much of his brilliance was due to his mother born  unique talent  I think very little of it  Read this book to find out what I mean   this was certainly one of the most influential books I ve ever read  because I m emmpathetic with almost all the events in the book  Reading this marvelous story in a particularly difficult period of my life helped me better think about who I am and who I want to be  Laughing out loud in the break room at work and I don t care What I ve taken away from this read is Feynman s free spirit attitude  curiosity and his absolute  pleasure of finding things out   His way of inquisitive thinking are so important to the way he interpreted the world around him  he couldn t have lived it any other way  His interest for new ideas and experiences should be something taught in schools and encouraged to anyone who wants the most out of lifeCheers  Mr  Feynman   new hero  Fun book about a peculiar scientist  The title doesn t lie   he s quite the character  While biographies usually aren t my thing  this was well put together and a very easy and enjoyable read  There was only a page or so when he dove into some detailed math equations that made no sense to me  But his endless curiosity and fervor for honest dialog and scientific investigation remain an inspiration  He experienced the curious mix that blends art  music and science in a very personal way  If this book does not make you fall in love with science  absolutely nothing else in this world will  Feynman was an exemplenary person besides being a science genius  Really liked it  Dr  Feynman writes in a very down to earth style  revelling the reader with stories from his extraordinary life    This book has long sat on my to buy shelf  Then other day  yeah   I found it at Goodwill As Is for a nickle  It s in terribly read condition  but sadly void of notes  I prefer books that have lots of notes  What an adventure it has been  An excellent collection of stories from a life well lived  Most of the stories are very humorous  but with point to each one  An awesome read  It is pure memoir of life by a genius and how he sees the world and how  he thinks the world sees him It was great going through the adventures of Mr  Feynman on one side and his emotions for the condition of his wife on the other side  Mr  Feynman s perspective of world is very interesting It is indeed another  noble  creation of Mr  Feynman Prekrasnaia kniga o liubopytstve  dotoshnosti i chestnosti  zhal  tol ko  chto bezobrazno perevedena  Humorous and highly readable book of Richard Feynman  an amazing genius and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics  What a character  He has been called   a combustible mixture of high intelligence  unlimited curiosity  eternal skepticism  and raging chutzpah   The short stories in this book will give you some insight into the working of his mind  and how his curiosity about EVERYTHING lead him into some unique adventures sprinkled among the more normal academic parts of his life  excellent read about the life of one of the great physicists of this century  This book is unexpectedly easy to read and Feymann is such a likeable character with an infectious passion for understanding and exploring the universe  Bittiginde burukluk yasadigim nadir kitaplardan biri  Egitim sistemi  savas politikasi gibi ciddi konulari yasanmis anilarla sivri bir dille elestirirken eglendirmeyi basariyor  Richard Feynman la arkadas olmak lazimmis demekten kendimi alamadim  I m surprised I never wrote anything for this  I first read this book almost a decade ago  It is one of my all time favorites  I re read it from beginning to end every couple of years  I also sometimes spontaneously re read my favorite parts  I find this book to be incredibly life affirming  My personality is very similar to Feynman s  I have an insatiable need to tinker with things and aggravate people  I really love all of Feynman s stories  Some of them are similar to my own stories  Like my father  one day I will write my best stories to share with the people I care most about  First off  this book really made me miss science  and physics in particular was my favorite  But if there is anyone that knows the predicament of being interested in many things and only having one life to live it is Richard Feynman  I had a constant smile on my face and laughed out loud quite frequently while reading The author is listed as Feynman on the cover but on the front page it says  as told by Ralph Leighton  edited by Edward Hutchings   and the three make a supreme team  You are instantly let in to his mind and character and  while the book is jampacked with little life lessons  the authors understood that they are often better left inarticulated  Sometimes in books like this the author feels the need to shove a lesson at the reader after every anecdote  More generally  I love that there was hardly any introduction or conclusion  The stories simply speak for themselves  Richard Feynman was an amazing person who had a wonderful way of living and looking at life  In some ways I feel I can emulate him   He is perpetually upbeat and good hearted  and because of that he never has to worry about holding back from saying exactly what he thinks  which is basically how I feel  But in some ways I can only admire him   he is positively brilliant  and can truly understand the universe down to it s most fundamental particles and forces  Lastly  I loved how the book ended  there are no spoilers here  and I vow here to always try to live a life of scientific integrity  as best I can   Prekrasnaia kniga A hilarious autobiographical account of events in Feynman s life  A must read  Fantastically readable  humorous  and educational  all in one  It s an autobiography  yes  but in detailing anecdotes from his own life  Feynman s really provided some insight on how to be a better scientist  a more confident and well rounded human that is true to oneself  and to have a keen eye that approaches issues with a dead eye examination of why they are good or bad How can we be better scientists  Avoid the cargo cult of pseudoscience that lacks the integrity of falsification and confirmation bias  How can we be more confident  Just ask if you want something  To be more well rounded  Don t take a job if you feel it will be detrimental to your happiness  Be true to yourself and live only to your own expectations  not others  Feynman approaches life with a zest for experimentation and trying all of the most odd hobbies  yet he finds himself naturally lucky that his talents are utilized in some way  He is humble for sure  and it shows  I really think his luck is built up through experience  though 5 stars for a wonderful read of a truly curious character  I actually read this book in its Chinese edition  A highly highly recommended book for everybody   About  Anecdotes from the life of Nobel Prize winner  and the one acclaimed to be the greatest teacher of the millennium   Richard Feynman  Books if often hilarious  consistently ingenious  and more often than not   inspiring How to Read  Flip across any anecdote and read it  This way it is much more fun that reading it cover to cover  Best read over several days  slowly absorbing the life of a genius  Impresionante  Increible e Imprescindible  John and I listened to this book while driving around in the car  We both really enjoyed it because Mr  Feynman is quite a character for a physicist  What a fascinating character  An insightful book into the life and times of one the brightest minds of this century   The  magician  with his engaging narration truly makes u flip through pages devouring the stories of his life   The hilarious pranks   the south American adventures   the science and his passion for it makes this an amazing read   A life worth knowing and read abt   A book worth buying and preserving   must read  It is an awesome book described as a series of short stories anecdotes perfect for bathroom reading Besides having some good memorable incidents from Feynman s life  it also contains some good thoughts for scientists  A must read book for all the prospective scientists  I loved this  Someone recommended it to me  and I was skeptical of reading an account about a physicist  even if he did take part in some very important projects  I was pleasantly surprised  finding it engaging and quite entertaining  Feynman is quite a character  A really nice read  Some chapters do feel unnecessarily added but most of the book is a goodread  Many chapters are quite interesting especially the early life events of Feynman Wish I had read it earlier Will recommend it to any one who is even slightly invested in science  as rarely do you get to read books by some physicists  Nobel laureate  and that too in so simple a language  Professor Feynman is an inspiration to read and a 20th century renaissance man that everybody should aspire to emulate inspiring life  inspiring book  must read
