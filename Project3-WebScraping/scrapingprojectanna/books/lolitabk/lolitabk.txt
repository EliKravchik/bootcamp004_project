Disturbing and beautiful  The narrative is stunning and it s easy to forget that the narrator is a pedophile because of this  As you read you get lost in this as a love story and not a story of pedophiles obessession with a young girl    disturbing and beautiful     On a more personal professional note  after years of social work  This is a remarkable look into the mind of pedophile and I found myself regarding it almost like a case study because it s clear that the author either was or did a great deal of research into the mind of a pedophile  My book club had a field day with this book   This is  hands down  the best novel ever written about American suburbia s own solipsistic adolescence in the peacetime years after Korea and before the assassination of JFK  Nabokov was a genius And Stanley Kubrick s take on the story  starring James Mason  Peter Sellers  and fabulous fabulous Shelley Winters  couldn t embody its tone more perfectly  Must watch  Brilliant  yet absolutely horrifying  One point that struck me about this novel is that the  modern  perception of a lolita is one of a seductress  but she is very clearly  at least to me  raped by a fiend in the book  How did this perception come about  Are we  as a society  not ashamed of this perversion of the story P S  After reading this  go on to Youtube and type in  Lita Grey The KidCreepy as all hell   if you understand the context  Superb  Light of my life  My sin  my soul  Nabokov threw me into the next stage of my literary evolution with this book  I read it first in my early pubescence and never looked back This is writing  This is story telling  This is mastery of the English language in all its glorious  elastic beauty An expanded review later  a response to those who get snagged on the pedophilia  which  detestable though it may be  is not the point   A response to those who make the mistake of trusting Humbert s narration  You re allowed to sympathize  my friends  It s exactly what he wants you to do  My banned book club is reading Lolita this month  and although I had read it many years ago  I wanted to reread it now  I think Nabakov is a wonderful writer and Lolita is quite easy to read  if you can get past the extremely  fake  foreword  I love the style of Humbert Humbert s narration  how much of his recollection of his  love story  can you believe  Was Lolita a nymphet  complicit in their relationship  or a scared child with no one to turn to  Was Quilty following them pretty much the whole time  Lolita is part love story  part mystery  and through it all  totally pervy   The sheer beauty and cleverness of the language is breathtaking  Nabokov is a master of wordplay  and this book is a joy if you enjoy that  The Vintage Books annotated version with notes by Alfred Appel adds even more to the experience  pointing out obscure literary references and hidden layers of meaning   Abhorrent  beautiful and challenging  The best and simultaneously worst book I ve ever read  What else can be said  I love what this book does to my brain  The story is so repulsive  yet the writing is so beautiful  Works because it combines VN s ubersmart glittery prose with a buried central character whose fate exposes the fallacy that words are all that matter  A critique of America and Europe  of materialism  of romanticism  and too willing readers   Pale Fire  is crafted just as well  but never quite finds a heart to go with its smarts  Letto non so quante volte  stupendo  This book is a lie  It is fantastic I recommend that everyone reads it  As opposed to monstrous Ulysses  I think Lolita may be the best book I ve ever read  Nabokov gives Joyce a run for his money in language  though he s a little more restrained  in Lolita at least   and Lolita doesn t sprawl   it seduces  It s monstrous too because of that  Humbert is disgusting and grotesque     and charming  I think that s the magic of Lolita  he takes something grotesque and makes it irresistibly beautiful  then leaves it to you and your conflicted feelings to sort out what s what   Startling beautiful and riddled with spine tingling  evocative prose   Lolita is indisputably Nabokov s magnum opus  The subject matter in itself is frightening  but experiencing it from the viewpoint of Humbert Humbert  or H H  is completely disorientating  switching between groundless remorse and unnerving desire  perceiving Lolita s supposed  seduction  through his eyes  and blanching at the sheer animalistic infatuation he seems to harbour for young girls aged 9 to 14  or  as he likes to put it so creepily   nymphets   Nevertheless  Nabokov takes Humbert s unreliable narration to dizzying heights in the way that he so carefully constructs this narrative to make the reader unconsciously slip into a realm of moral questioning   who exactly is the victim  and who is the perpetuator  The answer to this question is entirely subjective I felt that at some parts I almost crumbled and read Lolita as a perverted love story  and in others  was just overcome with rage at Humbert s thievery   and thievery is the most fitting way to describe it  He filches Lolita s innocence and girlhood  and yet our ghastly H H is still hiding in this complicated web of misdirected complaints and accusations  his thievery perennially incomplete  Till the very end the antagonist is very much left to the reader s deduction  with our own moral compass mauled and twisted beyond recognition   and this is purely the author s intent  to leave us stumbling in the darkness  still grappling at non existent footholds  But what is most terrifying is that despite the fact that   and I ll be blunt   a significantly older man has repeatedly manipulated  raped and psychologically abused a child  and she is simply that  a child   the reader still remains compliantly indolent to the moral deviancy of the story  Yes  I will admit that Lolita herself is quite sly and cunning and probably has an assortment of mental issues and yes  there lies the whole  it takes two to tango  argument  but for crying out loud   SHE S A FUCKING CHILD  And it s scary how quickly I became blind to this painful truth  Nabokov writes with utter beauty and fervour  his sentences purling eloquently but without drag  unlike other novels   I m looking at you Infinite Jest   He is a true master of words  of literature  the prose is elegant whilst the content is heavy and brusque to further illuminate the two facedness of the narrative  After finishing  Lolita  I did not feel enraged or amused  why this is labelled a comedy I have no idea  or even empathetic  but sad   sadness that rose and fell in great  gushing waves   sadness that was neither directed towards Lolita nor Humbert  but towards myself  towards the inherently dark nature of mankind   She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita    As close to being perfect as could be  I was compelled to write a review about this book after I had a brief conversation with a co worker about it  we were discussing our top 5 favorite books and Lolita came to my mind as one of my top 5   I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this book  I suppose I should have gone into it blind  without a preconceived notion of the plot or the narrator  but  strangely  I think that made me like it more as sick and twisted as that might seem Because I wasn t really rooting for Humbert because I felt no sympathy for him  initially   it was more fun when I actually realized I was enjoying the story  it made the book exciting  if that makes sense It s a great book  Wonderfully  beautifully written  and DIFFERENT  Different from anything you ve ever read  I can guarantee it  You may not agree with Humbert  I seldom did   but you will definitely get an unfiltered insight on a strange and interesting mind   An incredibly well written  rich  and uncomfortably evocative novel  Nabokov slips over the line of pedophilia with almost sympathy garnering ease  I found myself alternativly thrilled with this novel and then horrified that I enjoyed it  A master of prose  I admit that this is one of my favorite novels of Nabokov s so far  I absolutely loved this book  I think my favorite line was when Lolita said  The thing about death is that we re completely alone   To me this book is about loneliness  After all  who is more lonely than a pedophile  someone who is incapable of having a normal relationship  The reader can see this in Humbert s attempts to create an adult relationship with 12 yr old Lolita  there is a 3 dollars milkshake and a 10 dollars milkshake     they both may be made using the same ingredients   look the same   served in the same glass   in the same quantity but they never taste the same in terms of quality     the first would be just a milk shake but the second one is an experience of lust and love for a good 10 dollars worth on point made milkshake and   Lo  lee  ta   is undoubtedly a 1000 dollars milkshake and there is no other book I ve read so far even came close in terms of the quality of writing to Lolita and despite the subject of pedophilia   I ve enjoyed every piece of it and i doubt it would be a matter to the reader once he picks it up and starts reading this book which I ve read it took the author 2 whole years to write and English is not even his first language A masterpiece I love this book  I do not find this novel traits of pedophilia but of a sick man who lives through Lolita  of an unrequited love that will lead to madness Humbert Lolita is his only reason to live  His life doesn t mean anything without her He doesn t love Lolita  he loves the idea of Lolita because she remembers him his first love  Even though this book is on a touchy subject  pedophilia   I couldn t help feeling completely sympathetic to the narrator  the older man   Everything in this book is so human  his POV  her reactions to him young and then later  the effects of imperfect memory  the disparities of how the characters see themselves vs how they are perceived and  related  the false character image our narrator forms of the others  And so poetic   Nabokov s riveting prose steers you as navigate the controversial and often repulsive subject of the novel  It grips you as if watching a horrific accident unfold  As you read  you can t help but feel sympathy towards Humbert in spite of his predatory behavior   Lolita is perhaps the best written novel of all time  Each word that Nabakov chose was the exact right choice for the phrase  the sentance  and the novel  Only a master wordsmith like Nabakov could create a pathetic pedophile and spin a literary web that gives the reader the permission NOT to loath the character  and even perhaps  empathize just a little with his sad  noodle like state   unles of course the reader feels totaly manipulated by Humperdink  Which is of course  one of the most interesting questions of the novel  Is Humperdink a sad sap  or an incredible manipulator desperately trying to prevent the reader from loathing him   One of the best books I have ever read  EVER  The writing is unparallel  Strange sad love story  but a love story at its best  Very strange book  but interesting  In the wake of James Joyce s ULYSSES  mind the pun   the literary world at large was plagued with a particularly troubling and ambiguous question  where do we go from here  Nabakov provided the most pointed and artistically articulate answer with LOLITA  He carries forward the visceral realities  sexual repugnancy  undying wit  and earth shattering intelligence that Joyce laid out in his epic adaptation  If you can stomach the pedophilia  look past it and see what Nabakov is trying to tell us about the current state and imminent future of modern man  this book will prove thoroughly enjoyable and greatly rewarding  Contrary to the popular perception  this is a book about unbearable loneliness  lost love and crushed dreams  which put Humbert on an obssessive journey to recapture the few moments of true happiness he ever had  The basic premise of the book  a story about his prepubescent make out session  is actually a true story  retold in his memoirs and in a couple of other books he wrote  clearly  that girl left a long lasting impression on young Volodya  and we all have to be greatful to her for injecting him with a desire to express his love for her in a variety of wonderful books  Um livro unico  uma escrita sublime  A arte do texto levada ao extremo  um trabalho neobarroco  em que por mais descricoes e adjetivacoes que se sucedam  a sua construcao e tao solida  tao coerente  que nao so nao perturba  como antes nos deixa sofregos por mais  Nabokov impressiona  nao so pela erudicao  mas pela capacidade de criar um texto como se fosse um joalheiro  dedicando todo o tempo do mundo a cada detalhe  a cada palavra  frase e paragrafo  a cada ponto e virgula  a cada verbo e adjetivo  com um cuidado e um carinho incalculaveis Em certa medida sinto ao longo do texto que a obsessao retratada no tema  o amor proibido de um adulto por uma crianca  serve a obsessao de Nabokov com a forma e estrutura  um amor tambem em certa medida carregado de culpa  Sei que estou a entrar pelo reino da interpretacao pura  mas na verdade e o que sinto ao imaginar o que pairaria na cabeca de Nabokov enquanto escrevia  Lolita   Vejo Nabokov no seu labor obsessivo de 5 anos para construir uma obra imaculada  tao perfeita  quase divina  no entanto tratando um tema abjecto  Sendo eu profundamente formalista  percebo o peso na consciencia de Nabokov  que sente que a sua volta se da muito mais valor ao que se conta  do que a forma como se conta  Neste sentido  Nabokov trabalha um tema repulsivo com o objectivo de  apenas e so atraves da forma  o tornar atrativo  E consegue o Inevitavel citar Hitchcock   Para ser sincero  o conteudo  eu nao quero saber nada disso  Eu nao estou minimamente interessado em saber o que trata o filme  Estou apenas interessado em como lidar com o material para criar uma emocao na audiencia      no filme nao e a historia  e o que se faz com ela    pois acho que para muitas pessoas  ver um filme  e olhar apenas ao conteudo  e nunca parecem estudar  falo da capacidade de analise critica  o que e que o filme tinha para fazer com que a audiencia passasse atraves de todas aquelas emocoes   E isto Nabokov  por mais leituras que possamos fazer do tema retratado na sua obra  a sua primeira preocupacao  e o texto  e depois o texto  e so depois aquilo que o texto diz  Deixo alguns trechos  Atraves da escuridao e do rendilhado das arvores  distinguiamos os arabescos das janelas iluminadas  que  retocadas pelas tintas coloridas da memoria sensitiva  me parecem agora cartas de jogar   talvez porque um jogo de bridge mantinha o inimigo ocupado  Ela estremeceu e contorceu se quando lhe beijei o canto dos labios entreabertos e o lobo quente da orelha  Um cardume de estrelas brilhava palidamente por cima de nos  entre as silhuetas das folhas finas e compridas  e aquele ceu vibrante parecia tao nu como ela estava  sob o vestido leve  Vi o seu rosto reflectido no ceu  com uma nitidez extraordinaria  como se emitisse uma tenue radiancia    Para alem da planicie cultivada  para alem dos telhados de brinquedo  havia um lento espraiar de inutil encanto  um Sol baixo numa bruma de platina  com um toque quente  de pessego descascado  a infiltrar se na orla superior de uma nuvem bidimensional cinzento pomba  que se fundia com a sensual nevoa distante   Sentia me orgulhoso comigo mesmo  Furtara o mel de um espasmo sem molestar a moralidade de uma menor   Isto ganha contornos ainda mais impressionantes  quando percebemos que Vladimir Nabokov era russo  e  Lolita  foi escrito ja com 50 anos  sendo a sua primeira obra em ingles depois de varias em russo  Da minha pesquisa  percebi que o facto de ter nascido num berco aristocrata permitiu lhe conviver desde crianca num ambiente trilingue   russo  ingles e frances   e isso explica muito sobre os talentos do autor  Da ainda conta das suas preocupacoes com a escolha da lingua e da traducao  Parece que ter escrito  Lolita  em ingles lhe causou desgosto  porque diz  teria conseguido mais se o tivesse feito na sua lingua mae  o russo  contudo quando ele proprio realizou a traducao para russo  sentiu enorme desilusao  por nao conseguir retirar mais da sua lingua do que aquilo que ja tinha extraido na versao inglesa  Isto e um claro indicador da obsessao de Nabokov com a forma  o texto  a palavra  um verdadeiro joalheiro  um designer  para quem a forma era tudo Voltando ao tema  como ja disse  e repulsivo  A historia narra as aventuras de um senhor erudito  ironicamente pinderico  Humbert Humbert  Este sofre de um problema de pedofilia  atingindo o auge com uma menina de apenas 12 anos  procurando por todos os meios justificar e justificar se  O livro foca se apenas no pedofilo  e ele quem narra  pouco ou nada sabemos sobre quem era no fundo Lolita  ja que aquilo que nos e dado a saber  e por meio das elucubracoes da mente doente de Humbert  O autor  Nabokov  esforca se por nao agir moralmente  desenhando toda a abordagem ao personagem de modo a obrigar nos a empatizar com ele  Por mais que nos desgostem as suas ideias e acoes  Nabokov trabalha minuciosamente a sua apresentacao  de modo a que passemos toda a leitura a debater nos connosco proprios  pensando  e tudo tao horrivel  mas Humbert ate nem e mau diabo  e tudo aquilo e amor  amor verdadeiro   Mas amor  amor e o belissimo trabalho formal de Nabokov  texto e estrutura  que nos leva todo o caminho  pela mao  mesmo contra as nossas crencas mais fundamentais  ate quase nos conseguir atirar pelo precipicio da moral abaixo Para ler com links e formatacao fica o link do blog  http   virtual illusion blogspot pt 2    The prose was exquisite and beautifully poetic  I m rating this five stars because it is an exemplary demonstration of the English language  however  the subject matter made me feel weird on the inside  Proceed with caution  but if you choose to read it  make sure you finish  Appalling but captivating  Nabokov writes splendidly  despite describing such deplorable acts  The story lulls in a few places  but this was definitely one of the  classics  I ve read that lived up to the high expectations  It s probably not for everyone  but at least you ll have something to talk about at your next cocktail party  When I read this last summer  I couldn t have been in a more appropriate state of mind to experience it  This was during my family s long winding roadtrip to and back and forth through the state of Florida  so the ideas of the roadtrip across america s vast kitschy landsape wasn t too far fetched  I am pleased however to mention that my road trip wasn t nearly as tragic or debase as the title character and her captor s was We are ultimately given is a wonderfully parasitic relationship between the protaganists and only in literature would they enjoy any praise in that respect  What makes this one of my favorite books if not THE one  is its multi faceted nature  There are technically two stories being told here at the same time  On one end you have the rose colored self indulgent prose of the eloquent and perverse Humbert Humbert who contrary to being well to do  lets his impulses get the better of him  While many would jump at the chance to explain to you how Lolita is not a love story  from Humbert Humbert s point of view it most certainly is  though readers tend to be more rational than Humbert and notice what initiates this obsession is more on the sliding scale towards lust than it is love But what prevents this from being a  love story  is the second story being told  Lolita s  While Humbert rambles on about his escapades with his step daughter with a certain sense of delight and nostalgia Lolita clearly shares none of this enthusiasm  The titular character is stuck in captivity cut off from the world and her peers and as much as Humbert adores his little pet she seems to only be just that  his little pet  A pet which he refuses to let of the leash or even notice realisticaly until the leash inevitably snaps itself after a long time of tugging  Though it is a story devoted to her  we only get inklings of what Humbert allows use to see  Physically Humbert Humbert was the most in control  but Lolita had a stronger toehold in his mind than he had in hers When Lolita finally escapes after years of having to satiate a 36 year old man s libido whenever he came crawling on his hands and knees Humbert is driven to homicide  We needn t even debate that the victim here is Lolita  but one has to wonder by the end of the story  who was in more control  Humbert or Lolita  It was a roller coaster I loved it and hated it and it crushed me  It was unbearable  Lolita  Lolita  It left me empty  drowning  agonizing  Love of beauty  love of youth  love of flesh  as violent and ardent as any other love  How can a love so powerful be ever so selfish  Humbert was a monster and a God and a mad man  Humbert was hopelessly in love  All I want now is to forget this feeling  this bitter taste that I was left with  this ache in my bones  this sour smell that the book infused me with  I don t think there is a love story as filled with emotions  as devastating  as lethal as this one  Don t read this book unless you ve already lost your mind  I wasn t sure what to expect  coming in  but the prose here can honestly be called ecstatic  It s a bit odd to have a main character who can t quite capture the whole of your sympathies  but Nabokov pulls it off brilliantly  to the point where I almost felt myself in love with this dusty  decrepit seventeen year old women at the last hinge of the book  Love it or hate it  but it s a work of art  I decided to read this book because I wanted to challenge myself to read more classic novels this year  With its subject matter being so touchy but at the same time being so well loved by readers  it easily came to my attention  I ve read many reviews and I think enough good things are being said already   This review here is one of the most comprehensive   All I want to add is that this is a sad story  none of the character is benefiting from anything whatsoever  If one can only see the erotic part upon finishing  one lacks compassion  I dare say   brilliant and disturbing  this is an erotic and voyeuristic exploration of a human s  humbert  capacity for love  lust  longing and enchantmentlolita is fiction at its best  delicious language and a gutsy plot that exports the reader into the poetic and demented desires of a far out mindI likes these lines from the book  mirage and reality merge in love  the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised and in the end nobokov writes about his book  Lolita has no moral in tow  for me it exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm   The book is about how an adolescent girl  monstrously preyed on by an irretrievably corrupt man  and abandoned in place by her mother  nevertheless manages    through wits  intuition and determination    to fully escape both  As always  Nabokov makes the reader work very hard to find this hopeful meaning  I missed it entirely after TWO reads years apart  both of which left me wondering why I so enjoyed a book that featured such a loathsome anti hero  Finally  I read Richard Rorty s introduction to Pale Fire  where he observes that in Lolita  VN so focuses our attention on the repulsive character and actions of HH that many of us  ahem   miss the heroine s Houdini like escape  RR s piece is an insightful and delightful appreciation of VM s art  I am in love with this novel  however the topic is certainly not everyone s cup of tea  The way Nabokov is able to humanize a predator like Humbert is remarkable  The poignancy of word play  stylistic choices and characterization interwoven amid such a sensitive topic is genius  Many times I felt like Alice falling down into The rabbit hole knowing I should be questioning the sanity of what I was reading  but being enthralled nonetheless  Nabokov lives up to the lines   The moral sense in mortals is the duty  we have to pay on moral sense of beauty   This was a surprisingly good book  One of the most compelling I ve ever read  The writing is so good that it keeps you riveted to the story at the exact same time that you become very uncomfortable with the subject matter I sometimes felt as if I was watching a movie  The narrator and protagonist Humbert Humbert is a master of imagery  He sees other people as up on a screen and is seldom aware of their suffering  He is very sensitive to everything that affects his obsession and not curious about anything that affects anyone else  Lolita would cry at almost everything  yet he never gave it a second thought  HH was a genius at using language to prevent us  and him  from seeing reality  Only at the very end did he seem to cut through the bullshit and see himself as he was  a monster One more note   I  read  this as an audiobook narrated by Jeremy Irons  who actually played HH in a movie version  His performance added enormously to the emotional impact of the book  He understood the part so well that listening to him was a chilling  voyeuristic experience  I read this to be rebellious at sixteen and ended up feeling scandalized  but I read it at again a few months shy of twenty  after some ne er do well would be intellectual recommended it and subsequently broke my heart  and it was just what the doctor ordered  My first grown up book   The story is so well known by now  I shudder to imagine that one can  spoil  it but  just in case  beware I was hooked from the first paragraph of Humbert Humbert s first person narrative when he says   You can count on a murderer for a fancy prose style   That kind of wry wit and humor is scattered throughout this classic that is thoroughly deserving of its exalted reputation  This is the funniest tragedy you ll ever read Lolita is a love story  a character study  an observation of a fish out of water  and a commentary on deep rooted hypocrisy  Much has been made of its study of the sophisticated European vs  his  vulgar  American neighbors  And yet  Humbert s own perversity makes him even more vulgar than the provincials at whom he seeks to look down his nose  He is keenly aware of this and is as haunted by his own hypocrisy as he is by his equally self defeating pedophilia I highly recommend this book to any fan of poetry or passion  At some point in our lives  we have all pined away for someone or something we could not have  It is through our constant awareness of this that we can cry for Humbert s predicament even as we seek to throw rocks at him  especially those of us with young daughters   All the while  we laugh with him at his sardonic self loathing  Lolita is a frightening novel  simply because it allows you to view love from a pedophile s perspective  Nabokov s narrative is so powerful that at times I caught myself thinking  Wait  this is absolutely okay   And then realizing that I thought pedophilia was okay and then feeling terrible about it  I feel this is Nabokov s purpose in creating Humbert s character  Lolita is  quite simply  the most brilliant novel I ve ever read  Not because it touches upon an unconventional and frightening issue  but because it manages to play havoc in the mind of the reader  This book has earned its reputation  but by today s standards  it is relatively mild An excellent read  Give it a try  Lolita is one of the best books i ve ever read  i would highly recommend it to readers wanting to challenge themselves as Nabokov s prose is brilliant but can be confusing  i love how he poetically phrases everything   the descriptions and the narrative are interesting and the story itself is phenomenal  It s kinda fucked up but that s what made it so interesting to read   Read  this on audio  Jeremy Irons is the sublime narrator of this classic marvelous novel  I was repulsed and fascinated by Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita   Nabokov s does an incredible job of telling a story of immorality in beautiful prose  The writing is extraordinary  vivid and told in a manner that generates sympathy from the reader for Humbert  Nabokov s writing style makes something grotesque into something seemingly lovely  Lolita is full of richness  depth and essentially is poetry at its core  Nabokov is a literary genius by exposing Humbert s humanity and drawing you into this disturbing tale   Strange  how Nabokov haunts long after you put the book to rest  I never sat down and said   Today I m going to read LOLITA   I just saw the book on a shelf and picked it up feeling ashamed that I hadn t read this famous novel  Thinking  to hell with everyone else s assessment of it    and to hell with my conscience  especially if I should find beauty despite its questionable subject matter  I mean  one really hates wanting to know the narrator Humbert  But since the book makes you climb around in his skin for the duration of the read  there s really no point in trying to pretend that you re not inside his head  And it is his head that is seductive  Nabokov proves that the mind s illusions and delusions are the meat of any matter  or  any book It s terrifying to read about a man  a predator of children  to read about adolescence  how it boarders on the edge of innocence and knowing  and then to see a man willing to gamble  willing to take what he wants knowing that what he does is irreparable  What makes it even worse is reading it all in the heightened language that boarders on poetry  When you read Humbert s confession  you realize that he isn t purely evil  or out of control  On the contrary  everything he does is painstakingly calculated  as calculated as Nabokov s perfectly chosen words  Nabokov writes this terrible tale with a linguistic skill that s uncanny in its perfection  Perhaps  I feared the book  But true art doesn t ask if it is appropriate  True art is neither moral nor immoral  It lies outside  as an abstraction  so that we may linger in the play yard of the mind  so that we may entertain the understanding of things that seem outside understanding  It s not a question of good or bad  But  as a reader  just to be receptive  to actively read the story  to look between  the bars of the poor creature s cage   LOLITA  allows us to see into the cage of a man such as Humbert  and to recognize his animal nature and the all too human trappings of his elaborate intellect  It is a great accomplishment to have written a book that allows us to see a man  and an issue of this complexity  I have read that Nabokov was unprepared for how Lolita would be received  that he never imagined the backlash or the firestorm that would ensue with its publication  I ve often wondered if he felt uneasy  or sickened viscerally while writing Humbert into existence  or if he merely felt that he was writing inside the intestines of a man  unprincipled in his being  and merely translating his inevitable downfall   This can be a little hard to get through  language wise for me  but maybe plot wise for some people with easily upset personalities   but what I love most about it is in fact the language  It s so well written that I forget I m reading about a pedophile  Every once in a while I jolt back to remembering what the story is really about  and become disgusted  but then re immerse in the story  The dichotomy of it is so fascinating to me  how I can be so invested in Humbert and his emtotions and yet so utterly disgusted at the same time  Humbert is portrayed as a normal  intelligent  likeable character  save for the fact that he is in love with and having a sexual relationship with a young girl  see  how could you normally justify saying those things in the same sentence  hence  why i love this book   This was my first time to read Nabakov s master work  I had seen the 1997 movie adaptation but failed to remember the vast majority of the plot line  What makes this such a compelling work is Nabakov s uncanny ability to so fascinate the reader with his tale of the pursuit of illicit love while being  at the same time  so utterly mortifying  Reading this at the same time as the Penn State scandal and with the realization that my oldest daughter is less than 2 years younger than the object of HH s affection was a good bit disconcerting  I read with uneasy fascination as Humbert continually devolved into the vortex of his despair  Again  Nabakov s depiction of a man totally hostage to his lust and desire was both literary in scope and nauseating in effect And yet  that is just part of the tale  What starts out as the pursuit of a young girl to satisfy his sexual desires gives way to a similar pursuit  This time not of the girl so much as a pursuit for revenge  for the retaining of an object  This is not what I expected  It is not merely an erotic  love  story  It is the tale of descent into the deepest throes of longing and personal darkness  A look at when the object of our affection becomes merely an object  something to be used and pursued to your own peril and demise   I had been meaning to read this book for a while and when i finaly did i was not disapointed  vladimir although dealing with a delicate subject matter that is viewed as wrong by many in society  managed with his amazing writing style to allow for a beautifal story that i could not put down  his use of imagery and language made me never want to stop reading  If you like Quentin Tarentino  you will love this book  I highly recommend the abridged version  because Nabokov uses a lot of references that could easily go unnoticed but add a lot of depth to the story  This is probably in my running for one of the best books ever  One of the incredible things about this novel is its awful content  How can you really sympathize with a pedophile  Nabakov does an admirable job  I think he may be the finest prose writer in English   which says a lot for a Russian born novelist This book certainly has one of my favorite sentences ever   My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident  picnic  lightning  when I was three   Nabokov deals with a man s sexual insanity in a way that can be perceived beautiful  or utterly disgusting  The reader may look at this text and think how well Nabokov has penetrated the mind of a  nymph lover   Or the reader could read the book and be absolutely repulsed with the romanticized portrayal of Humbert Humbert  Putting this all aside  the pedophilia and insanity contained with in the book  we must all admire the way Nabokov writes  it is like no other  A genius of english writing  to say the least  english being his second langauge   Beautiful and compelling  a breakthrough novel of a sexual deviate like no other  and a ruining of his beloved  resulting in his own destruction   I read this book when I was just shy of 14  I did not understand most of it  but I had no trouble feeling empathetic towards Humbert  And it served as an excellent introduction to artful  poetic prose  I read it again at 16  and again at 19    And I ll probably read it yet again very soon  I have four different copies of this book  including one in French  that I ve never attempted to read   I love Nabokov  and I love this book   What can I say about this controversial book that has not been said before  Having watched one of the movie adaptations  I had an idea of what was expecting me  Still  I needed to read this one slowly with other less demanding books Nabokov is certainly a master writer as he managed so skilfully to record such an outcast love as described by the pervert  or perverted   narrator  And Jeremy Irons is such an amazing actor that he performed the role of HH all over again  but with me as a director and with my mind as a stage   dizzying obsession  beautifully written  disturbing and brilliant mind blowing  moving  beautiful prose  bordering on poetic at times   From the first paragraph  Nabakov inserts himself firmly inside your head and stays there   My sin  My soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta    Probably the greatest novel of the 20th century  and probably the most misinterpreted  especially by people who have not read it  To paraphrase Mark Twain  those looking to be offended should be prosecuted  those who are bored by it should be banished  and anyone aroused by it should be shot  Extraordinaria obra literaria  con una narrativa romantica y poetica donde trata principalmente el incesto y la pedofilia  El autor narra la historia  en primera y tercera persona  siendo H H   de 40 y tantos anos  el pedofilo  desde su prision  quien a modo de diario cuenta la historia de su amor hacia Lolita  una pequena de 12 anos la cual es su  ninfula  y su perdicion  El personaje esta tan perfectamente recreado  con ese toque de cinismo  de amor anorado y humor  que es imposible que uno lo odie a pesar de ser lo que todos deploramos en un ser viviente  Obra totalmente recomendable Pag  378 This book is a masterpiece  Though most people I ve seen comment on it get it very  very wrong and think it s a romance or love story  From Humbert Humbert s view  maybe  But HH is warped and selfish and nasty  You have to be a sophisticated reader to see beyond HH s narrative of events to get at the real story of Dolores  Nabokov gives us the fingerpost right in the preface  but you have to have your observational skills at the full from the beginning  I didn t write a review when I first read it  but here are some comments I made on BookCrossing forums about the book  apologies for some repetition  I really enjoyed it  I found it fascinating to be told a story like that from such a point of view  It was challenging to try and determine who the real Dolores was and how she must have felt  beneath the layers of Humbert s lust and obsession and selfishness  view spoiler  I also marvelled at Nabakov s spoiler that you don t realise is a spoiler til you reach the end  For anyone reading Lolita  go back and read the introduction when you finish   hide spoiler  Antof9   I m also totally weirded out by the Vanity Fair blurb on the cover  posted elsewhere in the forums too    The only convincing love story of our century   HUH   It s not a love story   And it shouldn t be convincing either  I liked the novel  but I think that people  like the Vanity Fair writer  and maybe the director of the Jeremy Irons version  I haven t seen it  so I m basing this speculation on reviews  just don t get it  We re not supposed to side with Humbert or feel sympathy for him or see this as a love story  that s Humbert s agenda   We re supposed to see through Humbert s b s   and like you  say  WTF  It s about a pedophile and the girl who can t get away from him   Hating Humbert and hating the book are two different things  no  I think it s clever and brilliant  but a person has to take the high road  be smarter than Humbert   not get sucked in to his warped view  obviously the Vanity Fair writer failed at that    miriam2   Definitely liked it   love Nabokov   agree it s supposed to bother you  Exactly   HH is the consumate unreliable narrator  but it s funny how that doesn t stop people  even critics who should know better  from going on about  courtly love  and calling this a love story  Yuck miriam2   but I think it also makes it seem less unimagineable  and makes HH appear slightly less creepy  as we re somewhat used to seeing teenage girls presented as sexualized in movies and on TV in a way that 12 year olds aren t   Very true  and this just goes to give credence to HH s point of view  Instead of seeing the real Dolores  a child victim of a very smart predator   movie audiences are presented with a complicit accomplice  Lolita  as HH percieves her  sexualised   asking for it   worldly  Even in the Kubrick version  I think the actress was 17   It would take a master filmmaker with the proper understanding to make a really good adaptation  how does one portray the dual vision adequately  so you get that sense of being told things from HH s desire to pull one over you  and at the same time seeing the real situation   anthromom   Re  Unreliable narrator vs erotic litI think what is bothering me is that there are people who actually see this as erotic literature  who are turned on by it  miriam2   Gah  Yes  that is disturbing  But my view of that is that that s a problem with those particular readers misinterpreting the book  rather than with the book  But  of course  it does raise the question of whether a work of art should be held responsible for how it has been read or interpreted  or misinterpreted   and or if society has a responsibility to safeguard people from possible misinterpretations of art   This is not to say that I have a straightforward answer to that question     And this book is especially tricky  because of the erotic elements  HH is able to couch his desire for Lolita in language we can all relate to  It s not desire that s disgusting  it s turning that desire on someone who has no power  whether we re talking paedophilia  rape  sexual harassment in the workplace  or misuse of a doctor patient relationship   And sometimes  HH leads us to forget that Dolores is a child  He turns her into Lolita  a nymphet  i e  a mythological being  that is a safe object of eroticism  We get dragged with him because he s so persuasive and subverts the universal feelings of real love  and sexual desire for the ideal In a way  it s Nabokov s genius that HH is so convincing that Lolita is so often misinterpreted  Humbert Humbert is the king of unreliable narrators and Lolita is the single most clever  sly  crafty and funny game of chess with poor reader s emotions I ve ever read   I feel like so many people write these epic reviews about this book  and I can t live up to that standard  Vladimir Nabokov s work is discussed in college classes     people use Lolita for their thesis and spend huge amounts of time picking it apart and finding the true meaning of every crazy thing Humbert Humbert and Lolita said  I m just a 27 year old hairstylist from California  and if my opinion matters at all  I can tell you that Lolita may be one of the most brilliant books I have ever read  There are only two other pieces of literature that stick with me  I think about them everyday  I talk about them all the time I want to be buried with them when I die  And Lolita is now the third  I was nervous going into it  It has a terrifying plot line  One  that at times  had me reading though my fingers with one hand on the Nook and the other searching for my daughters  Humbert is not written to be loved or sympathized  he just is  He is honest  He is a monster  but true to that form  There are no gimmicks or secrets or forgiveness  He is a child molester  Lolita is a disturbed child  I love that I read Nabokov takes responsibility for no one naming their girl s Lolita anymore because of his book  It has to be true  I want to quote every paragraph  I want to force you to read it     all of it  I want every single one of you to read this so you know what a good book really is  I want E L James to choke on every single word because after reading this  I think she is a disgrace to writers everywhere  She s a fraud and this is brilliant  and I m sorry that a book like Lolita even exists when shit like her s is considered epic  This is epic  This is what women all over the world should be reading If you want to be a better writer  read Lolita  Drown in it s vocabulary  Dance in it s fucking greatness  Expand you mind  Brilliant  And if I knew hubby would not have looked at me funny  I would have given it a standing ovation in my living room  which is where I was when I read the last sentence   And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita   Sigh   Humbert Humbert  H H   is a pedophile  but he is also a lot of other things  He is a narcissist  and he will justify every action he has committed but debates murder when he perceives an unflushed toilet as his wife s new lover s final insult to him  He is unreliable  but he is intelligent  The genius is how this character is so well written that you can despise a character but also sympathize with him  People are alarmed at the idea of feeling sympathetic to someone so selfish and obviously criminal  But that is the story  Crime and Punishment does not make you a murderer  and Lolita does not make you a pedophile  The insights are profound  the descriptions intense  there is really nothing vulgar in the book   the characterizations so eloquent that if H H  despises someone then you will too  Sometimes you see through his paranoia and his eagerness to control  and these feelings are not always unique to pedophiles  He describes the 12 year old as the optimal  nymphet   and when describing the stage before puberty  his exaltation becomes clear to the reader   my little cup brims with tiddles   Part of the fun of this book is dissecting H H  s coping mechanisms  The way he explains his own behavior by alluding to history and describing it as essentially harmless makes it clear that he has made his current situation possible through a process of self deluding  Sometimes he says he feels guilt in ruining Lolita  and a few times must maintain a sort of decent self control  not only to avoid getting caught  but also to minimize the the guilt associated with it  At one time  H H  addresses the readers directly to clarify that it was in fact Lolita that seduced him Whoever says Lolita is inappropriate because it makes you sympathize with a pedophile misses the point completely  It is fun and challenging to deconstruct the prose and to assemble a new  totally human construct of Humbert Humbert s flaws  The merit of Lolita also comes from the questions it raises  How do you define a psychiatric disorder  Accepting the norm that pedophilia is bad  it is   does this make other sexual  deviances   such as homosexuality bad as well  I do not think so at all  but how do you define the difference   Is the crime in pedophilia the interest in the underage  or is it the acting on it  or both  Read this book  you will know why H H  is a pedophile  a narcissist  a criminal  but also how he is human not despite these things but because of these things   One of my all time favorites  Read many years ago  and then just recently with a book group  Brilliant Long live Quilty   Que bonito es lo bonito  Un excelente libro  3   Hay que leerlo con la mente abierta ya que trata un tema muy fuerte  no esperes una historia romantica  P    Spoiler alert   Lolita is a novel where reality and fiction collide in a cacophony of color  madness  and melancholy  There is no writer I can think of who better transfigures English from a metallic  solid rigid slab of cold marble into the animated veins and muscles of a breathing human work with blood  with bone  and with beauty  This is a twisted work  unsympathetic to the casual reader because of the verbosity  density  and erudite nature of the prose    a killer example of postmodern experimentation and principle at play  This is an ill novel because of the nastiness of its narrator  an aged literary professor with a hunger for 12 year old nymphet girls  Yet  it is this same villain who is the poet  the arguable misogynist and immature male who cannot detach himself from a euphoric sexual memory as a child when he nearly lost his virginity to an initial girl child  Annabelle  It is Annabelle who is essential to Dolores Haze s  Lolita s  inception  and who is essential to Humbert Humbert s  our dear  disgusting professor  lifelong obsession with the damning allure of youth  and ultimately  by association  his obsession with immortality  He must have her  and he loves her  and she reciprocates    this is not purity succumbing to depravity  However  what has Humbert created  He s infused Lolita with the parasite of adult  carnal love before her time  Humbert uses Lola as an elixir of life at the expense of her childhood  and she becomes a mother by another man at a mere eighteen  He s ironically destroyed youth in search of his lost time  and as a means of saving himself  Humbert must lift Lola s soul to immortal heights forever through the art of literature  Her story is told infinitely and she lives forever through this novel  but is it not a terrible thing that she must  in this vein  relive her doomed life eternally  Humbert s fucked up  He s fucked up completely  He has no reservations about his depravity  and he has no intentions of saving himself in a court of law  this is still a frame story with Humbert giving testimony   Humbert is a deplorable character    completely terrible    but he is undeniably an artist  a master of words and of acting and of deception  And through this novel  it can be argued that the events are metaphorical and wholly a criticism of meshing reality with impossible fantasies    the  high romances  of poets and writers as Keats would say  Such is the female  placed perpetually on a pedestal  but at what cost  What would it look like in reality to do such a thing to the female or to the romanced idea  It d be a crippling of her wings and an abomination to the end  This may be the doomed relationship between the artist and their ideal vision  their love for the ineffable moment leads them to sum up  to make a statement and capture that moment and drink from it forever so that they may never forget what it feels like  But in capturing beauty  we restrain beauty and wither her soul until  at end  we are not melancholy to see beauty vanish into the hollow coves of passing time  we forget that never returning and never attaining again is what makes beauty exist   hot stuff An excellent work Hrrm  Well  Ah  Lo Lee Ta  At one point I considered putting this book down  not continuing  I was reading it before bed and then laid awake for hours  angry and disgusted by Humbert Humbert  And yet  it was also a beautiful book  Beautiful  not just because Nabakov knows just how far to push his reader into darkness and dis ease before he veers away on a tangent  and then  back again  but overshoots the mark  and hovers and veers again away  so that you never stare at any sordid detail for too long  beautiful  not just because the narrative itself is queer  like a fly buzzing around its target  or a larger picture which is made from thousands of intricately rendered tiny shards  he writes like a pointillist paints  Anthony said   Or better yet  it s like one of those weird white noise pictures that were big in the 90 s  the ones where you d stare cross eyed at some blank pattern and gradually a blurry 3 D image of a dolphin would emerge  His writing s like that  delirious  almost ecstactic  what s going on  you ask yourself sometimes  And then you realize this is the same detail or scene that was alluded to 50 pages ago    This then  is my story     It has bits of marrow sticking to it  and blood  and beautiful bright green flies   says Humbert   It s not a love story  It s the story of a monster  and the monster is so lovingly vivisected that the story  itself  becomes monstrous at times  For long stretches of the bewildering road trip Americana motel middle of the book  I just wanted it to be over  I couldn t wait for Humbert to be locked up  But the end  oh  the end is so fantastic  The most surreal  slow motion murder scene I ve ever read  A beautiful crashing and burning  And in the end  Humbert is broken  Humbert sees almost what we  the readers have seen  and from the 2 dimensional monster he painted Lolita into  emerges the child he broke   he broke my heart  you just broke my life   H imagines Lo telling him   and suddenly the whole narrative becomes 2 layers at once  both the screen the fictional Hum paints of his broken  pathetic  obsessive view of the world  and the view through the screen that has beent there all along  through the cracks  beautiful  tender  and devastatingly  fully human   holy f I ve only read it about three or four times  and everytime I decipher a little bit more of the story  understand more of the characters  and feel even more disgust towards H H It is a great story  beautifully written and a mind f  cker  and I will definitely read it again soon  Wow  I always meant to read this  and just never wanted the ick factor  But while reading  Reading Lolita in Tehran   I felt like I kind of had to read this  And I am certainly not sorry I did  Nabokov has to be one of the most gifted writers ever born  Certain passages literally gave me the tingles  they were so beautiful  Often they were horrible as well  Humbert is truly a monster  Is he the most reliable  or unreliable  of narrators  I keep going back and forth on that  Nabokov s writing style is rich and detailed  after 26 pages I had to take a break just to absorb everything that I had read  The writing blows me away  The story is pretty good  it s more fascinating that anything  A fresh  brave alternative to the safe books about mainstream acceptable love  Just opening up this book to any random page when I have writer s block is so inspirational based on his style alone  Provocative  disturbing  fearless and brilliant  Nabokov is my favorite of the Russians for the luxurious poetry of his words  Similar to Poe in that even in his least enduring works one finds gems of poetry that leave one slackjawwed in their sheer perfection  Nabokov in general  and especially in Lolita  is a look into the baroque and labyrinthine mind of a disturbed genius  Probably the model for modern characters such as Hannibal Lecter  Nabokov s protagonist makes Cristian Grey look like a comically transparent rube and an altogether  vanilla  sexual misfit  One of the best opening paragraphs in all literature  Says something profound about the evolution of language that it reads so well in translation  Even if you are weak of stomach  don t go to your grave without reading  Lolita  if you appreciate literature that celebrates the beauty of words for their own sake   nothing much to say other than  i liked it  and  i need to reread it   there is a lot going on and i must have missed some or all of it but still i liked it  Lolita is the most beautiful   but also unnerving   novel I ve ever read First things first  the novel starts out with the best opening to anything ever in the English language  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  a certain initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns   Impressive  huh  But more importantly  the beautiful writing has an effect in the storytelling  working as a sort of aesthetic anaesthetic that dulls our gut level revulsion to what the narrator Humbert Humbert does to secure control over his love Lolita  There are sections that sound like the most entrancing love letter ever    until Nabokov reminds us a few sentences later that Lolita isn t even in her teens yet  The effect is unbelievably disconcerting  and kept me on my toes throughout the early part of the novel Kubrick pursued a similar paradox in A Clockwork Orange  seeking to make the violence so beautiful that the viewer sympathizes   in a way   with the main character s psychopathic behavior  He neglects others  interests  but seemingly in the pursuit of a Greater Good like beauty  truth  etc  We re seduced by Humbert Humbert s artistic gifts  which were ironically insufficient to seduce Lolita herself But after the opening 100 pages or so  Humbert Humbert s manipulation of the reader starts to fall apart  We see glimpses of his efforts at control  such as how he would physically force his former wife to agree  By the time Lolita is his captive prey  we re familiar with his twisted logic and rationalizations for actions  Notable amongst these is one scheme to drug Lolita and fondle her unconscious body  as to not cause her psychic pain from an attempt while awake As the novel progresses  the horror shifts  Humbert Humbert isn t in love with Lolita  but some twisted shadow of a fantasy that he resolutely associates with her  Pedophilia is troubling enough  but Nabokov reveals it to be layered on a vile brand of unrequited love  Humbert is willing to do almost anything to keep his power over Lolita  even when his willpower is good for nothing more than    well  I ll just say that Nabokov knows all about Chekhov s gun Despite the moral stomach twisting that it puts me through  the prose really is fantastic enough to justify reading the novel all by itself  I devoured the novel s 300 pages in less than two days  and I ve found my own writing style to have sightly shifted since starting my read  My sentences tend to be longer and more gnarled  favoring the longer constructions that Nabokov occasionally slips into It sounds ridiculous but our finest prose stylist of the English language may be Nabokov  who first started writing in Russian  He was trilingual in his childhood  though  which he shows off throughout the novel by throwing in snippets of French  It s for those and other obscure references that I m tempted to buy the The Annotated Lolita featuring translations and all sorts of explanatory footnotes  I m glad that I went with the plain novel first  though  since I ve heard that the annotations spoil later events in the novel  As is  I could just skip over the confusing references and just enjoy the beauty in the words Anyways  I d recommend it to pretty much anyone  The book is over 50 years old  but reads as fresh as ever  I m beginning to suspect that Pynchon and others started to play postmodernism s games afterwards because you just can t beat Nabokov in a straight write off  He s utterly amazing  and his other stuff  like the poem story    Pale Fire  just shot onto my reading list  I m at a loss for words  I found this novel extremely disturbing  but it was beautifully written  which made me love the story I m conflicted   Un libro de gran calidad literaria que Nabokov con su estilo logra que sea puro arte a base de tinta  Mas en  http   thebooksangel blogspot com 201    This book was a pleasant surprise  I thought the narrative style was captivating  I have no idea why other people don t like this book  The most interesting thing about the book is that is not based on the typical tragic love story  but is based is a totally forbidden passion and constant drama novel  Really good ending  disturbed that I liked this book as much as I did  I listened to the audio version with Jeremy Irons  I know at some point I will re listen to all or at least part of the book  I had to keep reminding myself that the story is told by Humbert Humbert himself  I think it would have been very different if Dolores was telling the story   Nabokov un kurdugu cumleleri The Real Life of Sebastian Knight tan devralarak Lolita da surdurdugumu soyleyebilirim  Lolita yi ilk olarak Stanley Kubrick in filmografisini karistirirken gordum  Ama dokunamadim o filme  cunku bir karar almistim  kitaptan uyarlanan filmleri  o kitabi

never read a book as powerful as Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita  The book is hard to pin down into a single category  it is a classic work of literature  American fiction written by a Russian Immigrant  It is a look into the mind of a madman  the story of a young girl growing up in an abusive situation  it is a 1950s road trip novel  it is graphic sex  it is beautiful  lyrical writing  it is farce  it is detective story  It is incredible  Told from the perspective of the protagonist  Humbert Humbert  the novel is framed by a fictitious introduction by a Psychologist who presents the book as a case study of a criminal  The intro tells us that the book is a combination of HH s diary and notes written while in prison  The book itself begins with HH s infamous rhapsody on his beloved Lolita  a 14 year old girl at the time he first meets her   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   The book is stunning in that it manipulates readers so well  at the beginning of the novel you loath the aristocratic  pompous  offensive  pedophile  By the end  you pity him  Incredible I taught this novel to 50 first year college students this past fall  What a wonderful and challenging teaching and learning experience  Reading this book with them taught me so much about what students can achieve if engaged and challenged  It also taught me some really unnerving things about attitudes about female sexuality   but that is a different conversation  Better every damn time  I don t ever want to read anything else   Un grand roman  Le sujet est certainement tres tabou  le personnage principal etant un pedophile  et pourrait bloquer plusieurs persones  mais l oeuvre depasse ce personnage pour le moins trouble  L histoire nous met dans la peau d un homme deviant  qui le sait bien  mais n arrive tout de meme pas a controler ses ardeurs  Sans trop en reveler  l histoire va plus loin que celle a laquelle on s attendrait et nous amene au plus profond de cet homme jusqu a une chute imprevu et bien fait  Difficile de resumer ce roman  qui se passe en grande partie dans la tete de cet homme  mais simplement pour dire qu il s agit bien plus de psychologie que de sexualite  il y a tres peu  quasiment aucune en fait  scene sexuelle et les quelques allusions presentes sont tres peu explicites  ce qui rassuera peut etre certains lecteurs eventuels  Bref  bien conscient que cette critique n est pas m a plus precise  je termine en disant que ce livre vaut la peine d etre lu et qu il merite sa place parmi les classiques  What is considered beautiful prose is often unreadable prose  Yes  I am talking about James Joyce   Lolita is beautifully written and extremely readable  Nabokov is flamboyant in his style  his descriptions are gobsmackingly vivid  You learn so much about Lolita while learning nothing about Lolita  The little glimpses of her life as seen through delusional and unreliable Humbert Humbert s eyes are beautiful Read it for the beautiful prose  It leaves you a little sad   It took me half a year to read this book  I read the first half in February  and then I stopped  It was not until after I have watched the movie and listened to the audiobook read by Jeremy Irons that I picked up Lolita again It was  for me  a difficult read  I could not stomach the horrible things Humbert made Dolores do for him  Even with all the flowery language and his sniveling  I could not get passed the fact that he ruined Dolores forever  The poor girl  she could have led a different life if it is not for Humbert crossing her and her mother s path  I know that Dolores was not exactly without flaw  she especially annoyed me when she was with her mother  But for all that brattiness  she was only a twelve years old girl and to be honest  Humbert was not a reliable narrator  so we could not see how he might have twisted some of the child s behaviours The prose was excellent  the characterization  simply amazing  I saluted Nabokov for his talent and Lolita was truly a masterpiece  one of a kind  I might read this again in the far off future  but for now  feeling of utter disgust still overwhelmed my entire being  Disturbingly beautiful  Nabokov creates timeless poetry out of cruelty  narcisissum  deviancy and loss of innocence  Humbert s abashed love seems no more deniable than Charlotte s bold faced lust  while you second guess yourself and your morals for the sympathy you afford a monster  Nabokov s genius results in a comical  intellectual and emotive love story  In contrast  Humbert is a pathetic predator  his behaviour deplorable and his actions  unforgivable  Amid the selfishness and chaos lies the truely unjust solace bestowed upon an inncoent child made animal  object  nymphet  Tragically bewitching www booksnakereviews blogspot com I thought I knew what to expect  but I was wrong  Lolita is much more disturbing  heartfelt  and beautiful than I ever anticipated  Humbert Humbert  while repulsive in his sexual addictions  is intelligent  entertaining  and even charming  He is a character of great complexity  and his narration of the deeply twisted relationship he has with Lolita only makes it that much more intriguing and nuanced  Why was I so deluded  It took me a long time to write  a very small  review and a whole day after I finished Lolita  to realize that I was blaming the victim  There I said it  I blamed a poor  damaged girl who lost her childhood to a sick  perverted man that deserved prison and a slower death than the one he got  I blamed a victim  I normally have the urge to strangle people who do that and yet here I am  The hypocrite that I am  I fell for Humbert s sad story I cried when she didn t choose him in the end  It took a Lolita nightmare  that woke me up in the middle of the night  sweating  crying and ultimately disturbed and scared  to make me realize what a stupid ignorant girl I am  There s nothing romantic about rape and I blame Nabokov s brilliant writing in deluding me that it is  I read Lolita twice because of this nightmare and it helped  It made me realize that I find minds like Humbert  interesting  and  disgusting  at the same time  I did cry again the second time  but this time because my heart just ached for all Dolly s pain  Pedophiles destroyed her childhood and ruined her live  She is trying to move on and I hope she found the happiness she never got as a child It is surprising how easily you get through even though Nabokov likes to write in a poetic and riddle like manner  And it s got humor in it  You do have to understand it   This is not me being a snob   this is me saying the humor isn t easily understood if you don t at least have nerd or know it all level 2  I m a level 2 nerd and know it all  looks away ashamed  and I thought Nabokov s wit was hilarious  I am going to buy this book  because it is deep and serious and disturbing and brilliantly written and  it deserves every single one of the stars I gave it    college reading and total joy in language and america the new Yorker used the phrase  a sense of humor with a sense of horror  and I feel that describes this book perfectly  oh man  his description of Lolita s vacant eyes broke my heart  Nabokov is a lyricist and a word magician  the perspective makes the story easier to stomach as does the lack of detail on certain things  At its root   Lolita  is a tale of love and obsession  This disturbing story stars Humbert Humbert  a forty something man who falls in love with 12 year old Doloris  Dolly  Lo  Lolita  L  Haze  Nabokov writes beautifully and succeeds in making the reader feel like you are in Humbert s head throughout the novel  A modern classic  I had chills reading this and was constantly reminded that people actually exist like this in the world  Although  Lolita  is written from the perspective of Humbert  a pedophile who knows he is stealing Lolita s childhood  this is more of a story about obsession and how one can lose all sense of reality in the face of love  Sick and twisted absolutely  A classic read for everyone definitely not  While there are no graphic scenes in this book  situations are easy to extrapolate and this is perhaps the most shocking book I ve ever read  Recommend  yes  but not for everyone  the subject matter is uncomfortable Apparently I was deceived  I love Nabokov  He s one of my favorite authors  Yet I had never read his magnum opus because I had been given to understand that it was prurient and perverse    that it was a troubling and controversial work because it reveled in or glorified hebephilia and turned the hebephile into a tragic  sympathetic hero  But what did I find when I finally did read it  A beautiful  nauseating  tragic tale  featuring an immediately repulsive and pathetic protagonist who tries to hide the true horrors of his hebephilic predations behind a show of voluptuous prose and erudition  A book with such lush  luscious wording that it s literally intoxicating  yet which is also the least erotic and least sexual thing I have ever read  Unless you too are a hebephile  i suspect you are more likely to be sexually aroused by the Bible or The Fractal Geometry of Nature than by Nabokov s  Lolita  Appealing to ancient precedent  foreign practice  modern psychoanalysis  the shifting and arbitrary nature of cultural mores   taboos  the tyranny of  Nature  itself  and self serving historical revisionism  Humbert Humbert does everything he can to convince himself and his reader that he is innocent of any crime  or that he is at least in the grips of a lust he is incapable of refusing  Sometimes he demands the reader s pity or compassion  yet sometimes he laments society s failure to understand and accept his paraphilia  Indeed  his arguments are so familiar that one wonders how certain other groups whose sexualities have finally found approval in modern Western society must feel when they read the same arguments to which they appeal used in a story which intentionally evokes such revulsion and contempt   Dolores  Lo   Dolly   Lolita  Haze is only ever revealed to us through Humbert Humbert s memories of her  and we can never be sure if what we are being presented is the real girl or simply the solipsistic self justifying fabrication he projects over the flesh and blood being he has chosen to rape and imprison  Is she a  nymphet   coming into her sexuality in a society which refuses to acknowledge it  Is she a pubescent child captured by a monster and forced to live as his doll to preserve her own life  Is anything he tells us true  What would the character herself say  were she given voice outside Humbert s apologia One of the most disorienting features of the novel for me is Humbert s descriptions of the females he encounters  Humbert describes adult women in terms which the character obviously intends to be disgusting  but which provoked in me only the thought  Wow  that woman sounds gorgeous   Simultaneously  he describes the pre pubescent and pubescent girls  he  desires with an almost orgasmic exultation which only made him more impenetrably alien to me  There s even a scene early on in which he sneeringly describes how unappealing he found little Inuit girls and my knee jerk   enlightened   21st century reaction was  That s racist      until I remembered that he was talking about SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO CHILDREN  Again  disorienting In any event  I deeply regret not having read this earlier in my life  I denied myself a gorgeous and harrowing literary experience from one of my favorite authors simply due to this book s erroneous reputation    a reputation  I should note  which persists as much among its champions as its critics   Incidentally  having now read  Lolita   I have to conclude that the writers of  Red Dwarf  had never read it themselves  since they have Rimmer   Lister reacting to a passage which they silently read as though it were steamy and sexually exciting             I m finally reading it all the way through  I m a big Nabokov fan  but I ve never really read his seminal work  i was always afraid this would turn out to be another prurient piece of trash  a la Lady Chatterley s Lover   and I ve never understood ANY male s preference for younger women  even when they re of age   But I don t feel like I can really claim to be a Nabokov fan any longer if I don t undertake this read  My favourite  Love his writing  Jakiego kunsztu literackiego potrzeba  aby napisac powiesc o pedofilu tak  aby czytelnik nie tylko nie znienawidzil postaci  ale nawet go polubil i finalnie by bylo mu go szkoda Styl swietny  ksiazka to zasluzenie klasyka  polecam Przy okazji sie dowiedzialem skad wziely sie seksualne skojarzenia ze slowem  Lolita   oraz ze jest to zdrobnienieod  Dolores    Post reading Yes  Nabokov is more than occasionally self indulgent  preferring to showcase his wit in direct addresses to the reader rather than concentrating on the tiresome tedium of narrative  Honestly now  didn t you too roll your eyes just a little bit as HH pursues his nemesis across the cheap motels of the American interior only to be tormented by literary puns his adversary leaves for him in guest registers  Puh leaze  But I forgive him  It was a supreme achievement to take a man as loathsome as HH    who gleefully plots drugs and murder to achieve his ends  who s perversion is but the symptom of a deeper and darker inability to relate to women  have you noticed his deep dislike of Lo s personality  or any sign of individuation on her part other than adorable petite sex doll    who is insanely jealous of his object s affections as he continually searches for something younger and fresher    and turn him into someone entrancing and oddly likable  Is that because HH is so well actualized  That he doesn t angst or whine  he knows what he wants and pursues it with gusto  even though his goals are  in a word  evil  that he s so queerly admirable  I m gonna be chewing on that one for a bit Anyway  for once  a so called classic that lives up to its considerable hype  A monumental  iconic  smashing success  the confessional of a monster turned sympathetic through prose  Required reading   Pre reading OK OK OK so I never read Lolita before  Shut up I had almost sworn off Nabokov forever after choking through  Guantanamo waterboarding style  the hideously self indulgent  Ada or Ardor   But Big Bad Vlad could only get away with that incoherent  masturbatory exercise in puerile wordplay knowing his thrall of blindly loyal slaves would love him for it and shower Ada with PhD theses earnestly deconstructing its dick jokes  Which is where Lolita comes in So I m reading it now  Nymphet  Now that word has potential to send shivers down my spine  Lolita lingers and will have a permanent impact on me  The power of this book is that it is deviant and yet ever so human  darkly human  perverted in the corner  The plot is sure to raise eyebrows to the point where there is a risk of them disappearing into one s hairline  Nabokov slyly catches the reader in plenty of traps with his twisting perspectives in this wrenching tale of insanity  obsession  passion and      love  The writing is some of the finest I have ever read so far in my life  It is eloquent  breathless and the layers of innuendos can leave your mind running in wild circles  The style is deceptive yet pure  scandalizing yet sensitive  Sheer genius and a remarkable piece of Literature Just don t be surprised if you don t feel like recommending this to anyone else once you are done with it  Until the last chapter of this book  I was prepared to give it a 4 star rating  What a great ending Torn about the rating actually  I wish they let you use half stars EDIT September 2015  I have once again changed the rating because I constantly think about this book  Nabokov  who I haven t read before  writes in such a way that you get dizzy trying to keep up with him  If I had to put a price on sentences  something that Hemingway writes would probably cost   75  whereas a Vonnegut might be  1 00 to  1 50  Nabokov  on the other hand  writes  3 00 sentences  Does this confuse you  Read it  you ll see what I mean Actually  maybe you don t want to read this one  It is  in fact  told from the perspective of a pedophile who describes  in disturbing detail  his infatuation and relationship with the 12 year old Dolores Haze  aka Lolita  If this disturbs you  maybe you should stay away from this book  I know it gave me a few nightmares this week  However  if you are interested  read the first paragraph  Out loud  You ll want more  no matter how ugly it gets  At first  I ll try to read this book 4 years ago But I have to confess I coun t finish it   I got bored      Later  and it hadn t occurs to me before  I see the movie  Kubrick s version  and it was really wonderful  Then  I returned to the book and It has been raised to the top of my sacred books It s simply   marvelous    The sinister  sensuous  enigmatic  magical  disturbing  breathtaking  Lolita     my all time favourite book  How many times have I re read it  Don t ask  I ve lost count   Lolita  has to be one of the very few books that I have come across in my life that has a truly haunting quality  It grips you from the very first words and will not let go until long after you ve finished reading it    That is  if you ever dare put it away   Lolita  is a permanent resident of my bedside cabinet   There are so many levels to this novel and so many reasons why it will put you under its spell  Nabokov s virtuoso command of English language is probably what did it for me when I read it for the first time  am I the only one who finds it hard to believe the author is not a native English speaker     I ve given up trying to analyse this book  instead  I just let my mind drift along the mesmerizing flow of words    I implore you to cast aside your prejudice and keep an open mind about  Lolita   Forget all you might have heard about it and find out for yourself  This is definitely not a book about paedophilia and sexual perversion  nor does it justify it or make it look attractive  The main character s obsession is just a backdrop for exploring the darker areas of human nature where no one had dared go before  in a way that no one had done before  You will savour it like a glass of exquisite red wine and will be desperate to make the last drops last when nearing the end  So make yourself comfortable  leave your phone off the hook and let its dark magic do its work     a nice description of driving By that time night had eliminated most of the landscape and as I followed the narrow winding highway  a series of short posts  ghostly white  with reflectors  borrowed my own lights to indicate this or that curve  I could make out a dark valley on one side of the road and wooded slopes on the other  and in front of me  like derelict snowflakes  moths drifted out of the blackness into my probing aura   Although the content  for our time  may be called in question by some moralists  I find this to be the best written book of all time  The poetry of the words always send me into a trance  A good book is supposed to do many things for us but I think that althought there are a lot of fun character books out there  it is nice to be able to read a truly well written book  Words are magic after all   In my view  this annotated edition is the ONLY way to read Lolita in the 21st century  I read this in graduate school and was surprised to discover that the real joy of this book was not its eroticism but its observations on 1950 s America   This book was written with immense love  The kind of love that forced its author to go over 112000 words of writing and rewriting and rewriting over again until all the layers of creativity have been unpeeled to its clearest  purest and most resounding core  The kind of love that only the most faithful  prodigious and stubborn slaves are allowed to endure And I can t help but wonder  how could anyone love so deeply as that  I m beginning to understand why it s so hard for me to write anything longer than blog posts  I have never loved anyone like that  I can t love for more than 500 words or a 1000 without stopping and expecting a sign of reciprocation  How could I even love writing if I can t even love anyone enough  And writing is even more cruel than the most gifted poet  writings do not kiss or love its creators back  I m scrambling all over my textbooks  my old writings  the old scripts and letters  I needed to find the answer  the keys that would create that kind of love  I searched the love letters between authors and their sentences  syntax and syllables  Love letters that survived time and evolution of publishing s form  How could you love as conditionally as Nabokov loved every paragraph in Lolita  What does it take to be able to love as deeply  I m beginning to understand why there aren t a lot of masterpieces in the bookshelves today  Why a lot more people want to read more garbage literature than powerful shit like Lolita and Slaughterhouse 5 and Animal Farm  There s only so much defeat and loss that one can endure in a life time   I think if I had to pick a book to call  The Best Book Ever   it might be Lolita  I don t know if it s my favorite book of all time  maybe    but I think it might be the best book  just sort of in general  Lolita  there is so much to be said about this novel and I just simply can t say it  It s so controversial  and reading Nabokov can place you in a dark place of mind games  As most  this was my first Nabokov I ve ever read  and it has inspired me since to pick up his others whenever I come across them  His writing is beautiful  that s how I ll leave this  As far as the story  just jump right in and pray  Dear reader  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  I have a confession to make   I read this book more then a few times in my life  First time when I was 14  second when I was 16  third time when I was 18  then at least 2 more times in my early 20 s  every single time it was different even tho the book stayed  naturally  the same  This is one of thoes books in my life time that I read over and over again  Reading experience was different because I was different  I mean at 14 I really didn t quite understood what Humbert Humbert meant by his  scepter   This book is genius and brainOrgasmic  I ve run into quite than a few people who have prejudice against this book and silent hate towards it  yet they never even touched it  You know those people  who judge the book by the cover  literally   Those who judge you and give you  the look  if they see you in the bus reading something they look down upon and frown upon  I think it s quite more acceptible to read Twilight and 50 Shades then this book  that says something really said and disturbing about the world we live in   Anways back on the subject On the surfice the book s theme is upsetting and disturbing  but the book is anything but  This book is sarcastic  perfectly written  intelligent  it turns words into the sweetest honey and smoothest chocolate and the most delicious ice cream and you crave it for more and more and more and you never got sick of it  never upsets your stomach or give you brain freeze  It has a plot  it s not witty UH I am pedophile  let me tell you about my sick desires  poor me  NO  It has solid plot  great twists and turns  live 3D characters  I can t exactly pin point why this book is one of my favorites  there so many things to love  and it has one of my favorite quotes  and I am sure everybody experiences this book quite differenatly  All I know the book got me from the very beguining  from very first Poe s Annabel Lee reference Some will love Humbert  some will hate him  some will love Lolita and pitty her  some will hate her  But this book will never leave you indifferent  Excellent book  Unsettling subject  but great work  I felt like I was seeing another plane of reality reading Humbert s point of view  It just amazed me  the thoughts were so realistic and plausible  and I felt for the longest time that Nabokov must have personal experiences of this subject  Not that he did any of these things  but that he could create this character he had to have some of the thoughts himself  Humbert was just that real to me   100  understand the hype around this book plus my teachers were impressed when they saw me reading it    just make sure to have a dictionary nearby in case you re not as advanced with your vocab Loving stepfather takes his daughter on a roadtripPocahontas meets Thelma and Louise I will never look at little girls the same way again     Entertainment Weekly       A first hand account of an erudite poet hopelessly in love what that which is forbidden  In the protagonist s attempt to give himself  and us  addressed frequently as  Dear Reader   some solace by the means of a memoir  he relives the mischievous recount of a love affair with forbidden fruit Lolita displays Nabokov s playful volubility and exhibits the power struggle of relationship  ignoring all conventions of age and gender  This book is coruscating in every sense of the word addressing themes of love  power  and the moral ethics of a conflicted romanticist  This book was incredible  the story captivating  I loved the honesty and intensity  At points he was very convincing   It made me think about  love  and obsession and how the two are related and or substituted for eachother in the case of Humbert  and how it intermingles with an evil like devastation  A must read  rwy  lwlyt lli ktb lrwsy fldymyr bnwkwf  Zym  jdan   bdy  Hwlt qr  ar kthyr  w rvyw Hwl lrwy    lkthyr lm ythny

Humbert is by far the most interesting  passionate  insane  human  monstrous  and tragic character I have ever read in any book ever  Humbert is smart  witty  and handsome  But he s also immature  pathetic  and has delusions of grandeur  not to mention violent and transgressive impulses And yet  in his mind  he is the protagonist of  Lolita   He does truly love her  Even though he is a murderer and a pedophile  he s a human with wants and needs  Unfortunately  they are wrong by all accounts and he will never truly be satisfied or happy  Tragic and sympathetic  if one can have sympathy towards a rapist  as he may be  he is the antagonist of his own story In a sense  we admit that Humbert s story needs to be read  We want to know what happens    not to Lolita  but whether or not Humbert s criminal insanity will win him his love in the end Utter disgust matched by ruthless fascination  The shear monstrosity revealed through the cracks and elisions in the main character s witty and frequently funny narration packs quite a punch  If Nabokov can manage this level of richness and beauty in an English composition  my mind boggles at what he must have been able to accomplish in Russian  The story of Humbert Humbert  a humbug and a pervert  and Delores Haze  our little girl of sorrows  in a novel that wouldn t have met the Hays code of its time if they had cast someone who looked and behaved twelve instead of fifteen in the Kubrick movie of the same name   but not in the spirit of Nabokov  close reading reveals who the hero was  a heroine for our times  Nabokov s favorite character he created  a  brave victim    Lolita  5 5 on a creepiness scale but definitely 5 5 on a language scale  because dayum Nabokov  Dayum Such disgust and indifference and horror I felt  I think I will be reading his other stuff  possibly  The only thing that bothered me was the frequent French  because I do not understand even basic French  I first discovered Lolita by reading thisNabokov s prose style is truly enchanting and musical  Lolita is written with rich English vocabularies  mixed in with uncanny sentence structures and French phrases  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style It s true that this is one of the hardest books I ve read  And it is exceedingly like that I will never understand all the contents of every novel I read  so this review will only consist of my own reactions and understanding of Lolita Spoilers Lolita is a novel about Humbert Humbert s obsessive love to one pubescent girl  In a particular morning  after a fateful chain of events  Mr  Humbert meets and becomes attracted to a twelve year old girl named Dolores Haze  which he calls his Lolita  It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight Throughout the book  Humbert forces Lolita to have sexual relationship with him  he essentially robs Lolita of her mother and childhood for his own convenience  I ll die if you touch me   I said   You are sure you are not coming with me  Is there no hope of your coming  Tell me only this   No   she said  it is quite out of the question  I would sooner go back to Cue  I mean  She groped for words  I supplied them mentally   He broke my heart  You merely broke my life  Humbert is a despicable human being  A life is wasted to this man  for he kidnaps and rapes Lolita several instances in the novel  Worse  after becoming a legal guardian of Lolita  he blackmails her so as not to alert the authorities  His psychopathic actions  driven by his pedophile tendencies  do not render any signs of remorse or shame  He proudly upholds his sexual fantasies as if it s his greatest creation   Finally  let us see what happens if you  a minor  accused of having impaired the morals of an adult in a respectable inn  what happens if you complain to the police of having kidnapped and raped you  Let us suppose they believe you    So I go to jail  Okay  I go to jail     While I stand gripping the bars  you  happy neglected child  will be given a choice of various places  all more or less the same  the correctional school  the reformatory the juvenile detention home  or one of those admirable girls  protectories where you knit things  and sing hymns  and have rancid pancakes on Sundays Vladimir Nabokov documented this novel to let us  readers  have the final say of Humbert s committed crimes and taboos  We are imagined in a courtroom  the trial of the middle aged pedophile and murder Humbert Humbert  Is he good natured man who acted on behalf of his twisted imaginations  and therefore should be excused and discharged for murdering a man and raping a minor  Or should he be condemned as a despicable man who robbed the life of Charlotte Haze  Cue Quilty  and Dolores Haze  We are the Judge of all this Ladies and gentlemen of the jury   Gentlemen of the jury Gentlewomen of the jury As we read Lolita  we  readers  will delve deeper to the thought process of this repulsive man  We are in his mind  We are Humbert Humbert  We see what he sees in these so called nymphets  nymphets  nymphets  We ll learn his motivations  his drive  his crimes  his temperament  his being  But more importantly  we ll learn that he possess a tiny shred of humanity  Compassion  Understanding  Guilt  Remorse  We are the Judge of all this Thus  neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book  But while the blood still throbs through my writing hand  you are still as much part of blessed matter as I am  and I can still talk to you from her to Alaska  Be true to your Dick  Do not let other fellows touch you  Do not talk to strangers  I hope you will love your baby  I hope it will be a boy  That husband of yours  I hope  will always treat you well  because otherwise my specter shall come at him  like black smoke  like a demented giant  and pull him apart nerve by nerve  And do not pity C Q  One had to choose between him and H H   and one wanted H  H  to exist at least a couple of months longer  so as to have him make you live in the minds of the later generations  I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita  Started crying at the end when I reading Humbert s poem  Indeed one of the only convincing love stories that I have read  know that I am the type who laughs at the Notebook  Titanic  Romeo and Juliet  and all other stereotypical  romantic stories    I d rate this book 5 stars for Nabokov s prose style alone  I ve never read anything by him before  and it was a delight to encounter such an unapologetic  fresh employment of the English language  As for the rest of the book  it s great too  Complex and troubling    an honest reflection of the tragedy and moral ambiguity that pervade human existence  Can be quite dense and tedious  though  Only recommended for those who have dealt with and enjoyed literary fiction   One of the greatest novels of all time  Many people refuse to read the book  or hate the book  because of it s subject matter  This angers me because it is obvious that the book isn t an endorsement of pedophilia  it is more the exact opposite  In what way does Humbert Humbert  the pedophile   win  for being a pedophile  He doesn t  he winds up in jail  It angers me how people will ban books that they either clearly haven t read  or don t understand at all But to the actual review  Nabokov is definitely one of my favorite writers  His prose is beautiful  and at times hilarious  The fact that English was his second language is amazing Lolita is an amazing book  The writing style and characters are amazing  The plot however is a bit slow at times  particularly in the second half of the book  The first half of the book on the other hand is one of the most enjoyable works i ve ever read I recommend it to everyone  A haunting read that ensnares the reader in the twisted perception of a man in love with a girl  The prose is beautiful  probably some of the most beautiful I ve encountered in it s fluidity  vivid imagery  coupled with an unapologetic and almost refreshing boldness in tackling a shocking and repulsive subject  Like a fly caught in a complex emotional web  the reader is taken through a journey that repels and attracts  evoking emotions of disgust  sympathy  empathy  contempt  fascination  among others  Vladimir Nabokov takes a character so twisty and makes him understood  with a window or rather a doorway leading into the misery  anguish  passion  aches and pains of a man whose urges shall never be wholesomely satisfied  Though the novel s subject is controversial  it s themes are familiar  Misery  grief  pain  joy  love and lust  That  and the idea of justice  The book occupied my mind long after I put it down  each time after reading  and now  I believe this book is one that should be read  and read by many  if for nothing more than to broaden our idea of right and wrong  and enrich the mind   Pierwsze strony wystarczyly  by narodzilo sie zauroczenie do autora  Nikt nie pisze tak jak Nabokov  nikt w tak inteligentny sposob nie nawiazuje do kanonu literatury  Nawet nie zdajesz sobie sprawy jak  owija sobie ciebie wokol palca  swa barwna gra slow  Mistrz w swojej klasie  Niepowtarzalny  Humbert Humbert to najbardziej oryginalna postac z jaka mialam sie okazje spotkac Lolita nie istnialaby bez niego Klasyk  Must have  Lolita  America  Everyone should read it  even if they can t articulate an opinion about it  I m still afraid to  Vladimir Nabokov is magical  How does he write so beautifully in what is his second language  What might his prose be like in his native tongue Read it for yourself  read it however you want  be appalled if you wish  be amused if you can figure out how Simply  this is one of the most powerful books I ve ever read  Probably one of the best books I ve ever read  Nabakov s use of language is so beautiful  To me  this is a story about being in love with love  and pursuing perfection that is unattainable  It s a true love story with an unconventional premise  pedophilia  This was a very brave book  considering the time period it was created  It might be taboo  but this should be a must read for anyone interested in literature  Plot   4  Characters   5  Theme   4  Voice   5  Setting   4  Overall   5 1  Plot  4 stars    A European gentleman rents a room in an American house where he meets the forbidden fruit of a teenage  nymphet  and manages to whisk her away on a road trip  But can he stay free of the law  How far will his lust take him  And can he control the strong will of the child  Even though the destination was unspectacular  the tension was strong and kept me flipping pages  Thankfully it didn t devolve into soap opera or porno  In fact  the plot was all foreplay  all on the edge  all constant frustration  A bit like watching a high stakes soccer game 2  Characters  5 stars    Humbert Humbert is old world Europe personified  well mannered  intellectual  cautious  inwardly perverse  While Lolita is modern America personified  messy  coarse  spontaneous  and outwardly perverse  Each was fascinating to watch as they struggled with inward desires and outward pressures  But even more fascinating was their relationship  Just who was in charge  Who was using who  And who was the hero and who the villain 3  Theme  4 stars    Love  and its many close cousins  lust  compassion  jealousy  control  power  tenderness  manipulation  giving  score keeping  guilt  loss  All these themes are explored in the unusual love affair between old man and minor  Despite the reputation of the book  I never felt it to be a statement on pedophilia or fetishes  In fact  besides the fear of getting caught by the law  these are the basic themes in any dysfunctional relationship  So perhaps there s a statement in here about how we shouldn t judge love by its outward appearance  but instead by its inward poison or sweetness 4  Voice  5 stars    The story is told in the frantic  fervent  lyrical  lustful voice of the main character pleading his case as if to a jury  The sentences sing  and this is Nabokov s third language   5  Setting  4 stars    America in the post war abundance  candy bloated  movie star obsessed  Route 66 motel filled era  Though most of the book is about the inner lives of the characters  the outer world of America is done well as it flies by the windshield 6  Overall  5 stars    A beautifully written  emotionally charged work that explores the darker side of love  Not only would I recommend it  I would read it again  In the begging I was  almost overwhelmed by a sense of  repulsion  A damn dude doing what loving how  a 12 year old  Well  she may have been his immortal nymphet or whoever  but the subject matter confirmed in me the one thing I thought I d never have to say of a book  or writer  Controversy  If I was there then  and the publication of the book depended on my uncanny decision  I wouldn t have made it so hard for this man  He penned a book that will probably still be read a century into the future  despite      despite  its  you know what  But  it s funny  a writer like Nabokov can make even murder look beautiful  what then about love  No matter who is loving and who is being loved     The prose is written in the most artistic manner I ever seen of a book  and I wouldn t fail to say it s a book I did not struggle to read  not even a page  It deserves it s place on that shelve where you place your very best collectibles  even though not necessary the kind of story you ll keep talking about to friends   Lolita has slowly seeped into the public subconscious  it is a dirty word  with sexual and paedophilic connotations  few remember that the term comes from a book from a Russian emigre with an unpronounceable name  even those who know tendentiously associate it with imaginary sexual proclivities  and perversities  of its author  after all what kind of man writers not only one  but several stories  about an adult man s sexual desire for a teenage girl  Not only that  but Lolita seems to sympathise with the man who kidnaps and rapes a teenage girl  it imbues him with everything we associate with  goodness   handsomeness  erudition  charm and wealth  Yet  as any good Nabokovian would know  not everything is as it seems with Lolita  Any reader who believes that Lolita is  as Nabokov himself states  an aesthetic work with no moral message  or that it is an extension of Nabokov s sexual desires or even that it portrays the narrators actions in a positive light obviously hasn t been paying attention  Lolita  like most of Nabokov s other novels  is not only a beautiful work of art but it is also a novel with a strong moral and philosophical core  that many readers fail to notice this or attribute to Lolita the exact opposite message which Nabokov intended is a testament to his ability as a writer  to trick  fool and captivate us with his inexhaustible imagination and to test our abilities as readers The novel begins with one of the most famous opening lines in literary history   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate  to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   The narration then takes a different turn  as the narrator begins to describe his childhood in a manner which pastiches the matter of fact narrative style of epistolary novels  his childhood a series of easy cliche s and commonplace characters  Immediately we begin to see that the narrator is playing a game he has already told us than he is a murderer and sinner  yet he lowers our guard by creating an idyllic picture of his childhood and evoking our sympathy for him by telling us about how his sexual urges are a product of a failed attempt at copulation with his young love  Annabel  their coitus interrupted by the appearance of a pair of garrulous men   two bearded bathers  old man of the sea and his brother  came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement  and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu   This somewhat jarring description of the ribaldorous old men introduces an element of farce to the narrator s description and explanations for his sexual urges  not only is it Nabokov s poking fun at what he considered ridiculous Freudian psychoanalysis it also makes us question the reliability of the narrator  which is a key theme of the book Yet  despite the unreliability of the narrator  how his pen swoops and soars  as Humbert himself states  you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style    A cluster of stars palely glowed above us  between the silhouettes of long thin leaves  that vibrant sky seemed as naked as she was under her light frock  I saw her face in the sky  strangely distinct  as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own    She was musical and apple sweet  Her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap  I stroked them  there she lolled on in the right hand corner  almost asprawl  Lola  the bobby soxer  devouring her immemorial fruit  singing through its juice  losing her slipper  rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet  against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofa  And yet  these passages are descriptions of a young girl who has been kidnapped and raped by her step father and is being surreptitiously masturbated over in the latter passage Nabokov s poetic prose is able to mask the horrifying nature of Humbert s thoughts and actions and once we see pas the dazzling prose we recognise the cruelty and brutality of Humbert s mind  Humbert may claim to see the world with psychological acuity  may be a poet  an intellectual  a genius even  yet his outlook is hopelessly myopic  Humbert  and by extension the readers  may go into ecstasy over Lolita s unwashed hair or honey dewed skin  he may even superficially empathise with her over mistreatment by her mother  yet he fails to care about her sobs in the night  about her feelings  dreams and desires  in  safely solipsizing  Lolita he doesn t see how he has destroyed her will  destroyed her life and spirit  Maybe that point is something of a mistake I think Humbert is fully aware of how his actions affect Lolita  and others  he is just playing a game with the readers to make it seem like he is unaware of his brutishness and brutality thus increasing our complicity in ignoring Lolita s pain as we are blinded by the charm  wit and artistry of the handsome narrator  Consider  for example the following passage  one of the novels most poignant  when Humbert is watching Lolita play tennis   She preferred acting to swimming  and swimming to tennis  yet I insist that had not something within her been broken by me not that I realized it then  she would have had on the top of her perfect form the will to win  and would have become a real girl champion   the initial tennis coaching I had inflicted on Lolita remained in my mine as oppressive and distressful memories not only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by my every suggestion of mine but because the precious symmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harmonies latent in her were was utterly jumbled by the clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child I mistaught   And here lies the crux of the matter for all his solipsizing of Lolita  Humbert isn t ever able to truly understand her emotions and feel her pain  there is a part of Lolita which will forever be beyond his reach and imagination  there is part of Lolita  mysterious  beautiful and wilful which he can never destroy  it is not for nothing that the initial inspiration for Lolita came when Nabokov read a story about a caged ape who was coaxed into drawing the bars which imprisoned him  Humbert  who simian features are constantly referenced throughout the novel  whose grandiose  revenge  on Quilty descends into farce  is unable to empathise with the pain of others and so is unable to recognise the darkness of his own soul and his myopia or that he is a mere pawn in the game of another person not Quilty as he so incredulously believes  but of Nabokov  who is using him to demonstrate that whilst we can never truly feel the pain of another person  we can imagine it and reflect on how our actions affect other people  After all  John Shade does tell Kinbote in  Pale Fire  that  Pity is the password   I will finish by quoting what was  for Nabokov  the most important part of the novel and the one which most clearly points out Humbert s inhumanity and his insensitivity  In Kasbeam a very old barber gave me a very mediocre haircut  he babbled of a baseball playing son of his  and  at every explodent  spat into my neck  and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheet wrap  or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to produce faded newspaper clippings  and so inattentive was I that it came as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easelled photograph among the ancient gray lotions  that the moustached young ball player had been dead for the last thirty years   By far  the best written ENglish text I ve ever read  Nabokov s command of English is second to none  and he posesses unrivalled storytelling skills and a sense of style and rhythm  plus a keen sense of humour  The study of characters is thorough  and while the plot may appear as mundane at first  old pedophile seduces young girl   the author skilfully plays around this simple plot to avoid both traps of plainness  candor and monotony  as well as unnecessary  explicit lewdness  While this is a very demanding book  it does yield a very substantial reward to the keen reader  heart breaking and well written  a master piece of a book no review I can do of this book will ever do it justice  that being said I feel I am one of the only people to have this viewpoint  so I am voicing it if you take a step back from our current cultural definitions of morality  and take a look at just the story itself  you may see what I see  by this I mean that it wasn t long ago that in many cultures eating or using other human parts was a staple of high culture from hearts of men to tooth buttons  at the time of this book as well as before this book  and still true in other cultures to this day  marrying a twelve year old was actually a cultural norm  so when I say that I think Humbert felt some degree of love towards lolita  I mean it  to deny it would be to deny hundreds of years of other peoples love  as well as Shakespeare  s teenage romance between Romeo and Juliet  and stop getting your freaking morals all twisted up over this book  and remember that having sex with a horse is still legal in the united states in some states  get mad about that please  not some fictional one sided love story that may now seem wrong according to  y our current culture  it was an amazingly well written book with characters everyone felt for  its so powerful perhaps because we think its so wrong  it grabs us and we are spurred on to finish it to see how it ends in the hopes that it would reinforce our morality  instead of accepting a different point of view and logically questioning it and appreciating the story and everything we take from it  Love and obsession  possession and identity  loss and desparation  Lolita explores the ageless perils of human relationships  guided by Nabokov s unbelievable propensity for crafting vivid literary romps  Those wary of the subject matter may do themselves a disservice  the book is noble  careful  and passionate  and in no way exploitative  To denounce this novel as smut is to deny basic humanity and the characters that toil around us everyday  unseen by the silence of privacy  Rarely are the shades of madness fairly colored  and Lolita gives credit to the madness in each character while giving them an honest habit  The plot lopes along with a pace drawn forward by the promise of heartbreak and a tragedy that readers will find difficult to predetermine  One of the best novels of the 20th century   I have read enough reviews with cautious admissions that the reader enjoyed Nabokov s Lolita  I am not going to be cautious  I loved it  Sure  it was not subject matter that I found particularly appealing  and our society does  and must  I think  hold pederasty in the highest contempt  However  this was a fantastically written novel  and I think everyone should be required to read it I won t give away much of the plot through my review because I believe this is the first book on the list that everyone MUST read  and I am fairly certain that many people avoid it  I initially wanted to read it before the arrival of the next baby  simply because I thought people would frown upon a newly delivered mother reading Lolita  Surely  there is some stigma attatched to the book On the other hand  most people will gladly watch Law and Order  SVU or other incarnations of the series  all of which are significantly more explicit than Lolita  There were no incredibly explicit scenes  no  pornography  or anything like it  In fact  reducing Lolita to the pederasty is akin to describing a gourmet dinner of filet mignon to  beef and vegetables   Nabokov s masterpiece is far too rich  nuanced  and developed to be painted with such a broad brush I could wax on and on about my thoughts on the book  the richly developed characters  the clever plot  the brilliant prose  but  suffice it to say  I thoroughly enjoyed Lolita  It was the first book on the list that I have  loved   and I hope there are more like it  There s not a whole lot to say about this book that hasn t already been said  I ve read it four times now  I guess  and enjoy it more each time I go back to it It s one of the best written and most imaginative novels ever written  Nabokov  more than anyone  knew how to play with the difference between literary reality and everyday reality  This book is as much about sexual abuse as  Moby Dick  is about whaling  Unnerving and upsetting  Nabokov trapped me in Humbert s world  The story s vulgarity lies buried in wordplay and euphemisms  both French and English  while it s fictional trajectory echoes all too common disturbing true storylines  The scattered asides buried many of the story s clues  and I would re read to uncover them all  Updates from the re readFound it a marvelous and lyrical narration of the vagaries of an abnormal mind  Pedophilia and Hebephilia are difficult to digest topics  Here Nabokov has successfully managed to show the life of a pedophile  and how his proclivity destroys his life in the end  Humbert  is the hero villain who narrates this tale of abnormal love and infatuation of a middle aged man towards a 12 year old girl  and how he manages to destroy both their lives in the process  It was magical  lyrical  very touching  I hated Humbert the humbug in most parts of the book  but couldn t help in a thought creeping in   what if we discard the element of hebephilia  then Humbert is a really clever  articulate  learned man  who would be able to hold people captive with his words and rhymes  He had a great talent of playing with words  our Humbert  But his abnormal trait just eclipsed all his better ones  This is a book definitely worth reading  would recommend to all  even the faint hearted ones  as whatever disgusting act that occurs in this book is sugar coated with beautiful  ethereal words  mesmerizing the reader Feb 2011this is my first book by Nabokov and I have mixed feelings about it  The language was musical  nonsensical  humorous  enjoyable  The names chosen for the hero villain and his child amour were superb   Humbert and Dolores Lolita   the names are lyrical and I can roll my tongue around them easily and repeatedly  The circumstances were horrendous  The way the lecherous middle aged man entrapped the child was horrible and mesmerizing By two thirds of the book I can almost see and feel the villain deteriorating in mind and body  His ramblings and spoonerism increase  he plays with words  often nonsensical ones  I hated the main characters  even the girl child Lolita  who seemed precocious to me  even before she was seduced  I hated what they all turned out to become  I also felt a little bit of pity creeping in amidst my feelings of revulsion and horror  I will not wish upon such an acquaintance on anyoneThis book has moved me profoundly  If I had a daughter I would have fiercely protected her and looked upon all males who interacted with her with jaundiced eyes  I will not forget Lolita for a long time to come  Gorgeously written  And no filmed version yet has done it justice  captured the Americana  indulged the roadtrip  or offered us the tension of Humbert Humbert contemplating the murder of his wife while swimming in a pine fringed lake   Pines  Did I imagine them  Like some American postcard   Maybe the MadMen team should have a shot  For some reason I find the cover of this Penguin edition the most disturbing  Is it from the Jeremy Irons version  She seems too genuinely vulnerable and easily exploited  already exploited and weary  As an antidote  waiting for someone to make a tv series of Vaachs  I started the audiobook of Lolita one day at the gym while  Jersey Shore  played on one of the big TVs in the cardio section  and found myself thinking there was some sort of irony there  listening to Jeremy Irons  silky tones narrate a tale of a man whose behavior goes past the bounds of decency while images of people engaging in more banal forms of debauchery played in front of me  This is all a round about way of expressing my own trepidation when I began Lolita  the first person account of one man s criminal relationship with a 12 year old girl  Yet  Lolita is less about the narrator s crimes than about his own mental derangement  The spirit of Poe hangs over the novel  from the beginning when we learn that Humbert Humbert  our narrator  mourns for a childhood love named Annabel Leigh  and I found myself thinking much of The Tell Tale Heart  Nabokov takes all of the sickness  literary style  rationalization and guilt of that short tale and stretches it out into a strange  haunting aria of obsession and memory  with a healthy dose of black comedy  Yet he does not let us completely off the hook  and we often see through Humbert s narration  though he is blind to it  the terrible impact of his actions  It s the sort of novel that lingers long after the last page  like a vivid dream whose images continue to haunt long after wakefulness has returned  Disturbingly amazing  amazingly disturbing  This is one of my favorite books of all time  Which considering the subject matter and theme probably sounds a bit strange  but I like dark  A must read for anyone who appreciates good literature   Nabokov is a hell of a writer  This book  the richness  the depth  and even the sentence structures are pure poetry  I m always amazed by Nabokov  He was a literary genius and his writing has withstood the test of time    sighs  Light of my life  fire of my loins  Lolita  This book ruined my life  but in a fantastic way  Oh dear  where do I begin  This book is disturbing  yet charming  Vladimir Nabokov has become my all time favorite author because of this book  His writing style is amazing  and he develops this authentic storyline revolving around the main character  a pedophile  The characters feel so real  and Nabokov truly encourages us to analyze the actual theme of the book  not what society thinks it is  Don t be fooled  this book is not disgusting  True some parts make you want to cringe  but it does so in a weird  tasteful way  I highly recommend you read this book  it will change your life   I avoided this book for many years because I was under the  mistaken  impression that it condoned sexual relationships between grown men and young girls  After I read some of Nabokov s other work  I finally relented  I m glad I did   Lolita  deserves its place as one of the classics of 20th century literature  So much has been written about this book elsewhere that I don t have much to add  I will say that for me this was  finally  a tragic story of arrested spiritual development and the price paid by the sufferer and those around him   There is not a single word to describe Nabokov s art of narration  From the very beginning words  he charms the fantasy of every reader into a sad and poignant story of the life of Humbert Humbert  an unforgettbal traumatic character   What can I say  Lolita blew me away  I went in expecting to be grossed and creeped out  What I found instead was a novel constructed beautifully in its plot ascension and writing style  Now  do I like pedophiles  No  Do I like rapists  Hell no  I m not saying any of that stuff is good  and you d be an idiot to think I d support that  I m saying that Nabokov has written one of the best books I have ever read and created a phenomenon that won t be forgotten  Well  well done   The other day I finished reading Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita   Thank God  It was wonderful  I compare the experience to cutting through black briars with roses growing and only a dull wooden machete in hand   Lolita  was solid and boring  a monstrously obese    thing that danced like light through meadows of bumblebess and sharp grass and seven types of silky soft wheat  I could not even believe that its toes could leave the ground  I still cannot  It was like a cherubim  only uglier  it was a pain to taste and a joy to swallow and I am both sorry and proud that it is over and that I have been the one to kill it  Reading Nabokov is healthy for me   he opens my vocabulary  reminds me of words I had forgotten and left rotting  endows me with an articulate voice so starkly unlike my own cloudy  muddled one  He writes in a voice unnatural to most minds but easily tangible  and thus easily mutated and adopted by others  But I think that  in the end  it was Humbert Humbert that I loved best  I must be his only sympathizer in all the world   most do not trouble themselves with the affairs of monsters  but I felt myself strangely affected by him  Usually I have no tolerance for men throwing themselves so eagerly away and calmly walking the path to destruction  but I liked him   in all his evil and wretchedness  Even my heart bled for him  poor doomed beast that he was  The worst was that I could not even bring myself to hate Lolita herself   the vapid  disgusting victim  that shallow nymphet with only the aery beauty to her and nothing more  everything else sucked into the abyss and leaving nothing  Such a refreshing book  as well   blissfully absent of obnoxious symbolism and metaphors  Sometimes one just wants a story to be a goddamned story  never mind Humbert being Old Europe and Dolores Haze suburban America  Screw analysis   I enjoyed it  even though it was a bitch to hack away at  I enjoyed it  because the blood I bled on those thorns was real and my own  all my own  and it s been such a time since last I could care so much for a character  Makes you wonder what I ve been reading lately  no  When it came to writing this review for Nabokov s classic tale of daring love  I duly found myself at a loss as to where I should start  Although I knew that the goal of my review should be to convince potential readers to pick up this masterly tome  my lack of analytical prowess while reading the book   for the third time   left me fearing I might unjustly describe the book and deter rather than encourage potential readers  Nonetheless  this book review deserves my best shot and while I m sure the clumsy drawl of my words might act to deter numerous prospective readers  I would hereby ask that if you find yourself growing apathetic to this review  then please stop reading it and instead go and find yourself a copy of this book You see  as soon as I finished reading the foreword   which is itself noteworthy for providing Nabokov with a moral context external to the novel   and I started drawing my eyes into the dialogue  I felt the faintest touch of magic wrap itself round my mind  Written in the plainest English imaginable  the first paragraph has palpably hooked me every time with a seductive promise of literary adventure  the likes of which I am yet to discover elsewhere  While I m very aware that hooking a reader with the opening is a standard literary practice  I find little time to contemplate the opening paragraph as I subsequently slide with wilful abandon into the pages and the confessed world of the academic   and some would say perverted   anti hero  Humbert Humbert Being caught thus in the incantation of Nabokov s blissful spell  it was with barely a conscious thought that I found myself driven desperately through the tale of Humbert s sin and his soul  Following Humbert s actions and thoughts with a gamut of emotions ranging from sympathy and disgust to something that feels dangerously close to understanding  the only thought that my analytical mind can construe is how damn good this book really is  From Humbert s wry humour through to the comical and highly believable interlude that is Lolita s mother  every word colludes tightly with the plot to form the most glorious antithesis of the American dream that you might dare to wish for Having finished the scandalous piece in a single sitting  I duly wondered whether the moral part of my brain   if such a thing exists   should have been outraged at the book  In fact  each time I ve read the book  or watched either Stanley Kubrick or Adrian Lyne s cinematic offerings   I ve asked myself the same question  but then I can t help wondering which part of the story is really forbidden  Is it because of Humbert s carnal desires or is it because of his love  Would the story be more acceptable if it was set in the Middle Ages  or is the worst thing the fact that it raises these questions Of course  whatever moral standpoint you take about such a story  the real wonder of the book is that such a beautifully crafted tale of love and despair can be so entertaining and enthralling without appealing to the base emotions that many popular books aspire towards  Equally satisfying is Nabokov s refusal to parade his intelligence via extensive use of a Thesaurus  as is all too common in too many literary  geniuses   but rather he uses simplicity as the mattress on which to display his playful dance of literary gymnastics  So if I could give a final word of advise  it would be get yourself a copy of Lolita  take an afternoon off and remember that while most of us can t write as well as Nabokov reads  we can at least read well enough to read what he writes   I ve read this book exactly 5 times  and each time I read it  I had a different perception  The first time I read it  I was 14 years old  I had a hard time with the word play and I thought it was an interesting idea  But I didn t get much out of it except an aura of sadness that settled over me  By the third time  I fell in love with it  I loved the sadness out of it and though Humbert is horrible I loved him all the same  And I fell in love with Lolita and I felt pity for her  The fact that the book could make me feel so much for these fictional characters as if I knew them personally  I imagine myself walking down the street and seeing these two  Humbert walking steadily behind keeping a watchful eye as Lolita excitedly looks at a dress through a store window  I just loved it  I pity both characters  I pitied most characters in the book actually  Though both movies made for this are pretty well made  they don t do this book justice  I wish a film could be made that would depict this story and the emotion perfectly   It is one of the most controversial novel i dnt like to read this type of novel but when i got the copy during the train journey to mumbai i had finished it in whole night i hate the character but i read to feel how it was so hard to writte the truth It is bitter truth that animals hide in us that was picturised in his character  there was true vibration of heart expressed in words   I dnt like his character but the way it was written after keeping himslef in a negative role was great the power to speak the truth makes it a superb novel     To write an extensive review on this book is honestly a daunting task for me  That would be like asking me to write about the love of my life  as clearly  articulately  and as honestly as I can  It would be a painstaking effort to get the detail right  every sentence crafted to its maximum potential of expressing just how much I love this book  I d have to work on it But till then  I wanted to leave my mark here  Because I love this book      hugs it  Disturbing  In a good way  because it s a very well written piece with an amazing view into a very peculiar psyche    But it s a very disturbing piece through its authenticity  It s entirely concievable that H H  was a real being and Lolita was a traumatised child  Just    too real  This was a truly incredible book and I am so glad that I finally got the chance to read this book  It was a difficult book to read at times and certainly the beginning is something that was hard to get through  I didn t particularly like Humbert Humbert and felt that he was such a schemer and I certainly can t understand the Vanity Fair quote on the front cover that said  The only true love story of the century   I didn t feel that it was a love story  I felt that Lolita never really cared for HH but had to make do with him as a pseudo father and lover because of her horrible circumstances  I don t think she was such a temptress as people have made her out to be  She seems lost and sad and on the brink of her womanhood which many women know can be a very powerful time  It is when you realize that you have this power over men  but I think Lolita was playing with this newly discovered power and that it didn t go any deeper than that with her  A book full of tricks  The narrator is both pathetic and deplorable but he knows how to make you want to read on  I can see why they don t put this on the year 12 curriculum  I re read this in creating Black Heart Magazine s  Lolita issue   and it s still brilliant  Vanity Fair described it as  the world s only true love story   An odd description of a book that is  ultimately  about molesting a minor  and yet it s also true  Humbert Humbert  the despicable and unreliable narrator  manages to convince us all that he loved the under age Lolita  and that this book is his love letter to her  Definitely worth reading  whether you love language  a good moral quandary  or tales of lust and mayhem  It s got it all  This tops my  previously  favorite book  one hundred years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez  Lolita is written in a way where the language is so enticing that it becomes hard to put the book down  It is as though  while Humbert seduces Dolores and speaks of how he lusts for her  he  seduces  the reader to continue reading  Definitely a great read  Seriously  is it possible not to love the book   Everything about this book is just deadly beautiful  All time favourite book   Okay   I must admit I had to read this book twice in a row to appreciate it  The first time I was reading it  I was overwhelmed by Humbert s lifestyle  but I decided to read it again immediately to see if I felt differently  I am so glad I read it again because the second time through I was able to enjoy the book for what it is   it is beautifully written and contains a wonderful dry sense of humor  This book is a literary classic and after reading it twice  I understand why  Although Humbert s lifestyle is not something that most people can relate to  thank goodness  and is uncomfortable at times to read  the writing style of this book is one of the most beautiful I have ever read  I highly recommend it   but I believe you must read it twice   once to allow yourself to become introduced to the subject matter and then again to enjoy the book for Nabokov s style  Truly overwhelmed  This is one of the best books I ve read  The prose is exquisite  needless to say  The last passages with their comment on the act of writing  the novel  Lolita  as written by Humbert  are heart rending  Is Humbert delusional in believing that writing it out may redeem him of his way of life  What a character  the range of emotions he evokes  A must read  While the shock value of a relationship between a pedophile and a minor is most likely the reason for the sensational nature of most reviews to Vladmir Nabokov s Lolita and tends to dominate perceptions of the novel Personally  what attracted me most to the novel was the solipsistic nature of Humbert Humbert and his journal entries  Keeping in mind that the narration is his own written entries made the story that much more interesting to me  in the fashion that peoples perceptions are often muddled by their own biases  self preservation  and self aggrandizing natures despite good intentions  It made his descriptions of Dolores Haze a veneer that seemed to crack at moments  revealing a young girl with no good options presented to her Lolita is beautifully written  and Mr Nabokov skillfully shows his mastery of the English language  made all the more impressive considering the fact that English was not his first  second  or third tongue  Lolita was a pleasure to read  and an exceptional work in English   I m not sure how exactly to put into words what I think about this book  It s so wonderfully written that I know I ll always have a memory of it in my head  even from one reading  Nabokov s writing style is innovative and fantastic  He creates new words  adjectives   adverbs  from known words   which I admire and think contributes to  je ne sais pas  of the book  The story is about Lolita   her stepfather  Humbert Humbert and their illicit relationship  Impressively  Nabokov takes this sordid topic and produces an elegantly written book  Never once is anything explicit or graphic  everything is cloaked and shadowed  So much so I had to read the read the intro to understand what I d missed I highly recommend it  Nabokov is a genius  His writing is ethereal   Nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer We all have such fateful objects   it may be a recurrent landscape in one case  a number in another   carefully chosen by the gods to attract events of special significance for us  here shall John always stumble  there shall Jane s heart always break It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight  As disturbing as the subject matter is  this is a masterpiece  I more than likely would have never picked up this book had it not been assigned but it moved me  Nabokov s ability to  take you there  no matter where it might be is rich here  Lush descriptions and the inner working of the main character had me on the edge of my chair   you want to get to the end  You want to know what happens  you don t like him  but the curiosity lies in wanting to know what makes him tick  Why does he feel so strongly about Lolita  You know why because of the beginning of the book  but the work follows into the unexpected which is one of the reasons why it is so freaking masterful  Lolita isn t just a book  it s an experience   E strano che un libro del genere mi sia piaciuto tanto  Di solito apprezzo di piu i romanzi meno narrati e piu dialogati  e questo e il motivo per cui avevo iniziato a leggerlo con un po  di sospetto dato che sfogliandolo avevo notato le lunghe parti narrate Devo dire invece che mi sono dovuto ricredere  Anche se qualche pagina qua e la e un po  noiosa  e scritto in maniera magistrale  perche scrivere una storia di seconda mano  come in questo caso  e veramente difficile  La storia  infatti  non e  in diretta   ma e raccontata dal protagonista maschile come se fosse una confessione  o un resoconto  o un diario  o piu probabilmente tutte e tre le cose P S  per tutti quelli che pensano che sia un romanzo erotico o pornografico  non e niente di tutto questo  e una storia  punto e basta  Non e tirata per le orecchie  non deve essere scandalosa per forza  o erotica per forza  scene di sesso praticamente non ce ne sono   E una storia scritta bene  This might be right up there among my most favorite books of all time  There  I ve said it  And it might get me in trouble if I ever run for office  I m not ever running for office  It s worth it if I can keep saying this is one of the most troubling  amazing  creative  dirty  fantastic  challenging  intellectually stimulating books I ve run across  It really is a very smart read  I like to tell people this is my favorite book and I m even happier because it s true  I need to re read this one  it s been 10 years now  Come to think of it  this was one of those books I picked up in a used bookstore while I was in graduate school  I would browse through the shelves and think   Oh  yeah  That s on my  to read  list    Just re read this for the first time in probably 15 20 years  I find it hard to believe that I was so drawn to this story at such a young age  All I can suppose is that I was drawn by the nature of the content being so very tantalizingly wrong  Something I shouldn t be doing  I was only around her age the first time I read it  What must I have been thinking  Did it understand all of the implications of that relationship  Did I simply see it as a young girl swept away by her prince  So many questions for young me  I m still enthralled by the story  How has it survived in the public consciousness for so long  It s premise is so powerful that  Lolita  has become a term used in the English language  not always correctly  but used nonetheless  Also the term nymphette  Did he create that term as well  or simply bastardize the the word from an old usage more beautiful  While I was reading this book I was expecting Chris Hanson to come out of some corner and say to me   I m Chris Hanson of NBC s Dateline  We re doing a show on thirty somethings who like to pass themselves off as literature critics but are really perverts  And according to the transcript in the Yahoo Literature chatroom  you wrote     Nabokov s writing is crazy good   You did write that     your screen name is REPENT AND ACCEPT GROGAN  That s what I thought  What people at home might not know is that Nabokov is cyber code for Douglas Adams is better than Hemingway   And then the cops drag me out and I start babbling that I wasn t going to do anything  I was just here to make sure she didn t think that Michael Crichton was literature  Then I d swear again that I wasn t going to do anything  Then they d find the Cliff notes from The Sound   The Fury and then I d know all would be lost   What s my point  This book is a first person account of an enthusiastic pedophile and I liked it  And I don t care how many Top 100 books lists  Lolita finds itself on I still feel immoral saying I liked it  I got the book because I kept hearing about how awesome it was  I knew it was about a younger woman and an older man  It wasn t until I was reading it that I realized the pedophile was my age  36  and she was 12  That s right twelve  You would have to think that critics would be looking to crush this book  yet they rave about it because the writing is that good   8 5 10  Loses a solid point of the untranslated French Deeply disturbing and brilliant  The theme is unforgivable  Somehow  Nabokov s narrator casts a spell on me that entangled me into the perfect prose despite my extreme repulsion of its content and theme  The character development is perfect  The style is genius  The plot is suspenseful  Its terrible and powerful and obscene  It is a perfect novel  The author gets everything right  Well everything except the story itself  If he had written on death and love and obsession and suffering without the perversion of Humbert Humbert than it would be an irresistible masterpiece  Because of its perverse theme of pedophilia and the horror which it was all contrived and endured was so rattling that I can hardly recommend to anyone  Its frightening and has possibly shattered my confidence in middle age Europeans forever  A life changing masterpiece but should read with extreme caution  Un style qui detruit tout  qui empeche de regarder la litterature de la meme maniere  Un style qui ne permet plus d ouvrir de nombreux livres car  des la premiere page  on se dit qu on ne pourra pas supporter une prose  en comparaison  si laide et cela quel que soit le sujet de l ouvrage   Je ne sais pas a quel age il faut le lire ce livre   Il est dur de ne pas devenir trop exigeant apres   Ensuite  en dehors du style  il faut voir le fond  C est un roman dangereux et reellement sulfureux  non pas parce qu il rend les gens pedophiles  loin de la  mais simplement parce qu il est prenant  extremement prenant  Des les premieres pages on est avale par ce malade intellectuel  par cet homme objectivement abject mais qu on ne peut detester  La est tout le probleme  il n est aucunement detestable   il est humain  ses critiques acides sont droles et pertinentes  ses references superbes et son devouement total si bien que  rapidement  on se met a esperer qu il aura Lolita  que son periple ne se terminera jamais   A partir de ce moment la  il est deja trop tard  en se disant que cette gamine est insupportable  on oublie qu elle est une victime et qu il est monstrueux  Une delicieuse descente aux enfers dont on ne ressort pas indemne  bon voyage  Excellent in a really creepy way  This is an excellent examination  in a fictional sense of course  of a predator  The Goodreads  description was rather funny  asking whether Humbert Humbert was a monster or a tortured soul  Are you kidding  He was a loser  a very pathetic loser However  I couldn t figure out whether Humbert a monster  or imagining himself as a monster because couldn t accept that he meant almost nothing to the Dolly  I should probably ask an English major  Vladimir Nabokov is hands down one of best Russian writers  he deserved to win a Nobel and this book totally confirms that  The prose is elegant and magnificent  the word play is just outstanding and definitely he is a master when it comes to semantics and alliteration  One of my favorites  I never get tired of reading it  I have held off reading Lolita for years because of the subject matter  but I m glad I finally read it through  I will come back with a lengthier review and comments when I have time  but in short  I can certainly see why this is always ranked as one of the best novels of all time  A novel of infinite elegance and ambiguity  In a famous interview with _Playboy_  Nabokov himself said about _Lolita_ that   There is a queer  tender charm about that mythical nymphet    1964   and I have to concur  The same can be said about Humbert  for if the title and purpose of the book appear to be Lolita herself  I thought of it as primarily revolving around the ego of its narrator and main antagonist  Humbert  As the fictitious author of the Foreword writes it   No doubt  he is horrible  he is abject  he is a shining example of moral leprosy  a mixture of ferocity and jocularity that betrays supreme misery perhaps  but is not conducive to attractiveness      But how magically is singing violin can conjure up a tendresse  a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring his author  I read _Lolita_ for the first time when I was around Lolita s fatal age  thirteen  if I remember well   and it left me a strong impression that I could not clearly define at the time  I came back to it years later  at nineteen  for a thesis I needed to write on a work of  foreign  literature  This is  I think  the mark of a book one s truly loved  this impulse to go back  to delight in well known passages and discover new ones  _Lolita_ is a novel that never  left  me   haunting  has a sinister tone that doesn t apply to my relationship to that book   _Lolita_ evokes in my mind light and lightness  wit  style  grandeur and decadence in the midst of suburban America  trickery  deceit  playful perversion  poisonous appeal  I might outgrow it one day   so far though  I have remained under the spell  It took me some time to get into this novel  for obvious reasons  But once I did  I quickly became hooked  The genius of Lolita is that Nabokov presents the reader with a narrator that wants us to understand him  while at the same time Nabokov is urging the reader to look past Humbert s deception  Beautiful prose is so carefully woven into horrifying subject matter  I don t believe there should be any shame in enjoying this novel  it is truly an amazing work of fiction that makes you think   After I had read the first few chapters of this book I wrote This book is going to tough to review  The writing is superb but the subject matter is so distrubing that I sometimes find myself wanting to close the book  I sometimes do   for about ten mintues or so   then I find myself re opening the book and contiuning to read I have finished it now and here is my review Vladmir Nabokov is a writer of rare talent  his use of language is exquisite  He gets so deeply under the skin of the main character of this book it is hard to believe that the character s thoughts are not Vladmir s very own  As a writer  even one who uses a pseudonym  I never give my readers a glimpse of my deepest  darkest imaginings   I am too afraid of being judged  or even worse  inciting someone to sexual violence  Vladmir shows a bravery I can only admire by writing about a topic that is not only taboo but very disturbing The world is a brutal place and though we seek temporary escape in books or movies with manufactured happy endings  the truth is all around us  A book like Lolita reminds us of the ugly  undeniable reality of child sexual abuse and gives us a peep into the deranged mind of a perpetrator of this atrocity  Is Lolita one of the best books I have ever read  Undoubtedly  but I am not certain that I liked it  I know that it will haunt me for a long time  if not the rest of my life  And that  you must agree  is the mark of an extraordinary book   I knew I had fallen in love with Lolita forever  but I also knew that she would not be forever Lolita      Vladimir Nabokov  LolitaI don t know if I ve read any book in the past two years that tested me the way Lolita did  I ve put off reading Lolita for years  because I couldn t deal with the subject matter  Last year  I picked it up in a bookstore and read the first page and Nabokov s style mesmerized me  It was another couple of months until I bought it  and another month still before I started reading  I have finished quite a number of books while continuing Lolita  mainly because I couldn t read more than a few pages at a time  I also didn t want to put it down and lose Nabokov s incredible words  Teachers of Literature are apt to think up such problems as  What is the author s purpose   or still worse  What is the guy trying to say   Now  I happen to be the kind of author who in starting to work on a book has no other purpose than to get rid of that book and who  when asked to explain its origin and growth  has to rely on such ancient terms as Interreaction of Inspiration and Combination    which  I admit  sounds like a conjurer explaining one trick by performing another      Vladimir NabokovI found the little afterword by Nabokov very enlightening  It s a welcome look into the writer s mind  Everyone knows what Lolita is about  I don t have to summarize it  What I m trying to grapple with are my thoughts on the book and how it made me feel I m sure everyone is disturbed by pedophiles  But the idea especially disturbed me  from a young age  Think about it    how many children of 12 or 13 watch movies nowadays and fantasize or admire men in their late 30 s or 40 s  I remember the jolt I got when I realized that Brad Pitt was my mother s age  I was about fifteen  I think  When viewed in respect to things like this Lolita is even more frightening  That s where Nabokov came from  as well  Humbert describes himself as a handsome man bearing a striking resemblance to an actor Dolores  Lolita  admires  I am neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction  and  despite John Ray s assertion  Lolita has no moral in tow  For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connectd with other states of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm  There are not many such books  All the rest is either topical trash or what some call the Literature of Ideas  which very often is topical trash coming in huge blocks of plaster that are carefully transmitted from age to age until somebody comes along with a hammar and takes a good crack at Balzac  at Gorki  at Mann      Vladimir NabokovOn some level  that s one of the things that makes Lolita such a jarring novel    you read it  and you cannot find a moral string to tie everything up neatly  And it is definitely  definitely true that reading Lolita is succumbing to aesthetic bliss  After Olympia Press  in Paris  published the book  an American critic suggested that Lolita was the record of my love affair with the romantic novel  The substitution of  english language  for  romantic novel  would make this elegant formula more correct      Vladimir NabokovI would not have read this novel had it not been for Nabokov s irresistible mastery of the English language  You may dispute this  but in my mind I don t know if I have ever read a writer more talented  or one whose style is so exquisite  There are many  many instances when I just sat  open mouthed  at his ability  I think it a strange thing for one to say they loved Lolita  but I did  It s not only that Nabokov is talented  which he very clearly is  It s that his prose speaks to me  There are other writers whose style I very much love  Orwell  for instance  and who I rank amongst my favourites  But Nabokov is different  It feels like he distilled language  and if you were to look for the essence of the English language  you would find it in his words  What s to say that hasn t been said about this amazing  disturbing  beautiful  darkly funny book  I ve read it a few times now  but it s been awhile since I ve revisited it  Easily one of my favorite books  and most certainly one of the biggest influences on my writing style  It made me laugh so much  I almost felt guilty for it Oh  poor Mr  Humberg  What a storyline  Despite the questioning of morals in this story  the characters really make you forget that it is an unimaginable romance  The language used is absolutely beautiful along with the intense emotions of the characters  My friend told me about how the main character was a  creepy pediphile  yet in my mind he is still the protagonist and despite his immoral ways  part of you is forced to sympathize for him  Such an amazing book that it is IMPOSSIBLE to put down  I would recommend to anyone with an open mind that can look beneath the surface of the storyline  I decided to read this book because I was about to sit next to strangers on a plane  and I thought it d be dirty And in the beginning  it  hooray   is  at least  in fantasy form  Very little happens in these lecherous chapters  but plenty is envisioned  The reader is overwhelmed with breathtaking descriptions of what Humbert finds so alluring about Lolita s youth  we see her in bathing suits by the pool  pinafores before school  he describes her little socks  the downy hair on her arms  She is careless and confident  all squirmy arms  Her child ness is not only apparent  it is the whole raison d etre of her desirability and his obsession But as fantasy transforms into reality  we hear little of what actually happens behind closed doors  It could be a devotional from any lover to another  they re in the car  he loves her  they stop for a milkshake  he loves her  she is playing tennis  he loves her  Who doesn t want to be loved like that  Who doesn t kiiiiind of wish Lolita were written about them  Okay  so  every now and then there is a glimpse of her sadness  and you re reminded  ooh right       she s sort of been kidnapped  And  oh right  is       a kid  That s  uh  terrible   But any hint of darkness is quickly concealed with narrator Humbert s sense of humor  about what he is doing  concerning how others react  or what the reader thinks of him  It turns out  Lolita is one of the funniest books you ll ever read  What  Don t arrest me 10 billion stars                                       There my beauty lay down on her stomach  showing me  showing the thousand eyes wide open in my eyed blood  her slightly raised shoulder blades    42  But instead I am lanky  big boned  wooly chested Humbert Humbert  with thick black eyebrows and a queer accent  and a cesspool of rotting monsters behind his slow boyish smile    44  I believe the poor fierce eyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her purse she might somehow reach Broadway or Hollywood    or the foul kitchen of a diner  Help Wanted  in a dismal ex prairie state  with the wind blowing  and the stars blinking  and the cars  and the bars  and the barmen  and everything soiled  torn  dead    185   a kind of gown that makes thin armed teenagers look like flamingoes     186  Sometimes       Come on  how often exactly  Bert  Can you recall four  five  more such occasions  Or would no human heart have survived two or three  Sometimes  I have nothing to say in reply to your question   while Lolita would be haphazardly preparing her homework  sucking a pencil  lolling sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm  I would shed all my pedagogic restraint  dismiss all our quarrels  forget all my masculine pride    and literally crawl on my knees to your chair  my Lolita    192  Why did I hope we would be happy abroad  A change of environment is the traditional fallacy upon which doomed loves  and lungs  rely    239  Solitude was corrupting me  I needed company and care  My heart was a hysterical unreliable organ  This is how Rita enters the picture    258  Where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised    the great rosegray never to be had    264   Are you quite  quite sure that    well  not tomorrow  of course  and not after tomorrow  but    well    some day  any day  you will not come to live with me  I will create a brand new God and thank him with piercing cries  if you give me that microscopic hope   to that effect     280  Then I pulled out my automatic    I mean  this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose I did  It never even occurred to me to do it    280  What I liked most about the book was the fact that it is very personal  but it was written in such a way that anyone could relate   i e Humbert Humber s name and origins  It is more than a love story  it is the border between love  obsession and how as much as we try we can t escape ourselves  This book is about a conflict that is in every one of us  The war between desire and rationality  the Freud s id and super ego conflict  You want to eat burgers  pies  cakes but your mind puts a stop to it because this is unhealthy  you want to have sex  lots of it and some even unnatural  but this is again repressed by mind  This book is the intense form of what we all go through  Our lives are entwined around this very conflict  and so is Nabokov s Lolita Right at outset  Nabokov draws you in to read with his magnetic prose She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  she was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always   Lolita  Light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  My soul  The protagonist of the book is a European pseudo intellectual named Humbert Humbert  It s a narrative book in which he details his romantic life  At times you feel pity for him  at times you want to kill him  but you want to read nevertheless  He starts with his childhood    in it the naive and capricious love affairs    and then goes on about his ultimate affair with Lolita  The book is centered around her  She is this little  nymphet   A term Humbert uses to describe a little girl  9 12 yr  that has this devilish attraction quality that only a paedophile can discern   Saying anything else would only spoil this masterpiece Nabokov is a genius  His writing  surreal  The prose is a little heavy  but I assure you there there are very few people who could ve written this book so beautifully  You may feel strongly about the subject  but Nabokov makes you want to read it  the book is unbelievably captivating I understand some people would squirm at a fictitious autobiographical book about a paedophile s romance  maybe it is extreme  But then again it takes such extremes to present a case for the conflict between the animal and human side  Please don t skip this because you heard it is about a paedophile  you don t have to sympathise with Humbert  in fact  you realize he is not very happy and he even hates himself for this weirdness  In a way  it is a frank account of a person that is on the edge of humanity    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Right from the first paragraph you know you are starting something special  Nabokov has reached summit of the English language  a true feat for a Russian born author Masterfully written  but disturbing to say the least  Nabokov s incredible way with words has you entering the mind of a person who goes against society s deepest held taboos  You will be uncomfortable  disgusted  occasionally sympathetic  but always in wonder of Nabokov s prose  A phenomenal work of art  I didn t realise it was possible to love a book where you hate the main character  This book proved me wrong  Humbert Humbert is possibly the most perverted character I ve ever come across  yet his prose is  quite simply  breathtaking  The book reads like poetry and I really didn t want to put it down  Despite the sickening subject matter this is a hugely readable book and is definitely one of my recent favourites  Jeffrey Eugenides once said  in an interview I can no longer find  that when you re young and your identity still mutable  a single book can change your life  It can tear apart that sandy foundation on which you kneel  there in the earsplitting center of the world  and alter your existence  Lolita is one such book  In brief  this is the greatest book I have read of the 20th century  it s too hard for me to compare it to pre 20th century literature   I say this because it combines a full array of successful techniques and features that I haven t seen combined in other work  but moreover  in doing so it transcends itself and its subject matter to become true art  Possible plot spoiling follows    The most obvious misconception about the book is that it is lewd  Indeed  Nabokov s afterword dismisses this entirely  and actually reading the book has the same effect    he is well aware of the formulaic requirements demands of pornography  There is no crudeness or prurience in the book Another issue is the nature of Humbert  Without doubt he is wretched  selfish and cruel   it doesn t take much quotation digging to establish that  But at the same time it seems clear to me that he does love Lolita  with the ironically childish purity of true love  refer to the passage on his last meeting with her  and his plaintive final beseeching for nothing more than companionship for the rest of his life  This is Humbert laid bare  away from the crowing tone of his with Lolita days  where the stripping away of his one love  she surpasses Annabel   note the lack of Annabel reminiscences in the second half of the text  has shown him that away from the venereal desires burning in him  there was another passion for Lolita  one which renders life elsewhere meaningless    He displays his grotesque failings  and indeed evils  as the result of his sexual desire  a not uncommon event for people in general I haven t come across this reading of Humbert from other sources  but it seems that way to me  It s a result  I d say  of the remarkably sympathetic way that Humbert can come across  despite the brutality of  essentially  the slave girl ownership and psychological domination of his charge  Making a monster human was a great accomplishment for the author There are two tremendously moving parts of the book  The final scene of Humbert and Dolly is agonising reading as he dejectedly comes to terms with his love s final rejection of him  More concise  and more horrific  is the end of Book 1  I paraphrase from memory   Why can t I talk to my mother if I want to   Because your mother is dead     and the dry  emotionless paragraph afterwards  finishing with the lines that embody the book   She had nowhere else to go   One of my faves  The story of a pedophile and how he tries to make his lifestyle sound okay to his readers as he falls in love with Dolores  Lolita   His writing style is beautiful  To believe this author writes in five languages and English is not his first  I love this book because it truly captures the mind s drama as it fights over how to behave and what kinds of behaviours should be allowed  Especially when your victim seems so willing If you want to see the films  there are two  I prefer the newer version with Jeremy Irons because I feel it s closer to the book and captures the emotions necessary to portray such a book   it shows both the uneasiness of a man unsure of what to do with his feelings  and a child who both flirts but also cries over her own actions  I find Kubrick s version less emotional and more artistic  Oh Nabokov  Your love of wordplay and villains has made me a fan  I admit  I also admit that Lolita is not a titillating story  nor is Humbert cast as a terrifying figure  but I think some of your critics were off the mark when they said this book makes you sympathize with a pedophile Humbert does a pretty good job of coming up with excuses for his behavior  and viewing his skewed world with a tilted mindset where he is victimized  but a careful reader will notice how predatory our dear H H  really is  His talons appear frequently  his web is carefully crafted  and he often lays in wait  Oh  he is never aggressive  he is not an active hunter  He simply lays the trap and is pleasantly surprised when his carefully crafted schemes come to fruition  And then incredibly distraught at the unfairness of the universe when they fall apart  along with his sanity  But much has been written about Lolita  and another analysis of the story isn t necessary  Lolita is a very engaging read  and as the story develops with its double climax  especially the oddly surreal encounter with his nemesis  we are exposed to a real sociopath  Someone who doesn t understand other people s emotions  but rather only how he can manipulate them or use them to his own purposes  Humbert feels no grief nor regret for his actions against others  he is only upset at how they tear his own life apart  restricting his access to his pedophilic tendencies or whittle away his funds  Not that Dolores is perfect    indeed  most of the characters are flawed  But it is Humbert s exploitation of others weaknesses that is truly at the heart of the story  and how a charming  manipulative  intelligent person can do disgusting things and feel no regret about it  How can I possibly describe this novel  How can I take all 325 pages of it and violate it with my clumsy prose  My fingers itch to replicate Nabokov s style and they fail miserably  I ve been sitting here in front of my computer for a while now  struggling to conjure up an opening sentence For God s sake  English wasn t even his first language  Every once in a while  you come across a novel that annihilates anything else you ve ever read   Lolita  is too delicate for this  it chooses instead to quietly drown your past literary adventures in their sleep  It skips so lightly over their spines that you find yourself forgetting them  setting them aside  opening up your mind to nestle the massive masterpiece that is this book  I know they will return soon   but for now  Lo  Lee  Ta Nothing else   Having long been a fan of Kubrick s film adaptation of Nobokov s seminal work  and having been told repeatedly of its marvelous prose  particularly within the novel s first act  I finally decided it was time to serrer les dents and read  Lolita  So  so glad I did  The only other Nabokov I had read prior  was Pnin  and The Original of Laura  the former a fine satire  though removed from any real emotional heft  the latter  a vague half finished dream  that  while enjoyable  is no novel   Lolita  is the best of both of these works  and perhaps  one of the best   period  with its delightful  playful prose  still rousing  confrontational subject matter  and its two pitch perfect characters  the sardonic  world weary Lolita  and the sardonic  world weary Humbert  who exist as mirrors in their own private agonies  which Lolita cannot articulate  and which Humbert articulates with such grace  and such masterful guile  and who come alive on every page  often  seemingly  to circle and trap their readers in the beautiful marginalia outside of their comfort zones There s not much else to say about this novel that hasn t been said in countless other reviews  both micro and macro  except  yes  the book is a masterpiece of American literature  and yes  you should read it  immediately  slowly  and let the words trickle off the page in all their meticulous humors and horrors  The wordplay is amazing  The story line is brutal and repulsive  I just couldn t keep from going back for more   I was afraid of reading this book because so many people interpret it as the tale of a teenage temptress  But Nabokov did not disappoint  Reading carefully  it is not the steamy tale of a nymphette but the horrible tale of a brutal child molester  It amazes me that so many have interpreted it otherwise because Nabokov puts it all there  Humbert Humbert is the unreliable narrator par excellence  and it s a tribute to his wit and charm that so many readers have fallen into the trap Nabokov set  of sympathizing with HIM rather than the gauche mother  and accepting HIS view of Lolita rather than reading between the lines for the real facts  A really brilliant book   Lolita is as close to  classic  as I get short of authors like Edgar Allen Poe  Shakespeare etc  I read this in HS   fell in love with it  Started 8 26 10 Wow  I think Nabokov just became my favorite author  I m holding off on that decision until I can read more of his work  but wow  Obviously the content of this book is a bit       troubling  I guess  Disturbing  maybe  Whatever  the writing is so amazing that it dwarfs all of that  I listened to it on CD  read by Jeremy Irons  who has played Humbert in film adaptations  and his delivery is perfect  My CDs failed on the last disc  and I was forced to read the ending in print  and I m glad to have listened to the majority of the book  You really get the extent of Humbert s madness that way  and I don t believe that fully comes across on the page quite as well  I m on the hunt now for the perfect print copy of the book  though  as I do plan to read it again and again  As an aspiring writer  I m completely humbled by Nabokov s work  And to think that English is a second or third language for him  Oh  that I could read Russian and thus be able to enjoy his true masterpieces  Nabokov referred to this book as a demonstration of his love affair with the English language  and that comes across so  so clearly   This book is phenomenal  It s incredibly well written  which is all the more impressive when you consider that English is not Nabakov s primary language  It s an interesting experience to be at once both appalled by and in awe of the descriptions of Humbert s attraction  As abhorrent as his desires are  the way the desire is described can still be rather beautiful   I ll be perfectly honest  I listened to the audio of this book via Audible  It still was mazing especially as it was being read by Jeremy Irons  I loved the rhythm the book seemed to have and I don t think it s was purely because of Irons  vocal talent  I was both disgusted by Humbert Humbert and yet intrigued by his obsession with the young Lolita This is a great book to read if you re studying for the GRE as a good amount of the vocab is the same   I think I shall reread it  or actually read it  someday as there are some parts that seemed like they were better being read by one s own eyes instead of being heard  if that makes sense   Having attempted to master a foreign language  it is with great envy and admiration that I salute Nabokov for this book  I will never be able to use English this well  It is also an interesting trip into the deviant and perverted  which is always a bit of fun now and then  and antidote to becoming prudish  I love this book   what would anyone saysYes  she is a kind and it may seem relaxed   but it is certainly my favorite An incredible study of the way words work and speak  and superb insight into the power of translation  Among other heart tugging things  Beautifully written with a compelling  albeit disturbing  plot  Nabokov s Lolita is undoubtedly one of my favorite novels  It takes a rare type of talent to write in such a way that you can understand the perspective of a pedophile  which I thought unthinkable  I can t go into details without spoiling the novel s plot  but this book comes highly recommended for anyone who has a great appreciation for well written prose and is willing to read with an open mind  Never would I have thought that I would find myself in the position where I favored a pedophile over the child of his affections in a novel  for alas  why did he have to journal his feelings so beautifully  Really  I feel quite dreadful that at one point  in the back of my mind I found myself thinking   for god s sake Dolores  the man s a pedophile  as you re well aware  why are you being so difficult   and I recoiled in horror for an instant  Only an author as brilliant as Nabokov would be able to craft a story that is so beautifully written that one often forgets that it is being narrated by a sexual predator  So do not let yourself be put off by the subject  Despite the seriousness of the plot  Lolita is so much more than the story that critics often reduce it to  It is not simply a  horrific piece of pornography   It is one of the most elegantly authored pieces of English literature  So please don t dismiss it because of what you ve heard about the content  Also  one last note  anyone else think it s incredible that Nabokov wrote this in his second language  S O to the king of prose   Vla dih meer  the tip of the tongue taking a trip three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Essential reading  I pick this book up occasionally just to read a few pages  The writing is such a treat and the black humor is dead on hysterical  My introduction to Nabokov came through  Laughter in the Dark   In that novel  I fell in love with his dark wit and writing style   Lolita  has only helped to solidify my love for Nabokov s style  It is  obviously  more mature than  Laughter in the Dark  and  since  Lolita  was originally written in English as opposed to Russian like LitD  the story suffers no loss through translation I m not going to dive into a lengthy review as the book has been reviewed sufficiently through the ages  What I will tell you  though  is that it is a must read  It is so beautifully written and engaging  I couldn t put it down  Read Nabokov  I m looking forward to my next Nabokov endeavor   Lolita  is regarded as one of the best books of the 20th century as evident in its inclusion in many of the top books lists available Professor Humbert wasn t able to recover from the lost of 14 year old Anabelle whom he fell inloved with during his early age  This started his obsession for nymphets  Lolita  being his ideal  and whom he found in the person of Dolores  Lo  Haze  The sexual relationship between a middle aged Humbert and a 12 year old nymphet Lo is unimaginable and very disturbiing  This makes the book controversial and makes the reader explode with emotions arising from hate and discomfort paedophilia brings  to be confused on who is to be considered the victim between Humbert and Lo  and to explore the story from another point of view different from what is being narrated by the unreliable writer  To read and appreciate Lolita  one must be open minded  In my opinion  this book does not promote paedophilia nor other form of sexual relationship at early age contrary to what others claim  rather it helps us understand why and how it happens  hence  gives us idea on how it can be prevented  I read Lolita for the first time when I was 16 or so  in its Russian translation  I re read it now  in English  and realized how much I missed  both because of my age and the book s language  I would definitely recommend all those who read it in their late teens to read it again  and enjoy the vibrant writing  the characters that feel so real and human  the metaphors and images and word play  This masterpiece would touch your heart and make you gasp and shiver and cringe if you would just let it  This book is true art   Excelente libro que se disfruta a diferentes niveles  EL principal las contradicciones enfermizas de humbert humbert hacia su lolita  pero tambien es un libro con muchas referencias a otras obras de la literatura asi como un paseo por carretara a traves de el estados unidos de la postguerra  Muy disfrutable  I had heard so much about the controversy surrounding this book  that by the time I got around to reading it  I was surprised by it  Sure  it s about a guy in lust with a too young girl  but the book presents the situation as a bad thing   not the controversy I had been lead to expect  This book was cleverly written and Nabokov is brilliant at staying in character  The difficult part about reading this particular novel is that one needs to remember that you are reading the story through the filter of Humbert Humbert  This book is a challenge  but it is worth the work that it takes to read it  I read this book when I belonged to an awesome book club in Portland  It is a truly gifted writer that can make you sympathize with a grown man who lusts after a young female child  You go in thinking  what a douche  I can t wait to hate on him  But you don t   In fact  you kind of like him as a main character and  GASP  you feel an awkward sense of understanding  Which is crazy  right  No  this author is amazing at his craft and Lolita is a magnificent  albeit  twisted love story    Don t get me wrong  shit hits the fan at the end  when the daydream fades and we re left with reality  a grown man trying to father and get funky with a child   I read the version of this with annotations by Alfred Appel  and found them quite useful  The original text uses a short phrase in French nearly every other page  and to find my own translation of each of them would have been quite frustrating  Most likely  I would have simply glossed over them if I had not had the annotations  His insights into contemporary culture and slang were even more useful  as I am not sure how else I would have found them  However  the annotations occasionally exposed foreshadowing or otherwise gave away  spoilers  to the plot that I would have preferred to not know until I discovered them myself As for the actual text  Nabokov s idea of framing the entire novel as memoir by a narrator who fancies himself a literary expert  complete with a foreword by a fictional editor of the manuscript  is brilliant  Similarly  his ability to cover this material in such detail without delving into the realm of pornography is impressive  With the help of the annotations  I had no difficulty following the entire text and never became bored  which is somewhat unusual for  classic  literature written 50 years ago There is no doubt that the material is disturbing  and that Humbert Humbert s behavior is despicable  but I think most readers can identify with him more easily than they would like  His perversion stems from a need to recapture the unfulfilled delight of his own childhood  and who among us does not long to repeat our youth  This book is beautifully written   I love Nabokov s writing style   but the subject is quite disturbing  This will haunt me for a long time  Nabokov s commentary on 1950 s American culture was never more relevant  The last paragraph of Part I  the most tragic paragraph ever written  What can I add to the discourse that is the discussion of Lolita  It is perhaps the greatest or one of the greatest peices of literature from the 20th century on this or any continent  Nabokov was profoundly blessed with an ability to create emotion and fundamental understanding through language  Lolita is awesome in spite of and because of the nature of the subject matter it describes  Humbert Humbert s love is complex and simple  beautiful and profound  perverse  poetic  and perfect  I cannot imagine giving this book a negative review and can only say that it is one of the finest bits of masterpiece literature that I have ever had the good fortune to read  From my blog  may contain spoilers  I finished Lolita over the weekend  I alternated between reading the book and watching the accompanying scenes from Adrian Lyne s filmic version  which is 100  true to the book  but only as far as the events go  the characterization is completely wrong  but that s another story   The book bowled me over so hard  I think I m still recovering The best way I think I can describe is that Nabokov took me on a three tiered  or three threaded  journey through the book  The first thread was the actual story as it unfolded linearly  how the characters experience the story  The second thread was the writing style narrative  how the author experiences the story  The third thread was the way I felt about the narrator  Humbert Humbert  and the book at large  how I experience the story  All three of these met in a synergistic yarn which caused the three elements entities  characters  authors  reader  to be interconnected in such as way as to make the existence of each impossible without the existence of the others Throughout  Part One   I was absolutely entranced and delighted by the writing and  much to my chagrin and confusion  felt just as charmed by the pedophile Humbert Humbert himself  The book takes a sharp turn at Part Two  This was an interesting and ingenious division for the book  the change from Part One to Part Two is that Lolita finds out that her mother is dead  Charlotte actually has been dead for quite some book time  Both the reader and Humbert know the mother is and has been dead  Only Lolita didn t know  and when she finds out  everything changes  Part Two  begins the slow decline of the regard in which Humbert is held by Lolita  by Nabokov  and by the reader  His charm and wit have worn thin with his self awareness and  later  his inability to deprive himself of self gratification  Confidence has become smarm  which soon gives way to patheticalness  The writing seems to become long winded and cloying  I don t fault Nabokov for this  as some reviewers have  Rather  the culprit is Humbert s increasingly desperate attempts at justification for his actions that plays out via the narrative  I began to hate him  began to hate what he had to say  began to hate his every action  and in turn began to hate the book and the writing itself  but I was so mired in the story that I could not put it down  Likewise  Lolita was mired in her own situation that she could not escape  Even when she thought she did escape  she just got into another situation that was equally unhealthy for her  She never really escaped at all until her death  which we learn about at the beginning of the book  but actually occurs after the book is over  she dies in childbirth   The reader gets to escape the misery of the story at the same time both the characters do  but only death is a strong enough reprieve from the torment they ve been subjected to by the hand of McFate and by their own designs As I stated earlier  I felt immensely uncomfortable and confused at how much I was enjoying reading this book about a  nympholectic  pedophile  It made me feel dirty  decadent  and debased  But the way I felt throughout the end of the book completely reconciled my emotive response to where it  should  have been through the incredible feat of making me strongly desire to read a book I was  at points  loathing There s so much to say about this incredible book  but I haven t fully been able to wrap my brain around it all  I just wanted to write a few words about my response as a writer  What I m taking from this is how your narrative design can affect the interconnectedness of character author reader  and the tremendous effect that interconnectedness can have  I ve also learned about creating unreliable narrators  and the power of both sides of that coin  when the unreliability is only hinted at  or unknown completely  and when the unreliability is undeniable and almost excruciating to the reader  Nabokov used that tool to effectively manipulate his readers emotive responses as if he were creating the responses himself I love when you finish a book and you feel like you have  traveled    through time  through space  and through that intangible journey that is experience Read it  Fellow Nabakov fans Follow me on Twitter  I am tweeting Humbert Humbert s account  taken from Nabakov s Lolita  in its entirety  You can also follow me on Tumblr  where I am posting the same account chapter by chapter  So well written  Light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta   I d been meaning to read this book since    okay  pretty much every book here I d been meaning to read for at least a decade  I can t believe I ve reached the age at which I can say this   But  yes  I d been meaning to read this 1950 s controversial classic since watching the films of the same title  Continuing the theme not only of Stanley Kubrick adaptations but also incestuous hebephilia  two books back   I d bought it before ensconcing myself at the Nepali orphanage but decided to hold off reading it until later  Chitwan National Park  for obvious reasons  At heart the book is a comedic American Road Trip novel  which might come somewhat as a surprise  underlying a plot concerning one Humbert Humbert s obsession with young  nymphets   His  fortunate  acquisition of guardianship of one such nymphet   the eponymous Lolita   ensues a blackly humourous  black as night  tale of jealousy  desperation  sex and amusing observations of the American landscape and motel culture  Yes  this book is funny   laugh out loud funny  The quirky observations  dead pan dialogue and imploring narration of Humbert Humbert are told with meticulous precision  extreme visual awareness and a lot of word jokes   it exudes a real love of language  I actually tried to read the book as slowly as possible to squeeze out every treacly word  In my not at all humble opinion this is the greatest novel ever written  The prose is so fluid that you are amazed that it doesn t run right off the page but is fill with such a passion  not just between the characters but for the act of writing itself  that sometimes you think it might burn you alive  Lolita is one of my favorite books and it s a classic  so I can hardly write anything that hasn t already been written about it in one respect or another  Nabokov s prose is some of the most exquisite I have ever read  The words are so juicy they re like fruit bursting in your mouth and you want to read this book out loud  Some people have said that this book is disturbing because it makes the reader sympathize with Humbert Humbert s grossly inappropriate feelings for an young girl  I m not sure that s true  I think his expression of his overwhelming passion is just so compelling that it s difficult not to get swept up in it  In his mind  he is an adolescent boy completely and utterly besotted  and Nabokov can make you feel his torment acutely  even as you mentally condemn his behavior  It s unequaled   Wow  Okay  I admit that I avoided this classic for years based on the subject matter  but saw friends whose opinions I respect give it high ratings  It does indeed go into very creepy territory  but it is told so artfully that I have to give Nabokov credit  Very few writers can pull off an unreliable narrator so seamlessly   even Gogol didn t manage the same level of humor in dark obsession  And it s rare that I read a book these days that requires me to fill in the blanks to determine the events of the story from a more objective view  And it s been a while since I ve come across a book so full of wordplay Reading it is a unique emotional experience  running a strange gamut between delight from the language and horror from the situation  i wanted to read this book because i wanted to understand why with such a controversial subject  this book is still considered a classic  a romantic one at that  the book is beautifully written and it has a way of manipulating your feelings toward the main character to the point where you don t realize it  but you don t hare him  and because i didn t hate him i felt dirty  i felt like i should put the book down and call the police on this pedophile  yet i continued reading because i wanted to know what happened  it was so weird  thoughit qas a good book  i m glad i finished it and he s out of my life    Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the

no questions asked  People look down on me for saying that  but I don t care Recommended to every breathing person who has a literary interest  I m not saying everyone will love this  but what I mean

masterpiece  Oh mischievous Humbert    Oh innocent to the eyes of the cunning reader Lolita    You will never get out of my mind   And the rest is rust and stardust The review  Well  in my opinion  it is easier  at least for me  to review Lolita than to review Pale Fire  Perhaps Pale Fire is a more complex book  Although  I liked them equally  And both went straight to my list of favourite books of all time  I think I could read Nabokov for the rest of my life  and never be bored   First thing I would like to recommend to all the readers of my review  which might be the exact number of two  is that  I think  you should read some Edgar Allan Poe before reading Lolita  Mainly Annabel Lee and the Raven  the former being mandatory  the latter being optional  and I recommend the reading of it just because of a reference Humbert Humbert makes  There are thousands of references to the written word of the poem itself  but also to the tragic story the poem tells  Even at the first chapter we get a reference  There s a character  who is really important to the novel  whose name is Annabel Lee  I will not even bother to tell the story to you  So  obviously  the writing is astounding  Is lyrical with a purpose  Humbert wants to blind the reader by flourishing the prose  when the reality is he raped a young girl  Repeatedly  There s nothing romantic about that  He s an unreliable narrator  as  the reader learns  Lolita or the Confessions of a White Widowed Man was written while Humbert was waiting for trial for murder  Maybe this book would bring sympathy for the ones who read it  even though this book was supposed to be published after Humbert and Lolita s death  we don t know if Humbert would allow this book to be read at court  Probably it would   The characters are obviously fantastic   But the most important thing is that it is interesting  Nabokov nailed at describing the mind of someone that is a psychopath and crazy  He romanticizes pedophilia  And so the reader will not be able to get his eyes out of the words  The psychiatric description and evaluation Nabokov makes and fills with irony of a deranged and delusional mind is not present in the written word  but in between the words  We feel there s Humbert  but in Humbert s confession we also can read Nabokov saying   This guy he s loads of fun    He s fucking crazy    which is even more present in Pale Fire  my first Nabokov book   Irony and black humour enrich the novel to such an absurdity that makes it a masterpiece  Being pumped with action  it is an experience that I can only describe as delightful  though it is about pedophilia   and I consider one of the best books of the century  This book blows my little  insignificant mind into millions of tiny  insignificant pieces  Nabokov is the most talented writer I ve ever read  And if I m not mistaken  English isn t his first language  It s like his third  I could be wrong about that I m reviewing this a little over a year after having read it  And yeah  I ll be honest  I still think about this book all the time  It s that amazing  I thought it to be one of those books that everyone should read  In other words  I d heard good stuff about Lolita  but knew nothing of the writer or the story itself  As I am wont to do  I started reading in my typically lazy fashion   that is  skipping the foreword and jumping straight to Nabokov s writing  The first thing that struck me was that every sentence  perhaps even every word  had been measured to suit the purpose of each chapter  Nothing is wasted in this book and for that reason it is really gripping  To get a real sense of the English language from a writer who was Russian  only moving to West to teach literature at an American university  is something quite special  To clarify  this is no translation   while this means that it is unusually inventive  as Nabokov plays with his second language  turning ordinary  even dull  words and phrases into poetic prose  it still retains the lucidity of any great English speaking writer  who is writing for English speaking people   In fact  he probably demonstrates more than most other writers how flexible and robust language is  For that reason  Lolita is a joy to read  an inspiration and I ve since gone back to both fore and afterwords  which I would also recommend reading if you ve got the time    Sad  twisted  enthralling  and beautifully written  My preconception was  a story about a pedophile   But after continuing to see it on  Best Of  lists I was finally curious enough to literally pick it up at a bookstore and inspect it  I was sold after the first paragraph  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Love or hate the book  but you cannot argue that the prose and its rhythm are fantastic  It is the kind of writing that reminds me how terrible a writer I am  And it is not just  a story about a pedophile   in case you were wondering  It is an inspection of the human need for connection  a dissection of portions of the male psyche  a glimpse into someone s self destruction  and a case study on how tragically flawed people can end up together  Pathologically interesting  If you can put aside your revulsion at the pedophilia  this becomes a really engrossing and powerful book  Nabokov s language is completely masterful and it had to have taken a huge amount of talent to enter into the mind of a pervent when Nabokov himself wasn t one  Coruscating  ebullient  hyperfelicit  proseperfect  silky gin soaked lightning  any superlatives affixable to Lolita are inextricably apt  and it towers  this monolith of genius  as one of the greatest renderings of English the world hath hitherto seen  or will ever see  perhaps the best  brim with guffaw and depravity  narcissism and tenderness  beauty and terror  Three cheers for Humbert  the glorious bastard      with a squeeze of pineapple  if you please  Creepy and intriguing  oddly enough I loved this book Nabokov s writing is beautiful   62 d bwstr lfylm ll  t ml fy sn  lm wHd zy

you  That d be impossible  This  more than a novel  is an achievement of the human race  like penicillin  or the first man on the moon  My initial interest in this book started a couple of years ago when I read Reading Lolita in Tehran  However  after looking up the synopsis and hearing about controversy surrounding the subject matter  I decided I would not read it  Then  I read posts from many readers on Shelfari that I have grown to respect and decided to give it a try  I m glad I did  While the subject matter is distrubing  Nabokov does a brilliant job of taking the reader inside the mind of a pedophile  My fear  based on things I ve  heard   that it bordered on pornogrpy was unfounded  What Nabokov does do is incorporate all of the  excuses   deceit  tactics  and  justifications  that are still used fifty years after publication for such actions   In the opening chapters  Humbert relates his first romance and how deeply affected he was by her death  He supposes that this is the genesis of his desire for  nymphets   We then follow Humbert on his journey through life as he fantasizes about young girls  tries to assuage these impulses with prostitutes  makes an attempt at  nomal life  through marriage  and ultimately follows through with satisfying his fantasies with  Lolita  for two years   Nabokov s writing is brilliant  As I read this book I wondered if some of the outrage over the book came from a suspicion over Nabakov s intimate knowledge of the mind of a pedophile  He certainly does not shy away from detailed accounts of what one thinks as he looks at a young girl and seems to know it well  I think that leap is short sighted  Adding to the breadth of Nabokov s style  I have to admit that for such a serious subject there is a great deal of humor through situations  attitudes  and wordplay  Maybe this is a necessary devise to keep the reader from being completely disgusted  but Nabokov uses it appropriately   For anyone out there on the fence about reading this  I highly recommend it   Got to admit I didnt read this  per se  I had Jeremy Irons read it to me  and i wouldn t do it any other way  Do yourself a favor and get the audiobook  Sure you gotta hate Humbert Humbert for all his sick  twisted  pedophilia  but you cant help but love him for all his wry humor and sophisticated pretentions  That pervo sure can turn a phrase  My favorite part is whe he has to prevent his girl friend from playing Russian Roulet with his side arm  being that she won t have a very successful game with any gun that isn t a revolver  Muito bem escrito  Mostra muito bem o caracter manipulador e apologetico do pedofilo  mostra a forma como ele procura desculpar se e como se ve sempre de forma benigna  E como esse raciocinio que sexualiza a crianca  ve nos comportamentos em que a crianca se procura mostrar como significante e imitar os adultos uma carta branca para avancar sexualmente  O livro e brilhante  literariamente  esta muito bem escrito  E conseguiu tocar num ponto muito sensivel  culturalmente  Mas muito importante  Em quase todas as culturas  a iniciacao sexual e sancionada  Ha uma idade em que se considera haver a passagem para a idade adulta  E geralmente isso e acompanhado da iniciacao sexual  O que agora consideramos de pedofilia e precisamente o comportamento de adultos que procuram criancas  Seres humanos que ainda nao chegaram a limiar de idade que socialmente e considerado razoavel  Que ainda nao tem a maturidade necessaria para a vida sexual  Muito menos com adultos  E consideramo los pedofilos precisamente porque  clinicamente  o que eles parecem procurar e essa imaturidade  Isso e perturbador  Houve em varios periodos da historia  adultos que se viam como encarregados de iniciar adolescentes imberbes  E ainda existe  um pouco por toda a nossa cultura  um elogio da inocencia sexual  Por contraste com  saber se demais   Mas isso  ainda assim  esta muito longe da pedofilia  O que a personagem principal  o narrador deste livro  parece fazer  e tentar ver se como uma especie de tutor da sexualidade daquela crianca  Ele sera o feliz contemplado que podera receber  ao mesmo tempo  a inocencia dela  e alguma paradoxal perversao  Ele ve naquela crianca de 12 anos alguns comportamentos sexuais  Ao ver que ela usa maquilhagem e imita a mae e tem alguns comportamentos coquetes  interpreta aquilo como indicios de perversao sexual  de desejo  de algo proprio de alguem mais velho  de uma anomalia  Algo que nao seria proprio de uma crianca  Sexualiza aquela crianca  com o seu desejo de adulto  Em vez de ver como normal que uma crianca  ao aproximar se da pre adolescencia  e tendo como modelos os adultos a sua volta  os imite  e queira comecar a experimentar ver que efeito tem aqueles comportamentos que ve os adultos ter  O pedofilo ve os comportamentos da crianca como consequentes e dirigidos a ele e ao seu desejo  E usa os para se desculpar  Foi publicado em 1955  numa altura em que se casava mais cedo  em que a percepcao em relacao a pedofilia era menor  Em que era mais dificil para as mulheres falarem dos seus problemas e muito mais dificil falar sobre o que acontecia dentro de portas  dentro das familias  E e  continua a ser  um livro fundamental  Mostra o funcionamento da cabeca de um adulto que acredita que desejar uma crianca de 12 anos faz sentido  ou que  tendo conflitos em relacao a essa ideia  encontra forma de a racionalizar  para poder continuar a relacao com essa crianca  Como ate decadas recentes  na nossa cultura  havia casamentos com criancas de 12 14 anos  o alcance deste livro e maior ainda do que parece   What can I say about this book  In the begining  it had the power to scandalize me like no other book had  Here I thought I could not be scandalize  that what I can read in paper  from fiction   no matter how far from my beliefs and my sense of good and bad   would never have the effect on me as if I were staring at it  How many of us enjoy a good black novel  gory and violent and yet shriek and turn the other way when confronted by violent death in the news  And yet Nabokov brought this novel  this story so incredibly close  I gagged on it I had to literally force myself through the initial shock  keep on reading  until I started to find the frays  and as the character fell apart  goodness  it was a work of art  It had been knit together with such artistry  I simply stood in awe  Nabokov surely brings you back those rich strands of writing that had made Russian classics so rich  I suppose so much has been written about Lolita that there s not really anything I could add to it  Let me just say  then  that I enjoyed it thoroughly  Nabokov was a master of the English language  probably because he was learning it as a second language and was therefore able to better appreciate it s nuances and boldness  It s a novel  yes  but the amount of care that he put into every line makes it a work of art   I thought this book was really really great  A little disturbing though often surprisingly funny  I had so many hightlighted tabs in this book when reading as there were so many fantastic quotes   beautiful prose  I have never read something as funny as  scepter of my passion  before  Whilst he was talking about vile things I nonetheless loved the idea of  winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup  and thus  my little cup brims with tiddles   Nabokov has quite the way with language  with which I was impressed throughout  It is quite alarming how despite your common sense you get sucked in a little with Humbert Humbert into believing that somehow Lolita was not exactly innocent in all of this and that in a small way she seduced him and manipulated him for every penny she could get before doing a runner  However  as the novel winds up and at times  becomes a little jumbled   nonsensical  you sense his mind unravelling completely I think this is reflected well in how confused the ramblings are  More and more he reveals that he knew exactly what he was doing and that he is nothing other than a vile predator  A book I have heard so much but never could muster the energy to pick as already knew so much about it but boy O  boy was  bout to be blown A meditation on Desire  Obsession  Madness  Manipulation  devotion and how the lines between those things can be blurred Mind Blowing  I gave it five starts for its exceptional writing and style  It s beautiful and Nabokov iron grips onto your attention  holding you curiosity and demanding you to try to read below the face value  The story itself is unusual and for that I would tip my hat  How far did I connect and fall in love with the characters  Not much  Friends who have read this book told me that at the end I was bound to sympathize with Humbert  But I found that hard having witnessed the thinking of Humbert Humbert  It s not just his pedophile nature that had me on the opposite team  but also the sort of  love  he says he has for Lolita  That is a disturbed  overly possessive  and twisted sort of love  There is a part where he fantasizes marrying Lolita so he could have her daughter and maybe granddaughter for by that time Lolita would cease to be a nymph  Or the other part where he takes her along with him to watch school girls exist the school and makes Lolita touch him as he watches them  Such things throw a different light on the character and I lost any sympathy I might have had for him  As for Lolita  many believe she seduced Humbert  But we are talking about a 12 year old who is just discovering her sexuality  It is not very surprising how far she let Humbert go  especially when he began to use her fear to entrap her and earn her silence  Placing us in the role of the jury  Nabokov is asking us to process every word with care and that is what makes the book so immense  Lolita stayed with me for a long time  and I spent much time forming opinions   Here s a little book about a paedophile and you re going to love it Granted  you might hate yourself at times  Those sneaky little tugs of sympathy or  god help me  eroticism that have you almost  just almost   on his side   At least early on anyway  As Humbert fully objectifies his little nymphet  we as readers  conspirators   can easily lose touch with reality  lost in the romance and poetry  letting Humbert s intellectualizing lull us into compliance  But never fear  after a certain point  Humbert gets lax and lets slip comments about poor Lolita that are utterly horrifying when you start to realize what she is really going through  No one reads the book thinking  What he is doing is OK  but the little moments you get sucked in   well those microseconds of empathy for Humbert really have you question your moral leanings The novel is beautiful  but like a bruise can be beautiful if you remove all context and just look at the swirling colors  That s part of the genius of the work  Nabokov took one of the biggest taboos  a despicable  heartwrenching one at that  and made something beautiful  But he also doesn t let the reader off the hook  You pay for the beauty with your discomfort and self doubt  I love when a book has this kind of power over a reader  as if Nabokov is our Humbert  leading us astray and then admonishing us for our response Call me Lolita  Perhaps the best novel of all time In his post novel comments  Nabakov gives more clues on the novel  admitting that the forward by the fictional John Ray steals some of his credibility when discussing the novel from a distance  But he does tell us  I am neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction  and despite John Ray s assertion  Lolita has no moral in tow  He tells us the  secret points  the subliminal coordinates by which the book is plotted  although I realize very clearly that these and other scenes will be skimmed over or not noticed    He finishes the novel on a high note  expressing the truth  only art endures  if it isn t written down it didn t happen  I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita  Throughout this brilliant  perfect  lyrical novel  Nabakov alternates between lies  fantasies  funny stories and fabrications  But he does sometimes admit the truth  such as when he bluntly says  Oh  my Lolita  I have only words to play with   This book is completely and utterly captivating  Despite the blatantly obvious language devices Nabokov employs to portray his passion and infatuation with the sweet  brittle Lolita the reader though consciously aware of how perverse and immoral Humbert s desires are can completely understand and even justify the pedophiles actions  The book makes you think about your own perception and perspective to what is classified taboo as well as throwing the reader into a story of vice fueled passion  The book is not for the closed minded but for those who are willing to open their mindset and embrace a story which is pure evil  as it makes a sin seem ever so sweet  I have to say that I have never hated a main character so much in my life  H H  did not get what was coming to him  and I spent every moment of reading hoping for his painful and torturous death  Still  this is one of the most powerful pieces of literature that I have read  and I insist on making other people read it  It picks you up  and it makes you feel dirty  and it honestly disappoints me toward the end  but I wouldn t change a thing  The story would not be nearly as powerful if it had the ending I wanted it to  and despite cringing at every touch and every piece of dialogue  I reread it several times   I looked and looked at her  and I knew  as clearly as I know that I will die  that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth  She was only the dead leaf echo of the nymphet from long ago   but I loved her  this Lolita  pale and polluted and big with another man s child  She could fade and wither   I didn t care  I would still go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of her face   Possibly the greatest literary experience I ve ever had  Lolita succeeds on essentially every level of storytelling and writing  Nabakov proves himself more of a master of the English language than most native speaking writers  and his fascination with the language comes through in some wholly original turns of phrase  The character of Humbert Humbert is a remarkable fabrication  in multiple senses of the word   a funny  charming  bumbling  terrifying  mad  and finally pathetic human being  As an outsider  his satire of American life is poignant and sometimes hilarious  like much of the rest of the novel  It is as much a journey through American life as  On The Road   viewing it similarly through the lens of an outsider  though this is one perverted lens  I also want to note how challenging a read this was  I m no vocabulary slouch  though am also no maven  but I often had to consult a dictionary a few times per page just to get through it  Still  because of the investment I made in it  it came out to be the most rewarding reading experience I ve ever had  one that I will be sure to revisit multiple times in the future  A masterpiece of masterpieces  This book is excellent on many levels  For starters  Nabokov s prose and mastery of English outstrips most native speaking writers  Secondly  the book is inscrutably plotted and moves at a great pace through its traumatic events  Finally  and I think most importantly  the book does a great job of fucking with the reader s head  While on one hand you want to hate Humbert for being essentially a child raping sociopath  on the other  the book is at its heart a love story  and sometimes a heartwrenching one  Nabokov is a master at playing with your expectations  and in the end  I think the book is far from the cut and dried indictment of the narrator that most people probably want it to be  I don t know how to put my feelings into words  all I can say that this literarure tells a romantic love story yet sin but brilliant  Lolita is the masterpiece of an iconoclastic mind   rwy  ry    jd lm tkn km qyl ly  nh  bl ks wjdth t lj mwDw  lTlm Sdfnh fy lwq  wbkthr   yD Ht  fy zmnn hdh rGm Srm  lqwnyn lwD y   km  nn njd fy l

think you know what to expect with this book because the story of Lolita is now part of our popular culture but what I didn t expect was the fantastic writing  This book is a classic because of how it s written and I think the story is secondary  Not to mention that this book was written in English by a native Russian  Well  this book is narrated by a degraded pervert  If that sounds like it might bother you  don t read it But if you can put this in the context of fiction  a medium which ought to embrace  all  human experience  not just the parts that sate us or make us comfortable  then this book might stun you It is so funny  poetic  clever  loathsome  sad  and    beautiful  Chapter 32 of Part Two  where our narrator Humbert Humbert belatedly takes the time to reflect on his relationship with  the light of his life   Lolita  is one of the most poignant passages I ve ever come across One of those books you wish you d written  but know you never will  Now  this is going to be embarrassing to admit As we all should know  reading and enjoying a book is largely about interpretation  People are not the same and we all view things differently  one individual might see a relationship in a book as  passionate  while another could see it as  damaging   When characters make bad decisions  some will view it as stupidity and others will view it as an accurate representation of humanity s imperfections  Not only that  but time often changes the way one person sees things  A teenager does not usually have the same outlook on life and relationships that someone of thirty does  and neither of them have the same outlook as someone of seventy does So it s time that I admit  when reading this at thirteen  my younger brain actually romanticised Humbert s depravity and saw the relationship between him and Lolita as some tragic love affair that could never work out for the obvious reasons  It was  surprise  surprise  Tatiana s review that made me wonder if I d had a screw loose when reading this years ago  her interpretation was so far from what I remembered that I simply had to find time for a re read  This summer  I did just that  I am going to point my shameful finger of blame at my age when I first read it  I was as fooled by Humbert as the young Lolita was Humbert is not a reliable narrator  his declaration that Lolita was responsible for seducing him is repulsive and wrong  Because  in the end  an adult has no excuse for having sex with a child  even if they re walking around half naked and offering it up   adults have a responsibility not to take advantage of children  and I now realise how this case is no exception  This is not some tragic romantic tale about forbidden love  it is the story of how a grown man repeatedly raped a young girl  The fact that it is so easy to be taken in by him either says something about how brilliant a writer Nabokov is  which he is   or how much society still loves to blame the victim I don t know whether to feel better about my original feelings or be horrified that even the description for the audiobook describes the novel as   a love story almost shocking in its beauty and tenderness   And I also know that I have no right to criticise other people who saw it in such a way  but I would ask you to read it again  to look beyond Humbert s snivelling and self pity  to see the man who considers murdering a woman so he can be free to have sex with her twelve year old daughter  the man who feels sorry for himself when a young girl doesn t want to have sex with him because she s still hurt from the last time  Is that love  Maybe it was for a thirteen year old looking through Humbert s perverted eyes  but I m glad I understand it better now Nabokov has written a brilliant and disturbing novel  my opinion of it hasn t changed in that respect  I found it surprisingly easy to read and became absorbed quickly   even all those years ago  His portrayal of Humbert s perverted mind is scarily good  perhaps even too good if people can so easily be convinced to side with a paedophile   which is often regarded as the ultimate crime of all  isn t it  Even cold blooded murderers go after prisoners who ve messed with kids  And  as much as I feel ashamed for being so taken in by Humbert  I know that it s not just me who was fooled  Hell  even the GR description proves it  But  believe me  Lolita is a victim and no amount of saddening flashbacks to Humbert s past can change that  Blog   Leafmarks   Facebook   Twitter   Instagram   Tumblr Nabokov is another one of my gods haha  This is one of my all time favorite classics  This book is so gorgeously written  I actually really liked Humbert despite his brutish and disgusting actions  The twist at the end is also quite unexpected but after I got to that point I said to myself  Ah  I should have guessed   But this book is really a hilareous  tragic  yet incredible classic  An absolute MUST READ  I believe this is the greatest work of literature in the English language I have ever read   Not that I ve read any in any other language   Once past the grimy veneer of  still ingenious  plot  Nabokov sends his seductive tendrils of words out to ensnare you until pretty soon you don t care what the subject matter is  you are simply turning the pages  fast at first  then slower and slower  spellbound by the author s subtle  complex skill to draw you in and hold you there  like one of his famous butterflies pinned to the board  I believe that even those who say the book succeeds because it engenders empathy for Humbert  that makes us somehow complicit in his depravities are still too close to the surface  I read and reread this novel to allow Nabokov to treat me like a rag doll  flinging me up heights of descriptive bliss and down again to weep at the depravity of a monster and the destroyed life of a little girl  This is an astounding piece of fiction  not to be missed  After reading the small prologue of a first chapter  I knew I loved the way Nabokov wrote  He has a way of taking morbid  messed up topics  and making them flow as effortlessly as poetry  In fact  the whole concept of the book is quite messed up  Humbert is an older man  23 years Lolita s senior  but suffers from an agonizing love for the child  In fact  he likes to look at lots of different  girl children   Going into the book  I knew the whole plot was revolting  but I couldn t put the book down  The way Nabokov creates his characters makes them feel so real  so human  By the end I found myself sympathizing with Humbert  even though I knew this is the morally wrong choice  The characters aren t perfection  they have flaws  which make them so much more intriguing  I can t even explain how much I believe Nabokov did a fantastic job of this  By the end of the book  you just have to re evaluate everything  Leaves you with lots of thoughts I also should point out that  even though I found myself feeling for Humbert  in no way do I think his actions were justified or correct  Another example of how Nabokov gets you This book is definitely an experience  Not for the faint of heart  But the ending really is satisfying  You just have to read it My thoughts are still pleasantly jumbled   Poetico  perturbador  perfeito  Mas chega de falar sobre mim  o livro e excelente  1  Natalie Portman in the

a dark story in a gorgeous way  I could never put into words how I feel about this book  Other than  holy shit   This is what I d like to find in reading 1  Shocks  Surprises  Not the kind of surprise that a bloody body causes in me   Are we kidding  Of course  a corpse would shock me  We are wired that way  That type of shock has little to do with the book s plot prose  however   I want to be surprised by a new way of seeing things  Destroy me  and I will rebuild myself from there  all refreshed  2   Close second  Companionship  I d like to find a friend in the book  If he or she can put in words what I ve been feeling but haven t expressed yet  even better  If this is done with a great sense of humor  yet another point  One of the two is already excellent  What I dislike  by the way  is the opposite of these  that is  smug philosophy and lukewarm proximity disguised as companionship  And let me tell you  Nabokov is a genius  Definitely satisfies  1 above  and I also like HH s voice   Nabokov might be too smart  actually  Too much brain game  which can interfere emotional connection   I had heard that this book was about pedophiliac love  although it seems the definition of pedophilia is attraction to children age 11 or under  and Dolores was 12   so one of my interest in reading was  How did it happen from the girl s perspective  Was she forced to have sex  And the answer is no  In fact  the initial intention of Hum Hum was not about to hump hump Lolita  But that doesn t matter  does it  She was a minor  Until she is of a certain age  the actual legal age differs from state to state   she is not supposed to be capable of making her decision and consenting or dissenting  Never mind many minors have sex with their peers before that magic birthday  Adult and minor means no no  right right  One of the things that crossed my mind reading this was a novel Naomi  written by a Japanese author Tanizaki  even though Naomi is a tad older   Here is my review  which is a quick intro  If you don t mind spoilers  here is Jeffrey s more extensive review    he saw the similarity  too   Naomi was published before Lolita  as Nabokov repeats in his novel  this kind of relationship has been far from rare in many cultures  Would you like a few more examples  St  Augustine fell for a 10 yo girl  Yes  that Augustine  whose Confessions all Catholics are expected to read   He had to wait for two years because the legal age in Ancient Rome was 12  And by that time  Augustine had a change of mind   Japan s Emperor Taisho  current emperor s grandfather  married his empress in 1900 when she was 15    one of many such marriages  History shows that  both in the East and the West  there was a time when  if a woman doesn t get married by early 20s  that was considered more as a problem  The grooms were typically much older because men were expected to have means to support the family  Just historical fact    I am not advocating early marriages or sexual activities  On the contrary  I do believe children under a certain age shouldn t be even viewed as sexual beings    much less touched    because they are not  The question is  at what age do we become sexual  Much younger than some adults would like to think  I totally enjoyed Part I  I dare say it lost some tension in Part II  Part I deserves more than the regular 5 stars  so I m happy to give this 5 star anyway  however   I wonder if Nabokov wrote Part II to ease some readers  feelings       in the way   Hey  it s not only about dirty desires  there is traveling       and then        way  Lo is annoying and manipulative  just like her mother was  and very different from elegant Annabel  Humbert s first love   Humbert is not really interested in her personality  however  She was a nymphet  and she came into his orbit  So is this a love story  Read and decide for yourself  UpdateI found this interview with Nabokov  From that article  No  it is not my sense of the immorality of the Humbert Humbert Lolita relationship that is strong  it is Humbert s sense  He cares  I do not  I do not give a damn for public morals  in America or elsewhere  And  anyway  cases of men in their forties marrying girls in their teens or early twenties have no bearing on Lolita whatever  Humbert was fond of  little girls   not simply  young girls   Nymphets are girl children  not starlets and  sex kittens   Lolita was twelve  not eighteen  when Humbert met her  You may remember that by the time she is fourteen  he refers to her as his  aging mistress   15 10 So beguiled by the perfume of its composition  you unwillingly stumble into a complicity with the unctuous Humbert Humbert  sympathetic and at intervals abetting   this all in spite of such glaring  organic antipathy  Nobakov  with his erudite command of the English language  has fleshed out a truly immense work  flush with revelation  Fantastic for a raucous debate  I really didn t like it a first  it got under my skin often  and for good reason  it s dirrrty  But    the prose  My god the prose  The prose is in a world all it s own  Those pretty pretty complex words that confuse and entice and never let up  Never  not once  Nabokov can write  Lolita is two parts highbrow literature  too one part lurid pulp trash  Or is it the other way around   It gracefully dances back and forth between a subtle but savage satire on high and low art  American vs European attitudes  the travel industry    and least we forget at it s creepy core  Humbert Humbert s story  in his own words  about his undying love conquest of nymphet Lolita   Finish this book in a week and a half  I could not get my eyes off of it  Humbert Humbert may seem like some creepy old perv to youBut I saw him as a poet  After all that turmoil and pain he went through after losing her  I felt bad for him  But when he wrote those last few paragraphs saying that he hopes she lives well and happy  touched me very very deeplyWhen he said  I hope it s a boy  in that paragraph  you know he meant that he would not want another little girl to be victim of a man like him  Blissful bookA touching lovely bookA story that will shock you  yet you ll be attached   Through the difficulties I had reading this book to its end  and the endless French and Latin words I had to jot down and find meanings of  and the vast valleys upon valleys of descriptions  I found Nabokov s Lolita to be a heart wrenching tale of love  lust  desperation  despair  and above all  human nature  What an absolutely brilliant way to narrate a disturbing  perverted  paedophilic to be proper  tale of destruction  A disgustingly desperate Humbert Humbert reminiscing the love of his life and his downfall  While this book made my skin squirm in parts it is not as racy as I thought it would be when I started reading it  A wry Nabokov took a taboo topic  threw in a very flawed but self deprecating protagonist with a lonely and scared 12 year old girl and based it in the great country of America  The result is a very real  sad and even comical story  I m surprised at how much I loved this book  The subject matter is complex and yes  the main character is a pedophile but thanks to Nabokov s masterful language play I got sucked in to the narrative and began to somewhat acknowledge Humbert Humbert s obsessive  love  for his Lolita  Of course  I don t condone his actions but you can t finish the book without pitying sympathizing with him while also taking into the account the destruction caused by his unusual sexual preferences I also recommend the annotated edition  I confess that without it I wouldn t have understood many of the puns  and historical and literary references weaved into the text   Controversial topic but undeniably great writing  Was surprised at how humorous witty it was  I was more tempted to give this one a four  on account of the effort taken to overcome my revulsion for the novel s central character  HH is more of a monster and less of a hero than Shelley s creation  Against much resistance however  I have fived it  Nabokov  the master  always finds the right colours in his language paintbox for every dark shade in his portrait of Humbert  a character with a crazed obsession to seduce   even his readers  I am absolutely in love with Nabokov s writing style  From the first lines   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul   to the last line  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita   Nabokov keeps readers in a trance like state  sympathizing for poor Humbert  Nabokov is able to manipulate readers through Humbert in a way only he knows how  This controversial novel was written in a more conservative time  making it all the more forbidden While my French is very basic  I was able to catch bits and pieces of phrases and it becomes evident that the French passages are needed  for it is at the very core of who Humbert is I recommend this to any mature adult who wants to read something truly amazing   Is it possible to do a review of this book without sounding like a total pervert I think the blurb on the cover I remember  working at a library I put it away at least a dozen times  was from Vanity Fair stating it was  The only convincing love story of our time Wow I m not sure if I can add anything to that  again  without having to register as a sex offender  I ve read this book twice  The first time I swiped it from my Dad s study he had a list of books that were must reads this was on a high shelf which typically implied   when you re old enough to understand it   Well  that was salacious enough to scale up there and abscond what promised to be very naughty to my 11 year old boy brain  The other reason was yes  I was pretentious enough at 11 going on 12 to want to know exactly what the line in The Police song  Don t Stand So Close To Me  meant  The line at the end of the third verse Loose talk in the classroomTo hurt they try and tryStrong words in the staffroomThe accusations flyIts no use  he sees herHe starts to shake and coughJust like the old man inThat book by NabokovAh HA  Sting was a dirty old man schoolteacher with impure thoughts that were implied to be reciprocal of the schoolgirl in question  Just like James Mason in the original Stanley Kubrick film version of Lolita  Clearly controversial subject matter in its day  Nabokov s style has an extremely contemporary  innovative feel to it  When I went back and reread the book years later  it was all the humor and sardonic observations on American culture that had gone completely over my head    not the taboo sexuality    please  that was tame by late 20th Century mores  I also appreciate the place it has in pop culture by coining the phrase   Lolita   to describe a highly sexualized adolescent girl  Allusions to this work appear everywhere   from the movie  American Beauty  to the fact that any Disney manufactured girl pop star can thank the Nabokovs of the world for catapulting them to stardom  I give you Britney Spears as the ultimate example   This book has been hailed one of the greatest love stories  For many that is hard to digest because of the content matter  Nabokov has a fantastic talent with the English language in which he can write beautiful passages or play you as a fool and it is in that which you will find the greatest love  The storyline itself provokes many different feelings from many different people  Nabokov abruptly and appallingly opened Lolita with actions that created a virtual rift in my mind  On one side  the literary skill of Nabokov created images that came alive through description  satire  and truly great writing  The story he tells  however  struck out against a deep moral conviction that children should be protected from harm at all costs  It is through this rift  this somewhat dazed state of being  that Nabokov managed to work his way into who I am It s been said that all humans have an inner duplicity that gives us the power to accomplish great deeds of good while quietly contemplating great evils that are safely lock away  forgotten  and disposed of upon death  From within this bundle of thought and feeling  Nabokov managed to guide me through an experience that was independent of reality  He pulled on feelings and provoked thoughts in ways that allowed me to experience the story as he intended and in doing so  guided me through a literary work of art In Nabokov s Afterword  he indicated that he found Lolita to be a delightful presence now that it quietly hangs about the house   like a summer day which one knows to be bright behind the haze  I feel the same way  I just happened to be watching TV when the film came on  Amazingly enough  I had never seen it  After enjoying it thoroughly  I decided to read the novel  which I had also never done  And  like the movie  I enjoyed it thoroughly  There was an unexpected sense of humor  I liked Humbert in spite of his perverse proclivities  I think we all have a bit of pervert in us when it comes to the loveliness of youth  Who isn t drawn to flawless skin devoid of age spots and wrinkles  Who doesn t yearn for taut musculature and appreciate it when we see it  We delight in children because they are children    unlike us adults I read the annotated edition and was amazed at all the obscure references which a non native speaker of English drew upon  Wish I were a tiny bit as well read as Nabokov  This is 5 star book if you can stomach the gruesome subject matter  The language can perfectly be described as disgustingly beautiful  It will raise uncomfortable questions and sympathies in ever surprising ways  All in all it was a very good read  maybe one line was too much  that  tasted of blood  line turned my stomach Dark twisted and beautiful  Proceed if you dare edit  2 weeks later im giving it 5 stars  The book is a riddle filled with references to other books and paedophilic systems in hollywood and in life in general  For this reason i must increase the rating  It is difficult  but if the implications in the book are true  incredibly necessary  Terribile  Scandaloso  Bellissimo L intento diabolico di Humbert Humbert e perseguito con meticolosa operosita  con attenzione maniacale alle parole alle minacce all espressione dei sentimenti che poi sfuggono al suo controllo  Al controllo di un uomo cosi debole Lettore  Anche tu mostri la tua debolezza  La grande  colossale scrittura di Nabokov e la piccola Lolita  La seduzione dell arte e l accesso fisiologico  L erotismo che sopravvive alle remore morali  La naturale avversione verso la pedofilia minacciata da un incombente pericolosa immedesimazione     ai nostri giorni il termine   pornografia   suggerisce subito l idea della mediocrita  del lucro e di certe ferree regole narrative  L oscenita deve accoppiarsi con la banalita  perche qualsiasi genere di godimento estetico dev essere interamente sostituito dal semplice stimolo sessuale    Per me un opera di narrativa esiste solo se mi procura quella che chiamero francamente volutta estetica  cioe il senso di essere in contatto  in qualche modo  in qualche luogo  con altri stati dell essere dove l arte  curiosita  tenerezza  bonta  estasi  e la norma  so much more than a book about a pedophile  heartbreaking and very funny  slow in a couple places  but that was my fault  not nabokov s  in other words  i think it felt slow here and there because it was so consistently smart  your brain has to be working all the time  and every now and again you pick it up and see that there s a two page paragraph waiting for you and you want to take a break  but if you just go ahead and read it  it isn t actually slow at all  This tragic comedy  written by Nabokov and published in 1955  is famous for its controversial and disturbing subject matter as well as the innovative style Nabokov used to describe the protagonist s pedophilic obsession with young girls that he terms  nymphets   Although Nabokov may not have been the first to employ the  unreliable narrator   Lolita is often considered the origin of this concept  Lolita is hailed by many as a prime example of 20th century literature and is listed in the TIME 100 Best English Language Novels from 1923 2005  2nd reading  It s the late 1940s  in the fictional northeastern American town of Ramsdale  when a mentally unstable Swiss pedophile  Humbert Humbert  sets his sexual sights on twelve year old Dolores Haze  He marries her mother  who conveniently dies in a road accident  then  as Lolita s  father   sets out on a cross country road trip sexual spree during which he corrupts her utterly  The writing is extraordinary  There s nothing else like Lolita  The prose often works along a knife edge between creepy paean    to Lolita s beauty  to HH s cleverness  to the magnificence of his sexual idyll  etc     and its own verbal brilliance  That s a large part of the achievement here  to write with extraordinary precision and beauty about a rebarbative subject  How often are we on the cusp of closing the book and at just that moment find ourselves drawn back in by the writing  Do read it  if you haven t already  or re read it  Martin Amis  who supplies the introduction to this edition  says he s read it eight times  and that each time new levels of meaning open up  VN himself  somewhere  I think it was in an interview reprinted in Strong Opinions  spoke of coming across his father s copy of Madame Bovary and finding a note inside   the unsurpassed pearl     That s my assessment of Lolita  Top 5 books of all time  Pure poetry  only 1 mans point of view  il ne merite pas tout ce bruit     Lolita is sublime and surreal and Vladimir Nabokov is the master  You won t read much like this because there isn t anything else like this  except Pale Fire   ImranFull review here http   imranlorgat com 2014 04 19 lol    Yes  the subject matter is unsettling and even disturbing  but what a beautifully written and powerful book  I can see why it was controversial when first published  and continues to be today  Also  I can t believe Nabokov wasn t a native English speaker considering just how well he writes in English  I listened to the audiobook version with Jeremy Irons reading  he is spectacular  easily one of the best audiobook narrators I ve ever heard  A must read for any student of literature   It s kind of hard for me to review this book  When I was reading it I found I had to force myself through it  a lot of it seeming a bit dry and hard to understand where it was going  It was only when I put it away that parts of kept coming back to me and wouldn t leave me alone  What really got me about this book is the language used and how the words work together  along with the many references to other writers  This is a book I look forward to rereading sometime in the future  once my horizons have expanded just a little bit more   just probably not anytime soon  Humbert Humbert  hams humorously   It is not often that you read a book about a person with horrid tendencies and appaling appetites  and the language of the book still forces you to admire the musings of a character  Lolita  is absolutely such a book It is a tale of perversion as much as it is a journey described through perfect prose Rarely can it be said of a book that every word  Every  Single  Word   contained therein  is poetry  Nabokov s prose is like butter  Though he is a soi disant American Writer  only a non American could tackle taboo in such a headlong manner  For bonus points  he casually stomps in the garden of American prudishness  every step of the way  Rating this five stars is a cruel understatement  ETA  I read this book in 2012  I keep thinking about how much I enjoyed it  I have changed the rating to five stars because I feel it deserves the highest rating possible  I was too chicken to give it five before                                   I am going to tell you what I wish I had been told before reading this book  This is a memoir told from the first person point of view  I guess we all know that this book is about a pedophile  about incest  Yes it is  but it is extremely well written  And for this reason  due to this author s talent  it is often very funny and thought provoking  It is not just about incest  It is also about love and teenage kids and anger and craziness too  Humbert writes this memoir to figure out who he is and what has happened   It is a search for truth  He admits his own faults and nastiness  It was to be published not only after his own death  but that of Lolita s too  For clarification  Lolita  Lola  Dolores or Dolores on the dotted line  they are all the same person  I love that  name   Dolores on the dotted line  It is used only once  What does it mean to you  This is NOT a book of eroticism  The writing is at its most sensual when he describes his feelings of love  I thought these words were beautiful  Humbert is twenty four years older than Lolita  his stepdaughter  She is twelve when they first meet  This is not a book that will make you feel uncomfortable from sexually explicit descriptions   Humor is so varied  Here is one example of the kind you will find in this book  Humbert is trying to learn the current whereabouts of a person the dentist  Dr  Quilty  knows  So he inquires about getting a complete set of dentures  He has absolutely no intention of really doing this  He offhandedly also asks where the dentist s nephew is Dr  Quilty perched on the corner of his desk  one foot dreamily and seductively rocking  as he launched on a glorious long range plan  He would first provide me with provisional plates  until the gums settled  Then he would make me a permanent set  He would like to have a look at that mouth of mine  He wore perforated pied shoes       It was a noble dream  His foot rocked  His gaze was inspired  It would cost me around six hundred  He suggested he take measurements right away and make the first set before starting operations  My mouth to him was a splendid cave full of priceless treasures  But I denied him entrance   No   I said   On second thoughts I shall have it all done by Dr  Mulnar  His price is higher  but he  of course  is a much better doctor than you   I do not know if any of my readers will have a chance to say that  It is a delicious dream feeling  I wrote this down from what I heard  so the punctuation and the name spellings could be a bit different  It is in the fifth chapter of five in part two of the audiobook  There is subdued humor throughout the writing  He refers to moths as  derelict snowflakes   A bit further on he is driving I rolled back to town  in that old faithful car of mine  that was serenely  almost cheerfully  working for me And then  later  after something happens which I must hop over to avoid giving spoilers  he is back in his car driving again The road now stretched across open country  and it occurred to me  not by way of protest  not as a symbol or anything like that  but merely as a novel experience  that since I had disregarded all laws of humanity  I might as well disregard the rules of traffic  So I crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling  and the feeling was good  It was a pleasant dyafernal melting with elements of defused tactility always enhanced by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road  In a way it was a very spiritual itch  Gently  dreamily  not exceeding twenty miles an hour  I drove on that queer mirror side  Traffic was light  Cars that now and then passed me on the side I had abandoned to them honked at me brutally  Cars coming toward me wobbled  swerved and cried out in fear  Presently I found myself approaching populated places  Passing through a red light was like a sip of forbidden burgundy when I was a child  No  the above isn t necessarily humorous  but it shows Nabokov s style of writing  In the above you glimpse the craziness of Humbert  Interestingly enough  Humbert looks at himself critically and analytically  You understand what he does since you see the events through his eyes and through his feelings and emotions  Sometimes he behaves insanely  you feel his anger and craziness too  You are under his skin  You almost forget to criticize  And by the way  he isn t always the  bad guy   the one in the wrong  He is in fact just another human being  OK  a human being with abnormal  sick tendencies  but don t jump to conclusions  He in fact loves Lola  Although he is mentally ill  his thoughts will get you thinking too I listened to the audiobook narrated by Jeremy Irons  In this format the book is both well written and magnificently narrated  I believe that Iron s narration makes it easier to understand and enjoy the humor hidden in the author s words  It is amazing when Lolita speaks  Iron s intonation of a teenage girl is sublime                         BEFORE READING  I am listening to this because the narrator  Jeremy Irons  may draw me from the subject matter to the writing  or so I have read  Then I will continue with Vera   a biography about Nabokov s wife  written by Stacy Schiff   The book is brilliant but be careful with this annotated edition as the notes  though detailed and excellent  contain spoilers  Perhaps save this edition for a second read  Sometimes sublime  Sometimes tedious  Nabokov s humor  absurd  sophisticated  always clever  and baronial prose style really won me over  but for god s sake by the annotated version  Looking up french phrases and obscure though charming words really took some of the spank out of this masterpiece for me  Brilliant  Just brilliant   Lolita  What can I add to this timeless piece with my pitiful review  Only the fact that its opalescent prose brought me to tears  Or the fact that its gruesome obsession made me want to turn myself inside out and purge the very idea of such lechery out of my system  now and forever  How may I even begin to phantom to describe what this story is about when the very fabric of its composition borders on divine  I don t know where to begin  Lolita is poetry in prose  Lolita is tenderness wrapped around engorged lust  Lolita is everything and anything and nothing at once  an ethereal creature conjured in the mind of a hopeless romantic caught in the elusive dream of his childhood  Lolita is an exercise in seeing the world of magic in minute details  with disturbing clarity and lewdness  Lolita is the epitome of what true possession means  starting from the heart and continuing to the very marrow of the bones  corrupting one s spirit  The spirit of Humbert Humbert  the squallid monster of a man whose duality will puncture your mind with sharp spikes of impossible horror I would say  Lolita is a story about love  albeit a forbidden love  yet still  it s about love taken to the highs of mania  In this sense  it s perfect  The characters come alive on page  burst from it  pulling you in by the throat and making your heart beat faster  The exquisitely woven descriptions intermingle with smart humor  a parody on consumerism  and general comedy on life  with satire lashing out at every aspect of it  from pitiful marriages  to thinly veiled politeness that means nothing  to a landscape of road trip America with its cheap motels and simple minded people  Above all  it s erotic in a sick yet exquisite kind of way  the kind that makes you want to gag yet at the same time keeps you reading  Because you re unable to stop  Because in its wrongness  Lolita is art  And perhaps thats why is strikes you hard  In the end  when you know that Humbert Humbert is a pervert in the truest sense of this word  he confesses to loving Lolita  and you can t  simply can t  judge a feeling  Oh my god I ve read plenty of novels through the voice of unreliable narrators  but I have never read through the vivid and grotesquely beautiful thoughts of a protagonist quite as reprehensible as Humbert Humbert  There is no question about the revulsion that comes up with this taboo topic discussed within the book   there were times where I had a hand over my mouth so as to not feel sick  Nabakov s prose is so elegant and challenging that the reader is transported to the mindset of any character  regardless of how unrelatable they are  This novel  as discussed within the last chapter  is the definition of the immortality of literature  Lolita s memory lives for decades and the perversion of H H  will creep into the common reader s minds for years to come   Probably my favorite book of all time  No one can touch Nabokov for sheer skill  When I finally read the annotated edition  I realized how many allusions and such I had missed  Hoo boy  Many of the annotations don t add much unless you re already familiar with whatever Nabokov is referencing  but the whole thing is well done and there are some real gems in there  If you re a fan of the novel  definitely try the annotated version  As late as halfway through this book  I really wanted to take a star off the review just for the utter vileness of the subject and the narrator  but its just TOO GOOD  Jeremy Irons  narration is superbly poetic and creepy  to the point where I felt sketchy just standing in line for coffee listening to him  Very beautiful writing on some very ugly things  In the most effortless fashion  Nabokov has painted the most beautiful of landscapes in the form of fiction  I cannot describe how artfully crafted the writing in this novel is while still doing it proper justice  While the plot of the novel is not entirely as masterful  the prose is absolutely astounding  I ve concluded that this story is not about Humbert s love affair with a child  but rather this piece of writing is about Nabokov s love affair with the English language  Definitely one of my favorite works yet  Even if you don t like the plot  any reader can appreciate the language and style rarely done so well in fiction  This book is amazing   Nabokov makes the disgusting beautiful  the beautiful awful  leaves you wondering about yourself and your own beliefs as it is impossible not to feel sympathy for Humbert Humbert  Something we don t get very often   the sex offender shown as a three dimensional person rather than the tabloid cut and paste  Also  a very beautifully written book   One of the most astounding things about this book is that it is the author s first work in English  and yet it stands as one of my favorite books of all time  The writing is as good as Hemingway  and while it is a work of satire  it is the satire of a photographer  Nabakov satires through juxtaposition  not exaggeration  He is a master craftsman The concept of pedophilia is shocking  but this book does not rely on shock value  so it stands up well  even in current times where nothing much shocks  The main character s motives and thoughts are described in a forthright and non judgmental way  Many other books featuring such a dispicable main character create obvious flaws in reasoning to highlight this and make it impossible for the reader to relate  Nabakov forces the reader to understand the character Aside from all that  Nabokov perfectly parodies American culture  and captures a typical road trip in a way few other authors have managed   A must  mesmerizing book   A book that deserves both its reputation as scandalous and its reputation as one of the great American novels of the 20th century  Creepy first person pedophilia narrative  an interesting sense that the first person narrator is making stuff up  especially his dreams   extraordinary wordplay and control of imagery  well observed dialog that fleshes out the characters and their interactions  provocative tweaking of middle class social norms  thoughtful management of the icky father lover problem  excellent motel era road novel elements  and a paranoid pursuit section illustrative of Nabokov s influence on Pynchon  Somewhere after the journaling sections at the beginning  the suspicion you re reading smut is eclipsed by the sharpness of the satire   As a mother  I completely understand why  Lolita  would be challenged often  As a reader  I wish it wasn t  Pedophilia is a touchy subject  but Nabokov s writing is captivating  Humbert  the main character  is a sick and unlikeable man  I suppose that is the reason a lot of readers dislike  Lolita   Of course Nabokov wasn t trying to make you like a pedophile  I recognize that  but It could easily be too much to read  I had to put the book down at times because the story made me a bit queasy  Lolita is the look into pedophilia that no one wants to see or believe exists  Nabokov wrote Humbert and Dolores beautifully  Even though I disliked Humbert  Dolores shocked me on more than a few occassions  I found it alarming how possible the story could be  I can t fathom any other author writing such a lovely book about such an appalling sickness  I m glad this was my first book by Vladimir Nabokov  As I said  he writes beautifully  5 5 I love the way it s written  so I just couldn t stop reading  Of course it s not an easy or small book  and also the subject is not the most common  but I really enjoyed it   Gostei muito desse livro  fiquei presa nele o tempo todo  Lolita e um livro muito longo  Na verdade ele tem menos de 400 paginas  mas digamos que a leitura se arrasta em alguns trechos  tornando o  mais longo ainda   Como alguns sabem Lolita e a historia de Dolores  menina de 12 anos que perde a mae  ficando orfa e tendo que viver com seu padrasto  que abusa dela desde entao  E adivinhem  e ele mesmo o narrador da historia  explicando todos seus desejos e pensamentos loucos  Recomendo  Escrevi sobre ele no meu site  http   docequotidiano com br 2013 12      Guardate questo intrico di spine  L ultima riga del primo capitolo dice gia tanto  Nabokov non avrebbe potuto usare parole migliori per definirlo  Per spiegare cos e Lolita  Questo libro e di una bellezza indiscutibile  ma allo stesso tempo punge  E tanto anche  Punge e fa quasi male  Parlare di Lolita come di un semplice romanzo che racconta le vicende di un uomo adulto ossessionato da una ragazzina e davvero riduttivo  Lolita e molto di piu  E sta al lettore scoprirlo  interpretarlo  Impressionante come l autore riesca a ingannarci  in certi momenti pare che prenda le difese di Lolita  per poi subito dopo farti diventare quasi comprensivo nei confronti di H H  Oscar Wilde ha detto  Non esistono libri morali o immorali  Ci sono solo libri scritti bene o libri scritti male  Questo e tutto   Quest opera di Nabokov ne e la prova  La potenza verbale del romanzo e uno degli elementi che lo rende unico  Non c e una  e dico UNA  scena nel libro che sia descritta volgarmente  La volgarita non esiste in Lolita  E questa e probabilmente la cosa che mi ha affascinata piu di tutto Leggete Lolita  Guardate questo intrico di spine  Entrateci dentro  Fatevi graffiare  Permettete a Humbert Humbert di raccontare la sua storia  La sua confessione    E questa e la sola immortalita che tu e io possiamo condividere  mia Lolita   So the rumors are true  Nabokov is a scarily incredible writer and Lolita one of the most beautiful  poetic books I ve ever read  There were times when I re read a sentence several times because I couldn t quite get over the beauty of it  Other times when I re read because his shameless playing with words was just plain fun to articulate with my own tongue  on page one  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  How does one come up with that   Needless to say  I have fallen in love with language again  thankyou Nabokov   Rating  5  of fivePiss Christ  Andres SerranoLike  Lolita   reviewed on my blog  this work of art is one of the most challenged and banned and censored of all time  The religious are horrfied and offended that he artist submerged a representation of their tortured to death  savior  on his deathbed in a vat of urine But there s nothing in the least offensive about showing a man s death agony  Not a bit of it Lolita is challenged because it presents a pedophile s adoration of a little girl  It promotes awareness of pedophilia And not in a positive way  goofballs  Awareness of something is a precondition to avoiding that something LIKE ALL CENSORS  those calling for the censorship of this book  and of Piss Christ  just don t want to be bothered by things that are uncomfortable Too fuckin  bad  The world does not run on your itty fee fees  Pull up your big kid pants and walk away from things you don t like  Us grown ups will be out here with real world  Ignore that laughter  It can t be at you  Nabokov s Lolita is a wild chaos in the form of a book which would be perceived differently by each reader  so differently so as to make it a completely different novel each time it s read  Lolita does take one to places darker than one would like  depending on the reader s receptive capacity   Humbert Humbert the protagonist  also the narrator  is the most intriguing character I ve known   he s an inner antagonism and one is forced to shuttle between liking him and hating him  In his confessions one constantly risks taking sadistic masochistic pleasures since it s disturbingly hot  As for Dolores Haze  Lolita   she s our charming  flirtatious  semi conscious pubescent victim whom H H cunningly makes us despise at times  The beauty of Nabokov s writing style is in that he makes you feel the pangs  pains  excitement  desperation and helplessness of both H H and Lolita  In fact  it s so gorgeously written that one ends up being seduced by a character one s supposed to hate  who d be gross and despicable to most if not all  It s rather ironic for H H to call his readers  jury  since in this tumult  he leaves us unable to judge at all  In love with this novel  With a voice that whispers sinful thoughts and ideas with the tone of a slightly french young man  Lolita speaks for itself  I do not wish to analyze it  it s too raw and perfect to even imagine desecrating the story  This novel may be controversial  sickening  and immoral but god it is beautiful  Every word is delicately placed to create a little Humbert Humbert to whisper to me in the back of my mind  Nabokov makes a man so simple and so intricate that you can t help but love him even as he dabbles in sin  His hallucinations and conclusions are beyond eccentric yet somehow Nabokov makes the reader find them entirely rational  The narrator s voice is so realistic  his thought process so delicate  the imagery and descriptions so completely vivid  that the reader is pulled into his maniacal mind from the very first page  Lo Lee Ta  Each word is precise and serves a specific purpose  He truly is a master of words  always picking just the right ones to keep you floating a bit longer in Humbert s head  directly above normalcy  Despite the protagonist being a pedophile  Nabokov uses his language so ecstatically  uniquely  and seductively  that you cannot help but feel love  and insanity  throughout the entire story  Lyrical is the only word to describe Nabokov s work  the entirety of  Lolita  written in such a way that describes the beauty   and subsequent madness   of obsession and so called love  Guided by the voice of an unreliable narrator  the reader is thrust into a world of lust and sin  but it all leaves you in wonderment  however twisted the perspective seems to be   In short  An outrageous story about this middle aged Humbert who moves in as resident to a single mother with a teenager  Humbert falls quickly in love with the young manipulating sexy  as he interprets the situation  Dolores  He starts a relationship with the mother just to gain access to her  Circumstances eventually leads Humbert to a road trip together with her  as an adoptive child from marriage  Dolores is given secretly a nickname by Humbert as Lolita  that describes an euphemism for child erotica  or barely legal adult porn   meaning quoted from Internet    They set for a journey where Humbert s only intention is to love her  but keeping it secretly as they travel as father and daughter  My first Nabokov read and I m finding it very memorable  Intriguing as it s fascinating  Chocking to say the least  A book that have caused a lot of difference of opinions among readers  To some it s stimulating sexual desire  meanwhile others take offense to the main character  What the author superbly succeeds with  is to put the reader in a sympathetic state against the main character  The story is told in first person  view spoiler  and in front of a judge and jury as he pitying himself and looking for understanding for the crime he is suspected for   hide spoiler    I found it very thrilling and unputdownable  Humbert is such a creative person in manipulating the reader to almost taking a liking to him  in his pitiful and tragic way of reasoning  It almost becomes somewhat of an amusing story  A masterwork by Nabokov  LOVED this  So wrong and disgusting but I was hooked the whole time  Underneath the eloquence a shocking description about an immoral passion of a monster  Whatever Humbert Humbert claims  his twisted picture of the girl isn t reality  He s filling in the gaps himself and imagining something there is not  forcing the reader to see Lo with his eyes  How much of the story is actually true  The writing is superb  it s only hinting the surroundings but tells us so much  Nabokov s use of words and allusions is in fact so brilliant  that you can t help but have this constant nagging feeling that you should actually feel sorry for Humbert  There is a reason this book is a classic  and the performance by Jeremy Irons who reads the audio book is perfect While Nobokov does many things well  and most readers who are not too disturbed by the subject matter will enjoy it  I think there are two things in particular that he does that make this book especially powerful and inspiring for other writers  First  his use of language is rich and poetic in a way that I would find distracting from many authors  but not so when coming from Nabokov s narrator  and this is brought out all the more by Irons s reading  Second  as a reader listener I was  at one level  completely appalled by Humbert Humbert  but on another level I was completely in his head and empathizing and even almost rooting for him in his pederastic quests despite my full recognition of the despicable nature of them  hell  I ve got a 12 year old daughter   I think this is as compelling a demonstration of the power of novels as any I have read  though it is interesting that while the novelist is the conduit  the reader must be able to not only suspend disbelief but seems to be almost compelled to empathize with characters that we would be disgusted by in life  I am not trying to make any claims here about whether this is good  if we walk in other people s shoes  we are more likely to be compassionate and tolerant  or bad  we are able to be manipulated to empathize with evil   but it certainly seems to be an important aspect of human nature  literature  and the act of reading  Please get the annotated version and by God  read the annotations  I would argue that this work is more concerned with language than anything else  Who cares about the plot  the language games are fare more interesting  This book is like a puzzle  Nabokov is a terrifying genius and just being there  in this book  feels like entering hallowed ground  Breathtaking  Apo ta kalutera biblia pou ekho diabasei  Etan to proto tou Nampokoph pou diabasa kai eimai enthousiasmene mazi tou  O suggrapheas

suffers because many people purchase the book for the wrong reasons  They buy it for the smut  The truth is  there is no smut But Lolita gains  too  How so  Works of great literary merit are seldom best sellers   they seldom make it onto the shelf of the average reader  Without its bad reputation  its reputation for wickedness  Lolita would not have gained access to the very people Nabokov intended to stimulate   the great suburban mass Of course  many of these readers having searched desperately for the dirty bits to no avail  abandon the attempt  But some are persuaded by the prose  and it is sublime prose  to read on and on This audience could not have been reached without the court cases  the press  the banning  the tut tutting and the general hysteria caused by the book s plot  At the time  1955  the Sunday Express editor damned it  calling it  the filthiest book I have ever read  and  sheer unrestrained pornography   No wonder it sold well But that was in the 1950s  no one would find it offensive now   surely  Penguin Books recently published Lolita in their Popular Penguin range  You know the ones   the retro  orange covered Penguins you find in bookshops and on display in Australia Post Shops  Well  Australia Post had to remove Lolita from the displays  because of customer complaints What were they complaining about  Nothing real  Those who have not read Lolita know that Lolita is a book about a grown man having sex with a child  That is enough to damn it  Such logic would have us banning all crime novels  all war novels    and  well  to be on the safe side   all novels   Really   Do all novels promote and sanction the acts depicted within them  Yes  Lolita is about a grown man s infatuation with a young girl  But it isn t a Dummies guide to hebephilia  Lolita is about the damage this infatuation causes  But it is also about unequal relations of every kind and the damage these cause  It is about youth and age  It is about mind and body  About thought and action  It is about the relationship between the new world and the old   Europe and the USA When I read Lolita  it is about the relationship between knowledge and ignorance or  put differently  experience and innocence I m not going to deceive you  Lolita is a difficult book  It is many layered  and it is complex  One reading will not do it justice  and you become aware of this as you read it  Nabokov seems to be alerting us to our intellectual deficiencies  pointing out the enormous gaps in our knowledge  He wants us to go off to read  to learn  to become a reader worthy of his book and the questions it raises As I said  it is a complex book  It is also an interesting book  a rewarding book  And  for more reasons than the obvious  Lolita is a challenging and disturbing book  It examines many of the preconceptions that uphold the framework of our lives  finds them wanting and asks us to establish better ones  Something we have still yet to do  Which is why  ironically  Lolita can still cause a stir in the local Post Office  Amazing  Gut wrenching  sickening  revolting  A world I hope never to be a part of  first person pedophile  What s interesting is that whilst girls can freely read this book  any male that I have spoken to and recommended such a book has turned away with disgust and refused flatly to even touch the book  I wonder  if I keep promoting it  if one day I will find a male that is interested in reading it  and what such interest will say about him    to be fair I only offered it to about 4 males  all rejected it   This is a great book  I had heard of Lolita before as I admire Kubrick s work   and I ve seen most of his films   including  of course  the film version of Nabokov s novel  Prior to that  the only knowledge I had of it was that the term  lolita  was coined in this book  As it happens with most films that are adapted from books  I felt Kubrick s version wasn t as heavy and  well  dirty as I imagined a book on this subject would be  So after some time I decided to finally read it  And I m glad I did Despite of the ick factor   or maybe because of it   this book was still able to be a major accomplishment in writing  It made me ponder on a series of questions and it kept my interest for it going even on the occasions I had to put the book down for a while because it was too difficult being inside of such a monstrous and disgusting mind as Humbert Humbert s But I have to confess that I found the narrative so intriguing   even knowing HH was quite possibly unreliable    that at some point I found myself being less and less protective of Lo  I was feeling annoyed by Lolita all the time and her spoiled dirty little bitch behavior  Crazy  I know  I ll say it once more  this is a great book  Taking my time to delve more into her personality though  I realized that she was simply a product of her relationship with her mother  her father was gone and Charlotte treated her unfairly and created such a competitive and unfair environment for a child  And then enters an older  allowing sympathetic man  more like sympathetic character  as that was his act   who s not telling her what to do and how to behave   the complete opposite of her mother  I figured that maybe  in her emotionally incapable mind  she was simply moving from an abusive relationship to another  and that s why she felt compelled to him in the beginning A difficult aspect of the story to deal with  for me  was that Lolita seemed to want to be with Humbert and I started wondering if this could be called a love story  Of course  she didn t have any discernment  which twelve year old girl does   and was not in any way mature enough  prepared and emotionally and physically capable of making this decision and he didn t leave her much of a choice  but still  at some point  it seemed we were watching the downfall of your normal every day relationship between two consenting grown ups  and mind you that even grown ups have childish behaviors specially when in a broken relationship  Later on  I realized it wasn t that she wanted to be with him  it was that she didn t know any better  She didn t know she could get out and didn t know what else was out there  Lolita got used to being abused on various ways  the treatment dispensed by her mother and Humbert s intimidations  threats  violence  sexual assault and psychological rape Gladly  she was able to get away from his claws and it seems she was able to find happiness outside of what HH gave her on those sad times  clothes  money  gifts   which seemed to be her only satisfactions in life at that point  as she ended up marrying a working and humble man  At least she was able to take something out of that nightmare  she was finally maturing and realizing the worth of simple things in life  This is my first Nabokov and I don t know if he always wrote like this  but another compelling aspect found in this book was his writing style and rich wordplay  It also doesn t hurt that he mentions the great Marcel Proust  my favorite writer  a couple of times and emulates the styles of writers such as Dostoyevsky  Flaubert and Turgenev  showing an all around literary knowledge Rating  in my mind I realized this was a 5 stars book after I read 30 pages or so and the good thing is  while I read every chapter  I kept realizing the same thing  By the time I was finished  there was no other way to rate it   My thoughts about this book are complicated  That s to be expected  I suppose  given the subject matter  But it s far more nuanced than that  with the first person perspective adding an element of distrust to much of the story  and the flowery  carefully composed language giving an element of hypnotizing beauty  This is a book that requires processing I very much recommend it  I can tell why it s a classic  But you re going to have to figure that out for yourself  This book blew my mind  Most people would be afraid to write like this   this book is fantastic  humbert humbert s narration is so charming  engrossing and bright  it s hard not to be taken in  i kept finding myself enjoying him  even liking him  and then feeling shocked and disgusted each time we are reminded of how horrrrrrible he really is  it is a terrible icky feeling  i loved how deeply we got to understand these characters  how real and tragic lolita s story became  this book really struck me and i haven t stopped thinking about it since i finished it  a   This novel is a case study of someone who is supremely unlikable  I was drawn to it because of its reputation  and I can very easily say that reputation is earned  Nabokov fills Humbert Humbert s head with learning and sophistication so that everything he says can burst from the page with such zest and flavor  Humbert s language reflects the cravings he has which fill him to nearly bursting levels  It is sad to watch him lose what control he thought he had as he encounters Dolores Haze  the titular  Lolita   but when he does  the dam is broken  and he is no longer holding back  Perhaps worse is that he  for all his learning and worldly experience  fancies himself a victim of little Lolita Though we never see events from Lolita s eyes  the way in which Humbert describes her at various times  when he isn t citing more objective statistics  like her above average intelligence  says so much about his character that the perceptive reader can t help seeing past his constantly dilated pupils and into her experiences  Humbert s inconsistent remarks about her character reveal exactly this  she may at times be a naive little girl  but she is by no means stupid  and is perfectly capable of planning for the long term  She seems to know the predicament she s in  and   so long as she s got no other choice   will bend things in her favor as much as she can Many readers seem to want to read this novel for its shock value  and others simply to be offended  Some  who know all too well the contents of the book  probably want to know what could possibly motivate someone like Humbert Humbert  They may not like the answer  but he certainly supplies it  As I read along  I was motivated to read more to witness a young woman be as strong as she possibly could be  and ultimately overcome every obstacle that was in her way  I got exactly what I wanted  This book broke my heart and made me painfully aware of how alone I am and can be in this world  The writing is truly wonderful and the story sucks you in  as you watch the ultimate destruction of Humbert  all by his own hands   t   diky nejaky piratsky kopii Lolity  kterou jsem objevil ve ctecce  jsem byl nucen pretrpet toto pismeno jako nahrazku pismena z  Proste misto z bylo todle turecky t  Nic

subject in such a way that I felt unsettled  even terrified at the end  I m still all for catching predators a la Chris Hansen  but that doesn t take away from the fact that this is a beautifully  powerfully written book  El mejor escritor gringo fue ruso  ja  Hace un tiempo lei una resena de Matt de Lector Empedernido y bueno  me gustan sus recomendaciones y estoy muy pendiente de su blog  El

cochinadas y cosas horribles  Al protagonista de este libro le gustan las ninitas  Que horror  Vamos a tirar el libro por la ventana  A quemarlo en la hoguera Resena completa  http   rapsodia literaria blogspot co    This is my favorite novel  Nabokov s writing style is staggering  his storytelling equally powerful  I can never get over the fact that English is not his native tongue  because he uses it with more beauty and poetry than most writers I ve read  Most people can recite a handful of literature s famous first lines   It was the best of times  it was the worst of times    Mrs  Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I ve been turning over in my mind ever since   and so on   but few memorize the first four full paragraphs of a novel  All true Nabokov fans know the following by heart  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  a certain initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns  Always beautiful to my ears Lee It s really an incredible book  The writing is uniformly outstanding  the characters are really well drawn  and it s surprisingly funny  It s also probably the outright creepiest book I ve ever read  There s a reason that it s been on shelves for the last 50  years despite the subject matter  it s an incredible work of fiction and worth reading for anyone  I cannot think of anyone with a greater gift for words than Nabokov  For several weeks after reading this book  I was unable to write fiction at all because I felt so inadequate  Fortunately  I got over the writer s block  we carry on despite our limitations   but I will never get over the feeling of wonderment and awe brought on by this book  I don t really care how controversial the content is  or how taboo  I think of this as one of the great literary love stories  Yes  Humbert was  sick  by conventional standards  yes  he took advantage of a very young girl  yes  he had sex with her   manipulated her  lied to her   all of these things are true and also  bad    this we know  But what about his love by the sea  What about the root of it all  and the sadness  and the guilt and the emptiness  and all of the human emotions that create really fucked up scenarios   ones that might not be pretty or  okay     What about those things  They are not to be ignored  People can t be ultimately condemned without a second look  This book allows that  Maybe even then  he is not a  likeable character   still somehow the humanity of it all is beautiful and admirable and really alarmingly honest  Aside from all of that  Nabokov is such a crazily skilled writer  His is alliterative  and hauntingly lyrical and I always always always have to read passages aloud to myself because of how pretty they sound when spoken  For me personally the story line was a bit confusing  I like big words but the entire book for me was full of metaphors and phrases I was not familiar with  I skipped quite a few pages at a time but the plot overall was great  It was different than anything I have ever read before and I believe this book is a great love story about starcrossed lovers  It was sad at the end and I just love this book  Oh  the movie is great too  I truly enjoyed Lolita Perhaps the best satire hidden in plain sight masterpiece of dark comedy and gleeful bad taste since  A Modest Proposal   Vladimir Nabokov s novel of grandiose  self deluding pedophile Humbert Humbert s manipulation  abduction and seduction of a tween girl seen as Quixotic romance is an essential but uncomfortable read  Nabokov is a master of words  and his flurry of wordplay  allusion  pun and metaphor is dazzling enough that at times  one is almost conned into feeling sorry for  or even sympathizing with  the monstrous  and monstrously pretentious  Humbert  Nabokov pulls off the same trick Oscar Wilde patented with  Dorian Grey   taking a tale of bottomless depravity  filled with monstrous characters  and making it into frothy fun  at least on the surface  Such a great but disturbing book  It was completely addictive even though the subject matter was so raw  Nabokov did a great job keeping a book on a pedophile classy   I know that there is a TON of controversy even today about Lolita  and I would like to state that those who are against it are insane  You cannot simply write off Humbert Humbert as just a despicable person  because of who he is  He makes it clear that he is not proud of what he is doing  He really is a victim of love  and of circumstance  and of an obsession that turned deadly  Vladimir Nabokov is truly a genius  and one of the bravest writers in history for publishing this book  in the time that he did  He created a pathway for writers of all genres to break down the barriers of what is accepted in society  An absolutely wonderful example of literature   This was my second time to read this book  Nabakov is having the last laugh on this one  taking a turd of a morally reprehensible theme and perspective and rolling it in the glitter of breathtakingly voluptuous language and giving us an irresistible read  Doubtless  I will read it again  Clegg sees the novel s non disclosure of Lolita s feelings as directly linked to the fact that her real name is Dolores Haze and  in the novel but not the film  only Humbert refers to her as Lolita  Humbert also states he has effectively  solipsized  Lolita early in the novel  Eric Lemay of Northwestern University writes  The human child  the one noticed by non nymphomaniacs  answers to other names   Lo    Lola    Dolly   and  least alluring of all   Dolores    But in my arms   asserts Humbert   she was always Lolita   And in his arms or out   Lolita  was always the creation of Humbert s craven self     The Siren like Humbert sings a song of himself  to himself  and titles that self and that song  Lolita     To transform Dolores into Lolita  to seal this sad adolescent within his musky self  Humbert must deny her her humanity   The most artfully written book I have ever come across  Empathy is all I feel for the protagonist  This book really got to me  Such a simple yet complex man  in love with a child  a complex child  I saw in an earlier review that some people think that it is Lolita s fault  that she encouraged him and lured him in  I really do disagree  Girls  CHILDREN  tend to test limits  to tease and seek out exactly how much power they have over others and in certain situations  A normal person wouldn t respond to the signals or whatever she thrust upon him  But dear Mr  Humbert Humbert did Nabokov paints everything up with such beautiful language  phrases and similes and I absolutely adored reading the ryhymes  the lyrics and the creepy  wonderfully chilling poem he wrote when Lolita went missing  It is to be noted that Lolita was in for it at the beginning of their relationship  as mentioned  she was curious  But the further you read you come to realize that she s slowly drifting away  emotionally  When she finally leaves  physically  she s actually already left  emotionally A piece of the   WANTED   poem  chapter 25Wanted  wanted  Dolores Haze Hair  brown  Lips  scarlet Age  five thousand three hundred days Profession  none  or  starlet Where are you hiding  Dolores Haze Why are you hiding  darling  I Talk in a daze  I walk in a mazeI cannot get out  said the starling  Where are you riding  Dolores Haze What make is the magic carpet Is a Cream Cougar the present craze And where are you parked  my car pet Who is your hero  Dolores Haze Still one of those blue capped star men Oh the balmy days and the palmy bays And the cars  and the bars  my Carmen Oh Dolores  that juke box hurts Are you still dancin   darlin   Both in worn levis  both in torn T shirts And I  in my corner  snarlin    The writer was so convincing and the story so grossly romantic that I somehow understood this relationship that got built along the way  Wrong or right  no comment  However  it was told too well    Brilliant complex and extraordinarily readable  The writing makes the whole thing pleasure to read  like painting of words  It is definitely one I will pick up again    This is one of my favorite books out of all that I ve read  I adore Nabokov s writing  and Lolita is the book that got me started on him  His character development is impeccable  and you are drawn in by the drama and machinations of Humbert Humbert  It s always funny to me how the common usage of  lolita  as a word are so opposed to what she is and represents in the book  It s as if the common psyche adopted Humbert s thinking and accepted it to be the true and honest evaluation of the girl  Before I read the book  I had assumed that she was some sort of seductress and pictured her to be in her late teens  maybe underage  but close to the age of majority and quite mature  I was absolutely shocked when I read the book and learned that she was 11 at the beginning of the book  The portrait that Nabokov paints of Humbert s deceptions  both of others and of himself  is masterful  You see the lengths H will go to and the convolusions he creates in order to justify himself to the reader and within his own mind  He is the very image of the fiend  This book is  of course  beautifully written  I found it difficult to read the story of a man who stalks and seduces a 12 year old  Lolita has been interpreted by many as the seductress in this story but I don t buy it  She is coerced  manipulated  and cornered  Allan thinks this a fascinating story of a man who struggles with his weakness  as we all do  and fails  but with a daughter approaching her teens  I found it hard to empathize   Lolita is a hauntingly beautiful story that will take you out of your comfort zone and stretch your mind  Lolita a fictional memoir of Humbert Humbert  a grown man  who loves young girls  Humbert develops an incestuous relationship with his stepdaughter  the reader observes the dangerous nature of obsession and the terrible consequences of the victim as the relationship progresses throughout the story  Despite its obscenity  I liked this book because it was excellently articulate  the rhythm and cadence of his sentences were invigorating and his choice of words was precise  Overall I believe the book was wonderful and at the same time disturbingly provocative  it was unique  intriguing  and poetically written at every turn  Another reason I liked this book was how well the author created the characters  The characters are real in a way that allowed me to develop an uncertain empathy and relationship with the characters   Even if Nabokov were not writing in his THIRD language  Lolita would still be an astounding tour de force of English  The poetry of the writing and the word play are brilliant  and the story is heartbreaking  Don t let the subject of pedophilia scare you away   it s not a creepy book like that  I ve never cried at a book  But now I can at least say that I teared up at one  Oh that last paragraph just got me   Note to anyone who s about to start this book  Although the foreword to his novel written by Dr  John Fay is fake  do not read it  I luckily skipped it thinking it was just an introduction by some airhead professor and I am thankful of my ignorance  It tells the reader facts that happen after the novel is written that I believe would actually spoil the reading of the novel  Just a heads up  This is probably the most beautifully written novel about the most beautiful relationship in literature  Yes  it s technically pedophilia  but doesn t matter  Many people would disagree with me here saying that it s disgusting and obscene but don t listen to those people  form your own opinions  Ugh I just cannot get over how much I loved this  If any other of Nabokov s novels are written at just a fraction of how beautifully this is then I will cherish them for life  Please read this novel  it s a masterpiece  Ksiazka wybijajaca sie ponad wszelka skale  Absolutny geniusz  I really really liked Lolita  It is one of those books that I had always wanted to read  always heard was good  but hadn t ever read  After reading  Reading Lolita in Tehran  it was finally time The characters make this book incredibly interesting  I loved Nabokov s writing  It s a shame that the name  Lolita  has now become synonymous with the idea of a teenage seductress  but this book is really a great one Although the narrator wants the reader to be sympathetic to him  Nabokov does an excellent job of exposing a monstrous pedophile through his own words  It is so hard for me to express to anyone why this is my favorite book  More often than not the moment  Lolita  is brought up the instant focus is understandably the pedophilia  The book has been labeled  pornographic  and has been banned for being claimed to be such  but in truth it could not be any less so  It is ambiguous enough to not be anywhere remotely explicit  but suggestive enough that you get the idea The book is unusual  The subject matter is incredibly taboo  but what I fell in love with was not the controversy but the language  English was not Nabokov s first language yet he uses it with more precision and skill than I have seen in literature written by those who do hold English as their mother tongue  There are so many references upon references to pop culture  to the current events of the time and so many more I could not possibly list them without picking up my annotated edition  This arguably makes the book a bit of a chore to read at first and I found myself often enough completely glimpsing over Humbert Humbert s ramblings on certain topics because the references are simply so old  It did not take away however from my pure enjoyment of reading basically how this man strung two words together  That alone was enough to hold me completely as everything just seemed to flow so smoothly through my mind  I have read this book at least five times over and it took me twice at least to even begin to understand it Humbert is a terribly unreliable narrator  imaging up Lolita s actions and adding to them an adult perception that at 12 a child simply would not have  It is obvious Lolita is curious about her effect on this man who shows her such affection when her own mother does not and soon enough you start to believe Humbert s assertions that it was she who seduced him and for me at least the moment that thought passed through my mind I recoiled in absolute horror  That for one moment he had convinced me of the excuse pedophiles assert to justify their actions and how in truth  we never really meet Lolita  We only see her through Humbert s projected desires onto her and what he chooses to see her as  This constant churning obsession and possessiveness he has for this child is both disquieting and eye opening for me  Wondering constantly whether he became this way because he was born with an illness of the mind or if the trauma of losing his first love as a child had so deeply scarred him  Neither of which ever are enough to excuse his abhorrent actions In either case  by the end I was surprised that still he would cling to this idea of Lolita he had built up even though she was so much older and pregnant by another man  I still am not certain whether it was really her he loved or if he was just so wrapped around this idea he built up of this perfect undying child that even after she had shed this visage he could not stop himself from wanting her  I could go on and on about Quilty acting as a foil for Humbert and being an embodiment of the monstrousness of what he has done and that his murdering of him is Humbert symbolically murdering the monster in himself  but that would take up way more of this review then I am willing to Bottom line  I would tell people not to be put off by the subject matter if they are truly interested  Lolita is a beautiful work of the English language and is wonderful for those who  like me  want to spend hours agonizing over all the meanings and the mind of this obviously deeply disturbed man  Just an amazing book  one of my favorites  and even better the second time around  This time I listened to the audio version read by Jeremy Irons  which I highly recommend  He performs the entire book  reading in the voice of HH  matching perfectly his intonation to the tone of the writing  It s so good  I wish more audiobooks were read in this way by proper actors  This book is so exquisitely written but ugh  Humbert Humbert is a disgusting  despicable creep  He is portrayed as so intelligent but vile  vile  vile  I didn t pick up on a lot of subtle things when I first read this book in high school  but rereading it recently I was able to tell just how horrible he really was to Lolita  That poor girl  However  near the end when he goes to visit her at the home she shares with her husband  I couldn t help but feel a little sad at the description of how he loved her even though she had lost most of her nymphet beauty and was hugely pregnant with someone else s child  Almost sympathetic  but not quite  How could anyone ever really sympathize with Humbert Humbert  Aku tidak melihat tokoh bernama Humbert  Tapi  Aku melihat manusia bernama Humbert  So  first  the opening hundred pages of this book are distinctly uncomfortable  And yet  those opening pages are in large part a trap to lull unsuspecting readers into some sort of literary complacency  And this is not a book to read complacently at all  not if you want to keep up with Nabokov s labyrinthine allusions and hidden clues  The book twists and turns through its final two hundred pages with fantasy and reality intertwining through Humbert s increasingly unreliable narrative But through it all the book is excellent   Nabokov s craftsmanship is seamless and the great literary dodge inevitably delivers the reader to  well  an entirely unsuspected conclusion    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   Is there any better way to start  Lolita  Vladimir Nabokov s self adjusted  love affair with the English language  is deservingly one of the most acclaimed works of the 20th century  Given  is this book just about a pedophile obsessing over a little girl  nymph   Let s find out  I m going to start the seriousness of this review with the notion that I was  hating  on this book  Yes  in every sense of the word  I wasn t digging it  After delving maybe 50 pages in  I felt as if I was done  my streak of great reads this summer had come to an abrupt  and unexpected end   or so I thought  I feel as if once the reader leaves all expectation  thought  and everything else that can be mustered up at the door  one can truly begin to enjoy Lolita  Once I slowed down  and really took in Nabokov s beautiful prose  was I entranced in his work  And I finally got to enjoy my very own Lolita  I ve come to realize that giving any sort of plot summary for reviews is kind of pointless  or at least I feel that way  The same goes for any form of structure I was having thought I was having with my previous reviews  so hopefully from this point on everything is not a jumbled mess  Lolita  at its root  is about infatuation  love as madness  hallucination  the power of language  and in many cases a critique satire reflection of American life  There is a constant Euro American tension throughout the work  it s cool  work with it  back to the notion of infatuation  To address it in this review  I ve had several people ask me a  why I am reading a book about pedophilia  b  why such a book is considered a piece of great lit  and c  what s the point  Well  to answer everything at once  what better way to express the idea of infatuation than through a middle aged man obsessed with a little girl  Truly  there is your answer  However  Nabokov himself answers something along the lines of this question in one instance of writing  years after Lolita s initial release  He states that  For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm   He writes to write  That being said  my main point of this review can be better said  read Lolita simply to read Lolita  To close this review  I d like to say  when reading Lolita just take in Nabokov s beautiful prose  instances of sheer comedy  and dark excitement  Don t hold expectations and don t try to burn through it  experience Humbert Humbert s madness in it s entirety  To loosely paraphrase the back of my book  Nabokov s work is addicting because he writes in a way that all writing should be done  ecstatically  Read the entire work  and if you reach the beautiful finale of it still not floored  with a sense of dark excitement and comedic insanity  then I am sorry  I was left floored  Now go read it  Quotes  We had been everywhere  We had really seen nothing  And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely  trustful  dreamy  enormous country that by then  in retrospect  was no more to us than a collection of dog eared maps  ruined tour books  old tires  and her sobs in the night every night  every night  the moment I feigned sleep   176   Whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between book covers  his fate is fixed in our minds  and  similarly  we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them  Thus X will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the second rate symphonies he has accustomed us to  Y will never commit murder  Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us  We have it all arranged in our minds  and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him  Any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical  We would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor  the retired hot dog stand operator  if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen   265   The road now stretched across open country  and it occurred to me not by way of protest  not as a symbol  or anything like that  but merely as a novel experience that since I had disregarded all laws of humanity  I might as well disregard the rules of traffic  So I crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling  and the feeling was good   306   I  a 15  nearly 16  year old girl  read Lolita out of the shear curiosity of an under appreciated  and very controversial  book  I do not support pedophilia  I enjoyed this sadistic account of pedophilia however  I was enchanted into Humbert s world of lustful thoughts of a nyphet  as he calls our Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov s sensual wording and all consuming visions  This being said  I will likely read other works by Nabokov  I had this revelation recently  I ve edited this review since I first posted it  I think I subconsciously knew it while reading it  but once I was no longer trapped in the moments of the book  trying to proccess the actual story  I realized I fell prey  I believed Humbert s every word  I placed him as the victim  If he is a victim of anything  it s him own selfpitty  blindness  and woe is me attitude  But he is not the victim to Lolita  He is still a pedophile  Nobokov s ability to create a dispicable character that manages to make multiple people feel his pain is what makes this a good book  Humbert s charms worked on a large number of people here on goodreads too   Of course  poor Lolita knows her life is a living hell  that the very seams of her existence have been ripped apart and resewn in crude stitches  Humbert is too involved  too oblivious  and she has no where to turn and no one to turn to  And he does not truly realize that she had not recuperated in his feelings after their initial beginning until  perhaps  that day when he finds her  expecting a child  moving to Alaska  and now Dolly Schiller Evidently  she does find someone to turn to  hardly a change  from one pedophile to another  and we know just how long that last for  While reading this book  as a high school sophomore  I had an array of replies  My English teacher  an innocent  pain sakingly Christian bubble brain bitch  had never even heard of the book  What an education  Of my friends  only one knew what is was before I explained  He had been surprised my mom had allowed it  In that  I was too  For those that I had to explain it to  I have three reactions  Curiosity  much like my own  and desire to read it  Ignorance  Refusal to even let me talk about it  And indifference  Those who found it interesting  but for the most part  were unopinionated   For those who expressed desire to borrow the book  I look forward to being able to discuss it with them  for those who fell into the latter two categories  I m disappointed  In an ironic admission  my late father would have been horrified  was he still around to encounter me reading this  He had placed an age limit  My sister had to be at least 16 to watch the 1962 movie  I ended up watching it just before my 15th birthday  only months after my father would have still been around to enforce the age limit  Now  nearly 16  I have already read the book  a much more detailed and entirely disturbing rendition of the story  Of what I have seen of the 1997 movie  which is only clips and trailers  it seems much more accurate to the book   TEN STARSRead this now  RIGHT NOW                     After reading this  I re examined my life  Re prioritized my books to read in my lifetime queue to include every single shred that Nabokov wrote  If the electric chair felt good  this is what it d feel like  I got a big fat stack of Nabokov short stories at my house right now and just knowing they re there makes me sleep better at night  like how some people feel about keeping a baseball bat or AK47 by the bed  I am completely tickled that this has entered into my life  and if I could nominate one person to be revived from the grave  he s the one   To be fair  Humbert Humbert does warn you in the first para   You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style   Style is what separates Nabokov from any other writer I ve ever encountered  The writing is absolutely marvelous  The endless alliterations and wordplay  Vivian Darkbloom  anyone   keep you wondering how much fun Nabokov might ve had composing Lolita Lolita has a shocking  revolting theme  What Humbert Humbert does is deplorable and yet he provides a titillating version of events  teasing and manipulating us with his side of the story and portraying his love as a true  eternal love  always wishing the best for Lolita  I had a tough time reading it  especially when it strikes you that he has been talking about a 12 year old  but I just couldn t keep it down Stephen Metcalf described it perfectly in  Lolita at 50    Your run of the mill obscene masterwork  Tropic of Cancer  say  demands that you enlightened reader  work your way past the sex and excrement to recognize how beautiful it is  But with Lolita  you must work past its beauty to recognize how shocking it is   And I ll let Nabokov seduce you the way he s seduced countless others like me with this first para  The most fascinating introduction to a novel I ve ever come across  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  And then to realize  English wasn t even his first language  Nabokov s best novel I think    the most focused and also the most diabolical  The writing is intoxicating  Nabokov is a master of words  and Lolita is much more than just a story  its a mistery puzzle  a twisted love story  a psychological novel  and an amazing art work  its only problem was that i found it hard to read ordinary modern books after it  but maybe thats not such a bad thing after all      This was my holiday book and I can safely say that is now one of my all time favourites  Humbert Humbert is a monster I loathe  though I cannot help but feel sorry for him  Watching little Lo grow up under the guidance of such a man and play him at his own game was a ride I cannot wait to repeat  Riveting story   makes one question humanity throughout   with superb characterisation  Nabokov is an absolute genius  i have no words right now I really should have given this book 4 stars because part 2 is so long and makes the book lopsided  and I got a little tired of another motel  another motel  another motel  But Nabokov is such a genius writer  and I think English was not his second but his THIRD language  and so witty  his style alone carries this to 5 stars  If you worship words  want to scratch the surface of something different  and needless to say an incommensurable  and radiant love story   then go for Lolita  Indeed indeed this book made it to be the best book I ve ever read  and probably will ever read  Mr Nabokov tackled the English language in a way I couldn t believe it would ever exist  With his extremely lyrical prose that triggered all kinds of feelings toward this agonizing  exquisite love story  I must say I am hugely impressed  The story might not be everyone s cup of tea  but it was for me  The surprisingly humorous Humbert made me utter some loud laughs every now and then  that no other book or a comedy movie could do so  I am not a reviewer  and I don t like to descant about books analytically  so I ll just say that this book will be revisited frequently in the future  and since it s my first book to read for Mr  Nabokov  it certainly urged me to get all of the writings of that delicate yet beast of a writer  Beautiful  Why didn t anyone tell me how beautiful this book is I love it  It is now one of my favorite books  The language is gorgeous and playful  alliteration    I ve seen the movie  but forgot a lot of it  and still it had me guessing the whole time  It  like American Gods  makes me want to go on a roadtrip through America And    I mean  okay  Being in a relationship with a 13 year old girls sucks  Hello  they are all horrible brats  Usually when characters make stupid decisions  it makes me hate them  but even though I know Humbert s doomed  he s so convincing that I don t blame him for making the decisions that he does  Of COURSE he kidnaps and incesterizes Lo  wouldn t you  with the elbows and the auburn hair and the tennis playing  He convinces you Also also  Jeremy Irons is the most talented narrator I ve encountered yet  He s perfect My only regret is that I missed whatever was said in French  because I don t know from French But still  Beautiful  Read it  better yet  listen to it  if you haven t already   Am collecting interesting perspectives on Lolita  Obviously most people know that English is Nabokov s second language  and obviously most people think that s pretty fucking incredible  because I mean seriously  But maybe his English is too good  and maybe this isn t exactly revolutionary  but maybe he s able to use English in different ways because he doesn t  presumably  know it so well  He can twist it and turn it and manipulate it because he is somehow   separated from its core  This is badly put  I need to go to bed __________________Reading Lolita again is wonderful  There s a sense of coming home  of returning to some crucial and central part of my soul  oh god that sounds so bad given the subject matter but please bear with me   I find myself wanting to be by myself  curled up somewhere warm with my book and no one to bother me  at odd times  such as when I m supposed to be having fun with friends and alcohol  And also at not so odd times It is just so  so  incredibly  totally  utterly  superlatively  beautifully written  And I find myself past the half way point and still totally absorbed in the story  last time I read it I found it difficult to sustain my attention for much of the book   And all I really want to do is be alone with Lolita and Horrible Humbert Humbert and reading Nabokov s crazy writing which is like music and it s ridiculous  English isn t even his first language I have been reading with Manny s excellent review in mind  which has been fun  I m enjoying underlining things in a nerdy fashion as I find more and more evidence to support his assertion that Humbert is  a character  who   is initially presented in sympathetic terms  and then gradually revealed as a monster   And now I ve reached this point  which wrenches something inside I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely  trustful  dreamy  enormous country that by then  in retrospect  was no more to us than a collection of dog eared maps  ruined tour books  old tires  and her sobs in the night   every night  every night   the moment I feigned sleep And now I am finished and am stunned  I am paralysed with disbelief  Straight up the most beautiful book I have ever read  The prose is beyond amazing  I was captivated from the first paragraph  Very occasionally the plot can seem to drag a little  but it drags with beautiful prose so who cares  GOD  This book  This book here  This is orgasmic reading  Not because it is pornographic because it isn t  Because it is so incredibly well written  Nabokov is a god and I want to marry his brain This edition includes an afterword by the author  It is hilarious  Just so hilarious in every particular  Even if you gave up on the book because HH made you uneasy  read the afterword  Apparently the audiobook is read by Jeremy Irons  I must own this  This novel is a masterpiece  establishing Nabokov as the greatest English prose stylist of the 20th century  The protagonist Humbert s acrobatic  verbose narration charms and seduces  His monologue is readily laced with French phrases and literary allusions  to authors such as Joyce and Perrault  The lovely words cast a spell of enchantment  at the same luring you toward and away from the unpleasant notion of pedophilia  Surpassing the genre of mere erotica  this novel is a story of comedy  of beauty  and most of all  of human empathy  It is a must read for any English speaker  For Lolita is not just a story  it is the scrutiny of a deprived man s brain under a literary microscope  Nabokov is a poet  he s simply a poet  The only novel I know that can make me cry and laugh on the same page   Mi sento assolutamente inadatta e a disagio nel recensire o dare un mio parere sull opera di Nabokov  Un romanzo dalla prosa sublime  ricercata e raffinata che  nonostante il tema trattato  non genera nessuna repulsione nel lettore  Il romanzo  come specificato dall autore stesso  non ha nessuna pretesa di moralita  non giudica cio che e giusto e cio che non lo e  anzi  Col susseguirsi degli eventi ci si dimentica della morale e si confonde  vittima  e  carnefice   ci si immedesima sempre di piu nella miseria e nella cupa tristezza che permea i personaggi  Non si puo non amare un libro del genere   This was a very interesting read  and quite different from what I d expected  The book isn t nearly as explicit as I d feared  and it is very intelligently written  For a more in depth discussion of Lolita  stop by my blog  http   outsideofacat wordpress com 20    and http   outsideofacat wordpress com 20    A brilliantly written book if extremely uncomfortable  i read this in grad school  and i m glad i had a professor and a classroom full of fellow readers to guide me through this amazing book  i m sure much of it would have been lost on me otherwise  the story itself is strange and disturbing and wonderful  but there s so much more to it than just the affair between humbert and lo  the use of language  all the more stunning when you consider that it wasn t nabokov s native tongue   the portrait of america and american culture  just an incredible book  worthy of all the attention it continues to receive   A complete masterpiece right from the first word  according to popular beliefs this book is not about sex  but about love  albeit bacchanalian in nature  The character reminds of Boticelli s Venus  alluring and scandalising at the same moment  This boook definitely should go in the permanent collection  Darkly hilarious  the original  tragicomedy     and as we all know  full of distasteful behavior  The title itself seems today cliche  most folk know of  Lolita   or at least  what they think it suggests about sexual depravity  Two competing   and as regarded by the author  completely ludicrous and inaccurate   possible interpretations   Old Europe debauching young America  and  Young America debauching old Europe   Avoiding all that  though  I found it immensely enjoyable  easily exceeding its burdensome pop culture psychobabble associations  And really  that s more than can be said for many overrated  20th century classics   Estoy realmente dividido entre si darle a este numero cuatro o cinco estrellas  Es un libro excelente y fue una gran experiencia pero creo que tendria que leerlo una vez mas antes de ponerle cinco estrellas  Lo dejo en un cuatro 1 2 hipotetico Este es un libro tan extrano y fascinante  Nabokov toma una premisa simple  pedofilia  y corre con ella hasta los extremos y los limites  Todo basado en EEUU  dando una imagen de  en palabras de otra persona   la tranquilidad y pulcritud que esconden vicios y depravacion   Primero tengo que mencionar la estructura  que fue lo que mas me llamo la atencion en un principio  La novela es escrita como una  memoir  por Humbert Humbert desde la carcel que mas bien parece su version parodica de una confesion  Esta dividido en dos partes  la primera en mi primera lectura me parecio casi perfecta y la segunda senti que se estancaba bastante en la mitad pero termina con un final fuerte  De nuevo  es un libro hecho para leerse varias veces  asi que todas mis opiniones son dadas a cambiarse  Ambas partes empiezan con relatos por Humbert mas bien abstractos de su vida o del estado general o sus recuerdos  la novela mantiene una fluidez casi conversacional en la que su narrador libremente reconoce que cambia cosas o se le olvidan  En ambas partes poco a poco va centrandose hasta un momento especifico y mantiene una historia mas bien impredescible  No tenia la mas minima idea de a donde iba la novela mientras la leia  A ratos era desesperante  a ratos lo hacia aun mejor Ahora lo importante aqui  los personajes  Y sobre todo Humbert  Este es un libro que Es su narrador  un narrador que para el final de la novela  para bien o mal  conocemos ya como un amigo o un conocido incomodo  Las perversiones  justificaciones  idiosincracias y payasadas de Humbert son la novela mas que la historia misma y creo que la genialidad de Nabokov fue no crear un personaje simple y guiado por su lujuria  sino un ser humano que casualmente actua como una caricatura  El libro esta hecho para las interpretaciones diferentes  Humbert demuestra  una y otra vez  ser un ser humano asqueroso y horrible incapaz de cualquier tipo de simpatia  Esto desde el primer capitulo  Al mismo tiempo demuestra ser capaz de emociones sinceras y pasa humillaciones tales que uno no puede evitar compadecerlo o hasta simpatizar  Mi interpretacion favorita es que al final Humbert logra ver  por fin  a Dolores como un ser humano y no su ideal y se da cuenta del dano que le causo  Pero eso es lo genial  Nabokov no se conforma con darnos un pervertido y ya  nos da la imagen completa de un ser humano que puede ser tanto aterrador como patetico o divertido  Luego tenemos al resto de personajes  un monton de psicopatas mamando la teta del sueno americano con diferentes grados de humanidad pero siempre cercanos a la caricatura  Personalmente adore a Charlotte Haze y Quint dio una de las mejores escenas de todo el libro  Pero claro esta  estoy olvidando a alguien  Lo  Lee  Ta  Dolores Haze salta entre ser justo lo que Humbert cree o desea que sea y ser una persona que Humbert nunca podra entender  Despues de todos los cliches y copias que este libro inspiro  es fascinante para el lector encontrarse con una Lolita que es  simple y sencilla  una putilla pendeja de secundaria  Pero eso es lo chido   es realmente ella un personaje estupido y poco profundo o simplemente Humbert nunca pudo ver mas que eso  Lolita amaba a su madre y nunca es dominada completamente por Humbert  pero no deja de ser una nina berrichuda y sarcastica  Es un hecho que no es inocente  pero tambien es un hecho que no es  completamente  la  nymphet  que Humbert necesita ver  Al final de la novela  con ella y con todos los personajes  me quede con la impresion de que vi pasar algo humano escondido debajo de todo el desmadre y la caricatura  pero nunca supe si estaba ahi o solo parecia asi Simple y sencillamente un clasico  Es humor negro mas negro que el alma de Nabokov misma con algo de la mejor escritura de personajes que he visto jamas  Algo tedioso a veces cuando la pedanteria de Humbert se come a si misma o en los tramos mas lentos  pero con mas que suficientes pay offs en terminos de personajes y escenas  Estoy seguro que habian ideas filosoficas por ahi en algun lado pero tendre que volverlo a leer para entenderlas  Todo con lo que me quedo despues de terminarlo son luces  estallidos  humor maniatico  pasion que raya entre lo real y lo imaginado y un mundo donde no hay gente buena  The American Dream   I m shocked I made it so many years without actually sitting down and giving this one a full read  Well worth the time and deserving of it s status as a classic  Nabokov is an exquisite puppetmaster  delighting you with his playful language one moment and twisting your insides out with dread the next  and sometimes both   Yes it s controversial and will probably make you uncomfortable but it was extremely well written  Despite the subject matter and in regards to stories about taboo relationships  I found it better Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey    yes I went there  But then again thats probably why its a classic   I wanna cry  I literally want to cry  How on earth an author can finish a book like this  I mean  it was AMAZING  The book sometimes bores you  but the outcome is just legendary  I wasn t expecting an end like that  The book wasn t so fluid  to be honest  BUT if you don t read it you cannot know what a great book is  EVER  I can assure you  this is one of my favorite books now  And by the way  I wanna fuck Dolly  Stupid little girl  Ughh  I want to smash her face  and then blend the rest with a blender  She is the killer of a happy ending  And the criminal of an innocent love  An all time favorite and another re reader  A mildly uncomfortable ride throughout  having said that  it contains some of the most wonderful prose I have ever read  Nabokov had his work cut out to make the sordid life a sociopathic pedophile worthy of reading  but with his explosive prose his does so in this  lamentable tale of unreciprocated love  At times one feel mildly dirty  at times one feels discusted  at times one feels like pouring lighter fluid everywhere and setting the world on fire  and ridding us all of evil  but  at all times  the beauty of the words dance on every page  leave one with a true sense of Nabokov  a twisted genius Mike I really enjoyed this strange story  This story was from the  bad guy s  point of view and you saw his own perspective  Reminded me of Law Order SVU episode where Detective Stabler find his daughters photo on a Pedo Bear site  One of the things that was interesting about this episode was the kind way the webmaster talked about the children  It was revolting but slightly understandable  but still messed up  I felt like that though out this book  The different levels on the timeline and the complexity of the event make you understand this sick love story while logically and ethically still opposing that  I really liked how confused it left me  This is a keeper Electra complex  mixed with the obsession with Lolita It is the fire of an elder men  It is the loins  the lust that drives this romance In my life I have met many men  obsessed with younger girls  obesessed with the nymph like grace they carry around with them  in their cheap lipstick  their white dresses fluttering in the wind like Marilyn Monroe in  the Seven year itch   in their high pitched voices and their gossips about the new stock in H M or Sephora But it is meant to be a tragedy It is the soul of a weary forty year old  with a nymph The mortal is doomed to die  yet the nymph is eternity  Lolita proves handy as my lemon test for figuring out whether people are worth knowing  If  when discussing it  they reveal that they think it is a book only or even primarily about an old dude sleeping with a young girl  then I do not discuss literature with them anymore It may not be worth arguing with people over  But it certainly is worth severing marginal friendships over  I found this a great read  interesting and some what fascinating considering the nature of the book  However  I felt as though half way through the book or part 2 onwards  the book became slightly boring  less enthusiastic and the story seemed to be dragging on for long periods of time with not a lot happening  until the very end   This book will take you by the neck and plunge into your stomach  making you gasp for breath and squirm in discomfort     That sounds bad   but its NOT  Its exactly what you want in a book because when a writer like Nabokov can grip your emotions as well as your imagination by the power of prose and suggestion then you have encountered literary gold  Sublime says it  Just read it   Splendido  E un libro passionale certo  anche carnale ma Lolita vive e si libra solo nella mente di colui che la ama  Un amore cosi intenso che fa dimenticare qualsiasi riferimento indecente all incesto o alla pedofilia  Lolita e un pensiero cosi reale che farebbe innamorare chiunque    Lolita e morta e immortale  This gloomy morning when I was peering out the window of the bus  while on the way to work  I thought about this book  I have read it a few years back  I vaguely remember the story line and characters  I recall a few incidences from the book if I try a bit hard But I do remember how it made me feel  I sense that feeling every time I think of this book  There are some memories that don t have a fine level of detailing but have an intense sense of strong  lingering feeling  This book is one of those  It has a special  and a very personal  tone  a sound  and a taste  I will surely savor it till I plunge in it s mystique again  Someday For now  I would have to find a justification for the hint of a smile that I have on my face every time I think of this book  I hope it would have been easier to make the tip of my tongue take a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  I last read this novel 6 years ago and I found myself so disturbed for having sympathy for Humbert Humbert and his version of  love  with young teenage girl  Read the opening paragraphs   so amazingly written  You should read this book  This novel was banned in many countries when it was first released  Nabokov was a brilliant writer  in fiction and also in his critical views  Many people have reviewed and analyzed this book better than I could  All I can say is that I will re read LOLITA every few years    2  I agree with what he said and her and him too and yes  I thought that was amazing  and oh my gosh I know and ya I couldn t believe that and no way   me too   1 Yes  yes it s amazing and all that  But I m also thoroughly enjoying the 1 and 2 star reviews its been given  I especially loved the woman that gave  Help My Puppy is Driving me Crazy  3 stars and gave Lolita 1 star   I actually listened to the audiobook  narrated by Jeremy Irons  What a trip  Irons  narration is fantastic  he really captures Nabokov s expressive wordplay  The story itself was disturbing  of course  but the language was so beautiful   I hadn t realised that  wordplay  has so many similarities with it s rhyming partner foreplay  It s a treat when words tease  linger and manages to force a sigh out of you now and then  The book is unique in a sense that the content and style contradict each other  and the result is classic The texture of prose is flawless  you ll end up reading  then re reading certain parts  And then there s the pace set by words  like an ardent lover  the author knows exactly when to speed up and when to slow down   ah  the emotions words are capable of stirring    Lolita  serves us a rich buffet which not only looks good but even tastes good  Bottom line  You are missing something big if you ve not read it yet   Klassika est  klassika   Pisat  rev iu kazhetsia bessmyslennym posle poslesloviia samogo Nabokova k amerikanskomu izdaniiu   v nem vse skazano luchshe  chem ia kogda libo

they usually pause for a second and I can see their mental Rolodexes spinning  looking for a polite response  The fact is  Lolita is probably the most convincing love story I have ever read  It is at once obsessive  deviant  and hysterically funny  Nabokov has layered this novel so intricately that meaning can be peeled from meaning  each sentence like a layer of onion skin  The glorious thing about this book is that it never once delves into sexual detail  everything is innuendo  and clever innuendo at that   This annotated edition is a godsend  One can reread this book several times as it is  with this edition you will want to cloister yourself away  wall yourself in with Fortunato and a candle and never come out into the light of day again  Read it   And for the record  I thought both film versions of Lolita were quite good  though Peter Sellers will forever be Claire Quilty in my book      I just want to say a few words about this wonderful book To me  Lolita  is just a love story  A kind of love that happens to be asymmetrical  between a middle aged man and a child  Don t consider it a creepy book  because it isn t  Don t expect it to be explicit  because it isn t Don t consider Humbert Humbert a monster  but a poor devil  Just enjoy the beauty of the writing Regards   Lolita e o titulo de um romance em lingua inglesa  de autoria do escritor russo Vladimir Nabokov  publicado pela primeira vez em 1955 O romance e narrado em primeira pessoa pelo protagonista  o professor de poesia francesa Humbert Humbert  que se apaixona por Dolores Haze  sua enteada de doze anos e a quem apelida de Lolita  O professor  que ja conta com uma certa idade  desde o inicio se define como um pervertido e aponta como causa um romance traumatico em sua juventude Mas em funcao do inicio chocante  sem duvida o livro ficou famoso como um dos romances mais polemicos ja publicados  tanto que antes de chegar ao publico  foi rejeitado por diversas editoras I just finished reading Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov  What a book  Nabokov s writing style is like no others  I love the way he writes  I already knew the basis of the story  so I wasn t really surprised at what happens  What surprised me was that I thought the relationship was more consensual then what it really was  I thought Lolita loved Humbert as much as he loved her  But Lolita did not  And that s what shocked me  And I couldn t help but hate Humbert for doing this to Lolita  Even though he was definitely mentally ill  I couldn t help but wonder if he didn t care that he was robbing Lolita of her childhood  Not really her innocence  because she wasn t particularly too innocence  So no  I didn t feel remorse for Humbert  Or I didn t until near the end of the book where he says  I loved you  I was a pentapod monster  but I loved you  I was despicable and brutal  and turpid  and everything  mais je t aimes  je t aimais  And there were times when I knew how you felt  and it was hell to know it  my little on  Lolita  brave Dolly Schiller  Just like Holden  Humbert s perception of things was altered by his mental illness  So what he didn t bargain on at first was the fact that Lolita wasn t really a  nymphet  who was sexually ready to be with an older man  She was just a young girl with a young girl s crush that she soon grew out of  And he was a grown man with a grown man s love for a little girl who didn t love him  And when I got to understand that  I began to feel sorry for him  For if it wasn t for Annabel s sudden death  if it wasn t for the fact that they never consummated their love for each other  then there would have been no Lolita  which he frequently states in the book  While on the topic of Annabel  I realized that this book must be an expansion on Allen Poe s Annabel Lee  For just like poor Humbert  the speaker of Annabel Lee lost an Annabel when they were by a Kingdom by the Sea  And Humbert calls her Ms  Lee in one part of the book  He even says he started to look for another  Kingdom by the Sea   And no one could ignore the obvious allusion to the poem when he says  the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied   Maybe this book was intended to detail the speaker of Poe s poems life after the death of his dear Annabel Lee  Needless to say  I loved this book   Let me first praise Vladimir Nabokov   such a brave writer   _ Lolita is all about Humbert Humbert who had lost the love of his life when he was 14  and thus he developed this obsession  or I don t really know  illness      He would prefer nymphets over middle aged women   even if he himself  is a middle aged man Somebody who hadn t read this would deem it as just another pedophile related story and Humbert is a villain  a demon  a destroyer of a child s life  But the way it was told made all the difference  To me  Humbert was simply a victim of an ill luck You d probably think I am mad for actually sounding like I am defending Humbert Humbert who is a rapist if according to the Law  a devil if according to the old ones  But you have to read it to understand why he had my sympathy as well  Of course I pity Dolores Haze   Lolita Lo  but that was the default track  Anyone will pity her  But there had been actions from her that tells she s partly to be blamed for what had befell on her  But since she was indeed a silly kid who looked like she was misguided as well  it is only fair to have her mother  the obnoxious mama  haha  take part of the blame as well It was a great read  It makes you wonder  And I constantly wondered   how would this book sound like if Dolores Haze wrote it  Would she say in the end that she  at one point or another  had loved Humbert Humbert as a man  I d like to know that  My favorite novel slightly edging out Penn s All the King s Men  Any superlative one could think of will apply here  great  beautiful  extravagant  sensational  tour de force  masterpiece  At the same time many things in this book are revolting  creepy  unsavory  and shocking  But  Nabakov possesses such an immense poetic talent and sharp comic wit  that this novel becomes a magnificent confluence of the sacred and profane  Humbert Humbert is the supreme character when it comes to the world of fiction and hardly a book could match the power of this one man much less the detestable  lovely world N  creates around him   Amazing portrayal of a disturbed individual   Having seen both of the film versions  but never having read the original novel  I felt it was high time to do so  especially given the fact that this year is the 60th anniversary of what I know now to be one of the greatest  most groundbreaking  and controversial fictional works of the 20th century By turns  darkly funny  tragic  and disturbing  the now well known story involves the obsession of a middle age man  Humbert Humbert  for his landlady s 12 year old daughter  Dolores Haze Nothing about this novel is simple or straightforward   Lolita  having lost her virginity the year before  is hardly a dewy eyed innocent  and in spite of Humbert s passionate love for her  we later find that the feeling was hardly reciprocal  Although the superior Adrian Lyne film version is very faithful to the novel  something the earlier Kubrick film couldn t hope to be in 1962  even his film can t capture what is at the heart of Nabokov s masterwork  mainly that of the unreliable narrator Can we really believe everything in the journal of a pedophile and murderer who confesses at the end that Humbert Humbert isn t even his real name What is most haunting about the novel for me  however  is the destruction of a young girl s childhood  Toward the end of the story  after Lolita has left him  Humbert is standing on a cliff  looking down on a small town and hearing children at play  He narrates   I stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope  to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background  and then I knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord   I recently re read this book  and enjoyed it a whole lot more the second time  Since I liked it the first time  too  that s saying something  What s amazing about this book is how beautifully it s written  in spite of it s unsavory reputation  You can run through a huge variety of emotions while reading it   and it s definitely something that should be read more than once  just to get an idea of all the things you missed the first time  I highly recommend the Annotated edition   it really helps understand the more obscure references  Say what you want about the innapropriate content of this book  it is still beautifully written  And the fact that Nabokov can make you empathetic towards an otherwise hateable character  is brilliant  It is  and always will be  one of my favorite novels  Capolavoro  This book is a true masterpiece of Literature  At first glance it is the story of a perverted psycopath s descent into madness and murder driven by desire  lust and mania  But if you shift away from that you realize that it is an exquisite work of art  The best thing about the book is obviously the gorgeous and tricky prose which alone makes it a mandatory reread  The writing is littered with word play and anagrams which are used as tools to force the reader to focus on the langunage rather than on actions   events themselves  Nabokov spins a web of words and draws you in to be enthralled by his mastery but punishes you in the same sentence by reminding you of the underlying theme  He challenges you to continue reading at every other paragraph It also delves deep into themes of love obsessive desire  morality  fate and free will with an interesting take on the timeless theme of good vs  evil  There is even a good old American roadtrip thrown in the middle which brings to fore the culture clash between Old Europe and Young America Ultimately  this book is one of the best things I have ever read    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palette to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta    She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita   I feel like most people who rated this book low didn t understand what it was really about  They probably do think that the book was intended to be about Humbert Humbert  a pedophile who is in  love  with Dolores Haze  Lo   a young girl  and were grossed out by that and thought the story was horrible because he is clearly abusing her  Yes  He is abusing her  And he is also describing it as him being in love with her  and her manipulating him The point is that you were supposed to understand how much Humbert Humbert twisted reality  how much Lo couldn t stand him but stayed with him because she had nobody  And that s what makes this book so wonderful  Lolita is about a man who twists reality for it to advantage him Lolita is about being disgusted with ourselves for sort of liking Humbert sometimes  He is a disgusting person  yet he is a very charismatic character But Lolita is also a very well written book  Every time I read it  4 times now   I was stuned by Nabokov s talent  Lolita is pure poetry to me  That s why it s my favourite book   I am surprised at what ease men can read this with compared to women  The males in my life who have read this describe it as funny and mention Humbert Humbert as a bit of a dandy  whilst women mention finding it distressing  So far  I ve really enjoyed the lyricism of this novel and found a few moments troubling but it has been worth it One of those books  or rather  experiences   that stay with you  And you think  this is why I devoted my life to literature  And why people create categories of  great  literature I remember my heart almost breaking by the time I reached the end of this book  It is one of the most profound texts I have ever read  What leaves you the most shaken by the end   SPOILERS    Is it the fact that it is a taboo relationship  in fact  a scandalous one  and STILL by the end you are shedding tears for the protagonist and almost condemning his  Lo  for leaving him  The fact that what you remember about him is not the  dirty old man  as he is repeatedly referred to in the book but rather his essentially endearing  somewhat bumbling and clumsy nature  Nabokov has reached the mastery of his art since he is able to retain empathy  even innocence  in his so called criminal who is  if one looks at it baldly  destroying a fragile little girl It is the sheer visual tapestry of this book  it s musical and beautiful language  that floats you along and you don t consciously realise that you are reading about paedophilia  possibly even rape  No  neither Nabokov  nor the readers of his book  are condoning such treatment of a 12 year old girl  The author brings out a serious issue  a taboo relationship  and with it  he outlines the damaging effects on the psyche of not just the little girl  but also her father lover  Humbert  We participate in their pain  confusion and misplaced passion as they travel through the United States  We become carried away by the sexual undertones of the book  so subtle  yet so disturbing And one realises that Lolita the book is  at its very heart  a love story  A story of unrequited love where the object of the protagonist s love gradually becomes his everything  his whole life  the purpose for his existence  We watch as the self deprecating Humbert becomes consumed by Lo and we weep along with him when he loses her first physically and then  heartbreakingly  to another man If I have a bone to pick with the book  it is in the character of Lo herself  What was the purpose of building her up as jaded  promiscuous and not even a virgin before she sleeps with Humbert at the tenderest of ages  Is it to extract sympathy for the protagonist  keeping in view that the so called innocent  nymphet  was already corrupted  Or that as the stereotypical  bad  girl  it is not surprising that she receives such a childhood Lolita  this literary masterpiece  raises as many questions as it answers  After finishing it  you are not quite the same person you were before  It disturbs  it moves  it changes and it gives unresolved agony  And I think that is the embodiment of truly lasting literature  Porno or masterpiece  But this is begging the question In Lolita you have that rarest of birds  the pornographic masterpiece  I don t think a serious reader can de couple the story from the language in this book and the story is all about a dirty old man wanting to hump a fourteen year old  Recall the scene where Lolita inadvertantly jerks Humbert off with her feet and compare it to a standard issue porno novel of the sort issued by the now  sadly  defunct Greenleaf Classics  It s the same but likely far more salacious because of the female s age  On the other hand  here you have perhaps the best prose of all American novels and two if not three of the most memorable characters in Am Lit  I love this book because it breaks down all the pre defined categories of filth versus art   erotica  versus porn  the indecent and lowbrow  with a lack of  socially redeeming values   versus the esteemed and highbrow Good going Nabakov  Somebody should have the courage one day to actually film the book accurately   I had to put the book down several times  I thought I could deal with an older man coveting a young girl  I was wrong  It spent a year on my bookshelf  I couldn t bring myself to read it or even look at it  Looking into the life of someone that is not only coveting but actually believes that he loves this girl made my stomach cringe and regurgitate at the thought of someone doing that to my daughter  Who knows  He probably did  The fact that I have a six year old daughter might have something to do with my reluctance to finish the book  I m going to finish it by August 2008 because I want to get a deeper look into Humbert  There are two types of pedophiles  those who hurt their victims and those who love them and don t believe they are hurting them   I m loving them   Such beautiful language  such dark meaning  Excellent piece of literature  would recommend to anyone who would like to read something that will challenge them morally and make them think outside the box  While the book will make you very uncomfortable with its content and its ability to make you sympathize with the main character  it is still a very fun and enjoyable read  It provides a refreshing point of view  Probably the best opening paragraph I ve ever read  This book is hauntingly unforgettable  Passionate and moving yet deeply disturbing  the prose is so beautiful in such a wrong way  I loved it  This continues to be my favorite book ever written  It s written beautifully  playing with the English language and the universe it creates is like a living  breathing  horrible thing  It presents you with the narrator  Humbert Humbert  who is a pathetic  broken man who clings so desperately to his childhood love that the rest of his life is marred by his uncontrollable  awful  and tender love of beautiful prepubescent girls  This novel is polarizing because the subject matter is so delicate  a pedophile who systemically marries a woman  allows her death with little sympathy  kidnaps her young child  and takes her across the country  raping and manipulating as he goes  But it is true that the importance lies in how the story is told  the character of Humbert is sympathetic and that s the real evil of it  You see his thoughts  his dreams  and you re riding along with him through every revelation he has  Lolita is dark but manages to read  at times  light and romantic  The wording is dense but you share Humbert s joy and  subsequently  the byline of Dolores  suffering  It is suggestive and never graphic  This is an important book about America  about children  about the 50 s  youth  love  and pain   What can you say about lolita  I watched the movie with Jeremy Irons first when I was about 14 myself and hated him and the story because I thought it was vulgar  I think it has overshadowed what I might think if I read the story having never seen the film  I guess I ll never know  However  the story alone I can now see is very beautifully constructed and although the topic is controversial and humbert is a pig  I enjoyed reading it and would read it again just for the pleasure of the language and description  Nabokov s prose is at its best in this infamous tale  The controversy of the subject matter is inconsequential to me   what really matters is the profound depth of the imagery  I became a glutton for Nabokov novels immediately after finishing this book  gorging myself on his rich  powerful style time and time again  A very great book  but it is indeed tragic What Humbert felt for Dolores was true  I mean it was really love and passion from the first time he saw Dolores and all  What Dolores felt for Humbert  from my point of view  was actually falling in love for someone when you re 12 years old  It was like falling in love for a movie star when you re in that age and actually wishing the things Dolores did to Humbert After I read it  it was like I couldn t look at any pretty kids the same way   Nymphet  as what Humbert called them  I like the way Lolita appeared  with the gorgeous hair  the way she talked  and the way she dressed  She is a young woman  Reading this will also put you in that way of living  I was a little disappointed with the ending  because why would Lolita betray Humbert  Why  After all of what he did  I liked the story  The way Lolita acted in that age  It was so badass It depends on how you look at it  I know a lot of people did not like the plot because of their age difference  For me  it was really passionate and endearing   Well  that was an interesting read   Humbert Humbert is a fascinating character  a mentally disturbed pedophile  an incestuous father  a disgusting human being  And I never thought I could appreciate a book where the main character is so depraved  Rape  seduction  incest  murder   this book has it all  But the fact that we are able to dig deep into this monster s rotten mind    the fact that he finds justification for every crime he has commited    the fact that Nabokov is such a master in human psychology    that s what makes this a great book  Lolita deserves 5 stars  no doubt  It is extremely well written  the story is captivating  the word play is brilliant  I have never read anything similar  The most disgusting thing about this novel is not the unpalatable passages of pedophilia   no  the real crime is that Nabokov crafted this masterpiece in his second language   how embarrassing for all of us  Sick with green envy  Nabokov conducts your emotions like a Wagner Siegfried Funeral March  I need to read more Nabokov  I enjoyed the controversial spin this book put on human morals and societies perception of said codes  How Nabokov twists the readers pre established ideas and fills in a lot of detail as to why the character of Humbert does these things It gives a slight insight into mental illness  also of the different circumstances in which this applies and also the moral high ground of the audience themselves  we are made to feel sympathy towards Humbert and we are made to be able to relate to him It s an odd slant to put on the concepts challenged in the book  and this is why i enjoyed it  It was different and exciting  This book simultaneously dazzled and enraged me  What a great  twisted book  If this story wasn t told in the first person  it wouldn t have been nearly as successful  That Nabokov puts the reader in the mind of our sad  demented protagonist is pure genius  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Humbert Humbert  you dirty bastard  Un autentico desafio moral  pura provocacion  placer tecnico y fenomenal espacio connotativo  La burla y la sinceridad en una misma voz Me quedo con una lectura sobre la muerte del Autor  Magico My favorite part of this book is the very beginning  where Nabakov writes  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  Gives me shivers every time I read it  Lolita  Music of my mind  sickness of my soul  My heart  my love  my shame  Lo lee ta  A lilting lollop of the licking lingual addendum lunging languorously towards the lip  laughing leeward like a limp  lovely lily  Loo  Lee  Ta I have just completed my second journey through the pages of Lolita  Well  I suppose the paper passage has only occurred once  as this second experience happened via audiobook  read by the masterful Jeremy Irons   I hear he starred in a 90s remake  perhaps I should watch it   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  angels and the archangels  seraphs and saints  look kindly on this book review I find it difficult to exactly pinpoint the effect that this book has had on me  Since my first encounter with it a few years ago  a strange phantasm presence has lingered in the quiet recesses of my brain  with a mocking laughter that nagged naughtily at my attempts to excavate definite impressions  I had read it in a rushed fury  with a mad admixture of pleasure and perplexity  my palpitating heart puttered pitifully like a portly pugilist past his prime  practicing My absence from Lolita has felt like fevered nightmare  a sick parody of reality  Alas  I did not own a copy  the book I had originally read had been loaned to me  so I was forced to satisfy myself with cheap paperback substitutes  One such desperate attempt has stuck with me  I was wandering through the streets of downtown London during my study abroad  when  out of the corner of my eye  a tattered volume caught my attention  It was sitting in a display window in a musty old bookstore Without thinking  I rushed in  pushing a rather heavy glass door and entering the shop  I thought such places only existed in poet s fancies  Massive shelves were stuffed with ghastly volumes  with horrifying titles like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey  that seemed ready to collapse under their own horrid weight and crush poor me  Poor me  who only longed for that half forgotten joy that I had indulged on a nearly empty train car  four years ago The man at the register was a classic old lecher  Bald  skinny as a corpse  dressed in a drab  gray smock  He gave me a Dostoyevskian grin  revealing a mouth full of silver teeth  He was Russian  or Ukrainian  or something  Keeping my eyes trained on the ground  I managed to ejaculate my humiliating desire   One moment   he said  and walked over to the window display  He came back holding a little square object  which he rudely plopped down on the counter  Five pounds   he hissed I slammed a 10 down on the counter  swooped up the book  and secreted my package home under my overcoat  I walked up the stairs to my flat in a febrile daze  the staircase seemed a maze  the air seemed a haze  I was crazed  amazed  and definitely raised  if you catch my drift As soon as I shut the door of my small apartment behind me  I gingerly placed the book down on my table  It was a dirty little thing  with a cracked spine and a faded cover  But in the cover illustration and the quaint yet bold font of the title  I seemed to catch a fading glimpse of my passion  Without even removing my coat  I threw open the book  and ran my eyes over its pages with the desperation of a criminal on the run I finished a few hours later  It was an agonizing bliss  I was shivering and wet with sweat  But then  like a monster coming to life inside me  I felt an upwelling of remorse and shame for being so inconstant to my dear  my only  my immortal love  In one motion  I picked up the book  rushed over to the window  and threw it with all my might like a Frisbee  Oh  mon cher  s il te plait pardonnez moi What a fool I was  and am  and will always be  But it is all for you  my Lolita  As the succulent last sibilant of the audiobook faded into nothingness  I was reminded how distant  how intangible you are  how intangible you must forever be  If I could  I would claw my way inside your lines  and run my nose over the soft curves of your dialogue  I would kiss every pore of your descriptions  I would gently caress your finer  more delicate passages But here I stand  once more  like a starving orphan looking in to a happy family having Christmas dinner  My dear readers  you don t have to feel sorry for me  I don t deserve it  I only ask that you smile slightly at I sing my song  along with the invisible choir of demons that accompanies every moment of my life  A tale of a Man tortured by the wiles of a nymphette named Lo   His tragedy is every man s tragedy   Only most men go to the grave without ever realizing the joys and agonies experienced by that of Humbert Classic  Lush  Taboo This book will either provide a lesson   or sicken your soul  In the honorable house of art there is a lounge of love  Under its glittering  enticing settees and sofas  velvet and hessian  under them  lie rotten peels of a strange fruit surrounded by an ancient dust  These are Lolita As  Riku did  so will ITout comprendre  c est tout pardonnerIn English  this would be  All understood is all forgivenAt certain levels  Nabokov s Lolita is about this  That if we lend an ear to a monster  we may very well end up siding with him  Not completely  of course  That depends on the monstrosities a great deal  which in the case of Humbert Humbert aren t dumb or droll  a word Nabokov might be imagined to use  in English tantalizingly and excessively borrowed from the continent   Nabokov s novel  and I m in disagreement with Riku here  is not so much a Post modernist novel than one in which Modernism lives its moral dilemma  If Modernism was about exploration of inner lives and plot thin character studies  Lolita is a late Modernist masterpiece that raises the simple moral question  what if this rigor of Modernism was applied to a monster in the old sense of the word  We have in fact  a romantic monster in our midst  almost like a 19th century European monster  segregated from the History of the continent  and planted by a superb ruse into mid 20th centruy America  It is through the monster s denial of monstrosity that we chance upon the general depravity of the continent  of what Riku has chosen to call apocalyptic  The Modernist rigour produces a strange effect  we understand HH a bit too well  Here the temptation to harp upon the unreliability of his voice has to be avoided  HH is not so such unreliable as he is unreal  As much as we loathe him  we cannot say that he did not  love  Lolita  again in the old sense of the word  Another takeLet us spare Nabokov the Oedipal universe of Sigmund Freud  one which he abhors  In a late Lacanian Post oedipal universe  Lolita is the focus of drive  From a perspective that knew more about their sexual acts  one could have concluded her to be the femme fatale  in the noirish fashion  But from HH s perspective  if one was to borrow from Zizek  she is the woman in whom he ex sists  Lolita embodies the death drive  The story itself is what it is  but the writing    it is rare that I find myself re reading a passage just to admire its phrasing  but that s what I found here  And it s well worth being familiar with the story  as it is part of the culture   Sublime texto  inagotable en su lirismo  No se puede creer como escribe Nabokov  Perhaps I should hate Humbert Humbert  a man obsessed with  nymphets    pre pubescent girls    But I can t  I never have  and years later his is a character that stays with me no matter what  The whole book stays with me no matter what  I love it  it s controversial but handles the issues in such a way that only those with the faintest of hearts would be put off  The style of the writing is simply fantastic  the kind that is incredibly detailed but so easy to read  I cherish this story as one of the greatest I have ever read  I empathize with Humbert and Lolita  and the narrative  from Humbert s point of view  is gripping to the very end  I thoroughly recommend this  Even those that come out at the other side simply LOATHING Humbert cannot deny that this is an amazing book  Though I first read it about three years ago I am constantly going back over small sections  and I am certain I will re read it in it s entirety very soon  This book has pride of place in my shelf  and in my heart  A dramatic  emotional and thoroughly touching story   A man detached from reality describes the arch of his deep and culturally inappropriate obsession https   www goodreads com search utf8     Probably my favorite book ever My feelings about this book are best summarized  I think  by the note written by Nabokov himself at the end of the novel   Lolita has no moral in tow   It is not an indictment of social factors that lead to pedophilia or an investigation of psychiatric disease  It is a portrait of people  all of whom are fantastically warped and twisted and troubled  and yet utterly human and relatable  in a way that is quite terrifying  really   There were little things I noticed along the way    HH s slipping in and out of 1st and 3rd person  the novel s strange relationship with names    but the overwhelming sensation I am left with is deep ambivalence  Parts of this book are disgusting  Parts of this book are beautiful  Any of the reviews on the back    the only convincing love story of our century  according to Vanity Fair     are only half the picture and do not capture the blurriness of this work  This is a book to be taken slowly  to be troubled and enraptured by  to put down feeling incomplete yet satisfied  This is simultaneously one of the most disturbing and the most brilliant books I ve ever read  Stuffed to the brim with symbolism  allegory  and psychology  it s a literary theorist s dream  I get the feeling that I didn t even GET half of what s there  Prepare to spend almost as much time with this book as you would with Faulkner  I wasn t sure at first if I would be able to finish this book  You delve so deeply into Humbert Humbert s twisted psyche that it can be difficult to get back out again  Not that I ever felt like I WAS Humbert  but I felt a little haunted by this book for most of the time it took me to read it  While the content of the book can be horrifying  the prose is STUNNING   it reminds me of Anne Sexton s poetry sometimes  It mixes the super poetic with the obscenely everyday  Here is the opening two paragraphs of the book  no spoilers   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms  she was always Lolita  Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  a certain initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  Ladies and gentleman of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns    My LoLEEta This is my second time reading this novel and I love the fact that I was able to have a completely different reading experience reading this novel this time around  I focused on narration this times around  which shows just how complex and rich this work is  It s an aesthetic rich novel  it serves as a satire of know it all academics  and of course  it s a novel about  that thing   that is  the pedophilia thing  It s a disturbing novel  well  because  pedophilia is a disturbing topic and because this novel forces us to reconsider what is right and what is wrong sexually and the reasons for it  I believe that literature serves as a means to explore those topics that are disturbing  taboo  and yet common  which we are unable to discuss through other means  Now  I believe that Humbert Humbert is a PERVERT and that Dolores Haze  despite her own issues  is a victim trough and through  And because of that  there were times  seriously  were I wanted to stop reading the novel because it bothered me  despite the fact that it IS a work of fiction  However  sometimes we must look at certain things RIGHT in the eye if we are going to make sense of them  And I was able to make sense of certain things while and after reading this novel  A thought provoking and powerful work of fiction if there ever was one   nabokov has a knack for making you suffer along with his characters  even ones you never thought you d be able to empathize with  in this case  a pedophile  it s hard to read this one without rooting for humbert  despite his perversions  if you can get through this one without crying at least once  you are some strange sort of breed that i can t understand Humbert Humbert is what is called a  unreliable narrator   and Nabokov s use of the english language achieve that trough out the entire book the feeling of being seduced by the prose doesn t leave the mind but at the same time the sensation of being cheated by the narrator at the same time   Actually read in April of 2009  from the Library of America edition   The following is a summary of notes  or review  written at the time that I am moving to my Goodreads library  Many people never read Lolita because  as you probably know  it is a first person narrative of a pedophile  If you can stomach that  there is nothing graphic in the novel   you will experience an author with true mastery of the English language  Some of the very best writing I have ever read   Whatever anybody thinks of the pure depravity of Nabokov s story  his language is rich  thick  sticky  and clever  Lo Haze is an archetypal victim  yet she wields untold power over that perfect villain  Humbert Humbert    This story is everything you think it will be  plus layers and layers of tragic beauty  While I m amazed I never read this book before now  I m extremely glad I did not  The best novel I ve read in the past year  The wittiest and perhaps the saddest  I would be terribly jealous that anyone born in Russia could master the English language to this extent  but it is said English was spoken freely in his childhood household  A work of staggering genius  Fire bursts from the pages as the reader tries to extinguish the burning prose that seems to be so fine and soothing one doesn t suspect they are being dangerously engulfed  Veritable and unceasingly flowing  the book revolves around a man with a fetish for nymphets  Around the states with laughter  tears  and allusions that illuminate a humorous innocence  Abstract at times  the writing delivers a sensuous feel that rips the words out the pages and into your mind  Nearing the end  I felt that Humbert Humbert revealed a little bit of his past which might account for his concupiscence towards premature starlings  A joyride of confession and crazy recollections  With the release of his long pursued love  Humbert retreats to a world of sadness that reconciles itself  somewhat  with a last daring deed  A flamboyant  tactical approach to the strangeness of the substance matter  Lolita tells a tale of soaring dreams and unrequited love  At no point does the story slow  it actually gains momentum  just trying to figure out the imprisoned teller makes the novel worth reading         perche lei e morta e immortale  se state leggendo queste pagine  Premetto che questa non e una recensione  ma un brevissimo commento a caldo  nel pieno dell entusiasmo da fine lettura Non avevo idea di cosa mi sarei trovata davanti leggendo questo libro e ne sono rimasta piacevolmente sopresa  E scritto benissimo  a tratti e anche divertente  l uso che Nabokov fa delle parole e meraviglioso  Penso che potrebbe scrivere la lista della spesa e sarebbe un capolavoro  Mi sono commossa  ho pianto  ho sorriso e ho provato anche un po  di disgusto  ma credo sia normale Ho trovato anche interessanti i riferimenti alla capacita della letteratura di dare vita alle cose e alle persone e di mantenerle vive anche dopo la morte Ho messo in wishlist tutta la sua bibliografia  ovviamente  Lolita is a charming  witty  smart novel narrated by a monster  Through the cracks of H H  s wonderful florid words you see the tragedy of Dolores  a girl who s beauty is so rare that everyone around her means to destroy or possess it  This book is about ugly awful things and it is so thoroughly well written and imagined that you can t put it down  Bone up on your French and don t laugh too hard on the bus   as to make others around you uncomfortable  A modern masterpiece   OH MY GOD  THIS BOOK I ve never read anything like this and I m not only talking about the subject of the book  but of the writing it self  It was phenomenal  The characters were so well constructed and the story was amazing  You and I probably consider language a functional tool  occasionally entertaining and fun  but ultimately utilitarian in purpose  If language is paint  most of us are finger painters to Vladimir s Monet  Vladimir s Van Gogh  This man is the most skilled user of English that I have ever seen  with no exception and very few comparables  Shakespeare made up words to suit his purpose  Nabokov crafts sentences with such exquisite precision to give such purpose to his words that to see them used again outside his auspices detracts from their meaning  Under his studious tutelage will the fact that he s earnestly and devotedly courting a 12 year old girl seem a secondary consideration to his god like ability to describe it  It goes without saying that you don t read Lolita for a quick  plot based and action driven read  Don t dive into this thinking you ll be able to develop a true appreciation on the train to work every morning  The plot is unclear  weaving and unpredictable  to say nothing of the language itself  And that is where the magic of this book lies  the language  At first it may seem dizzying and unnecessary  but if it is confusing it s the most beautiful  exquisite confusion ever put to paper  He uses a sort of train of thought method  where each carriage is not less than 25 syllables  and its occupants the most fantastical  stylish aristocracy  Think Ulysses level structure and vocabulary  if Leo was slightly more literate and also a sexual degenerate  The plot is really quite secondary in my memory  although I do distinctly remember having a revelation about three quarters of the way through that I was intensely uncomfortable with the situation depicted  The book takes you on a mesmerising ride that hypnotises you flawlessly right up until reality comes crashing in  and all of a sudden your perverse involvement in the abduction of a young woman becomes deeply unsettling  Only Nabokov could manage to delay that revelation beyond page ten   Finally finished  Not the book s fault  life got crazy busy for a while  When I had the time  I couldn t put it down This is a phenomenal novel  The protagonist is weird  creepy  manipulative  and generally not a good dude  The writing is fantastic  I m glad I stuck this one out  a classic for sure  Just read it    If you are an English student  a writer  a Poet or a philologist  You will love this book  If you are just an average reader looking for a love story   I would recommend you get a cup of tea and read a novel by Nora Roberts in the company of your cat  This is the holy grail of literature   Absolutely beautiful writing that leaves me feeling a tad ashamed of my grasp of language and vocabulary  Though the subject is uncomfortable  my approach to literature is summed up nicely by Mr  Nabokov himself  For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm  No moral need be gained  Enlightening me to something beautiful is the goal  and any education gleaned is just bonus  When I first picked up Lolita  I didn t expect much  However this novel surprised and surpassed all my low expectations  It was a very light read but it contained such memorable twists and turns which always clasped my attention  The way Nabokov articulates his words makes this novel a fantastic read  Lolita  in summary is a novel about extreme obsession and pederosis but as you get into the novel you become the narrator and you understand where he is coming from and what he is going through  GREAT NOVEL  MUST READ      The state of my  to review  list is just frightening right now  I don t even like looking at it because it s like  10  books and a lot of them are ones I finished months ago  So     GAHHH  Anyway  it s been about two months since I read this book  And I admit  part of the reason why I ve put off this review for so long is because  well     I m not sure how to go about reviewing this book  I think it s the type of book that you just have to experience  because someone explaining it to you is just probably going to make you give them a look like they re crazy SO GUYS THERE S THIS PEDOPHILE AND HE ESSENTIALLY KIDNAPS THIS GIRL AND DRAGS HER ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND     AND     IT S REALLY AWESOME GUYS  TRUST ME See what I mean But     okay  I ll try to explain The way this book is written is just pure genius  First of all  the way Nabakov manipulates language is so great  there s a lot of dark humor in the book  a lot of clever use of puns     I can t really put it into words because you just have to read it  but it s really great And just like he is able to cleverly manipulate language  our narrator  Humbert Humbert  is also able to manipulate the reader s mind  I mean     throughout the book it was hard for me to decide whether I loved him or hated him  You re probably like   Brigid     he s a pedophile and a kidnapper  How could you love him   Well no  I don t love him as a person  As a person  he s super disgusting  But as a character  he s just so fascinating  and his narration is so great  and a dlkfj sljfsdl  I don t know  man  It s hard to justify my enjoyment of this book without feeling like I m digging myself into some deep hole  Obviously  the subject matter of this book is controversial and will make a majority of readers very uncomfortable  And yeah  the whole thing is very uncomfortable  understandably  But it s also genius how Nabakov unfolds the story  how he makes Humbert Humbert so convincing and almost sympathetic  Most authors wouldn t dare to create such a narrator     especially because we tend to think of criminals of any kind as being  other  than us  so it s so difficult to even try to get into such a person s mind  But  Nabakov does a pretty convincing job So yeah  I really like this book  Even though it s about a pedophile  I really don t know what else to say  YAAAAAAY   This book is beautiful  It is poetry in prose form  Nabokov clearly had a handle on language that most accomplished novelists dream of  If any of us had half of his talent we would be well known  The argument is whether to sympathize with Humbert Humbert or not  My take is that we are  meant  to struggle with it   Una trama increible con personajes increibles  Y no puedo decir nada mas de esta obra maestra  the topic is of course quite disturbing  though all we get are hints and bits  but the powerful language of nabokov makes it even more so  one starts enjoying a story for it s literary qualities and yet can never forget the disgusting nature of the narrator  a frightening masterpiece Apoteosi dell io narranteFissato nell immaginario collettivo per motivi essenzialmente extraletterari  Lolita e invece un opera straordinaria che incastona almeno tre romanzi al suo interno fra i quali sinceramente non saprei operare una scelta  il particolare triangolo di sentimenti bruscamente interrotto  l infinita fuga senza meta attraverso motels  autostrade  campi da tennis  supermercati  in lungo e in largo per gli Stati Uniti o la malinconica parte finale cui lo stesso Nabokov  attraverso Humbert  attribuisce il significativo sottotitolo di Lolita disparue Si chiude cosi con questa definizione un ideale cerchio che accomuna l autore  attraverso il suo personaggio  a  un altro martire della combustione interna  e anche qui  come in Proust  e una passione inconfessabile a costituire il fulcro del romanzo e del pensiero del protagonista Su tutto questo si erge uno stile senza paragoni  una sorta di apoteosi dell io narrante  che confessa  implora  altera i fatti  si interpone fra il lettore e il succedersi degli eventi per rappresentare dall interno della sua anima la struggente storia di un amore impossibile  There is something incredibly melodic about Nabokov s writing and his fluid mixture of English and French is a delight  Although dealing with a deeply disturbing subject matter  Nabokov produces a novel that is charming  intriguing  and difficult to put down because of its incredible character development  suspense  and plot  I feel like this is a book I could read over and over again without tiring of it  If the nature of controversy is limited to maturation  consider that males are latent  The socially accepted and slightly comical mid life crisis for males may be a misnomer as they are just coming into sexual peak  Nabokov as etymologist and entomologist uses the term nymph  As arthropods in metanarrativemorphisis  they are the immature and developing phase  It is Humbert that is the stunted nymph  Lolita was the compassionate facilitator for his love  Nabokov needs a sixth star  This is one of my favorite books of all time  The prose is haunting  I can still recite the last paragraph years after reading  While the subject matter is grotesque  the novel reads like an addiction and the reader can t help but immerse himself herself into the gorgeous writing and sadistic quality of the whole narrative  I felt like such a pervert while reading this book  Nabokov is such a genius at convincingly portraying his lead character that while reading it  I really did feel like I d turned into a pedophile  I read it mainly while travelling through Vietnam on rather crowded public buses  so I couldn t help looking over my shoulder the entire time to make sure that no one was reading with me  And even after I d convinced myself that no one knew what I was reading  I still couldn t shake this feeling of guilt  like I was complicit in the acts of the book  Powerful and perverted stuff  If only he didn t have to be writing about pedophaelia  sp      A lot of people are turned off by the plot and the character of Humbert  but I love this book for the way its written  Its clever  witty  and there is great character development  And despite the questionable intentions of the main character I found his musings to be quite amusing  I highly recommend this book   Viena megstamiausiu mano knygu  Butina kiekvienam vyrui    Viena vertus  noreciau patirti kazka panasaus  kaip pagrindinis herojus  kita vertus   velnias zino       blogai jam

fortrollning  hans karlek till Lolita som leder till mord och hans undergang ar lika tidlos som bokens tema   I think Nabokov is a genius  I can t imagine writing a book with such a deep understanding of a second language and a second culture  Every reading brings a new appreciation for Nabokov s abilities  because you can t possibly catch all the wordplay in one pass  I guess I need to get an annotated edition   And Humbert Humbert is the most pathetic and disgusting character ever   Depraved trash crafted so beautifully that the first paragraph took my breath away  This book is so well written it s almost easy to forget how monstrous it is  Incredible  but I won t be reading Lolita again  though I can t say I didn t know exactly what I was in for from the start  I read this book  in prison  no less  because I had heard many awful things about it and felt there had to be some redeeming features  I was correct  the prose is rich and varied  and the story is quite intricate  Yes  it deals with  pedophilia   but it does the job of any well told story  makes the reader think  I wonder if you could write this book today given the subject matter   that being said It s written beautifully and brilliantly  I found myself feeling compassion for Humbert Humbert despite his dark and corrupt tale  The prose is poetic and captivating  The pain is palpable  Great read  Tremendous listen  as an audio book   This is one of my favourite books of all time  if not my favourite and the story about how I stumbled across this book is a bit weird When I was eight or nine  I remember being cooped up in the house all day  so I decided I would spend that summer attempting to read every single book on the greatest books ever written list  I couldn t be arsed to read the entire list chronologically and I remember being drawn to Lolita because it had a pretty title  However  after reading it and reading about Humbert s desires  I soon realised that this was not a book for little kids  However  weirdly enough  that actually drew me into this book even more  Can I please note though  if you have reservations reading this book   it s not obscene or explicit  so unless you are very easily offended  it s not going to disturb you in that aspect I admired the poetic language in the book  and how it made this book surprisingly really easy to read  and I liked the idea of this book being a secret pleasure  I don t know why  but as a kid I liked the idea of reading things I knew I wasn t supposed to read As I ve grown older however  obviously some of my opinions on this book have changed  I no longer romanticise Humbert and Lolita s relationship as much as I used to  I ve began to realise that actually there is a huge controlling element in Humbert s character that morally I should be against However  this has actually made me appreciate the book even more  because I still marvel at how Nabokov is able to write a book so well  that the reader grows to actually sympathise with such a horrible character such as Humbert  Nabokov is able to portray this using wit and humour  which is something I ve always been in awe of  and if I ever become a writer  it is something I hope to be able to achieve myself when writing a book Nabokov is able to achieve this effect even further  when it comes to his bittersweet ending  I m not even going to explain what happens  because I don t think I ll do it justice  but just read it  I promise you won t be disappointed  This book is just stunning and I can t even properly put it into words how much I adore this book  but I promise you  you won t be disappointed reading it   A difficult read  Absolutely filthy story  but the writing is stunning in its use of language  in its descriptions of  misplaced and terrible  ardent desire  in its study of a troubled man  in the nostalgia of mid century America Nabokov s prose is intricately woven and finely beautiful  that it s a little too easy to unknowingly fall into his narrator s trap of  fancy prose style  self deception and rationalizing  At times I really could believe this was a love story  The portions dedicated to Humbert seeing Lolita for the first time in 3 years   pale and polluted and big with another s child  but still gray eyed  still sooty lashed      and his last wishes for her contain some of the most arresting passages of heartache and anguish  But  and this is probably because of my own history  there was never a point I ever sympathized with Humbert more than I did Lolita  who is irreparably damaged and hurting always and nothing at all like pop culture s conception of her Nabokov s Lolita  for all its wit and fragile eloquence is ultimately a tragedy  a story about delusion and twisted lusts  For anyone to come away from this book believing it to be a love story is the very equivalent of Humbert feigning sleep during Lolita s sobs in the night  every night  every night   Well to start this book took me way longer to read then I was expecting but  it was amazing  I started off buying it because I wanted more contemporary Russian authors to read  basically I went into this book not knowing anything about it  I was in a surprise but I feel in love with Humbert s emotional personality  His love for Lolita is what I find divinely beautiful  but what many others find disgusting  Anyways  I recommend this to everyone  especially those ready to leave there comfort zone  It seems my whole life the universe has been telling me to read this book  I finally did  and was angry I waited so long  I will confess to reading a book that came with notes to provide context on his many wordplays  but I often skipped over those notes just to enjoy the read  I mean  what can I say about a book where the narrator is the vilest of the vile and yet I find myself rooting for him  Wow  A fantastic read  Went through it in four days because I couldn t put it down  I actually bought the book because Solzhenitsyn mentions Nabokov as an example of the cultural drain on the Soviet Union  I couldn t agree more  it s a pity the Russians can t claim this literary masterpiece as their own That being said  the way Nabokov leads the reader on throughout  as you slowly realise the depths to which he will descend for his love  the way he narrates the imagery of the USA  all stunning The character of Humbert Humbert was quite possibly one of my favourite characters ever  His upbringing  quirky snideness  French phrases  I feel sorry for those who don t know French     all brilliant  Feb 19  2012  A stunning masterpiece  Truly enchanting performance by Jeremy Irons  A perfect work of art that will stick with me forever Oct 22  2012  Some thoughts before getting too deep into my second reading   The thoughts that remained with me about this book several months after I read it was the way that it differentiates readers from one another  The emotional responses that people have to the book seem to vary widely  from people asking questions like  Was she really raped   to people saying  He s a monster    I think the power of and my affection for the book lies in just that  It was so subtle  and the narrator was so manipulative and self apologizing that you could easily get seduced by him  This was his special talent that he used for evil  Perhaps it s unfair and overly judgmental of me  but I get to glimpse into the minds of readers  from above mentioned rape apologists to people who think the book is  gross  and stop reading immediately  and see how susceptible they are to influence  to victim blaming  etc  It s incredibly interesting  and a bit depressing  This isn t to say that there weren t moments in the novel when I was seduced by the narrator  but there were carefully placed reminders throughout as to how awful he was  and how unhappy Lolita was tl dr It s just a very interesting delve into psychology  Here are three lectures  one  two  three  from Open Yale Courses that I plan to watch while reading  er listening  the second time   The moral sense in the mortals is the dutyWe have to pay on mortal sense of beauty Brilliant in that Nabokov s fluid depiction of Humbert s mind is so vivid that I felt sympathies towards Humbert s affections for Lolita despite his twisted morals    Disturbing for the psychological justification of Humbert in the beginning of the book made him relatable to other people s experiences and make reader fall for the paradoxes between the seek of beauties and the debauched means of pursuit  After reading the book I felt the lures of Humbert lays inside of the mind  disguising itself as evil or sublime  If you enjoy getting that strange  twisted up feeling when you watch Walter White at the meth lab then you re going to love the neurotic knots Humbert Humbert will tie up for you  To all who like the idea of rooting for the bad guy get ready to be abused into the weirdest of all ambivalences  Ironic  but the flow of comments both for and against LOLITA only showcase the beauty of this book  Even at the time it was scandalous  How can you ever like the story  the intentions  the horror of a child being exploited and falling prey to a monster of a man     But then the beauty of the book is in the way it places the story in front of you  with HH as the storyteller  It is not the author but HH who shares the dark secret  The credit to the author is for bringing forth such a dark topic  to pen it down in beautiful language  to describe and not disgust  Do not read it to check it off a list  read it to know this sort of a mind  of the lurking predator  You need to have a an open mind to appreciate such a topic or even comment on the atrocities of writing this book  For only then you can really see why it is beautiful  why it is unbearable  I read this book while serving in the Peace Corps in a country where young girls got married as young as 12 and 13 to much older men so you can imagine how difficult it was to get through it  You don t know whether to empathize with or hate the characters  I think that s what makes this book so superb  I believe it s much more than a book about a pedophile  You need to read between the lines to appreciate what the author was trying to convey  It ll mean something different to each person who reads it but it s still worth reading   On my second read of Vladamir Nabokov s Lolita  I am still left with the same experience  not including the magnificence of Nabokov s writing  that Humbert Humbert is a predator There is no  truest love story  as reviews over the ages have said  This is the image of a sick mind  a man who uses fear and manipulation  to include threats of violence to engage in carnal acts with a very minor child  My skin crawls  So why  then  five stars  Because Vladamir Nabokov is brilliant in writing this faux autobiography in the mastery of his fluid and cheeky and appropriately witted voice of Humbert Humbert  Because he completes the story and because his gift is in honoring the creation of the story that perhaps in 2015 would be unrealized because of the subject matter  I remain in love with my dear Vladamir Nabokov  fully satisfied with the artistry that is definitively his own  With Lolita  there area numerous conversations to be had  There is no mystery about why Lo stayed with the wicked Humbert Humbert or why she ends the way she ends  as far as we see her   I do only wish that Humbert had been arrested for his molestation of the child  But  that is not the journey we are to take with Humbert  The good doctor s preface is enough to ensure that we know that this story is NOT to serve as a romantic view of child molestation as well  But as for Nabokov s amazing writing and his crafting of this treacherous story and character  Brilliant  Besides getting swept up in something so unthinkably dark and loathsome  all the while hating myself for finding the beauty in a perfectly created  perfectly identifiable human monster  Welll    It would have to be the fact that Nabokov writes in English better than most of the contemporary native English speakers could ever hope to  I ve read his others  all of them   and this still remains my favorite His writing style to me is like a fluffy pink bathrobe  Immediate almost nostalgic comfort with the immediate realization that you are wearing something you would NEVER wear  even at home with no one watching  Nabokov samoe luchshee   Lolita  e um livro que retrata o tema polemico da pedofilia e e contado como se fossem as memorias do pedofilo  Humbert Humbert  E tambem um livro de viagens dado que  a determinada altura  eles viajam por varias localidades na America do Norte  nos anos 40  se nao me engano  pois Humbert ve se forcado a partir sem destino certo e nunca ficando no mesmo lugar  devido ao segredo terrivel que ele e Lolita escondem Da primeira vez que o li prendeu me imenso o discurso de Humbert  conhecemos a razao pela qual e pedofilo  quando se apaixona por Lola  a forma como a historia se desenrolou ate descambar numa paranoia constante de ser perseguido  Da segunda vez fiquei mais interessada na motivacao de Lola  apesar de a perspectiva ser sempre a de Humbert questionei constantemente a  inocencia  de Lolita e afligiu me como e facil cair na ratoeira de ser adorada por um homem adulto para ser abusada por ele Lido duas vezes e tendo visto ambas as adaptacoes ao cinema  foi na versao de Kubrick que finalmente compreendi aquela cena final  em que Humbert ve Lolita pela ultima vez  Apesar de nao morrer fisicamente aquela cena e a  morte  de Humbert  o fim da ilusao  do seu sonho  E tragico porque  apesar de nojento  ou proibido ou simplesmente errado  Humbert e um homem que ama e perde E pela contradicao que o livro me fez sentir  ou seja  simpatia e compreensao pelo vilao apesar de condenar os seus actos  que o considero tao bom  Fora que Nabokov escreve muito bem  mas isso nao ha duvidas Ler a opiniao completa no meu blog Facinating  Twisted and beautiful and frightening all at once  I m excited to go to an all day seminar about Lolita  Definately deserves the  classic  it bears  I was sad when it was over  I wanted it to go on  Also the first time in a long time that a first person narritive held my attention for so long  Wow  First time I ever read  listened to  anything by Nabokov and I was blown away by his mastery and love of the English language  It was made even better by the fact that it was narrated by Jeremy Irons  Irons captured Humbert Humbert perfectly and I totally believed I was listening to a true confession  full of stubborn views  dripping sarcasm and scorn  and painful longing and regrets  Yes  Humbert is a despicable and amoral human being  but it s still hard not to get wrapped up in his story  This is probably the best audio book I ve listened to thus far  Download it now  Wow  The last sentence is amazing   I am thinkng of aurochs and angels    This was a funny  heart rending book  Nabokov is smarter than just about every reader out there  so expect to be wowed by his writing  His writing  I should add  is not condescending and not undeservedly pompous  This book encapsulated every past relationship experience I have ever had  minus the part about them being with twelve year olds   What seems on the surface as a study of a pedophile and sexual predator results in a very honest study of obsession  infatuation  loss and expression of love  I can t think of a book that I ve read that has accomplished this more entirely    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  Best first lines ever Read in a hospital bed in the early 90s  Plan to reread UPDATE  Over halfway through the second time  It s as delightfully written as I remember  He can certainly turn a phrase  Disturbing  Disturbing  and did I mention Disturbing  Of course I could not put it down  A truly beautiful book  It is rare I feel that a book can ignite in a reader a few earnest feelings  whereas here Nabokov hands you a slew of them  The writing in so genuine  sensual  and at times almost erotic  though Nabokov is careful to avoid ever being lewd  that the reader is charged with all of these great pleasurable feelings  only to then be reminded that we are speaking of a twelve year old girl  which in turn issues within us a deplorable shiver  There were times I emitted actual verbal sighs  gasps  moans  or groans  Who were these for  There was no one to hear me  And yet the story was so powerful somewhere in the physiology of my system  my body felt the must be uttered  So well written  such a wonderful story  shocking and sensitive  with an ending I found as beautifully crafted as anything else within the work   Firstly  I must admit that Nabokov  as someone who wrote a novel in his second language  captured my heart like not so many authors did before   I don t view this book as pornography and I think that nobody really should  That s not Nabokov s intention  What we have here is ART     The story is disturbing  it makes you want to lock your children away from all the sickos of the world and keep them safe  even like in my case when you have no children of your own    Every word is dripping with sensuality  This book is incredibly well written and I highly recommend it  4 5Absolutely fascinating read but an absolute nightmare to review  When I told people I was reading Lolita  I was met with mixed reactions  Some said they had to abandon it halfway through  others said that it was one of their favourite reads  I won t lie  There were times when I felt really uncomfortable  and I began the book with huge reservations and apprehension as to how Nabokov was going to let Humbert s obsession with Lolita play out  Thankfully  I needn t have worried  Whilst Nabokov s poetic prose was undeniably seductive  it was also incredibly haunting  and twisted  and conflicted  and it s what made Lolita such an incredible read for me  It was dark  It was complex  The prose was extremely rich  and incredibly deep  Nabokov was one step ahead throughout  and I m definitely going to be reading his other works  This book is really difficult to review  so I d suggest you just read it if you re interested in it  I d recommend this book to readers of modern classics  However  it won t be for everyone  and it definitely comes with a huge trigger warning  View review here  http   vivatramp blogspot co uk 2014     I resisted reading this book for forever  sure I would hate to read a book from the perspective of a somewhat sympathetic pedophile  A friend finally insisted I give it a try and I was immediately glad he did  Extremely well written  it very soon reminds you why certain books become classics   I am re reading this novel and finding it even more enjoyable this time around as I discover new meanings and twists in the narrative  It s been thirty five years This time around I am noticing that Nabokov s technique of narrative via memoir  diary  letters and other scraps and fragments of remembrance signal a discomfort with traditional narratives and their all encompassing scope and focus  a focus that often seals up the story  characters  and the action into a translucent jar where no new elements or possibilities can be introduced or even imagined  Hamlet uwill still only find Yorick but a skeletal remembrance  another lost father figure  Anna will forever fling herself with each reading into the path of a locomotive and out of the hope of renewal  Nabokov wants Humbert Humbert and Lolita to not only double up and morph into the vagaries of composition  he wants them to evolve into a multidue of possibilities  ever seeking new tangential lives outside their first encounters with the text and its readings Nabokov s narrative is based on a Dostoyevskian mode  the unreliable narrator  A narrator whose diary is destroyed and one that he remembers verbatim  according to him  It is a story told from the confines of a mental hospital prison inhabited for 56 days  The narrative style is best mirrored in the letter Charlotte leaves Humbert  a letter that he loses and yet offers up to the reader as an exact remembrance  one the he recalls verbatim  And yet this letter has the rhythm and sound of Humbert with its prompt to throw it into the  vortex of a toilet  which he offhandedly admits to   Even the news of Humbert to Charlotte union in the society column of the Ramsdale Journal finds purposeful missteps  Her name is incorrectly rendered as Mrs  Hazer  Humbert claims his name as Mr  Edgar H  Humbert  and later he tells her that  society columns should contain a shimmer of errors   as do all narratives  shaped and formed with the care of a true story teller  And thus deception and revelation work hand in hand to tell this story  reveal the truest impulses and foibles which haunt both the reader and its characters Nabokov lets his narrative loose among this chaos of form for he believes that narratives  true ones  materialize exactly in this manner  that our lives are but fragments that we piece together and negotiate alongside and in concordance with a multitude of other narratives  That was one heavy read   The more I think about it  the more this book completely transcends everything that comes to mind when one hears the words  madness    obsession    despicable    passionate    loss of innocence    a regular novel  Stunning as it is  Humbert does not fit the typical protagonist  but then  Lolita is not a typical novel  Seems obvious  but Nabokov did a remarkable job of creating a real character that seems to exist so much in real life  It is the vice in him that never dies out  One may point fingers at Humbert but there is another crucial character that seems to suffer from the exact same thing  Perhaps one of the great wonders of this book is how Humbert goes in blaming this other character  Here  we see a true madman  One who is completely separated from logic  reason  so it s no surprise that a loss from morals sets in as well For one person  this book may not receive a full 5 star rating because of they raise their noses at Humbert s actions  I do not blame you  But the portrayal of a person who plunged the very deeps  kissed the edges of cliffs with his toe way out to the side  and all in anguished silence  I think it is the true portrait how far and how deep one can be beside oneself due to the reckless abandon that such love for another being can cause  Primitive  corruptible  wild  but never dying  Just as Humbert s vice will never die Sometimes we carry things inside us that can ruin us or lead us to false illusions  Sometimes we carry things that are the very sparks and tiny fierce flames of life  In pursuing it  that is our very undoing  To kill it would be like to take all of the stars out of the sky  all of the trees from the grass  and the very sun from its rightful place in the sky  To take oxygen from this world  We wouldn t ever feel or see anything in its blurred  sketched  or over saturated color Such is the irrational  swerved way of thinking for Humbert  And feeling  Me encanto  Escrito de una forma impecable e inteligente con una trama por demas interesante  La forma en como Humbert  el autor de las confesiones plasmadas en el libro  describe a Lolita  desde su color de piel a como juega al tenis  y sus perversiones con ella es de una sutileza tal que se acerca a la perfeccion  Como pequena critica se puede decir que tiene algun que otro pasaje de mas  por ejemplo cuando narra el trayecto del viaje que el y Lolita realizan  mas alla de esta pequena observacion el libro es totalmente recomendable  I won t degrade this book by putting the crappy cover with Dominic whatever her name is on it  and I won t ruin this lovely book by watching the movie How talented a writer must you be to be able to endear a lowly kidnapping pedophile named Humbert Humbert to millions of readers  Now  before I get to the review  let me just say that this is my all time favorite book  I have worn the ink off the cover from reading this gorgeous gem of literary magnificence many times over  If I have ever fallen in love with a book  a story  a fictional girl  it would undoubtably be little Dolly Haze and the tragic story of her ruined childhood aptly named Lolita  for all she ever is in Humbert s eyes is his fetishized play thing  his Little Lo   Now I know people are going to go apeshit when I say this  but  I don t believe Humbert to be a monster because of his attraction to pubescent girls  There have been loads of stories where a preadolescent girl and a full grown man fall in love and sometimes have sex  Wanda Nevada  The Professional  Kodomo no Jikan  etc   and I personally don t believe there s anything wrong with that as long as the girl is 12  and fully willing  No  what makes Humbert such a sick  depraved  unforvigable bastard is not his hebephilia  but  instead his cavalier way of blaming his own sick crimes on his unwilling and trapped victim  Dolly  It is not ok to imprison  rape  and slap around your stepdaughter because she playfully flirted with you and at one point wanted to have sex with you  It is not ok to twist things around and use your pretty little words to make her seem like a depraved whore when she is really a normal child with a slightly higher than average sex drive  Anyone who villifies Dolly and says she s just as corrupt as Humbert is really screwed up in the head  Do we really live in such a rape culture that it s considered ok to rape and abuse someone just because they showed sexual interest in you at one time  I think the way Nabokov separated the two halves of the book was nothing short of genius  In Part 1 we see a happy  annoying  cheeky  flirtatious Dolly  even with her neglectful  abusive mother she still turned out alright  playing a lighthearted game of seduction with Humbert  the resident monster hiding behind good looks and boyish smiles  Dolly is such an engaging  realistic character and I found myself drowning in adoration towards the precocious child  I really do wish Nabokov would have written even the smallest drabble in her point of view  at any point in the story  Anyways  in Part 1 things are sweet and sexy and fun and hush hush don t let mother know  and you almost think that it will turn out to be a love story played straight  Then Charlotte dies and things get even better for Humbert  Now he has his plaything all to himself  He picks her up immediately from camp and she s more than happy to have sex with him that very night at the hotel they stay at  he even finds out that she had sex with a boy named Charlie and one of her girl friends at camp    But things turn sour when Dolly wants to call her mother in the hospital because Mr  Nice Guy lied to her about her own mother s death so that he could screw her instead of wiping up her tears  He told her before when he picked her up from camp that her mother was sick in the hospital  Now  after having fucked the daisy fresh girl  he revealed his lie and she spent the rest of that day and night bawling her eyes out  It s not spelled out blatantly  but  anyone with a brain could tell that she no longer trusted him and wanted out of their relationship  In Part 2 things are more gloomy  They travel across the country  all the while Dolly says she doesn t want to be with him anymore and threatens to call the police if he won t let her leave  He  successfully terroriz es  poor Lo   actual quote from the book  by telling her that she ll be shipped off a convent if she tells the police anything  She is completely trapped and must do whatever her stepfather wants her to do  She becomes more and more miserable as the story goes on and the book does not hide this fact  At one point  Humbert even tells the reader that Dolly cries herself to sleep every single night  Somehow Clare Quilty  an annoying playwright whose petty personality and other noxious ways make him out to be even worse than Humbert  stays in contact with Dolly and the two set up a plan to help Dolly escape  Two years after Humbert first took her on this trip across the States  she does escape by going to the hospital and leaving with Quilty  Humbert goes on a wild goose chase looking for her and never finds her  He eventually gives up and settles down somewhere  having a brief affair with a childlike woman named Rita  Three years later  Dolly sends Humbert a letter asking for money  saying she s married and with child  and about to move away  Humbert mistakenly thinks that her husband is the one who  stole  her from him all those years ago and plans to murder him  When he gets there  however  he finds that Dick  her half deaf husband  is obviously not the man he wants  He realizes how much Lolita truly means to him and begs her to come back to him  She refuses and he gives her the money he promised  He then leaves  but  not before asking who took her away three years before  Dolly explained that it was Quilty  and that she couldn t believe he hadn t known  Humbert then drives to Quilty s house  and murders him in an awkward  messy way  He is later arrested  but  before he is apprehended  he stands up on a hill overlooking a town  He hears children playing  crying out  laughing  screaming happily and says that  the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord   He also says that if he had come before himself  he would have given himself thirty five years for rape  Now if even the rapist admits that he has done what that title suggests  how can so many people read this whole book and say that he s actually innocent and that Dolly is actually some evil little vixen who ruined his life  HE ruined his life the day that he lied to Dolly about her mother  The day that he terrorized her into staying  The day he beat her  The day he ruined her life  he also ruined his own The thing that people seem to miss about this book is that Humbert did not love her until the very end  It was not  love at first sight   it was obsession at first sight  To Humbert  Dolly was a posession  a toy  a sex doll  Her emotions  her thoughts  her feelings  her likes  her dislikes  they couldn t mean anything less to him  It was only after he d lost her that he realized what a treasure she was  and how he blew it by being a selfish piece of shit  This book will always remain my favorite  Nothing could ever rival this work of art  I assure you  Dolly will stay in my heart forever and always  a constant reminder of tragedy that I believe everyone should keep near to them  to warn them against real life tragedies soon to come  Love your children  protect them from strangers  don t let them wander through this world alone  Don t allow your son or daughter to become the next Lolita on the news   I love unreliable narrators  I love all the Poe references that I picked up    and I m sure that there s quite a bit of French literature references that went right over my head  I know the bits of French dialogue definitely did   4 5 Stars   Does  Lolita  dip a toe into the waters of  disturbing    creepy   and  a little gross   Yes  it does  How could it not   have you read the premise But Lolita is probably the most prolific writing I ve ever come across  Nabokov is a master of using language in a myriad of ways and each sentence is playful and lyrical in it s own way  It was absolutely beautiful to listen to  simply because of the masterful way in which each word was chosen  each sentence crafted  I loved it   Without a doubt one of the greatest books ever written   dense and demanding to be sure  but also endlessly playful  stacked with layers of meaning  jokes and prose so beautiful and musical as to be almost extatic  Often misunderstood or reduced to cliche  it s one of those classics truly worthy of  re discovery  There isn t much I can say about this book that hasn t already been said   but  for me  this is hands down  my favorite book of all time  And  that was TOTALLY unexpected  I decided to read  in fairness  I listened to the audiobook format  read so masterfully by Jeremy Irons  Lolita on a whim   it s a classic  and I was getting bored with the contemporary reads I was reading  so I decided to shake things up and go classics for a bit  Holy moly  this book will take you through the paces  for sure  At first  I was utterly repulsed  I m not so sure how  in our society  that the contemporary meaning of a  Lolita  is a come hither young temptress  says A LOT about our society that THAT was many s takeaway    but  this story is about a straight up pedophile  oh  and apparently  that isn t even quite accurate as  as I learned  there are many different names and types of pedophile  depending on what age range the sicko is into   So  at first I was like  abandon ship   as I wasn t quite sure I wanted to hear more about that  But  Nabokov   he is a flippin genius  The story was so masterfully crafted  and so utterly smart  I felt wholly uneducated and  well  dumb  On any given day  I feel like a fairly intelligent individual   but  when faced with the mind of Nabokov  one is forced to reevaluate their mental prowess  The way he crafts a phrase  The way he describes things  The way you think you know what he s talking about  but then again   maybe not  It s almost like a dream state  Things feel so real and tangible  but then  it s so bizarre and abstract that it can t be real  Suffice to say  I will be reading this one again  While I loved Jeremy Iron s audio version  I think I m going to check out The Annotated Lolita  book version  that comes with a virtual decoder ring for the great and twisted mind of Mr  Nabokov  This will be one of those books where you see something new each time you read it  So  if you are an open minded individual and can get beyond the obvious sickness of Humbert Humbert  this truly is a gem  If it weren t for the subject matter  it is THIS type of writing we should have been reading in Literature class  So layered  So complex  So much meaning  It is not to be missed  Oh  and a small little aside I found fun   being a fan of the Police  band  and a child of the 80s   Don t Stand So Close To Me  was always one of my favorite songs  but had no idea what they were talking about when they say  just like the old man in that book by Nabokov   So fun when things click into place   even after 30 years  Nabokov  though saying his name out loud doesn t make your tongue dance like LOLITA does  but Nabokov does accomplish something else  He makes your head dance in the skull   I sound miserable  I know  I am trying to Nabokovise my prose  I hated Humbert  and loved myself for hating him  I pitied him and despised myself for that too  The story begins with such a beautiful paragraph that I instantly knew that I was going to love it  Nabokov writes like He is the god of English  as if He can do with it whatever He wants  And if the same brilliant story had been told in any other way by any other writer  I bet that it would have made a miserable read  Nabokov dilutes  at the expense of readers ever conscious conscience  the whole tragedy and painfulness of the story by using the most masterly constructed adjectives and pronouns  It is a story of destruction  of depravity and a childhood tormented  Destroyed and mutilated by the ruthless Humbert Humbert  Humbert  for me  belongs to the pedigree of Iago and Hamlet  There is a method in his madness  His cultured and erudite outlook conceals the fiend within  But still  How much is He to be blamed for all that happened  As the principle instigator of all the tragedy  He sure is responsible  and His persistent attempts at trying to shift some of it on Lolita s shoulder makes him even despicable  But still He is a loveable character  for we relate with him like we can t to a lot of characters  He speaks out our most abject and grotesque thoughts   we all have some at one time or the other  with such eloquence  clarity and humor that makes you smile just like the hopeless         HE is  He is one of us after all  isn t he   It makes it all the more grave and horrifying  when we suddenly realize that lurking around the corner in the street or resting with newspaper on lap  trying to hide  in the park  the amicable looking gentleman might just be Humbert the Monster Humbert the Pedophile is abhor able  Humbert the Lover  maybe  is not  What He did was absolutely horrendous  What he felt  maybe was not in his control  What I am going to say here now  is more of a random thought that kept tickling me all the while  rather then a proper theory or something  Truth is  we don t get to choose what we desire and whom we love  Actions are a matter of choice  emotions are not  Suppose that Jay Gatsby loved a women and wanted her in his life  all the while knowing that she was a wife and a mother  This did not had any affect on his feelings for Daisy  He loved her hopelessly and madly  Though the literary allusion might not be a perfect one  but what I am trying to say  is love chooses us  we don t choose it  love controls us  and we follow with waging tails  It makes a fool of us  and in Humbert s case  a monster  My point of view is not a deep one here  it s just something I would love to discuss with all of my GR friends  Since primitive times  child marriage has been a norm  a despicable one nonetheless  in many of the societies around the world  Still in many Arab  African and South Asian countries  they are happening  It s the normal for them  has been for years  But it s downright atrocious for us when we learn about any such case  Homosexuality is as old as humanity is  It has always been present  hidden here  explicit there  In some countries its quite normal now for two men or women to marry each other and spend lives together  have a sexual relationship and a family  But many among us would shudder at the very mention of such a possibility  Simply because it isn t  Okay  according to them  What then  I dare ask  is okay   Is there a definite OKAY   Would it have been less a crime if Humbert was not her Stepfather  Did the coalesce of Incest and pedophilia made it all the more horrendous  Lolita has left me with so many questions  some of them might just be quite stupid ones  But tell me this  Don t we all have a deviant in us   A Humbert the blasphemer  Don t we all have that one thing that we love and adore and desire  but we can t have it just because it s not OKAY to have it  to be it   Don t we all have a Lolita   I won t take the  pedophile  interpretation of this book  It s simply too pat an explanation for a writer as sophisticate as Nabokov  This is a book about language  About being in love with language like one is in love with a young girl  It s great art and is about as erotic as a wet beach towel  But OH that language        ml kbyr dhy   lSyt ws  lshhr  lys bHj  l y tqyym  w bd ar rf  lqb   wHsb    khsh   n shyy an ln yrwq ly b d qrth I was told by my Creative Writing teacher at Valencia that  Lolita  was one of the best pieces of literature that she had ever read  She was not lying   Lolita  is told through the pedophilian eyes and disturbing yet histarical thoughts of Mr  Humbert Humbert  It is a very dark tale  but also a genuine love story  Humbert Humbert is in his 50 s and is infatuated with what he calls  nymphets   a k a girls between the ages of 9 and 13  He needs a place to stay where he can work on his writings  so a woman by the name of Charlotte Haze allows him to rent out one of her rooms at her house  She is a single mother  with a twelve year old  innocent yet flirtacious daughter by the name of Dolores or has Humbert likes to call her  Lolita  He falls in love with Lolita the moment he sees her  There are so many twist and turns in this story  you will not want to put it down  Vladimir Nabokov is a master of dark comedy and tells a tragic story with an uncanny style  He makes you forget at times just how disgusting and immoral Humbert really is by showing that he has a genuine love for Lolita  This is the novel that allowed Vladimir Nabokov to quit his teaching job and become a full time writer  and rightfully so  An excellent read  By Chapter 20 I realized that this book is both disturbing and hilarious  Disturbing because of the content  and hilarious in its wordplay and wit  Although Nabokov would disagree  I believe that now  in our Dateline NBC  To Catch a Predator  Chris Hansen days  it is sickly mind blowing to think of how many Humberts existed with impunity  It may also cause some to shy away from this novel  However  to do so would be to fail what I believe was Nabokov s test  Can you look past your own biases about content in order to appreciate one of the most brilliantly crafted novels of the 20th century  Can you stomach the first person narrative of an unrepentant pedophile  There is much for us to learn and appreciate from the tale of Hummy  Mummy and Dolly   OMG Nabokov is rubbing off   no pun intended  On so many levels  this book is definitely not for the feint of heart  Only the heartiest of readers will be able to love the beauty of Nabokov s language and witty wordplay in the midst of Humbert2 s lusty lamentations of the charms of all nymphets  charms   demonic  and alluring 8 14 year olds  he encounters  especially those of the elusive Lolly  Dolly  Dolores Haze  housemate  step daughter  A true  haze  to him  a haze he is under  then finally over  all over  until it is inevitably over  At its base  the novel is a peek into the mind of an obsessive pedophile  one who is so driven by the 12 year old object of his desire that all rules  niceties  barriers are transgressed for redress  It is also a road trip novel unlike any other  an homage to the old days of the new motor hotel  a bed and a washroom for the price of a fast food meal today could facilitate fractious encounters on unclean coverlets after you ve registered with anyone s name  address  and license plate but your own  Ahh  The days of anonymity  before sex offender registries  Humbert Humbert  you smooth talking pervert  Unapologetic and peripatetic  Like fine

the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  Look at this tangle of thorns        the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years  never less than ten I should say  generally thirty or forty       between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphet s spell Overtly  I had so called normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins for breasts  inly  I was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as a law abiding poltroon I never dared approach  While my body knew what it craved for  my mind rejected my body s every plea  My little cup brims with tiddles  How marvelous were my fancied adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling

tired of being cynical  I read and reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title Know You Own Daughter       Welcome  fellow  to this bordello  Being inclined to be lenient  I only shook my

durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita  I love this book for two reasons  unconventional story and exquisite descriptions  It talks about a genial middle aged man Mr  Humbert who came from the old world was obsessed by a 14 year old young girl in America  Then  they had a short but happy time together although the social burden  However  their distorted love turned to a tragedy in the end What caused such a tragedy  The answer is controversial  But in my opinion  the serfism and greed of Humbert ruined the life of that girl  Deeply affecting  with scenic and vignette like paragraphs of prose  I never anticipated liking this story given the grotesqueness of the subject matter  at least  to my fragile sensitivities  And yet  Nabokov entrances with his hauntingly real characters set against an all American suburban backdrop   Prior to reading the book  I was not aware of what it was mainly about besides that it did stir up controversy  I have always seen this book around  but never had the chance to read it  I think it is good to read books that may push the boundaries and are controversial because the give you sometime to talk about and discuss with other people  Lolita is a classic  It is written as a reflection of the main character  Humbert Humbert  and his love for Delores  Lolita   a nymphet  It starts off describing Humbert and his past and his moving to America  He marries a woman named Charlotte  He soon discovers her daughter  Lolita  and develops a love for her  The story goes on and is filled with both love and tragedy  The book is filled with many emotions Lolita was a nice book overall  but I did have trouble reading it when I was approaching the end of part I  I think that it was because Hubert is by himself without Lolita  because he mainly just complained and rambled  As the story progressed I started to read at a regular pace again and it was not very hard for me to carry on  Overall I think this was very interesting to read  because it is a little out of my comfort zone but still a great book  Still creepy It s difficult to fault Nabokov s Lolita  Nabokov s first person narrative and character analysis of H H is engrossing and despite the controversial content I felt a wide array of emotions towards his protagonist  The obsession and hopelessness of H H s illness love for Lolita is portrayed effectively through Nabokov s poetic words and outstanding use of the english language  Wonderful twist at the end  and I was pleased I had not read the foreword first  Nabokov is a literary genius  Now time to brush up on my vocabulary   I work with a fiction editor who can spot a writer who doesn t read from ten miles  Nabokov is an apparent craftsman  but one erudite and humble enough to borrow from the masters This annotated version points out the one million and one literary references employed by the author   many to James Joyce  Lolita s an enjoyable  but challenging read  For me  the experience was a combination of awkward tension  painful embarrassment  and uncontrollable laughter  Humbert Humbert  Nabokov s protagonist  is an amazingly complex character  He s despicable  egotistical  self delusional  and dangerous  yet he s also exceptionally intelligent  sickeningly loving  and tragically wretched  Beyond the pure brilliance of the writing  the truly remarkable part of reading Lolita is Nabokov s ability to draw us into a character we instinctively want to reject  I was left not liking Humbert Humbert  but understanding him more deeply than I thought was possible  Pa min klassiker liste   og starter med det darlige Der er enkelte passager i bogen  hvor Humbert rabler lidt ud af en tangent omkring  hvilke moteller de bor pa  og hvordan de ser ud   men det er ogsa absolut eneste anke i den her eksploderende bog Resten er forrygende godt skrevet  med krudt mellem linjerne og lige til at blive i godt litteraert humor af  Vil faktisk ga sa langt  som at sige at Nabokov er den storste ord ekvilibrist  jeg har modt indtil videre og han sugede mine ojne til at danse over siderne De forste 200 sider er en lang spaendingskurve  som sigter pa fuldbyrdelsen af Lolita  hvilket faktisk kom som lidt af et antiklimaks  Det var flottere at laese Humbert beskrive hendes flammende blode skulder end deres eskapader pa et lagen   som han nok klogeligt valgte fra pa grund af tiden og censuren Flere steder balancerer Humbert mellem gentlemanskab og singsyge eller en frimodig blanding  og den absurde slutscene hvori Quilty bliver skudt er De meget sjaeldne top karakterer er pa sin plads her   inspirerende som en solopgang og dens sjael banker som en evig flamme  All the stars  All of them  In his advice to writers in The Guardian  Geoff Dyer is all   Don t be one of those writers who sentence themselves to a lifetime of sucking up to Nabokov   And I m all   Dude  WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE  DO YOU EVEN LIFT       Audiobook narration  by one of the Mssrs  Humbert himself  Jeremy Irons  is as solid as it gets  This book is amazing  everything by nabakov is amazing  don t be freaked out by the storyline  please read this book  it will change your view on the human experience  And it will help you understand the police  Its no use he sees her he starts to shake and cough just like that  old man from  that book by nabakov  Deeply Disturbing  sickening  powerful  haunting  beautiful  I hardly know how to describe this one but it was really amazing   Several years ago  a former professor of mine talked about how great of a book Lolita is  The idea of reading this book was thus planted  Having never read a single Russian author  while I realize Nabokov lived in several places  and suddenly having the urge to do so  Lolita finally presented itself  After reading through the novel  I have to agree with my professor  This is literature of the highest order  The unreliable narration is outstanding in Lolita  Perhaps the best I ve ever read  What can you trust of Humbert s narration  Dialogue is often the only hint of credibility in the novel  And yet  Humbert s love for Lolita is sweet  sickly  euphoric  and disturbing  The prose is beautifully overwrought and frequently clever  For me  the ending is perhaps the most powerful of all  A great villain presents itself and the damage and the longing of Humbert will resonate with me for a long time  Mnogu sum gorda sto ja procitav ovaa kniga  Tolku revolucionerno delo napisano od eden bezsmrtno moderen avanturist ne smee da se preskokne  Llotita ke vi otvori novi pateki na analiziranje i preispituvanje na sopstvenite morali so sto ke ve ostavi bez zdiv Mojot omilen del od knigata  Ja donesov slednava odluka so seta zakonska sila i poddrska na potpisaniot testament  sakam ovie memoari da bidat objaveni samo po smrtta na Lolita  Na toj nacin  ni ti ni jas nema da bideme zivi vo toa vreme koga citatelot ke ja otvori knigava  No  se dodeka krvta bie vo ovaa raka sto pisuva  ti si del od blagoslovenata materija  kako i ja  i se uste mozam da ti se obratam odovde vo Aljaska   Lolita seems to be one of those books where people hate it or love it  Put me in the latter camp  I suppose it s one of those books that you could analyze again and again from myriad angles  I happened to read it the year R Kelly went on trial for his sexual exploitation of young girls  so to me  it seemed a really interesting look at the ways in which our American culture sexualizes and objectifies young girls and then blames them for any subsequent abuse or exploitation  Here was Lolita simply acting out or mimicking a grown woman s sexuality and Humbert takes it for authentic interest and sexual maturity  He warps her intent and justifies his actions in his mind  The narrator s POV is critical to understanding what has happened  I don t understand how anyone could read this book and not see or hear about Toddlers and Tiaras  or look at any female child star after they leave the Disney Channel and not see the links   stunningly beautiful  and yet the beauty is corrupted from within    it s a spectacular veneer for Humbert Humbert s depravity  What makes it so great is that we are made really complicit    that s a cliche that s usually not really true    but in this case it s very true  HH s prose is irrestible in some way  pleasurable to read  and so we re enjoying the romantic whitewash of a rapist  among the most complex reactions I ve ever had to any novel  and it s why it can be read again and again   A good book is always the type you have to read many times  It s not always  but it s usually the case Lolita is a marvelous product of prose writing  More than that  however  is the soul of a love story  crossed by the stars   It s not an easy read  as the images melt so seamlessly it gets one lost on occasion  That s the point  That s what writing is supposed to be  I guess  for the purposes of the great Vladimir Nabokov  The walls of creative writing broke down in his prose  and  as a millenial  I have only discovered it No  it s not an easy read  but for the reader itself  it s a test of character of gaining substance amid a meticulous style  Humbert s meditations on love  life  and his darling Lolita looks  at first  a prelude to erotic adventures  But no  no  mistaken was the reader for such perceptions that the world has posed on books like this Was it a love story  Was it  for all intents and purposes  a classic  That is for you to decide  Because however phantasmal the phallic fantasies of a 40 something metafictional character    ladies and gentlemen of the jury   the judgment remains into your hands  I m really glad I read this now and not in high school  Humbert s perversion is really apparent right at the beginning  but I think a lot of people lose sight of that when his narration begins to focus more on how she  seduces  him and their following sexual relationship  The way my mom explained this book to me  Humbert is a victim  and while he should have had more restraint  Lo did corrupt him and is partially responsible  With this as my precursory Lolita lecture  I would have missed that Humbert forces her to give him  fancy embraces  for pocket money  that she clearly despises him and is unhappy all the time  and that he has a ridiculously skewed view of real life because of his narcissism and uncontrollable hebephilia  I actually saw the Kubrick first  which is way more understated  for publicity purposes  than the book  It s weird that Quilty becomes a foil  the most evil version of Humbert  allowing the watcher to sympathize with Humbert more  You barely get Quilty s full name until the last pages of the novel  let alone his role in separating Lo from Humbert  Amazing prose from Nabokov  I m embarrassed I haven t read him before  but again glad I read this now as opposed to freshman year in high school    This is a book that I loathed and loved immensely at the same time  like many of the readers here  I detested the main character  his predatory views  his egoistical ways and filthy thoughts  I had the same feelings towards him as I did towards Flaubert s Madame Bovary or Thackeray s Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair  The difference is that the character here changes   Humbert Humbert does not necessarily see the wrongful ways in which he led his life  however  he discovers love and surprisingly  self sacrifice  From the calculated rapacious hunter he becomes a revengeful knight and the twist of the story lies here   when he decides to kill somebody like him  another predator  with this decision symbolically killing that part of his own self  Once this accomplished  H H reconcile with his fate Nabokov is my hero   he was raised and born in Russia  wrote in Russian and immigrated to Western Europe and finally to America  Considering all this  his writing skills in English are superb  he has such a good command in English that his vocabulary surpasses the one used by many American born writers I cannot stop thinking though about a few things  If Lolita is a symbol of the New America  then how much must have Nabokov hated Western Europe  The character he chose to represent it is a charming and educated pervert  displaying a trustworthy facade and hiding a deranged soul  While America  on the other hand  is reflected in Lolita the naive  the little stupid young harlot enticing the depraved Western European  ob rkana s m ot mislite i chuvstvata  koito s budi u men tazi kniga p rvite

Instead  Nabokov develops his characters so well that we ultimately empathize with Humbert  When I would stop reading at certain points and try to step back for a moment  I would realize the absolute disgust and moral deprivation that Humbert exhibits  but would be totally engrossed in the novel and continue to read on  As a non native English speaker  Nabokov demonstrates a command of the English language that I could only hope to one day achieve  His metaphors and vocabulary shine  one gets lost in his prose  Simply put  an amazing novel that is a must read    And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita At times I was shocked  other times I was amazed  Like someone who suffers from bipolar disorder  The plot was fine  but the use of words and the descriptions even if sometimes too long or boring  I couldn t help it but enjoy them  I didn t really love the characters  but I sort of understand them  So I think that the thing that made me give this book a 5 star review is the last sentence  It left me dizzy  I couldn t wrap my head around it and that s something that doesn t happen often   Nauseating  but brilliantly written  This book is at once great poetic prose and a hilarious narration of a self professed evil  I love it   Preview    Though I initially read this dark  gripping novel six years ago  Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita  keeps coming back to me  It is without a doubt  the one story that continues to reenter my mind as the years pass and helps me to analyze my understanding of and appreciation for other great works of literature  Many are aware of the perverse subject matter of  Lolita   but only those who have read it can comprehend its beautiful prose and contemplative nature Our protagonist  Humbert Humbert  lost his first love  Anabel  when he was 14 years of age and she  12  Not willing to accept his loss  he becomes obsessed with trying to recreate this simple love with other young  sexually aware girls  or  nymphets  even as he grows into middle age  He relocated to New England and boards with a widow  Charlotte Haze and her young daughter  Lolita  Immediately  HH becomes infatuated with the girl  and though he finds her mother to be loathsome  he marries her to cement his connection to his beloved nymphet A sudden turn of events  leave Charlotte dead and Lolita under the sole care of HH  Eventually the two enter into a sexual relationship  Much more can be said here  but I don t want to give anything away  It is a joy and a treasure to uncover the world of Humbert Humbert for the first time  I would hate to deprive you  In writing this article  I have been inspired to do something I have never done before  what with so many great books out there   to go back and reread an old favorite You may like this book if    you love to delve deep into a topic that most find repulsive and  perhaps  find yourself sympathizing with the villain  you enjoy the art and beauty of a story well told  you don t want to read about a cookie cutter world  you enjoy postmodern literature  you like explicit sexuality in books  think DH Lawrence   you love the idea of a story so very unique that not even 2 film adaptations can capture itYou may not like this book if    you simply want to be entertained and don t want to think about deeper issues as a result of literature  you think you may hate yourself if you end up rooting for HH  you think the story s concept is way too far fetched  you want a happy ending Nabokov logro llevar a entender  y hasta de cierta forma admirar  aun sin estar de acuerdo ni tolerar el amor de esa indole  lo profundo de una mente tan perversa  Mucho tiempo me habia preguntado que puede pensar  sentir  cual es su punto de atraccion en cuanto a la fijacion de un adulto a un nino  y he de decir que si antes de comprar esta tremenda literatura me hubieran avisado que trataba del amor de un pedofilo por una ninfula  no creo que lo hubiera leido  Solo cuando me fui adentrando en la historia  envuelta en la narrativa tan explicita y tan bien delicada de Nabokov fue que fui entendiendo de que trataba   pero ya no habia vuelta atras  ya estaba atrapada en su relato   y wao  Que gran experiencia  Humbert realmente amaba a Lolita de una forma que va mas alla  y lo compruebo al final  a pesar de que termina preso de su locura y de las rejas  Y a pesar de lo enfermo que puede sonar sus gustos femeninos  tambien esa Lolita dio indicios de ser muy avanzada a sus  tiernos  12 anos  Fue una relacion que fue fluyendo por ambas partes  por los motivos que fueran   pero Lolita era tan Lolita  tan libre pero a la vez tan presa de las circunstancias que se le fueron presentando  Ma gis tral   Funny  dark  romantic and disturbing all at the same time  Nabokov s vibrantly descriptive style did an outstanding job of putting me inside the mind of a man tormented by his obsession for forbidden fruit  Genius  I fully expected to be repulsed by this book  Certainly didn t expect the humour  The scene with CQ at the end is class  The language  the images  the sentences are to be savoured  Will re read  After reading everything else Nabokov has written  Can see why Martin Amis fawns over the man  I discovered this book after watching the movie  1997 version   I fell in love with the movie and then with the book  It s necessary to keep an open mind vision  but it s a beautiful story that gets a little bit dense in the middle  the description that Humbert makes of Lolita is chillingly beautiful and the book even has funny parts   Lolita  Light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul    Couldn t put it down  Really makes you question right and wrong  who takes advantage of whom  etc  Needs a re read  Nabokov s style separates this novel light years from most of the other authors out there  He had written so much before Lolita that this artist transformed an already impressive skill  such a writing  to an almost conspicuous way of telling a tremendously complex story where his insanely rich vocabulary shines throughout the whole book  After I finished the last page I immediately continued to page  one  of the next book in my list  and I don t know if it was because it was a translation to english  I m taling about Albert Camus  The Stranger   or just because of his style  but what I was reading seemed to be lacking something that inserted me truly into the novel  That is what I felt while reading Lolita  Nabokov describes the simplest situations in the most detailed  yet beautiful ways while making it seem completely simple and logical to put such particular words in that particular order  The story line is synester  sad  hilarious at times  but the real joy behind this novel is to appreciate the artistic expression of writing to the finnest  A book to be read more than once  a great example of a novel that implicates the reader in a profound way  Absolutely astonishing and extensive command of the English language has Nabakov  A must read  I was  forced  to read this novel for my English lit class my freshmen year in college and it will go down as one of the greatest books I have ever read  Dark  shocking  and disturbing  it is a beautifully written novel about the love and infatuation a man has for this nieve young girl  And that s really all I can say    let me know what you think    Lolita is beautifully  cleverly  and manipulatively written  Vladimir has a knack for enticing the reader into rooting for poor  limp wristed  droopy eyed Humbert without one being entirely aware of the ploy  but alas  therein lies the true core of a pedophile I want to give Lolita 5 stars    I really do    but whatever tiny shred of moral dignity I have left prevents me from praising something so completely vile that thoroughly   Dolores Haze  Dolly  Lola  Lolita Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita was published in 1955 in Paris and to this day holds a reputation of mulling a clandestine opera with a well brewed cabaret  Interspersed with motifs of old world romanticism  the American travel novel  Petrarchan thirst  a nubile parental awareness  a cornucopia of paranoia and a slight peppering of the heterodox erotic  Nabokov s work walks a lonely mile where few other writers have dared to tread  In the realm of pioneered ardor  his work which has often been questioned for its dubious expression of morals  and it laughs rapaciously at the reader who has kept reading  allowing the humming Humbert to quench his appetite by gorging on a very literal  yet literary Lolita in the brothels of our minds It has been often mentioned that Lolita is merely a pornographic escapade into the noxious imagination of an aging male  but this can be disputed in several parts  First and foremost  it is mandatory to keep in mind that the implied author does not share a bone blooded similarity with the average hebephile  his love for Lolita is in keeping with his tendency to regard a certain array of prepubescent girls as  nymphets   who exhibit an anatomical likeness with other girls of that age  but are precocious in their mental and sexual development over their inferior peers  This in fact stems from a long lost childhood romance which was tragically severed unconsummated and is suitably referred to as  Annabel Leigh  by the logophilic protagonist  From this perspective  Humbert s affection  criminally hopeless as it is  a genuine passion  an unrequited desire for the loss of that formative Eden  It is an escape from all that was never grounded in reality  but Lolita is real enough in Humbert s reimagination of her as a resurrection of that long lost season of le premier amour  The book while containing scenes of glaring intimacy between two individuals questioning the mother lode of all taboos  is rarely lewd in its description of all that the commonplace reader would come to expect from a book harbouring such infamy  If anything  Humbert  the big  hirsute  handsome giant transcends the carnal in his worship of Lolita  she is removed from the plane of fleshy friction into the domain of scintillating high art  Where anyone finds anything more to include condemning the book as a carnival of skin  perspiration and disheveled motel sheets  one can suppose such will be found when looked for in the most innocuous of fairy tales  Whether Lolita is a ethical book is  however  a more difficult question to answer and one that can seldom be answered with the untamed din of lackluster objections  Therefore  before this question is revealed to a bystander  it might be of paramount significance to inquire whether Lolita or any work of fiction for that matter is inherently disposed to have a didactic agenda  In the established norms of society pervading the 21st century  it cannot seem even mildly acceptable to place a middle aged man and a teenager in any circlet of friendship  let alone the annals of lust  Much opposed to the criticism which is often favoured by popular fiction readers around the world  Lolita actively articulates why exactly such amity is doomed into premature extinction through pages of pure poetry  Oui  c est une celebration de l amour  but it is also a premonition  a prevarication of sorts which allows the experiment to sustain its run in order to achieve its unbiased results  Nabokov s honesty is phenomenal and one must remember to distinguish the gilded throne of a body of art from the mortal coil of the artiste  Where the novel excels is in its humanizing of a man society would look to as the very degeneracy of the carcinogenic id  It does not write off Humbert as a man who savours a fetishism which is distinctively difficult to preserve  but a man who succeeds in imbibing a drop of personal euphoria to taste all the gall of the unending netherworld  His curse is sealed in his consummation of that dream which should perhaps remain imbued in our souls to never face the gentle caress of reality  To a reader it is advised to manducate this book gradually  masticating all the flavours of a tainted childhood and an obsessive future  gently remember the piquancy  the sweetness   the essence of the novel  before regurgitating every morsel and spitting it out into a boundless basin   If there is a better book written in English I don t know what it is Some people are turned off by its content  but I think it makes the beauty of its language that much more apparent  Anyway  the content is a fascinating study in how man will justify his actions  while still allowing just enough smidgen of doubt that Lola herself did try to seduce him      though ultimately  she didn t know what it was she was wanting until it was too late  Dr Humbert s favourite songs  Creep by TLCCreep by Radiohead Writing my research paper for my English class and I could not have picked a better book  What can I say  I loved it  Part 1 of the book was  disturbingly comedic   Humbert Humbert contradicts himself humorously and refers to his other what I like to call  sexual  persona  He tries to analyze himself psychologically but fails yet succeeds  What I mean by this is that Humbert Humbert succeeds in fooling the reader to feel bad for him  I felt extremely conflicted at the end of this book because I ended up tearing up   I actually felt bad for a pedophile  Nabokov perfectly weaved a story that makes the reader feel uncertain and question many aspects of the way people think  Nabokov often writes his novels in the perspective of detestable villains  You never like them  you re never supposed to like them  and Nabokov doesn t like them either  He slaps them around and humiliates them  And in the end  they pay the price for their sins  Readers never seem to realize this  They become immersed in the psychology of the book and feel defiled by it all  Instead  they should sit back and watch the bastards suffer  The stories are written in their own view so that makes the punishment all the more sweet  The reader knows exactly what the scheisemeister is feeling   pain  pain  pain  That s one of the reasons I like Nabokov so much  The bad guys really get it  It s not just getting killed or caught at the end  you really feel their anguish  Mmm    schadenfreude   I sort of believe the reason why most of the characters are 2 dimensional is precisely because of who is potraying them  a depraved person  A depraved person who commits terrible  unforgivable crimes against people  How could he commit those crimes if he saw them as the human beings that they are  It s easier for a crook to swindle if he dehumanizes his victims  At the end of Lolita  Lolita transfigures  She s a sensitive  care worn woman  but only because HH realizes her as such  That s why he can murder the man who betrayed her at the end  He was a filthy mongrel that deserved to die for what he did to her   She groped for words  I supplied them mentally   He broke my heart  You merely broke my life     I don t remember  but this could be the first time he  supplied  words  mentally  in a way that s true and unselfish  He finally understood her as a person and sacrificed himself to revenge her  Perhaps  HH s only redeeming quality  In Nabokov s books where the villain is the protagonist  the only other charachter with real depth or psychology is a character who the protagonists loves  The little daughter in Laughter in the Dark  Lolita at the end the novel  Despair  The protagonist in that one is a sociopath and doesn t give his novel mates anything  but their personalities pop out  You can feel them from the distance  Other novels I ve read by him don t exactly fit this mold  In Pnin  everyone is a little characterized but still quite real  Pale Fire is written by an almost villain and you love everyone but him  especially the wife of the poet  Invitation to a Beheading  not even the main protagonist was very real  He had the same consciousness and feelings that a  K  would have in one of Kafka s novels  But he had no believable history  it s all just a dreamscape that doesn t have half the terror as Kafka s novels have  I never finished Ada or Ador  It s Lolita x 10 in smuttiness   Is this really necessary    And it wasn t believable either  Just a fantasy  Of course  not all his novels are going to follow the same formula  but they are written by the same writer  the same mind  So I m still working on him  I really think he s one of the best writers of the 20th century  He doesn t just tell a story  he explores the psyche and human perceptions  how a certain person feels  sees  or reacts to things  If they were normal people  it wouldn t be interesting  but he picks villains or eccentrics   I think you can tell from my username that I love this book   I read this the summer after I graduated from high school  and I remember it as the first serious book I read for fun outside of a classroom  Even though the content and main character is disturbing  Nabokov just writes so well I couldn t put it down and wanted to read more and more   What is there to say really  This book is absolutely phenomenal  It s sick and twisted  and disturbing how I forget what I m reading and find myself feeling bad or rooting for Humbert  but Nabokov got me  he really did  Ugh  the way he spoke about Lolita was so beautiful  You forget who he is  This book is stunning  intense  creepy  sad  so freaking sad  and just perfect   This absolutely is a must read for everyone  This book is so sad  dirty  morbid and yet wonderful  Nabokov has a very specific writing style  worth admiring  I hated H H  Low human being  not in control of his desires  so selfish and pathetic  What makes me sad the most is that all people are Humbert but not brave enough to fulfill their most hidden  forbidden   needs  So sad  Lolita is a very dark and daring story of transgression and love gone wrong  It s a story of a sex maniac who willfully steals and destroys the innocence of a young girl  but the most disturbing thing about the book is the empathy we feel for the pervert Humbert Humbert  Nabokov is a brilliant writer using sardonic humour and sympathy  His effort is an eye opening for people to understand the mind of a maniac  Moreover there is no direct lewd reference to sex in the book  like i was misinformed before reading it  I have daughters  This was a touchy subject  That being said  I couldn t stop reading on and on until the whole hot mess was over  Humbert Humbert I hate you  want you dead  yet your words  your sentences  your prose   CAN T WALK AWAY Here s the deal  I was in a pedophile s mind for three hundred pages  and not just any pedophile  a narcissistic  lazy  whiny  neurotic  needy  woman hating one at that And still  I read on  Now if that s not a testament to Nabokov s genius  then I don t know what is What a sick love story if you can call it that  The last lines of the book are exquisite and broke my heart  It is  really  a tragic comedy of horror   I read this in college  and as with most books I read then  I didn t have time to read closely  I m glad I came back  because this really is a fantastic book with beautiful language and some of the dryest humor I ve ever encountered  I can see the subject matter turning one off  of course  but Nabakov s refusal to go blue leaves little excuse to not give it a try   What can you say about a novel about a middle aged man s affair with a pre pubescent girl  That Nabaokov manages to present the story in such a way that you don t care  you re not disgusted   in fact  you find yourself rooting for the pedophile protagonist  The writing  while a bit formal  is beautiful and makes you think  repeatedly   is he saying what I think he s saying         Una obra maestra de literatura irreverente  sin buscar serlo   un libro proscrito  quemado  prohibido    Un libro que ofendio a las mentes ofuscadas por romper todo paradigma sobre el amor y la literatura romantica clasica  Pero por sobre todas estas cosas  una obra profundamente romantica nacida del alma de un verdadero amante  Es imposible no sentirse escandalizado por el pensamiento a veces retorcido de su protagonista  Monsieur Humbert Humbert  pero cierto es tambien que es inevitable sucumbir ante lo humano de su amor  ante su sufrimiento y su frustracion    Un amante roto  como tantos otros lo somos  buscando un lugar para amar a como es deseado  Si  quienes hayan leido este libro coincidiran conmigo que sus metodos no fueron los mas correctos o los menos daninos para su amor  pero  quien puede decir que son correctos cualesquiera de los caminos por los que buscamos el quimerico amor  Fue impresionante arrojo demostro Nabokov al escribir tal pieza  definitivamente de mis recientes favoritos  Some sections are difficult to read due to the subject matter  but even among the uncomfortableness there s no denying that Nabokov s writing is beautiful  Humbert becomes an unsympathetic character  yet his madness  delusion  and ultimately his downfall is a path I could intellectually understand  He rarely owns up to the responsibility he had in shaping Lolita s life and understands consequences blame only in the context of what others did to him  Lolita is genius  because  as told by Humbert  it s an eccentric love story  but if told instead by its title character  it would be a very different tale  one of horrifying child abuse  In this way  Nabokov so persuasively explores the power of individual perspective  Lolita is   as I ve been telling everyone I know for the last week   simply the best book I ve ever read  The plot is uncomfortable  the resolution is anticlimactic  and the characters are shallow  But none of this actually matters  Nabokov  whose first language wasn t even english  manages to tell his story with the most beautiful language I ve ever encountered in a novel  The whole thing is like poetry  the good kind    I m usually the type who skims over descriptive paragraphs because I want to get to the action  sorry  writers  but I read most of the pages in this book  almost all descriptive  several times to make sure I didn t miss anything  When I finished it  my first thought was that I want to read it again HIGHLY recommended  I am obsessed  The thing I ll never let go of when reading Lo li ta is that English was Nabokov s second language  I read the book the first time and listened to the book on tape read by Jeremy Irons the second  It was the perfect order but both are worth while  This is a book I will continue to re read during my lifetime  Wow   beautiful  The author is a genius and the ending is amazing  Witty and funny  it takes skill to make HH a likeable character  The second half of the book is a bit slow and anti climatic but Nabokov intends to do that to convey his message  There s a reason why this book is a classic   Re read the first chapter when finished  the funniest book i have ever read  laughed out loud on almost every page  for my money humbert is the most absurd  pompous  hilarious narrator in english fiction  sure it s about a pedophile but i say if a single book is gonna change your moral assessment of statutory rape then you have some serious gullibility issues  Favorite  Book  Ever  The protagonist who has some despicable affinities draws sympathy from the reader while making the reader very uncomfortable to admit such sympathy  Likewise the way this non native English speaker engages in word play and innuendo is brilliant and subtle  A serious masterpiece  The first book I ever wanted to crawl into and die reading   On one hand  this is an unbearably sad novel  narrated by a despicable man who ruined the life of a little girl  On the other hand  it depicts the little girl s triumph despite that ruin  Nabokov chooses words with precision  spinning exquisite passages amid the squalor and scandal of situations Humbert creates  The media view of Lolita the book is misleading  Yes  there is sexuality in the novel  but it is more about power and resistance  a child s refusal to submit her soul to a wily villain who had found a way to invade and then take control of every other aspect of her life   Lolita  is stunning  the best book I ve ever read  This is now in my top five  possibly top 3 favourite books  Someone envied my reading it for the first time  and I get that  The lovely lovely and often unexpected metaphor  the alliteration  the humour  the complication  heady heady heady reading  I definitely want to read more all of Nabokov in light of Lolita   Absolutely astonishing prose  Nabokov creates conflicting responses as the reader is torn between the arrestingly sensual poetry and highly disturbing pedophilia  He explores the human psyche and tells a story I didn t want to put down  but the author s greatest accomplishment here is his absolute mastery of language  Human life is but a series of footnotes to a vast obscure unfinished masterpiece Opening a book is a unique conversation with another  the chance to enter and occupy the headspace of a writer  a character  a voice screaming out into the void  We see life  our own world or fantastic realities that function as elaborate metaphors for our own  through another s eyes  walk a mile in another s skin as Atticus Finch would say  and learn that despite the differences between individuals  we are all part of the same chorus of humanity  There has been much research into showing that reading assists the building of empathy in children  and many fine publications such as articles inThe Guardian or a similar one in Scientific American  Reading is a fresh perspective that helps us to shape our own  Lolita  a masterpiece by Vladimir Nabokov  takes us into the mind  heart and soul of a man none of us wish to become  yet Humbert Humbert s voice is as important to the human comedy as is anyone else s voice  Nabokov is a master of literary games and jokes  and Lolita is a work of art that often evokes knee jerk reactions even just by mention of the title  which is precisely what Nabokov loves Nabokov has a fascination with literary games  detail and jokes  and Lolita is a gorgeously complex work that touches on taboo subjects to force our reaction and is loaded with allusions and important details and clues that invite us to play his game and learn  Vanity Fair called Lolita  The only convincing love story of our century   yet is it the relationship between Hubert and Dolores that is the love story  and tomes could be written debating the topic   or the love of literature  Lolita is a love story to language that soars through the stratosphere with some of the finest attention to detail in prose and plotting to seduce the reader into Humbert s literary vision of events as justification of the horrors that transpire I ve no ideas to exploit  I just like composing riddles with elegant solutions   Nabokov Nabokov is a supreme maestro of language  Few authors since Joyce have such acute attention to the supreme specifications of each word choice to build the maximum potential of a sentence   I only have words to play with  insists Humbert  and Nabokov uses words like playthings with the very best of them  Each noun  verb and adjective are precisely picked to elevate the tone of a scene through connotative commentary as well as attention to poetic flow  puns and general atmosphere  Even the names are exquisitely invented  from Lolita chosen for  the necessary note of archness and caress  and the last name Haze being a pun on the German word hase  meaning rabbit  which is suggestive of her as prey  There is also the music of the name Humbert Humbert   the double rumble is  I think  very nasty and suggestive  It is a hateful name for a hateful person  It is also a kingly name  and I needed a royal vibration for Humbert the Fierce and Humbert the Humble   The double rumble also exists with couples like John and Jean or Leslie and Louise to denote a cohesion of two individuals into a cumulative force of The Couple  Nabokov often rejects any interpretation of his work  insisting that it is just sheer creative force with nothing undermining the themes and symbols  a mere game of words being projected onto the page  While this may be a shirking of any Freudian  which he so detested  or deconstructionist interpretation  it is comforting to know that an author would pay such attention to words to build the perfect game board for the reader to immerse themselves in  America comes alive in his words and descriptions as Humbert and his charge travel the nation seeking any excuse for a sightseeing adventure  Even in the author s afterword Nabokov rejects the notion that Lolita is a commentary on America  or an examination of  young America debauching Old Europe or vice versa  As intention is often overshadowed by interpretation  the reader may find much to discuss in the matter  but what is most important is to see Nabokov constructing a linguistic America through the observations and experiences of Humbert as he travels   It had taken me some forty years to invent Russia and Western Europe  said Nabokov in an interview discussing the creation of the novel   and now I was faced with a similar task  with a lesser amount of time at my disposal   Nabokov set about inventing America in prose in Lolita  drawing on his travels and hotel stays with his wife on a butterfly hunting quest through the states to color the world of Humbert and create a true to life game board for his literary puzzles You can always count on a murder for a fancy prose style While the scintillating cacophony of words are the invention of Nabokov s  they are also of and through the character of Humbert Humbert  The aforementioned affection towards naming is part of Humbert s method of pseudonyms that both protect the  real  in novel people but also nudge towards Humbert s own literary bent This is a character that quotes and alludes to an erudite array of fiction in order to seek an authorial immortality of his own by putting his deeds to paper in eloquent fashion  both his immortality and that of his relationship with Dolores   and this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita   One is left to question the validity of truth  truth of the assertion of the novel as a realistic portrayal of the Novel s reality  as expressed by its narrator  Humbert is unquestionably an unreliable narrator  much like many of Poe s narrators such as in The Cask of Amontillado through which every undergrad writes their first essay on unreliable narration In a kingdom by the sea  The allusions to Poe s work is highly critical to the understanding of Lolita  As Humbert would wish it to be understood  Humbert s nymphomania stems from a romance pruned by death with Annabel Leigh during his youthful years  The two star crossed pre teens shared a summer fling before her untimely death  leaving Humbert s sexual attraction stunted to those of similar budding maturity  The name and the constant references to a kingdom by the sea allude to the poem Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe  an author who married his 13 year old cousin  In fact  Humbert repeatedly reminds readers that romance with young girls is rampant in literature  such as Dante and his nine year old Beatrice or Lewis Carroll s  another author frequently alluded to in the text  fixation with young girls  and that many cultures historically saw no qualms with union between man and pre teen girls  Humbert is attempting to justify his actions by seeking sanctuary in history  However  his history of amourous occasions with Annabel Leigh should be called into question for validity as the aptly named Annabel may only exist in Humbert s literary vision of how things  should be   Funny how Ms Leigh is only captured in a photograph where she is blurred and indistinguishable  a photograph that Humbert is unable to produce  Perhaps she is merely a justification  a romanticised fantasy befitting of her name She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita It must be questioned then as to what we can believe from Humbert  Lolita is a name given to Dolores by Humbert alone  her mother preferring the diminutive  Lo   ponderously parallel to  Hum    We understand Dolores only through the filter of Humbert and rarely do we even see her dialogue other than summarized by him  He insists that she was the one to seduce and sexualize him  but we are not present for the scene  Perhaps the seductive Lolita only exists in the mind of Humbert to accommodate his rationality and distract us  and himself  from the grisly truth of his statutory rape1  It would be interesting on a re read to note every time Humbert refers to his step daughter as Dolores  Lo  Dolly  or Lolita  as she seems to be Lolita only in the sexual moments  While Humbert insists upon his love for Lolita  often to win the heart of the reader by asserting genuine love  his love lands solely upon physical elements  She is repeatedly eyed over for her physical and sexual traits  but never for her personality or intellectual qualities  the latter of which he tends to condescend   The Webster s Dictionary defines  lolita  as a precociously seductive girl  though a more accurate definition would be a precociously sexual girl as affected by rape  Nabokov teases the knee jerk reaction in the reader  and while many refuse to read the novel due to it s taboo sexuality  it is equally disquieting how many thrive on it 2If  as Nabokov insists  the novel is not about the intermingling of Europe and America  perhaps the generational gap is the true investigation  While Humbert and his Lolita may have a relationship  there is an emotional gap of maturation that is evident even to Humbert  He sees in her stories an assertion of maturity that seems comical to adults  and her experimentation with sexuality reeks of juvenility to him  yet he pounces upon it like a lion lurking in the tall weeds  Humbert is highly vain and egotistical  constantly reminding the reader of his good looks  He even tells the reader that he looks similar to a music icon of whom which Dolores has a crush  a Dolores that falls victim to believing every magazine and commercial advertisement that falls her way  While Humbert is much older  he reflects the youth culture of intellectual and physical attraction and uses this to his advantage  W e are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader s mind If Lolita is a joke  then the reader is the butt of it  As Dolores is seduced by Humbert  so is the reader by his charismatic ways  We are drawn into his world  into his justifications  enamored by his prose and then held in sick bondage to his will  We know that his story is a manifestation  yet we cannot escape it  practically don t want to escape it as a sort of perverted Stockholm Syndrome  We are even made implicit in his crimes   I need you  the reader  to imagine us  for we don t really exist if you don t   he tells us  bringing us into his first sexual experience with Lolita to make us a part of it  If we condemn him  then we must condemn ourselves since we complicit with the act  We are bonded to him and unable to escape by the time we realize he has wooed us with his words as he has wooed Dolores with his looks and intellect  We  the reader  are his judge and jury as he sits in prison with a fatal heart condition  he slips so far into his literary reenactment of his crimes that he writes himself to be literally dying of a broken heart   and he seduces us to both pardon him of his crimes and immortalize both himself and his love lust for Lolita through our eternal reading and remembrance of him  Everything we read has been tweaked to literary perfection to accommodate his fantasy in our minds  Even Dolly s socks become a metaphor through his retelling  When she is his pure nymphet  her socks are pulled up and pure white  Yet as she fades in his eyes  her socks are always described as rumpled and soiled  Socks are a permeating motif of the novel that is both a indication of Humbert s literary assertions and a thermometer of his passion and opinion of his step daughter Nabokov was obsessed with detail  In teaching he insisted upon maps of Dublin or Samsa s apartment to understand Joyce and Kafka respectively  He made students visualize a train car to understand Anna Karenina  This is the sort of book to rub in the faces of anyone who insists that a blue chair can be a simple blue chair and not a symbol  Those sort of writers  if they are published  are not remembered because we have writers like Nabokov where every blessed word is another beautiful piece to the puzzle  Nabokov invented his literary America to give a map for his character s to race across  and filled their travels with allusions  names made of anagrams  puns  jokes  and moral investigations  We cannot help but be seduced by Humbert become a further victim in his fantasy of Lolita drawn from the sensuality stolen between the legs of Dolores  While Humbert is a clear villain in a comedy of moral errors3 we realize that his illness is just one facet of him  We must remember when we condemn someone that there are many other facets of their personality and lives that aren t that unlike our own  This is Nabokov s joke on us all   The rest is rust and stardust  100 100I loved you  I was a pentapod monster  but I loved you  I was despicable and brutal  and turpid  and everything  mais je t

 are taken from the interviews and essays of Nabokov collected in Strong Opinions  Furthermore  biographical information on Nabokov is lifted from Speak  Memory 1 Later in the novel Humbert drops his guard and recalls the sexual relationship between Hum and Lo as her left with hollow  sad eyes  I recall certain moments  let us call them icebergs in paradise  when after having had my fill of her  after fabulous  insane exertions that left me limp and azure barred I would gather her in my arms with  at last  a mute moan of human tenderness  her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind  her soot black lashes matted  her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever for all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operation  and the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair  and I would lull and rock my lone light Lolita in my marble arms  and moan in her warm hair  and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing  and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness There is a sense of remorse for his actions that sprout through his narrative in the later portion of the novel and ask us to rethink our earlier perceptions  This account of intercourse reveals one that is not as one of willful harmony but aggressive assertion of dominance over a passive partner  2 Perhaps more people thrive on the Humbert justification than we d like to admit  or at least have learned how to capitalize on it  The New Republic once ran a fascinating article highly worth reading that addresses the  lolita culture  in today s world of pop icons like Brittany Spears posing with a teddy bear in the nude  we acknowledge that she is not underaged but invokes the image of a young girl  or Katy Perry singing about copulation in a living room blanket fort like a child  Also of interest in the article is the town of Lolita  Texas where officials considered changing the town name to distance themselves from the novel 3 This novel is essentially a comedy  and is quite funny when you let your guard down  However  it is also a tragedy  Martin Amis provides a wonderful introduction that points out that the tragedy is not Humbert s fate  which he deserves  or his murder of Quilty  Nobody seems to pass judgement on his murder  enacted in a sick yet hilariously slapstick scene  The true tragedy is Dolores in her role as Lolita   He broke my heart  You merely broke my life   Despite the obvious unsettling topic of this book  it is one of my favourites  Nabokov is a master of understatement as a form of humour  and the first person narration of Humbert Humbert is so narcissistic and unreliable  it make for a very intellectual look at how someone s self delusions can alter identity with devastating consequences  In fact  Delores herself is no slouch in this book and we do get a fabulous conflict of  who is manipulating who  in the end   Lolita  light of my life  fire of

that deals with such a        odd subject  but hell  How can you not like this book  This is grand literature  I felt like I was reading poetry  The writing was original  witty  sad  romantic  elegant  formal  and every other word in the thesaurus  Part One  as always  was better than Part Two  but even Part Two was great  It took me a while to read  just because the writing was heavy  not in a bad way   but I am glad that it took me a while  because it let me appreciate the novel for a longer period of time  The ending  as I ve also read  was rather disturbing and unexpected  I don t know if I would have chosen that  or if I even liked it  for the matter  but when you think about the rest of the book  the beginning makes up for it  I really don t feel as if this is adequate review for such a brilliant novel  but I will just end it with  Get this book  NOW   Even if the subject matter is a major turn off for some  it s well worth it   sudy dphlangaehngwrrnsilp r yrineruue ngraaw

adama acir halde buluyorsunuz kendinizi kitabin sonunda  Ah  what can I say  I saw the movies before I ever knew there was a book  and when I find out about the book  I thought by the reviews it would be a most interesting read  and I wasn t wrong Nabakov s writing is amazing  I did find it at times annoying that entire paragraphs would be in French  Let me explain  I do know some french so that I could understand them without notes or with the aid of them  however  this took me time and drove me out of the depth of immersion I had in the book at reaching such points  and sometimes I had to re read to realize where I had been left standing before I had to figure out what the hell that sentence said Despite that  Nabakov s writing was most enjoyable  that it made such annoying points almost unimportant as it was very hard for me to put the book down  I enjoyed the style enough to say I would love to read more by him As for the content of the book itself  I have always thought the story to be interesting  Maybe not morally correct  maybe not what most people would like to read about  but a reality  and one told so very well that you can t help but enjoy your read  even if you hate Humbert Humbert  even despising what he represents and what he is I truly enjoyed this book  I have not read any of Nabokov s work until now  but I am very impressed with what I found in this controversial work  The story is about a man named Humbert who s had quite a difficult life  His childhood love died young and his marriage has been rather rocky  After he recovers from a breakdown he moves to Ramsdale  so he can clear his head and write  He moves in with a women named Charlotte and becomes infatuated with his daughter Dolores  who is the spitting image of his childhood love  The book itself is very well written and I found the characters very believable  The subject matter of the book  while it is rather sickening  is handled much more tastefully than one might expect  This book was an excellent read and I can t wait to check out more of the author s work  People who love unconventional character will live this book  It will also satisfy those who love a book with a beautifully written prose  One of my all time favorites  The fact that English was something like Nabokov s third or fourth language is incredible  This is one of the classic examples of the unreliable narrator  and the literary genius exhibited here continues to astound me Yeah  I even named my cat after Humbert Humbert   The most ecstatic wonderful first 100 pages of a book ever  The prose has this energy  My favorite opening ever  such an amazing blend of prose and poetry  Despite the fact that I think the energy falls off after the first 100  I still rate this book five stars because I think its beginning is just that amazing  People seem to struggle with Lolita  the book  not the character or even the iconography the name has come to embody   Perhaps this is because it is a ghastly tale about a stark taboo  a sick protagonist s wrenching account of limply justified wickedness  But then again  if it were merely that  dark  vile  unscrupulous  it would be simple enough to marginalize along with the other subcultural perversions found in seedy red light district back shelves or your average horror film set  Instead  Lolita dares to exist aboveground because within the tragedy at its core  it is a masterpiece of literature  a poet s novel filled with passion and wit which elevates itself  self consciously  on a rhythmic crest of gorgeous wordplay and wry humor In a sense Lolita is all the more provocative because it s so well written that it manages to very nearly sway the reader into thinking the first person account of deplorable exploitation is  perhaps  well    Not understandable or forgivable since not even Humbert Humbert himself understands or forgives his own actions  But readers may find themselves horrified to begin to sympathize in a way with the opportunistic and self obsessed  though unnervingly self aware  ogre  Nabokov carefully treads a tightrope  or is it tight thread   of motivation and madness such that it is never thought by author or character or audience that Humbert is anything but a demented predator  but he is far from a caricature or a silly incarnation of evil  At his most chilling core  Humbert the pedophile  Humbert the rapist  Humbert the murderer  Humbert the kidnapper and devourer of innocence is  in fact  a human This  I suspect  is what mortifies some readers  But then  I d argue  that is precisely the point  Humbert pays for his sins  and Lolita in a way pays for both of theirs  We aren t meant to cheer for anyone  except maybe karma   in the novel s sprawling spiral downward  but just to perversely enjoy the ride  safe in our own self righteousness  There isn t anything about us so revolting or antisocial as to grope gratification at the expense of innocence  is there  Of course not  Or at least  nothing we aren t better than Humbert Humbert about keeping locked safely  deeply  away There is  I m afraid  one sour spot in the edition I read that may not appear in all printings which is Nabokov s afterward  I instinctively read these in all books as part of the prose though doing so often leads to similar regrets  The defensive and shrill posture Nabokov presents in his own voice at the end of the book undermines the conviction of the book to stand on its own  He jests off the irony of affecting perhaps a third character  this one named  coincidentally  Vladimir Nabokov  since there is a faux foreword in the voice of John Ray  Jr   Ph D  But it would almost be better if one could presume the writer were affecting a phony and reactionary whinge in prescient anticipation of the moralist outrage expected from characterizing such an undeniable rake  Instead it just feels feeble and haughty  adding nothing of value but detracting from a picture I had of the author as courageous and defensible  I waffled on whether or not this addition impacted my view of the novel enough to alter my rating and ultimately I decided the wordsmithing skill on display is sufficient to overwhelm a poorly advised tack on  but I d advise new readers to skip the inclusion and stick to the novel itself   scary and brillliant oh man i love the way Humbert love Lolita  best of best using word quality  the love happens like that in 21st century too  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my lions  My sin  my soul   Vladimir NabokovLolita Chilling  to say the least  At most perversely  guiltily beguiling  Humbert Humbert is a most charming monster  and by the time the mask of charm is removed less than halfway through the book  I find myself so enraptured by his narrative that even his disturbing pathology does not deter me from wanting to hear the end of it  Reminds me of Scheherazade of 1001 Nights  referred to at least a few times in the text   as Humbert  facing death  tells his story so that he and Lolita might have some kind of immortality together  as Scheherazade told her story to stave of death  Beautiful  romantic  sickening  enchanting  We all know the story of Lolita   and  if you don t  please leave this review and go and get a copy immediately  Other reviewers have ably lent their opinions  and I would like to take another tack Nabokov s Lolita was banned from the library at my school   which struck me a decade later as fascist and philistine Lolita is that rare book  a masterpiece  It achieves a sexual tension that runs through every page without every turning to banal or graphic imagery  Men can identify with Humbert s lust and women can identify with Lolita s awareness of her sexuality   and the power it wields  The book never seems exploitative and has that quintessential quality missing from a lot of today s post Fifty Shades erotica  the writing is rich  considered and compelling  With sex merely alluded to  Lolita is the apotheosis of the erotic without a grain of porn   Not for the feint of heart  Nabokov puts you inside the mind of a child predator and then does the impossible   makes you identify with the monster  Instead of merely dismissing the protagonist as disgusting  I found him fascinating  It was also interesting to see the monster of the story as the narrator  with the primary antagonist being the detective hot on his trail  When I first started reading the story  it honestly wasn t what I was expecting  It was much more upsetting  but also much more fascinating to read   Lolita  is extremely well written  but depressing as hell  A classic worth reading  This was quite a weird book to read  but as the pages were consumed it turned into a very interesting read  the mind of a person  madly in love with a young girl  the science of the nymphets is  from a scientific point of view  quite intriguing  Cheers to Nabokov and his weird but interesting book I love this book I think everyone knows the subject matter of Lolita  The main character being a pedophile was not a surprise to me  I was surprised with the language of this book  Nabokov s use of language and play on words throughout the story had me flipping back and forth trying to catch all of the games he plays  Let s start with the forward  You must read it  The forward is an integral part of the story and itself a fabrication that helps  explain  the book  John Ray  Jr   PhD  describes the book as a manuscript  a memoir  a true story  a novel  and a case history  All of these are very different forms of writing and when applied to this book brings about different ideas on the subject matter I m not sure I would say that Lolita is a love story although there are some elements of a love story  I do think that Humbert loves Dolly  I also think that he is aware of and ashamed of the abuse she suffers  Of course  he doesn t stop abusing her and it could be argued that if he really loved her he would stop  I think that in his mind  however twisted  Humbert loved Dolly very much The most amazing part of Lolita and the thing that I loved most is the language  This is a book for those that love words  An example  She was thinner and taller  and for a second it seemed to me her face was less pretty than the mental imprint I had cherished for more than a month  her cheeks looked hollowed and too much lentigo camouflaged her rosy rustic features  and that first impression  a very narrow human interval between two tiger heartbeats  carried the clear implication that all widower Humbert had to do  wanted to do  or would do  was to give this wanlooking though sun colored little orphan aux yeux battus  and even those plumbaceous umbrae under her eyes bore freckles  a sound education  a healthy and happy girlhood  a clean home  nice girl friends of her age among whom  if the fates deigned to repay me  I might find  perhaps  a pretty little Magdlein for Herr Doktor Humbert alone  It s so beautifully written that you almost miss the part about abusing Dolly s friends  Almost  Of course  these long eloquent descriptions can leave many readers wishing Nabokov would just get to the point  There is also a lot of foreign language  Humbert is French and since the story is told from his point of view he frequently lapses into French  I spent a good amount of time with Google Translate just to make sure I understood everything  I think there was a little bit of German mixed in  also I would not recommend Lolita to anyone that cannot set aside their distaste of what Humbert is and what he does to Dolly to see the beauty of the language and the games Nabokov uses throughout this book  For all others  enjoy  A slow  slow burn of a book that totally engulfed me while I was traveling    I was staying up on overnight buses and not leaving the hostel at night so I could drink in more Nabokov  If there is prose that could personify tantric sex  I think this would be it  Highly controversial  though beautiful  unmissable  picked it up off a friend s shelf one night when we were sitting around reading aloud  it d been years since any of us had seen it  i picked a random page  a random paragraph  read it  just about took the top of my head off  dizzying  but there s nabokov for you   Nabokov s writing is really fantastic  and his insight into the mind of a monster is actually quite   touching  I was between 4 5 stars for this because the middle drug on a bit for me  but the ending  view spoiler   where HH is discussing how he knows he ruined a young child s life  etc   hide spoiler   is really well done  Found myself forgive this sinner simply because his love for Lolita deserves pity rather than hate  His obsession is not merely for any nymphet but so sincere  so real  so agonizing that it hurts me to see his tears Love the way he cherishes and describes in details   slow motion to be exact   all the moments he had with her  Sometimes the beauty  and difficulty  of the words  had exactly 212 new words to learn after this  got me so concentrated that I forgot to take the violence of his actions seriously A book that takes me on a road trip around America and a journey into a pedophile s mind A totally different way to tell a murder story A strange and crucifying love The strangest story that I have ever read  The whimsical way Nabokov has with words almost makes you forget Humbert Humberts love for Lolita is menacing and wrong  Truly and eerily the most romantic work of fiction I have ever read  A book you are sad to put down  but glad to have experienced  Because it is an experience  a walk through the world of a very odd man and his undying affection for a girl who is just that  a girl  Exceptionally great novel  Initially I was bit sceptical  mainly because of the topic  I don t mean I was expecting some hard times because I m too conservative or something like that  However  due to my recent sound shift to spiritual lifestyle  I though maybe anything about something sexual will not worth the time spent on reading And yes  in the beginning my worst expectation were met with open arms  but that s exactly when the magic started  In spite of those incredulous feelings I could not resist increasing joy and satisfaction that happens when you read something extraordinary  When you don t yet know but feel that you will experience something new  the big adventure is ahead on the way     and my thanks and appreciations to Victor Pelevin  who in his The Sacred Book of the Werewolf sent subconscious  though strong message   read Lolita  IT IS GREAT   Shocking and repulsive but incredibly well written   Each sentence glitters like a jewel on a long  lovely string of them  Perhaps that s why  even as I squirm uncomfortably over narrator Humbert Humbert s perverted desires    drawn in so that I feel his yearning to achieve his goal of sexual gratification with the  nymphet  Lolita  then disgusted by his rationalizations and his insistence that he  loves  her    perhaps that s why I continue to devour the pages  I am awestruck by the writing  by the author s skill  by the language of a Russian writer for whom English was secondary  For a writer  humbling and inspiring  For a reader  thrilling  Now I want to read it again    Very interesting read  Yes  it did make me feel uncomfortable and I was not fooled by Humbert and his excuses  but I think this book deserves 5 stars for the sheer brilliance of the writing  From a psychological point of view it s fascinating how Nabokov could have written such a good account of a madman  A great book indeed  This is an incredibly satisfying  well written book  But if I go telling you how good thisb book was  I am afraid you will think I m very creepy  I can t think of a harder story to tell  The nymphet who Humbert constructs in his imagination  complete with small breasts and a floss pubic hair on her hillock is oversexed  tempermental  but never seasoned  The narrator makes you understand who a nymphet is  truely  I love this book  Any review I could offer wouldn t do this justice  I m undoubtedly going to need to read it again  as I stretched the experience over far too long a period with far too much else going on in my world A compelling read  and one well worth the time invested   I m not 100  convinced this one deserves a five star rating  but I m giving it one just for its sheer audacity  Could this book even be published today  Iffy  And yet it was published in the 1950s   By Olympia Press  admittedly  which was renowned or notorious  as you prefer  for publishing challenging and controversial books   Anyway  this is really a tour de force about  Humbert Humbert   pseudonym assumed by our narrator  and his pedophiliac relationship with  Dolores Haze   or Lolita  Nabokov s afterward comments clearly and succinctly on how this work differs from pornography  but there s nevertheless no doubt whatsoever about what goes on in the relationship  Humbert s a frankly amazing creation  I have no idea of the genuine psychology of pedophiles  but Nabokov makes Humbert into a remarkably complex and understandable figure  clearly a monster  at one point planning on breeding duaghters and grand daughters for his own sexual pleasure   clearly aware at times of his own monstrosity  yet equally clearly all too often oblivious  He s also  against all expectation  to some degree sympathetic  One might complain that Lolita s flat and characterless  but a huge part of the point is that we re seeing her only as Humbert does  not as a genuinely individual human being  and Nabokov is remarkably skilled at providing hints for the attentive reader that there s more to her than meets Humbert s eye  The language here s rhapsodic  complex  occasionally almost incomprehensible  Nabokov s vocabulary and command of style were superlative   very occasionally ringing a bit false but mostly contributing essentially to the depiction of a clearly mentally unstable narrator  Dense and challenging  remarkably rewarding  but clearly not for all tastes   This is one of those books that s pointless for laymans to talk about  For a great analysis on this  watch Nick mount s lecture on YouTube   One of my favourite novels of all time  Distinctly unique  beautifully written prose  while submerging the reader into the mind of a sadly conflicted middle aged professor with honest desires that speak to striking realities of human lust and emotion  The books leaves you feeling conflicted over a protagonist that would otherwise clearly be labelled as  mentally ill   or a  paedophile   as his intense obsession for a young girl is conveyed through a conflicted mind that ironically seems rational and understandable in many respects    and leaves you  yourself  feel a little uneasy over your own approval of this irrevocably lost character  An intense  unpredictable  intricate  provocative and confusing look into the mind  A masterpiece by a Russian novelist who clearly understands what it means to be human   Audacious  Nabokov risks everything in this novel by crafting a first person account of a pedophile and murderer   with sympathy  My gosh  Humbert Humbert is so suave and sophisticated and erudite and intelligent and ultimately  utterly corrupt  He belongs in the Heinrich Himmler Iago Satan  Paradise Lost  school of villains with whom the reader sympathisizes with  to the point of disgust   I loved the riff that Nabokov makes on his cross country road trip through America  It rivals Steinbeck s Travels with Charly and Kerouac s On the Road for its insight into Americana  I have gained an enormous respect for Nabokov as a novelist and risk taker and artist  His sentences are elegaic  John Updike could do it too  Do not read this if you are squeamish about the revolting  But read it if you want to see a master storyteller take on an impossible task and succeed   Inizialmente  ancor prima di leggerlo  ero molto scettica nei riguardi di Lolita  Conoscevo superficialmente la trama  o pensavo di conoscerla  Avevo deciso di dare fiducia a Nabokov  perche il suo stile per me e poesia  e cosi di inaugurare la mia lettura  Un romanzo sorprendente e il lettore ne e costantemente coinvolto  Viene infatti chiamato a condividere o meno i punti di vista di Humbert  o a risolvere l enigma finale del rapimento  Esprime pensieri cosi umani e veri  che quasi commuovono   perche mai speravo che all estero saremmo stati felici  Un cambiamento d ambiente e la tradizionale premessa fallace in cui ripongono le loro speranze gli amori e i polmoni condannati Nel corso della storia  capitolo dopo capitolo  gli atti di stupro che il protagonista consecutivamente compie ai danni di Lolita  non appaiono neanche tali  Tutto si tramuta in una reale sentimento di passione e amore che travolge la figura di Humbert  Il finale straziante dimostra appieno il concetto  rivela la propria solitudine  e quella di tutti coloro che soffrono di amore non contraccambiato  Il finale testimonia forse una maturazione  la purificazione di un uomo  la quale perversione non ha fatto altro che liquidarsi progressivamente e diventare amore  Hot damn  this book made my head explode  I read it in one sitting  sometime early last October  while I was home sick  I didn t know anything about it  thank you  medieval studies degree  when I picked it up  except the salient bits about the older man and the younger girl    I thought the book had been written in Russian  translated into English  No  no  no  Nabokov is brilliant  his prose is lush  full in the mouth  begging to be read aloud  his characters are both repellent and seductive  the tale horrifying and so understandable at the same time  I don t know what it would be like to be a man to read this  but as a young woman who remembers quite clearly her own awakening  this struck an unsettling chord   This book is extremely well written  it s scary  The way that it is written make you feel sympathetic and at the same time disgusted with the protagonist  and yet you re seeing everything from his point of view  His unreliable narrator makes you wonder about the realities of the situations he s in      Best book I ve ever read  hands down    I didn t want it to end  It s beautiful  elegant  twisted and just utterly delicious  Sometimes I wish I never read it because for me all books pale in comparison    but I m forever grateful I did   it s a masterpiece  Thank you  Vladimir Nabokov  Masterpiece   Without a doubt one of the best books I ve ever read  It s warm  funny  scary  confusing and an outright assault on everything polite society brought us up to expect Say what you will about the content  Nabokov is an extremely gifted writer  His long  complicated sentences unfold like exotic hothouse flowers  He weaves a unique sort of poetry out of vile subject matter and comes away with something haunting and  well  beautiful The sexual component of Lolita is 100  repugnant  no doubt  Had Nabokov soft peddled this fact one iota  the novel  and author  would have failed on many levels  Instead  through Humbert Humbert  we re able to imagine    really imagine    what goes on in the head of a pedophile  It enables us to see how these monsters can be  and often are  school teachers  guidance counselors  Scout leaders  coaches  pastors  etc  They re not all scary  toothless strangers offering candy to babies in parks  they can just as easily be charming  educated and successful  If nothing else  Nabokov shows us this with gusto Is it at times a vulgar  uncomfortable read  Absolutely  and it should be  If it doesn t make you squirm  you weren t paying attention  I d question it if it were any other way  But it s also beautifully written and will stick with you long after the final page is turned  It s possible  though extremely rare  to have both coexist in a kind of uncomfortable harmony  And  credit where it s due  Nabokov  I felt  walked that line better than just about anything else I ve had the pleasure of reading  Kudos to him for taking no prisoners in the telling of a difficult tale  There are very few  if any  sympathetic characters in Lolita  yet you ll find yourself searching for justification    and reason to excuse  if only to yourself  why you don t hate everyone And that  my friends  is storytelling at its finest   Interesting  and as Lolita exists as a culturally iconic figure  I m glad to have finally read this novel  Nabokov s writing is beautiful  even when describing acts which we may find despicable  I cannot help but think of Nabokov in terms of his history  born in 1899  witness to the Russian Revolution  emigre from Russia to Germany  France  the US  literary critic  poet  novelist  professor  translator of Russian  French and English  I found HH to be a sympathetic character  despite his profoundly destructive and cultually unsanctioned acts  From the perspective of a  healthy  adult  how does an adult have an intimate relationship with a child  Not from a moral perspective  but from a relationship perspective   how does it exist  Does it exist  Critics may read this novel as  Old World Europe  raping  criticizing  penetrating  New World America  but I read it  additionally  as a love story  a sad  doomed  sorry  pathetic love story  What is love  What is desire  How do we love  Why do we love  Who do we love  What is love  Having wanted to read this book for years  I finally got an opportunity to slip it into the upper echelons of my reading list when I found a free copy at my school  I knew that the book was about a pedophile and to me seemed like one of the poster children of controversial reading  because of that  I also expected the story to go a certain way  as many people often do when they are confronted by a very famous book or author  However  Lolita was not what I expected it to be at all  and it is safe to say that this is one of those books which reassigns new destinies for peoples lifelong train of thought  Nabokov s wordplay was out of this world  ever the more remarkable knowing that English wasn t his native language  In the end  it was impossible to feel any one kind of emotion towards the book  so layered with thoughts  wordplay and emotion was the book  There was an almost Epicurean pleasure in reading such an imaginably worded novel  there was disgust for Humbert Humbert  and the pathetic vibes associated with these domestic American characters also added flavour to the novel  As has been said before  Nabokov very cleverly makes it easy to feel sympathy with the pedophile  and I imagine that when writing it he had to temporarily adopt that type of emotion for a spell or two  but while at first I allowed my mind to fall for the trick and feel sympathetic towards his cause simply for the sake of literary immersion  in the end I found that I pitied his character more than anything else  His reflections on  nymphets  were perhaps the most disturbing parts  but like the rest of the book it was so well written that at times it didn t seem to matter what kind of sick thoughts Humbert is sharing with the reader  Regardless of its controversial content  or maybe even because  since it can be said that one of literature s primary directives is to grab the bull of controversy by the horns and wrangle it into something   Lolita definitely deserves five stars  This is one of those few books that alters ones mind in a way where it almost feels like one s brain cells are mutating and warping into new  unique organisms  Crime   Punishment by Dostoyevsky and The Skin by Curzio Malaparte also share that spotlight for me   It has also turned me into an overnight Nabokov fan  and whether or not it s Pnin or Pale Fire or one of his other works which I get to next  the next chance I get to begin another Nabokov book will be a happy day indeed   This is a beautiful story  its difficult to read  Humbert loves Lolita and says many times that he knows the best thing for her is for him to get as far away from her as possible but he can never bring himself to do this  Humbert loathes himself for hurting this child but is not able to stop  This language is beautiful  I only wish that I know enough French to follow along with the random French phrases that Humber mutters  No one will ever be able to convince this book is some kind porn that glorifies pedophilia   Holy shit  this book is amazing  Just Wow  The prose is to die for  and the plot creepy and haunting  yet humane  The book is satirical  and hilarious  Its themes dealing with the sexuality of young girls is even more apparent to today s society  Its themes vibrate strongly  This book is a must read   You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  A repulsive story    beautifully written  Simultaneously loved and hated this book  Check out my review here  https   elexithymia wordpress com 201    Damn  that was dope   Says Humbert Humbert to us and our posited reasons for reading his  confession      you veteran crime reporter  you grave old usher  you once popular policeman now in solitary confinement   you wretched emeritus read to by a boy    one I am almost finished with for the 3rd time  trying to see what the professors see in this damned thing  Something to do with the narration  Nabokov was a Joyce lover  referred to Joyce s pornography trial in the Forward of his book  daring it to be banned  It was It s rather ridiculous in some ways  that this book was banned  Nabokov himself thinks the publishers in America he submitted it to didn t read past the 1st part  and rejected it more for its lack of graphic material  I have mixed feelings about this book  don t get me wrong  I think it is  great literature  and all  But  this may be my last read of it  now that the cardboard walls fell away and I see the hand of god  Nabokov  in the machinery  That was what he ultimately wanted  I think  as many of his other writings  I hear  are about that  I truly have never felt so overtly manipulated by an author in all my life  and I don t quite know what to do with that Do I give him 5 stars for being an expert manipulator   I tend to like an author I think I would enjoy as a person  you know  like ol  Holden Caulfield s line about finishing a book and wanting to give the author a buzz  shoot the shit  I would dig that  too  I don t feel like giving ol  Vladimir a buzz  Don t think he d be terribly friendly for a chat Continuing on the down side  I do not like Humbert Humbert as a character  His obsession with Lolita bores me  Ultimately  he s a snob  On the plus side  his gift with words is enormous  and almost fun  Games games  games  What part of the story is true  How much a madman s tale  Does it matter  Ne znaio  I laughed out loud at the end  after he d committed his revengeful crime on Clare  his alter ego  when he said   covered in Quilty  heheh    since I had disregarded all the laws of humanity  I might as well disregard the rules of traffic   as he proceeded then to drive on the left hand side of an American highway at 20 mph  But that was really the only time I laughed in spite of all the diamond wordplay  definitely tempting to steal ideas   However  I must admit  I was rather moved when pregnant and married Lo  faithful to her Dick  called our narrator  honey  Maybe she did love him  Maybe she never existed  Maybe she existed  but the road trip was all Humbert s fantasy  Maybe we re all being played for what stirs us up the most    Incredible writing style  I ve never read anything half as good Nabokov for president and all  peace out  Spectacular   Brilliant  disturbing  fascinating  Beautiful  Horrible  Probably the most capturing book I read for a while  I began  Reading Lolita in Tehran  and realized I was at a disadvantage because I remembered very little of  Lolita   So off to the library to find the annotated Vintage Books edition  the same edition author Azar Nafisi brought to her Iranian students It had been many decades and  it seems  a lifetime ago since I first read Lolita in the early 60s  Then  like many Americans  I read it because I believed it to be shocking and sexual   a pornography  Unlike most Americans  I read the whole thing  even when it became quite evident that it was not at all about those subjects  At my young age  I m not sure I understood what it was about What it IS about    well  since Nabokov found it difficult to explain    I can hardly do better  But turns out it is great literature  Born from an image of imprisonment  it is about imprisonment and freedom  and dream seeking of the most desperate kind  It is deep  difficult to read with annotations  yet almost impossible to read without  It is filled with comedy  puns  and desire  I read this book at a younger age  about 14   At the time I was deeply disturbed yet intrigued  It was my first piece of mature literature and I found it beautifully horrifying  Nabokov wrote it so delicately that you almost put the age and pedophilia aside and and feel for Humbert Humbert  You almost go in and out of forgetting the massive age difference  I found it a truly beautiful love story that would disturb the dirtiest of hearts  A must read for anyone 18 and older  Hmmmmm   so beautiful  Simply the best book I ve ever read  Every sentence is poetry  Disturbing content  beautiful poetry  Nabokov s toying with words  the plot riddled with hidden clues  magnificent and deceitful betrayal  escalating tension  the coming of age  the crises of lifetime and the tragedy of misguided yet obsessional love  I loved it  He broke my heart  You  merely broke my life  It s difficult to explain to my students that their English teacher s favorite book is Lolita  but I love it for so many reasons  really  the subject matter is almost moot  It s entirely drunk on language and allusion  and I always felt that Nabokov is just totally fucking with us  Perfect in every way  This book gets you thinking about the limitations of love  and how confined we are by society s acceptable norms  I found myself empathising with Humbert Humbert moreso than Lolita  and saw her more as an extraordinarily mature girl who acted quite the vixen  Humbert Humbert s wit is unrivaled and a nice light hearted  if not melancholy  supplement to a disturbingly relatable storyline  The prose is utterly beautiful  creative and specific  emphatic and subtle  I really wanted to write a review for this but after sitting on it for several hours I failed to construct even the simplest of analysis and only a keyboard mash can truly articulate my feeling  There are no words  other than holy effing Mary berry this is amazing  Just read it and don t think about what you re reading and what H H  Is doing too much  just read it   Fantastic book  The writing is absolutely gorgeous  and you know it takes a brilliant writer to make a pedophile interesting and believable  But mostly the prose is just incredibly lyrical  Try to listen to it read by Jeremy Irons  who played Humbert Humbert in one of the movie versions   It s amazing  so beautifully written  disturbing in so many  many ways  i started this book thinking it was a controversial love story of a middle aged man and a very young girl  but after just a few chapters i thought  this isn t at all what i expected  instead the author seems to be trying to get me to sympathize with a confessed monster  i wanted to stop reading it twice but continued  nonetheless  i described it to colleagues as a wreck on the side of the highway  you want to look away but instead you stare as long as you can early in their relationship i thought  this is no love story at all   but now that i ve finished  i m completely certain that i have no idea whether h h  really loves lolita  or only thinks he does  or knows without a doubt that he does not but wants desperately to convince us of his sincerity  nabokov has renewed my faith in the unreliable narrator  i thoroughly enjoyed this book  gliding along in its flowing  flowery prose only to be abruptly stopped by a sliver of reality or a morsel of creepiness  although i still have some questions and there were one or two parts that seemed to drag a bit  it was truly a delicious read  Old man and young girl of very questionable age mixed together in the most shocking way and most fantastic way  The plot line is so suggestive and point out on many phenomena of the society  Yes  sometimes they could be more creepy then professor Humbert Humbert and his pawing of little Lolita  who is perhaps the biggest psycho of the book   It s no secret as to the themes and general plot of this literary masterpiece  so I won t labour on it  The most astonishing thing about this book  is  how through the mastery of language and wordplay  Nabokov was able to manipulate this reader  There were times  while reading this I actually felt empathy and affection towards Humbert  I was tricked into believing this really was a  love story   and then  had to keep reminding myself of the perverse and sick way in which Humbert had defiled and violated a young pubescent child  And there in lies the genius of this book  Had Nabokov merely created a grotesque and cliched version of the  sterotypical paedophile  it just wouldn t have worked  But his astute use of language  dark humour and subtle manipulations are what makes this story so engaging  My first experience of Nabokov was a thorougly enjoyable  though disturbing one  and I will definately be delving into more of his work  THIS IS TRULY A MUST READ    It takes a lot of courage to foray into uncharted territories  especially when you know for sure that doing so would make you unpopular  Nabakov did just that when he explored the passion of the aging  lumbering  Humbert for lithe  little Lolita who is his step daughter  What could have become a cheap  sensational novel in the hands of a lesser writer a becomes literary masterpiece when narrated by Nabakov  The dense  lyrical prose is a treat to anyone who loves language   hdhh lrwy  l bqry    lfrwydy  bTb h w lGryzy  bTb h    qr th dht mrhq  wknt Hwly 200 SfH    wlan   yd qrth bSfHth l400   dwn tshfyr

ever read  The insight into the mind of the pedophile was mind blowing  Truth be told  I got some strange looks while reading this book in school or in public  but I found that aspect of reading the novel especially entertaining  This is a book that everyone should read  This is one of my favorites  obviously  After all  how can you feel sympathy for a pedophile  I can only say one thing and that is the book is extremely well written and Nabokov does a very good job of fooling us into empathizing with Humbert Humbert  In the immortal words of Oscar Wilde   There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book  Books are well written or badly written  That is all   Five stars  The central theme of this book  30 something man desires 12 year old girl  is obviously disgusting and disturbing  But if you choose to read despite this revolting premise  as you may have chosen to watch  Silence of the Lambs  with its cannibalism   you will be amazed by its writing  I can t begin to describe how magnificent it is     other reviewers have used terms such as deep  textured  subtle  and inventive     all adjectives are inadequate  I d suggest reading the e book for quick definitions   Hacia mucho tiempo que tenia ganas de leer este clasico  pero por una u otra razon siempre venia postergandolo  Me costo engancharme porque al principio choque bastante con la forma de escribir del autor y en algunos momentos hasta llegue a aburrirme un poco  Sin embargo  a medida que avanzaba  no podia soltarlo pues realmente necesitaba llegar a ese tan ansiado final  Buena senal Ame el final  por sobre todas las cosas  Perfecto  si los hay Quizas el libro ha tenido gran controversia en su tiempo y muchos aun encuentren ciertos prejuicios en base a la trama principal  pero hay que tomarlo como lo que realmente es  una ficcion  Y como novela es bellisima   Fantastically written and the manipulation of the readers view on the character is incredible  Everyone should read   Not sure if I should tag this Russian Literature or English Literature  o_O I read it in Russian though   Yes  This book is written in very clever manner   I highly recommend getting the annotated version  which explains all the references Nabokov makes throughout the book  It may sound like a laborious process  but it enhances the experience  This is in some ways a simple story   a man with an extreme attraction to a much younger girl  I was most impress with Nabokov s ability to get into the thought process of Humbert Humbert  and his obsession with the forbidden Dolores  Lolita   You almost become sympathetic to him  As much as you know his pursual of this relationship is wrong  you kind of end up thinking this somehow makes sense  just like he does It gets a little long and a little weird towards the end  but the twists and turns make it somewhat thrilling   This audiobook is completely sustained by the superb and finely attuned narration of Jeremy Irons  While Lolita is and remains a classic of 20th Century literature  this production will allow you to see  hear  a completely new perspective  Irons takes you completely inside the mind of Humbert Humbert  and with skill and subtlety makes you loathe him and sympathize with him at the same time  His tremulous and unspeakable desire mixed with his engulfing shame  his cowardice and his bravery standing side by side  his disregard of social norms tempered by his utter need for secrecy    all of these conflicts are roiling beneath the surface of the story as it unfolds  This is a performance that only the finest of actors could pull off   Lolita  The Elusive Butterfly of Love5 stars  This story is terrific  disturbing  and a classic of its type  A meditation on obsessive love The narrative from the point of view of Humbert Humbert is a constructed literary haze  significant word choice  of obfuscations and word play  He creates a fog of puns  references  a lot of French was spoken  mon Dieu   an enchanted solipsistic world  He knows what he wants is destructive and criminal  and he knows that he is a sociopath  an imitation  swimming easily in American culture  assuming the roles and shapes others wish for him  Only occasionally are we allowed to penetrate the fog 13 year old Dolores  aka Dolly  aka Lo  aka Lolita  becomes a captive who trades  favors  for money  treats  promises  He gives some of these  he threatens  he intimidates  he gets physical  She compartmentalizes  tries to be  normal   tries to develop normal interests and friends  but she s damaged and a victim  and once that is fully unfolded before us  we feel deeply hurt for her  for her stolen adolescence Lolita takes to drama and acting  no surprise   The play  The Hunted Enchanters  within the novel refers to the hotel lodge where he first rapes her  The Enchanted Hunters   The message of the play that  mirage and reality merge in love  is also the message of the novel  Both he and Quilty think themselves to be the poet hero of the play who wins Diana s  Lolita s  love  Lolita the nymphet is a mirage for him  the object of his obsession and ardor  both love and love object  After the story is over  after Lolita has grown out of the  nymphet  stage  even after she has married  malnourished  in poverty  and is hugely pregnant  Humbert confesses his unconditional love for the girl Whatever love means to everyone else  to him the mirage of love was real enough to do anything and to sacrifice everything  The denouement is that he visits the now 17 year old Dolores  gives her and her husband a lot of money  and then he murders Clare Quilty  the man Lolita actually loved  For her part Lolita knows Humbert stole her life  but amazingly  she feels sympathy for him  Not real  perhaps  but a good story Love is strange  isn t it  Lolita s mother Charlotte loved Humbert  Jeanne Farlow loved Humbert  Humbert loved Lolita  Lolita loved Quilty  and Quilty  He only loved himself  Everyone of them projects their needs and fantasy onto the next one  Is that what love is  I have never read any other book with such beautiful use of language  Only Nabokov could write and play with words in such a way that the reader could actually empathize with a character such as Humbert  This is my favorite book of all time  on par with GG Marquez  Memories of my Melancholy Whores   I have yet to discover a writer and novel as great as this one  In his responsive letter  Norbakov says he wishes to accomplish  aesthetic beauty    Lolita  is more than that  it is an aesthetic triumph  He turns morally dubious subject matter into a brillant articulation of love s futile struggle  It is an apology for the perverse that articulates man s inferiority to his own emotions  The narrator s admittance of pedophilic conquests forces the reader to loathe his vile nature  yet his earnest rhetoric stirs some sympathy  Sympathy for the human condition that is enslaved by emotions that no matter how egregious one cannot help but feel  Fantastially written and poignantly perceptive of both human nature and the subtlies of love  this book remains with its reader long after the final page is turned  because through it Norbakov pursues both elocutionary and ethical aesthetic thoroughly   Nabokov s prose is lyrical   in spite of  or perhaps due to  the fact that English isn t his mother tongue  The subject matter of this book might be revolting  but Vlad uses humor as a medium to make the topic digestible  This story is ultimately less about immoral deflowering than than it is a work of a genius showing off for stunned Americans  I have read it at least 4 times and it gets better each time There are no nymphettes in polar regions  EVERY word sentence and paragraph was absolutely marvelous  In fact  marvelous  is an inadequate captivation of this books beauty and vitality in the world of literature  The journey an author takes from nonexistence in a reader s mind one day  to nobility 309 pages later is a peculiar and infrequent one  By presenting to the world the literary masterpiece of  Lolita   Nabokov has done what not many authors have  and traversed this journey in the mind and heart of this reader   About the book itself I have nothing to add  It s reputation as one of the finest novels in the English language is well deserved  I do want to recommend the annotated version  though  Read it once without  but consult the annotations on a reread  Lolita is Nabakov at his most tricky  and it enriches the experience to pick up on the connections you missed the first time through  One of my favourite books I read it so fast I was so hooked and amazed  I strive to be like Lolita  When I was first planning on reading Lolita  I had the idea that it would be an extremely weird book  and that s what kinda kept me from reading it  For months  I had wanted to read this book  but was kept away because of the extremely figurative language that I had heard was in the book  After reading about 50 pages  though  I realized that I was easily following the novel s storyline and was enjoying it  I did not expect such an excellent story from a book like this  How  I thought  could a book about a pedophile be so enjoyable  Everything about it was great  The writing style  story  and even the figurative language made Lolita one of the greatest books I have ever read   I read this in college and all I really got out of it was how disgusting it was  This time I was blown away by the beauty of his writing  It was great that I had the annotated edition  since there were many words I didn t know  and English was his THIRD language  and a lot of subtleties of the plot that I wouldn t have been aware of  It s easily become one of my top 5 favorite books of all time  I ve never read a book with such intense  deeply thought out characters  From the moment you read the summary  you know you re meant to hate Humbert   he s raping a child  But Nabokov paints him in such a sympathetic way that we find ourselves concerned for him rather than loathing him  We find ourselves doubting our own sense of morality simply because we DON T completely hate him  We know what he s doing is wrong  and we feel sorrow for Delores  but that sorrow is conflicting with the compassion we surprisingly have for Humbert It s a novel to make you think  to be sure  but surprisingly  it also touches you in a way you might not have been expecting  I read a lot and have read a lot my entire life  Not always good stuff and not enough good stuff  but I don t think I have ever come across prose as flowery as Nabokov s  I haven t read any biographical stuff about him but I imagine he was just a hugely pompous dick in person  Probably justified though   of course  inimitable This is an absolutely incredible book  A disgusting story with detestable characters filled with brilliant wordplay and humor  The characters are not intended to be liked simply because of the beautiful prose  and this is not a love story like so many other reviews complain  Nabakov is a truly remarkable writer  I can t wait to reread this  Thetta er klarlega einhver besta bok sem eg hef lesid   en samt er soguhetjan barnaperri og sagan thvi hraedileg  En tungumalid og ordaleikirnir og hvernig sagan er byggd upp er magnad  Madur tharf eiginlega ad lesa hana aftur til ad taka eftir ollum visbendingunum a rettum stodum  Samt tharf madur lika ad passa sig a ad trua ekki frasogninni  thar sem sogumadur er ju ad skrifa soguna a gedveikrahaeli og thvi kannski ekki marktaekur  Algjor snilld   I highly recommend reading Lolita with Alfred Appel s annotations  which enriches the entire experience   Read  This  Book  When my mom snatched this book away from me years ago  I already had a feeling this was going to be a book I d like  Because anything taboo  is certainly thought provoking  I like books that make me question morality and how I assign aspects of morality to my own way of thinking  Books that bring me closer to knowing myself  what I can and cannot stomach  what challenges me  inspires me  teaches me  what I love and hate  what principles I may compromise  and what divides my mind from my heart along with what joins them together  This novel hit all the right and wrong buttons  Nothing shocks me anymore  but reading this hurt  at the same time it opened up my mind to things I never would have known had I not read this  On that account  Lolita is a very important part of my personal growth  Sweet mother fuck This book  you guys  this book   First of all  It is fucking amazing Secondly  It is absolutely flawless The prose is beautiful  endearing  colourful  sweet and lush  something completely out of the ordinary  Vladimir Nabokov s book is not just literature  a modern classic and a fiercely memorable novel   it is music in words  poetry in the air and wine in my blood  A burning experience from the first to the last page And It  Is So  Morally  Fucked  Up  I can t even conceive of the life Humbert Humbert  the main character  leads  Although he explains it so well  his thoughts  feelings and actions   from the tiny  happenstance  hand placements  to the subtle inhale of a girl s fragrant hair  you know that HE knows that it is wrong  No matter how he validates and reasons to himself  there is no excuse for Humbert s behaviour  None I was unable to put the book down  This book is horrifying and monstrous  but it is also incredibly human  It is heavy with forbidden lust  lurking shame and possessive love  This man loves his Lolita  there is no doubt of that  He loves her to death  but in all the wrong ways I feel for this twelve year old girl  She is young  innocent and bold  obstinate and sweet  She has her whole life ahead of her  just a few years left to act the child she is  Through randomness and chance  this forty year old man walks into her life  living with her and her widowed mother  view spoiler   whom he chooses to marry in order to be close to her daughter   that nasty piece of work    taking upon himself the role as her  dad   which is even more fucked up  I swear to God  I can t even   hide spoiler   Lolita does not sense the predator sneaking up on her  She is immediately drawn to this handsome man  albeit old  he is charming and understanding   quite unlike her mother  Little does she know how he manipulates situations and puts himself in the right places at the right times  hooks out  ready for her to bite and latch on It is summer and Lolita is a girl growing into her sexuality  nourished by a childish fling  She falls into his lap more than once  not understanding the extent of his ecstasy when she does  He catches her  snares her in and keeps her close with the claws of his hands When she later cools off  she comes to realize how serious and all consuming his want for her is  But there is no way out  He monitors her with sharp eyes  following her every step and keeping track of her friends  Quite the psychopath  He is terrified that his secret will come out  and even more terrified that she might run away Clinging to his Lolita for bare life  the reader follows Humbert s journey from a man with vivid fantasies  to someone raggedly insane with love and possessiveness  A man who could have had it all  but is ravished by his own demons  deeply unhappy and unable to let go Oh  for fuck s sake I can t say anymore  Read it already  Just remember to put your ethics aside  otherwise you won t get past the first chapter for the sheer descriptiveness of how he wishes to fondle  young little nymphets    and other devious attributes of his pedophilia  This is the saddest  most brilliantly and wittily written book i have read in quite some time I laughed  was horrified and aching for the characters   i had all the feels Nabokov is a Master when it comes to using language  wit and references   i was drawn in by his writing For me art should either comfort or provoke  or both    and this book shook me to the inmost core of my being and made me question myself and society  subjectivity and objectivity  good and bad   i don t like to apply these two very much  This is most of the time the scale on which i measure a great piece of art Though Nabokov mentions in his epilogue that this novel has no moral   it still makes you think through it s unanswered questions if you let it and don t dismiss it immediately as a taboo  I was torn between disgust and compassion and at the end the thought of seeing the Humbert Humbert in all of us   the fatal slave to his subjective feelings  desires and urges  turning a blind eye on the impact his self succumbed behaviour has on the world and people around him   declaring love as the reason for his debauchery when really it is no love at all   not even love of oneself Of course it could be argued we see Humberts true love when he sees his  pale and polluted  Lolita for the last time  but i feel he is more in love with the picture he created of her  not her real self  At one point in the book he even admits to not knowing her at all In the end this book is more about wanting to love than love It is perfect  Read it  There is a lot to unpack  much more than I can put down on paper while also dealing with real life obligations  However  I completely understand why Lolita ranks on various top 100 books ever lists  it is totally frakked up and brilliant  And the prose   the prose   Controversial piece of writing  Nabokov writes from the point of view of a paedophile  What is important in this piece of writing is the insight of the author on a controversial matter  For this alone I give it a 5 star rating  This isn t meant to entertain the reader it is meant to inform the reader   This book is really disturbing because it was written about a girl and the narrator is a pedophile but it s so beautiful and it really makes you question his love for her   I ve just read  this very interesting article  from Hazlitt  about the true story behind Nabokov s book  I totally recommend it  It s a bit long  but worth the read  I can t recommend this book highly enough  The annotations absolutely make the book  Think you can handle Lolita on your own  tough guy  Think again  I just read another Goodreads member s review that said she felt there were many passages of nothing in this book  Exactly the opposite  There is not a single word wasted  Nabokov knew precisely what he was doing with this book  and if you don t get it  it s because you re not some sort of Nabokov level genius  Who is  No one  So the master crafted a work that almost no one can understand upon first reading  So sue him for being a genius  or sue your parents because you re not one  Thank god for someone like Appel  the editor  He has read Lolita umpteen times  taken countless notes  and then discussed them with the author  Holy shit  What access  Reading this book is like taking a college course in one of English language s greatest works  with occasional verbatim quotes from the genius who penned it  If you ve read Lolita before and just felt like it was a somewhat confusing but generally good read about a freaky Euro pedophile  read this version  Lolita is not about pedophilia  It s about how humans are tragically imprisoned by our own selfish desires  Read this book and bust out  Non sto qui ad incensarlo  a scriver capolavoro eccetera  Aggiungo solo che letto saltando tra la versione originale e quella italiana ho notato che nel tentativo di edulcorare le immagini piu forti la traduttrice   non so perche ma sono convinto fosse una donna  ahime il  pdf trovato in giro non me lo diceva  ne appanna l ironia o la quasi comicita lasciando paradossalmente campo alla componente morbosa nera disperata E adesso finalmente  Kubrick  The strangest of love stories  Lolita is a deeply compelling and disturbing piece of fiction  It is Nabokov s artist s hand with language that keeps the novel tripping the line between exquisite and grotesque  With wit and charm  we follow Humbert Humbert and his girl love  Lolita  With honesty revealed only through gross exaggeration  and love revealed through debauchery  truth is found in this book among glittering epigrams and astonishing description   The annotated version made the book much more enjoyable  Although it was a pain to keep flipping back and forth between the notes and the story  I learned a lot and the allusions made much more sense to me  This is one of those books you can t fully appreciate unless you ve re read it several times  so I wouldn t say you have to read the annotated version first  but I do recommend reading it at least once so you can appreciate the references more  Vladimir Nabokov has changed  completely  my principle as I read a fictional book  which reminds me of how Mulholland Drive has changed my outlook  expectations and analysing course as I watch a movie  What do we need in life  Love  Money  Time  Lust  What do we need beside the satisfaction of emotions and feelings  followed by the constant  or maybe  eternal worriness to hide the flaws and crimes behind our desires  What are we reading  what are we living for in this world if everything we see must be connected to some kind of symbols or ethic lessons  What I expect before reading a book  or watching a movie  An allegory  A meaningful lesson of life  A what Well let s say Lolita satisfies me  just as Vladimir has taught me the ideal way  maybe not the  correct  way  to read a book  Lolita satisfies me  without the presence of any lustful scenes or carnal details  without the availability of lessons or tears or laughters  Lolita leaves in me a sense of longing and wonder  and that s all I need for a fiction  If Vladimir Nabokov needs  only  the connection  the link  the bond between aesthetic factors  I only need the wonder and the longing  If there s one thing that is educational in some ways about this book  which people are asking for   then it s the admiration and reverie of genuine love  It s surprising for a men hater  a misanthrope like me to understand and not understand the motives of what Humbert Humbert is doing in the book  He s blindly devoting to sa petite  without a second thought  Oh well  he s in love  and obviously the  animal   a rare one  only loves Loleeta for his entire la vie vieuse  But I don t understand  too  In the face of Lolita s neve reaction  straight forwardly turndown of his offer to provide her with a new life  a better life  or simply  a life with him  he s still sacrificing himself for her  WHY WHY WHY  Why is he so o willing to handle all the miseries and the unstoppable tears himself while acknowledging the fact that he has never been part of her life  but only an outsider who ruins and shatters hers  I m satisfied  I m satisfied because now I m left with my own thoughts and wonders  that I m satisfied with a book without an open ending but still capable of making me feel longing for  not more  Nabokov s ending is complete for me  but for the creative process of writing  of making up some characters for myself  or for the complete absorbtion of his characters   his novel s ideas and motives  I long for comprehension  I long for the future during which I can comprehend these wonders That s enough of a fiction for me  This book was absolutely brilliant  And disturbing  disgusting  offensive  beautifully written  enthralling  I could go on with the oxymorons all day  There s a reason why this is a classic in spite of  or maybe because of  the perverted  protagonist  s twisted mind and ongoing rape of a pre adolescent girl  The book is so well written that at some points  it almost lulls you into accepting Humbert s perversion as the  normal  of the story  and leaves you wondering who you should be rooting for  It is a perfect portrait of a diseased mind that is fully aware of its disease  but tries only nominally to fight it  It takes a strong stomach to get through the book  I can only thank the literature gods that Humbert s so full of his own classical intelligence that there are no real graphic scenes    everything is described in poetic  flowery terms   but if you can  it s worth the read  In the first half of Lolita Vladimir Nabokov starts by giving a very long yet very intriguing detailing of  Humbert Humbert s  before lolita days  The way he scopes out child like prostitutes  detesting their every womanly feature  and blaming his past with Annabel and human traffickers for his own fails and falters is exactly how I imagine a person in HH s state of being would act  Along with the violent thoughts towards Valeria and complains of suffering through it  Nabokov created the suspense of what HH could do to others in a sort of ironic way where the reader doesn t trust HH to tell the whole truth about his past Throughout the story  HH sees himself as sly  which is also questioned due to his mental state  like how he thinks Lo s mother doesn t notice he suddenly changes his mind about not wanting to live with her because he sees Lo   the fire of his loins   HH tells us how he plays the coy father role and   again because his perception is off   the reader can only assume that Lo and her mother both notice his desires for Lo  hence  Lo s acts of  seducing  and her mother s attempts to lead him astray with marriage and religion  her extreme jealousy  and finally her invasion of his personal things   Another tid bit of the story that might have been tampered with is Lo s mother s death  HH said he had nothing to do with it   a mere timely coincidence   but there s no way of knowing if he truly had nothing to do with it This then leads to his skillful plan   executed quite perfectly in his mind  He takes his Lolita and commits an act he gives every excuse for in order to persuade the reader that it s right  though it s generally seen as wrong  all the while  he is terrified someone will find out his secret and have him locked up  Not to mention  his  lover  that he says he cares so much for is extremely unhappy so he s also afraid that she ll run away  There s no doubt that these fears are simply selfish even when he swears he cares for Lolita  The things that fuel his anger revolve around jealousy  losing his little slave  and Lo not obeying  She is depicted as an object with the horrible side effect of not wanting to give up what HH wants from her  Despite the fact that HH presumes a father like role in public and is perceived as protective  it is not the sort of protection in Lo s best interest  her protection is merely his best interest   if you can even call what he does  protection  Lo s disappearance really throws HH through a loop because he has then lost the thing he had looked for all his life and even made disgusting plans to impregnate in order to fondle the   hopefully   girl child  The reader is then entertained by his wild spout of insanity as he tries to track his prized possession down  Things get slow after that because he gives up eventually  relying on his relationship status with a small drunken woman for his writings  Long after HH has stopped tracking her and she looks to her  father  for financial aid  it s amusing that his first reaction is to shoot someone  Obviously  the man is still crazy  He goes after Lo despite his little girlfriend and wielding a gun in his hand  The reader is then put through the suspense of wondering HH s next move  Will he shoot the girl or kidnap her or both or neither  Will he shoot her husband or her child or both or neither  Could there be anyone else to get in his line of fire  anyone else that he could blame all of this on The man he does wind up in a bloody fight with and the story behind all of it completely blew me away  Nabokov s expertise at foreshadowing and side plots is incredibly clever  Even though this story has unearthing controversy to draw the reader to it even after all these years  the most remarkable thing about it is how well the storyline was put together and how real Mr  Humbert   the insane and cocky yet fiercely frightened Mr  Humbert   seems Even with the looks I get when I read this book  I d gladly read it again and again   It may even be my favourite book ever  I read it when I was almost 13 years old and I have to say it influenced me terribly and without it I wouldn t be myself today  I wouldn t recommend people to read it at the age I did but it certainly is a must read once in a lifetime  The controversy of this book and storyline is put in a shadow by Nabokov s exellency in writing  Lolita remains with me  Questo libro puo disgustare  traumatizzare  puo nauseare  intristire  sconvolgere  irritare  far arrabbiare  Puo anche lasciare indifferenti o perche no addirittura piacere  Ma tutti noi lettori  senza alcuna riserva  possiamo assieme inchinarci di fronte alla vera protagonista di questa squallida storia  L Arte della scrittura  Quella vera  Third reread  Extra star added since last read  probably because I understood the last paragraph for the first time  and that  on it s own  is 5 star worthy  Obviously a lot more fun to pick apart than to actually read for pleasure  I could not even begin to describe and put into words the wide range of often conflicting emotions I felt all throughout the story  It was very rich  vivid  poignant  and the details as described by the author felt so excruciatingly real  In a way  I wanted to sympathize with him  in that I felt his agony  remorse and aching desire for atonement  and yet he could not escape his singular obsession and adoration for Lolita and her beauty  I felt his hell  and at times I was revolted by his weakness  I could not comprehend the complexity of it all  but I believed him when he said he loved her  Mad as it was  it was a love story of sorts  a heart wrenching one  so real I could not help but feel for the characters  If at first  it was merely out of sheer lust  somehow  over the course of time  it developed into love  not only for Lolita s beauty  but for Lolita and her ways  the very essence of her  Like him  I desperately searched for something to justify the wickedness of his acts  that it was born out of love  but no  it was selfish and he knew it  I could not help but think of their motivations for staying with each other  and how Lolita must have felt throughout the whole ordeal  At times  she was so indifferent  so agreeable  sometimes coquettish  that I felt like she could be okay with it  But she was a child  a child who couldn t truly know  a child uprooted from her family and everything she was familiar with  so that she was made to rely on one man  this man  her pseudo dad who gave her trinkets and treats if she were to do these unspeakable things  Would have everything turned out well if Lolita didn t allow herself to be whisked away by Cue  Would everything have been justified if they got married and had little Lolitas  as what was suggested in the line of Humbert s poem   you cheated me out of my redemption   Would he really have been redeemed by then  had it been the case  All these thoughts  all these feelings  will last me through the years  There are lines in the story that just stays with you  haunts you  It is a very moving story that reels you in the author s mind and heart  and it disgusts and awes all the same  and all this   it echoes within you for hours and days after you ve finished reading the last word and finally closed the book   This annotated edition illuminates the text in many surprising ways and provides interesting pointers to the rest of  Vladimir Nabokov s works  so the reader can not only understand all the allusions and references  and many of them may be obscure now  almost 50 years after the book s first publication  but identify within the book the recurrent themes and elements of style that characterize Nabokov s entire literary career  Disturbing  Dark   Perverse  Beautifully Ugly Read  I Loved It  One of my top five books of all times This book uses the most flawless English I have ever read  English being my second language makes me appreciate this book even more  Nabokov learned English as an adult  this book was written when he was older  I read his other book   Ada or Ardor  and you can tell that it had a lot of pieces that were later used for Lolita  However  Ada is a translation and it didn t have the melody of Lolita Besides the story  which has an anti climatic ending  reading this book is almost like listening to the music by Delibes   Copelia   Howard Gardner in his book  frames of minds  talks about different types of intelligences  I think that Nabokov was a true virtuoso of the language  Lolita is a composition masterpiece   The cynical nature of Humbert Humbert will simultaneously entrap and disgust the reader  Vladimir Nabokov makes the twisted relationship Humber and Lolita have seem socially acceptable and somewhat romantically envious  insert eyebrow raises from the reader   This is a very underrated  controversial  and ultimately poetic novel that I highly recommend to anyone with a taste in great literature  It s impossible not to give Lolita 5 5 stars  After all  it s on most literary critics  lists of the greatest English language novels of the 20th century  The book is a formidable combination of masterful style and brilliant story telling  For days I delayed opening it despite knowing that I really ought to  Don t make that mistake  Don t be put off by the fact that Humbert  the protagonist and narrator  is a pedophile  This is but one theme among many in the story  And don t think you ve got it all down if you ve seen the movie  you haven t  The novel is different  and a lot meatier  My only frustrations with the book derive directly from the foibles of Humbert  the protagonist and narrator  He is pedantic  arrogant  effete  self absorbed  and ostentatiously intellectual  and he enjoys expressing in French that which might just as easily be said in English  because he can  I don t know French  and Humbert doesn t stoop to provide translations  He also lards his commentary with esoteric literary and mythologic allusions  The result is a character whom we can t stand  but whom Nabokov presents to us masterfully and in the full  For all its erudition  the book is absorbing  readable  and worthy of its status as a classic  My first experience of the great russian master s prose and I can t imagine a better introduction to Nabokov than this annotated version of Lolita  Without Apple s notes I would probably have read it as a straight forward  beautifully written story and missed all of the references  puns and symbols  Granted  it was tiring to have to stop almost in every paragraph and go searching for the explanations in the back of the book  but finding the clues and little games that Nabokov has sprinkled throughout his novels  or rather  having them pointed out to you  add another dimension to the reading experience  Having read Lolita partially through Apple s eyes I felt better prepared when I tackled the next novel by Nabokov  Indeed I went through  The real Sebastian Knight  making copious notes on my own  stopping frequently to find out more about possible clues on the internet  I understand that this may seem a bit excessive to many readers  not to mention Nerdy   and it must be said that the style  beauty and genius of Nabokov s prose make it well worth reading without worrying about these clues  but  as the the many nabokov groups on the internet attest to  these games add and almost addictive quality to reading Nabokov On top of everything else I was genuinely moved by this book  It was a long and arduous read  but proved to be the most rewarding ever  The craftiness of this narrative is unparalleled  showing us how  normal  and  likeable  someone can be  even when that person is monstrous  I love that this book accomplishes  perhaps too well  an essential task of humanity  That we care for a human being simply because of their humanity  even if we DESPISE their actions  Humbert is a terrible person  but we can offer him sympathy even as we condemn him  If only we could do that with all of humanity  the world might be a better place  a beloved classic for readers of all ages Nabokov is poetic in writing Lolita despite the socially unacceptable age difference between the protagonist and his love interest  Once you get over the fact he s a total pedophile the actual writing itself is tear jerkingly beautiful  I highly reccomend this book   Creepy  but written so well   Lolita itself is a masterwork  Frankly  I don t feel the need to expound on that What I m particularly excited about now is the audiobook version of Lolita narrated by Jeremy Irons  ISBN 13  978 0739322062   What a fantastic casting choice  and what an astounding audiobook  My full review is here  http   booksforears com 2008 01 06 lo    I highly recommend this annotated version over the other ones  I want to point out how sympathetic Nabokov is towards Lolita  that this is not a novel that titillates  There is a massive crime in Lolita s rape by H  Understanding the depth and consequences of that violence begins with realizing how unreliable H s narration is  He tries to erase Lolita s self  and shape it to his desires  just as he tries to shape the reader s view of his actions  But Nabokov doesn t allow H s character to claim omniscience   This novel was eerily beautiful  Pedophilia is a touchy subject  but the thing with this book is that Humbert Humbert managed to hide how deranged he was under a mask of flowery diction that made you nearly sympathize with him  It is only in his most critical moments where you can see through his guise of  love  for Lolita  if only for a second  At the end of his book  all of his lies fall away and you can truly see the extent of his insanity  Brilliant  and the reason why I gave the novel five stars  Lolita used English better than just about anyone I ve ever read  and it wasn t even his first or second language  His prose is three simultaneous games of chess with eyes closed  brain surgery with a chainsaw juggler s flourish  In the 1950 s he wrote a book about paedophilia and incest that also happens to be a roaring page turner and managed to ruin a lovely girl s name  it s about as likely that anyone in the English speaking world will call their daughter Lolita as they will name their son Adolf  Hemingway counted on you to fill in the spaces left by unnecessary words  Nabokov used the unnecessary words to show you just how dull you are compared to him  Of course  this book deserves more than five stars  I m not rating classics  but after seeing how many religious nuts have given this great book a poor rating  I figured I d do my part to counteract them and raise the rating by a millionth of a percentage point   Truth is  I do re read this book once a year or so  and every time I do  it gets even better   Nabokov captures amazingly well the world of a pedofile  Add Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert in the movie and one might actually start doubting in his her own sanity and think that this kind of love affair is something beautiful  The end of the story is of course less romantic and shows pretty well where this kind of affairs might lead   violent child abuse  poor mental health and suicide murder  But from storytelling point of view  style and Nabokov s ability to get into a criminal s mind this book is a masterpiece indeed   Perfect and unfettered brilliance  I have only one question  why did I leave this book untouched on my shelf for years  Probably because of a vague distrust or a mild  ungraspable aversion  Both proved to be entirely unfounded I read it partly in Hungarian  partly in English  sometimes comparing the two  The translation is splendid  the original a genius  Let me offer you a short excerpt  Such passages are waiting to jump at you unexpectedly from the pages  turning the mundane into something divinely beautiful  Some way further across the street  neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart  the outline of a restaurant sign  a large coffee pot  kept bursting  every full second or so  into emerald life  and every time it went out  pink letters saying Fine Foods relayed it  but the pot could still be made out as a latent shadow teasing the eye before its next emerald resurrection  In fact  I would say that the most important feature of this book is that it is beaufitul  My first Nabokov   and I certainly hope it will not be my last  I am only a poor little girl and I do not have the talent to express in words what Nabokov does with his  C est inexplicable   Yazilmasi gereken o kadar cok sey var ki bu kitaba dair  Aklimi basimdan aldi desem yeridir  Pedofili ile ilgili bir kitabi baskasi yazsa mide kramplari gecirir  bu ne ya der firlatirdim kenara belkide ama Nabokov un oyle sihirli bir dili var ki okumamak imkansizdi  Hele ki yazarin bu kitabi nasil yazdigina dair detayli bir okuma gerceklestiriyorsaniz vazgecin bu sevdadan derim aklimi kaciracak gibi oluyordum yazdigi sozcuklerin ele avuca sigmazligi ile  bazi elestirmen dangalaklar kurmaca bir oykuyu ahlaki degerlerle karsilastirip yazara sallamaya calismislar ki boyle bir salakligi nasil yaptiklarini halen anlayamiyorum  nabokov bir sanatci ve okunan kitabi bir sanat unsuru olarak degerlendirmeleri gerekirdi  sanat sanat icin degil midir ki  vay efendim kucucuk kiza hede hodo  okuma arkadasim o zaman kimse kitaptan ders cikarip kucuk kizlara nasil sarkilir feyzini almaya calismiyor  bir sanatcinin hayalgucu sinirlarini kesfe cikiyor sadece  sirf nabakov un uslubu icin tapilircasina okunur bir kitap diyorum  nabokov u suana kadar okudugum tum yazarlarin en ustune cikariyorum  siradisi ve kaliteli bir kitap okusam da ne okusam acaba diye dusunenlere siddetle tavsiye ediyorum  bir ilginc konu da nabokov un zamaninda benim cok deger verdigim sartre ile girdigi agiz dalasi  tabi tek sartre da degil dostoyevski yi bile elestirmis ve dusunuyorum da ben nabokov olsam ben de elestirirdim  adam edebiyatin tanrisi desem cuk oturur bence   I m probably going to say what a million readers have already said about this book   Its language is entrancing and gorgeous  It s got to be one of the most imminently quotable of all books  but what I think is most notable is its subtle commentary skewering the society we all know  The satire feels entirely unintentional and incidental against Humbert s machinations and obsessions with little girls and his special nymphette I was initially thrilled by Nabokov s facility by language and horrified by the subject  and that didn t really change for most of the book  but then something else started happening to my brain  The mutual seduction of a twelve year old girl had suddenly moved beyond my outrage to a dumbstruck and almost clinical detachment  watching the tumultuous living arrangements of this father and his step daughter as they traveled around the country and briefly attempted to settle down in a quiet town instead of hopping the border  watching it degenerate as the pressure of a confused and immature girl learns to play all the strings of Humbert s bow  and he lets her because he is ultimately so damn weak and drunk on possessiveness and mindless jealous rages  never once seeing the little girl for who she was or truly acknowledging that she was desperately unhappy despite moments of returned passion littered with her despoiled self worth From Lolita s story  it was more than just the end of innocence  It was the indoctrination of a woman by the sick standards of all men  turning her into nothing but a whore turning tricks in order to survive  Humbert was trapped by his own desires  sure  and blind to anything but his own passions  but he only barely recognized what he was truly doing to her  No matter how many movies or plush hotels they frequented  no matter how many gifts he gave  he never understood that true understanding might have been the real key to her heart   And I say this  regardless of the sickening subject of child molestation  It is only one side  and a truly sensational one in the horrific sense  but Nabokov s genius lay in telling equally important tales within this singular novel that transcended the hook  I truly believe that this story does an excellent job of pointing out exactly how perverse our world is  that we can accept such a mode of thinking as perfectly normal in such lesser doses  that the need to possess something or someone so uniquely and rapturously  can be easily carried to further extremes  such as carrying the rule of law  the continued subjugation of women  or even men by their own stunted ability to think or break free of all the things they understand to be right and just in a society so damn sick in its heart that I just want to cry and cry and cry Okay  This was a pretty effective novel on many more levels  but this is what I m leaving this review on   I watched the movie Lolita  the 1997 version  not the original one  last night  It was suggested by my best pen pal when I asked her which is the most beautiful movie you have ever seen  Hmmmm  Lolita and I have a love hate relationship  Don t get me wrong  I love Nabokov  I think he was one of the most honest yet abstract writers of his time and Pale fire happens to be one of my favourites of all time  To be fair  the movie is beautiful  It s more like a slideshow of aesthetically shot scenes and sometimes it seems that the director is trying too hard to put eye candy shots between the narrative  Dominic Swain  although a tad bit taller for Lo  does the role justice  And of course Jeremy Irons  no singing praises needed What bothers me is the story itself  I first read Lolita when I was 14 and just out of school and needless to say it completely outraged my sheltered  Indian  middle class puritanical morality  Maybe it was the similarities in ages or maybe my teenage psyche wasn t evolved enough to comprehend the intricacy of such a topic but the book left a disgusting taste in my mouth  Before reading I knew that this was book about a man s obsession with a young girl  but I expected it to be just that  an obsession inside his head  a sullied fantasy and nothing more  All through the first half of the book I kept praying that Humbert doesn t actually act on his impulses and  repents  his sinful thoughts and later becomes the perfect father to this lovely little girl  Happily ever after and everything  I read the book again just before leaving college and it felt like I was reading the book for the very first time  But this I could see the book for what it s  a brilliant piece of literature  I remember running to the dictionary hundreds of time because the pages were filled with big words I never heard of  This book taught me that it s OK to use big words if they are more appropriate to the context  it doesn t make you pretentious  I read somewhere that good literature pleases you  but great literature shocks  intrigues and leaves you speechless  Most people I know go into the fourth gear over praise mode or into the tight lipped disgust mode  but the subject leaves everyone mumbling  It s still not OK for people to discuss a book for its merit as art than apply it to a real life scenario and bringing up the author s sexuality  Humbert s obsession cannot be termed as true ephebophilia  because he wasn t obsessed with all young girls  He was only obsessed with Lo  and if the disparity of ages was absent  this book would be considered an epic romance  Having said that  when I watched the movie yesterday some of the love making scenes did make me cringe  Possibly because in my imagination the words did not come to life so blatantly  I always pictured Humbert a little more jaded  a little more ashamed of his actions  In the book the complexities of the characters soften the blow  so to speak  Like Humbert was much more than just a dull old pervert and Lo was much more than a precocious nymphet  But the movie version presents them very one dimensionally  IDK  it may just be my prejudice against movies based on brilliant books    Ci sono anime miti che giudicherebbero Lolita insignificante perche non insegna loro nulla  Io non sono ne un lettore ne uno scrittore di narrativa didattica  e  a dispetto delle affermazioni di John Ray  Lolita non si porta dietro nessuna morale  Per me un opera di narrativa esiste solo se mi procura quella che chiamero francamente volutta estetica  cioe il senso di essere in contatto  in qualche modo  in qualche luogo  con altri stati dell essere dove l arte  curiosita  tenerezza  bonta  estasi  e la norma   Vladimir Nabokov A masterpeice  however  the subject was disturbing  BINGO square   one word title I have two reactions on finishing this book  firstly  that Nabokov is such an astonishing writer  and secondly  it was great to finish and get out of Humbert Humbert s head  Nabokov s linguistic playfulness in his second or third language is breathtaking and his working vocabulary must be immense  The story is the memoir of a sex offender and his unrequited love for  and his predatory corruption of  Lolita  I m glad it s over but it is undeniably superb  Vladimir Nabokov fascinates me  He had synesthesia  and literary synesthesia is defined as  a writer s use of a metaphor of the senses   It gave him a unique perspective to weigh up the world around him  which I think manifests itself beautifully in the prose of Lolita Despite the taboo subject matter  I found myself forgetting that this was told from a narrator in love with an underage child  and instead got so seduced by the prose all I could perceive was the beauty of it  There are countless examples of stunning descriptions  effortless yet biting remarks on the world as Humbert saw it  and not to mention the rich use of words to add meaning  I must have had to look up 50  words on my Dictionary app just to be able to keep my grasp on what exactly the narrator was trying to convey Yes  the choice of subject matter is shocking  but I find it all the more shocking that some readers have failed to perceive the irony and sarcasm throbbing through the pages of this book  Take  for instance  Humbert s assertion that he is  now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop in Lolita s morals   or Miss Pratt s blind assumption that  Dolly is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet  I find it dangerous that so many have read this novel and seen it merely as a depiction of paedophilia  when it is so much more than this  In the novel s afterword  Nabokov declares that Lolita has  no moral in tow   and I m inclined to agree with this  He was not writing this to raise questions about whether or not Humbert s behaviour was abhorrent   that s already perfectly clear in Humbert s fate and his realisation that  What I heard was but the melody of children at play       the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from the concord   It s useless getting too bogged down with WHY and HOW an author write the novels they do  I think the key is just to appreciate the fact that they put pen to paper at all and could then subsequently inspire and influence thousands of others  What s especially poignant is Nabokob s almost inane assertion that his inspiration for writing the book was reading about an ape that was given drawing materials and then simply drew the bars of his cage  But the more I think about it  the more I seem inclined to believe that Lolita was Nabokov s attempt to write a novel outside of the confines of his literary cage   to write in a unfettered style  ignoring the traditional limits and restrictions of the literary tradition  Forget everything you ve heard about Lolita  Just don t forget while you re reading it  Nabokov s way of switching from feverish oral sex to the rolling landscapes of Western America only makes you as queasy as he wants it to  he s so damn good at it that people still think he must have shared desires with narrator Humbert Humbert  I don t care what his motives are  I just want to read more  It is almost impossible not to have a love hate relationship with Nabokov  He is quite possibly the most arrogant human  let alone writer  to have ever lived and this arrogance simultaneously helps and hurts his literature  It helps it because there is nothing more unique in the world of written word  It hurts it because his works are rarely grounded at all in any way  He would not see this as a detriment  but any sane  insanity is important  but here there is almost no sanity at all  human being wants to take something away from a book  Instead  you can take nothing away from this book other than viewing it as a purely sensual experience  It is the most sensual experience literature has to offer  and parodies itself by casting Humbert as the main character  Humbert is the mirror to every person who enjoys this book  a reminder that the enjoyment of the most profound art requires a great deal of perversion  amorality  solipsism  hedonism  and transcendent arrogance  Shamelessly  I must confess that I fall into the above categories  at least vicariously in the art I enjoy  so this book is definitely worth the read  if only to experience the wonderful mind and pure aesthetic modernism of the amoral hermit that Nabokov is  He is a freak  but a wonderful freak   La descripcion y la forma de describir la mentalidad de ese pederasta fue sublime  El leer este libro fue un reto por el inmenso odio que sentia hacia el protagonista  Un detalle que debo resaltar es el realismo de la obra  al no intentar presentar un cuento de hadas con el final feliz  sino que presento los hechos tal y como terminan este tipo de situaciones Recomendada al 100   aunque no es para todo lector  Es posible que llegue a ser muy pesado y dificil de leer para determinadas personas  okThis was difficult to read  at least in the beginning  Not really because of all the ephebophilia theme but mostly because of the away H H  show us his feelings along the way  it s just so  crude sometimes But i did enjoy it  one of the best books i have read in terms of writing style  The story is   to put it in one word  subtle  You realize there s something wrong there  of course  the obvious  but at the end you are able to see all the feelings that where changing  fighting   living  together   his feelings and some of her s  this sound strange  but i don t know how to explain myself without giving details  so  have a nice time reading it  and even if you want to stop  don t  Do just like me and talk to the book i hope no one saw that    the author it s going to my favorite author s list  Truly a masterpiece in storytelling  Every author can create a narrator who is likable  whom we want to root for  etc  It takes someone much more talented to create a narrator who abhor able and despicable and everything we detest    and yet  is still a man  The very best author can make us empathize with and root for that narrator  To say nothing of Nabokov s prose  genius  through and through  There s never a superfluous word  There s not even a single word who serves only one purpose  Every word is considered and necessary in denotation as well as connotation  diction  its shape on the page  its translation in French or Russian  those words  connotations and dictions    everything  Every writer who aspires to greatness or even decency must read this fine example   The book is even better than I imagined it would be  darkly humourous  poetic  creepy  Everyone should read this  Honestly  its worth the hype  So much better than all of the trash talk about it  Not a porno book  but a honest literary piece of life  distraction  love  and aging  It is the Breakfast of Tiffany s of novels  everyone says it is their favorite book  no one has read it serious in years  A nearly perfect novel  I read Lolita as research as my novel The Sleeping Serpent  and I don t know what took me so long  This book is written with such subtle  exquisite language  Narrated by a pedophile  the reader becomes engrossed in Humbert s thoughts and observations  It is painfully beautiful even though it is about obsession and abuse   Nabokov s writing can only by described as absolutely impeccable  The relationship between Lolita and Humbert Humbert is so beautifully honest and terrible  Humbert struggles between what he knows to be right  what he knows to be wrong  and what falls in between  and he makes distinctions in his behaviours that we know as readers are absurd  and yet it s hard to not feel for him I remember watching the Kubrick version of Lolita and crying at the end  and thinking that I surely wouldn t feel this way once I was reading his words and being inside his head  but even while he horrified me infinitely more with his internal monologue  he thinks some truly horrendous things   the book made me struggle with my emotions just as much  if not more  than the film did In my mind  Stanley Kubrick can do no wrong  excepting Barry Lyndon   I thought A Clockwork Orange was as a good as Anthony Burgess s creation  The Shining was even better than King s  and while I haven t read 2001  I imagine Kubrick probably won that one too  But not even Kubrick could come close to the brilliance that is Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita  So briliant it s scary  simply great  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita despite all the brand new nymphet matter what astound me more was Nabokov s English  his writing is one of the unbelievable achivements that any one has reached in a foreign language  all in all I love Lolita and I have a deep sympathy for Humbert  The subject matter is disturbing  I almost had to quit early on  However  this ended up being the best book I ve ever read  The author s use of language  and English is his 2nd language   is amazing  If you like audiobooks  get the one narrated by Jeremy Irons  Highly recommended   Jeremy Iron s performance was strikingly beautiful  He made Nobokov s novel come to life with passion  laughter  and the sadness that permeates throughout his words  It was simply exquisite  I avoided this book for a while because I thought it would be a thinly veiled romanticised pedo fantasy  Which in some ways it is  but it isn t an apologia  Humbert is a charismatic and persuasive narrator  he tries to evoke our sympathy  convince us he is gentle and harmless  his only crime is love  he is mourning the loss of his first love ect  Lolita seen through his eyes is a knowing  coquettish little manipulator  a  demon  rather than a real child  But through the facade we glimpse Humbert s real nature   e g his casual recollection cruelty to his first wife  twisting her injured wrist slapping her breasts  when he complains about how hard it is to manage Charlotte  he plans to drug and then molest Lolita in her sleep  to murder Charlotte    Even his great love for Lolita  which he presents as his main defence  is not love at all   to him she is a disposable object with a shelf life  and while claiming to love her eternally he also vaguely wonders how to get rid of her when she gets too old  He considers impregnating her and with a new victim   her daughter  his grand daughter  So towards the end his self defence  his Romantic image of himself crumbles  He recognises that he has ruined her life and condemns himself   Had I come before myself  I would have given Humbert at least 35 years for rape    In spite of this some people insist on viewing this as a love story  sympathising with  poor Humbert  and condemning the child he molested  little harlot   I don t know if these people read the same book I did  are just dense  or if this is just an ingrained attitude that women girls are always the sexual manipulators  We live in a culture where young girls are constantly sexualized  in fact the main legacy of Lolita is the fetishized image of a sexualized girl child  Lolita survives in people s minds  not as the victim of abuse she was in the novel  but as the  nymphet  image distorted through the mind of a pervert  which even Humbert renounces in the end   This gets 5 stars because it a technical level it blew me away  The prose is just beautiful  it boggles my mind that English was Nabakov s 2nd or 3rd language   It s been over ten years  I m re reading it  11 21 10  Bumped up a star to five  It was even better than I remembered  Uno de mis libros favoritos  Pueden leer mi recopilacion de frases en mi blog  http   bit ly 1mrCVU4 My first audiobook I ve always loved Jeremy Irons and felt that some of his roles were beneath his talents  although he is another of those famous British talents who do a lot of Shakespeare Nabokov is one of those writes who plays with the rhetoric of the narrator in such a fashion that  holy shit  for a lot of the book you can believe him  Humbert Humbert begins by defining the nymphet  and for some reason his deliver MIGHT convince you  though by the end of the book every girl is called a nymphet There are times when it s easy to hate Lolita  It s easy to feel bad for H H Then  there are moments where the truth slips through and you feel ashamed of yourself  for example  when H H  admits he pretends to fall asleep every night after which Lolita commences crying herself to sleep Whether or not you love hate the story  it cannot be denied a masterpiece example of good writing  And Jeremy Irons caresses those words and sentences  makes love to them  He knows when to drag out vowels  when to growl words  although growling always makes me think of Lion King s Scar   Wow wow wow  Every word is dripping with sensuality  every sentence sweeps at your ears and whispers its terrible sick song  The writing is so superbly twisted and evocatively wicked without being trite  It is just as pornographic  just as wrong  just as honest to god terrible  as the bulk of erotica in subject matter but no one could read this and discard it as trash  no one could mistake this for poor taste  I have never read anything quite like it  The story is disturbing  it makes you want to lock your children away from all the sickos of the world and keep them safe  even like in my case when you have no children of your own   It makes you realize how very many chance circumstances keep people from harm  what a toppling edge of sanity we all live on  and yet the complexity makes it engaging  The psychosis makes you ravage the book  I would have never thought that I could have enjoyed a book like this one  and frankly for subject matter I would not have  it made my heart retch  but the writing is an absolutely flawless performance of pure madness and no one could deny that is the truth  despite the terrible things this book contains  from a literary standpoint its a five   Everything about this book has already been said  Brilliant  BUT 1  this was not a love story  2  this was a story about abuse 3  Humbert at the end is him just being a half decent human being  not a loving father a man in love  whatever  Lolita   un grande classicoUno dei migliori romanzi di sempre  un grande  grandissimo classico  Amo il modo in cui e scritto  La creazione della parola  ninfetta  va oltre il genio  Trama  personaggi  descrizioni  costruzioni sintattiche  aggettivi  nomignoli  vezzeggiativi  tutto  Tutto talmente perfetto da sembrare ovvio  naturale  Lo scrittore VERO scrive cosi  Is this the greatest novel ever written  It s certainly up there  and my personal opinion is yes  From the controversial subject matter  beautiful language  written in Nabokov s second tongue  and depth of detail and emotion portrayed  Lolita makes for a great read from beginning to end  The middle section can seem slow  but if you can enjoy it for the descriptions of America and its people in the 50s as Humbert and Lo travel the country  you ll find much to appreciate  This novel will make you think and wonder about the human condition    why is it accetable for some things to titilate us but not others  What most people are mistaken about is that Nabokov is advocating the older man young girl relationship when in fact he is not  What he does is present a scenario that is remarkably and somewhat frighteningly human  and challenges the reader to come to their own conclusion on questions of normalcy and morality I think everyone should read this book   Lolita was one of the most beautiful  yet also most disturbing novels I ve ever picked up  Nabakov s writing style is both playful and layered with puzzles  and although it is by no means easy  it is enjoyable  However  his true genius simply lies in whatever trick he uses that he makes you want to read about such subject matter at all  I m sure there are allusions  connections  and inventions I glossed over or missed outright  this novel definitely deserves another reading  after a healthy interval  I can t stomach Humbert in high doses  Don t be repulsed by the pedophilia in the book  First of all  you would love the elegant  witty  and sometimes arcane prose of Nabokov  I cannot stress how exquisitely he used the English language to the extent that it seemed like a new and beautiful foreign language  Secondly  you might find yourself oscillating between love and hate towards the sexually obsessed pedophile but also very human Humbert Humbert  His story  his character  his love for the 12 year old nymphet Lolita will absorb you into their world  This book really made me laugh and cry   D I have only read two annotated editions  One was Alice in Wonderland and this title Lolita  It is sort of like having the bonus film footage on a Criterion DVD set  The annotated notes mentions the word plays  location importance and so forth  And Lolita is full of self reference material  A very enjoyable read  Lo lee ta  Light of my life  fire of my loins  Really nifty book  Once one gets past the creepiness  there is just so much to love about this book  the writing is so captivating  the language is so clever and Nabokov s mockery psychology and love is ultimately satisfying  The entire thing is just brilliantly done all around  and I really appreciated it  A literatura e verdadeiramente incrivel  visto permitir nos ver  sentir e saborear o mundo atraves da alma das personagens que narram ou sofrem estorias singulares  Este livro  dividido em duas partes  em dois momentos completamente diferentes  enseja ao leitor a possibilidade de vislumbrar o mundo atraves do olhar ironico de um homem extremamente douto e humoristicamente sarcastico  que nos convida a adentrar o seu universo ninfico e conhecer as suas mais intimas predilecoes sexuais  bem como seus medos e seus problemas em lidar com a sociedade que o cerca Contudo  o mais fantastico e que somos solicitados nao so a ler esse  memorial   essa quase ode ao objeto amado  porem dela participar como cumplices nos pequenos delitos psicologicos e nos grandes crimes que o narrador promove ao longo da narrativa  Isso porque  conquanto extremamente instigante  esse memorista que escreve sobre seus momentos de gloria com Lolita  ou melhor  Lo li ta  padece de uma predilecao defesa a sociedade  ou seja  gosta ele das  petites oiseaux  que pipilam e adejam a sua volta  encobertas ainda de uma penugem pre puberes    Uma narrativa psicologica densa e intensa  invertendo os papeis ao seu decorrer  It is rare in this world  that an author or poet can write well in a secondary or tertiary language  It is rarer still when an author can outshine native writers  Nabokov is a very rare author  If you re going to read Lolita  the first thing you need to know is that English was not Vladimir Nabokov s first language  And knowing just that should blow you away for that first chapter While the subject matter may make you cringe  you may find yourself continuing to read about Humbert Humbert because reading Nabokov s writing is easier than breathing and more beautiful than a Rocky Mountain sunrise   Through the writing of Nabokov I realized that I am a terrible writer  As a man writing in a non native tongue  Nabokov conveys in English what I have only hoped to do  If you want to not feel so bad about extreme May December romances  I suggest you read this  And I suppose you can check this book out if you re actually looking for a good read  too  Although  I am at the end yet   so we ll see  A girl read the opening paragraph of Lolita to me when I was 14 years old  I watched her tongue dance across her pallet and teeth as she read  I still think it s one of the best opening paragraphs ever written  Maybe it s because I was in love with the girl  but did Roxane have any complaints about the length of Cyrano de Bergerac s nose  Conversely  I have no complaints about the length of Humbert Humbert s    oops  Anyway it s a good book  I m particularly fond of when Nabokov slightly fumbles his adjectives and you get newspapers that are  obese  and young girls that are    oops  I did it again  I have reread the book a few times since then and though enjoyed it  never felt the lust and passion I did in youth  I think Nabokov could sympathise with these sentiments  I think Humbert could have as well  the freak  The _only_ thing I could add is that I read this as an ebook  and thought it was ridiculous that they didn t use the hyperlink abilities of ebooks in the annotation  I know  I know  the extra labor in setting that up would have increased the price of the book  but come on  what are unpaid interns for  Well written provocative book  Lolita  or maybe the title should read  A Portrait of a Pedophile   I added this book to my list due to the fact it is a book listed on the top of most  best of classic literature   This was difficult for me because of the subject matter  My first thought was  I can t read this book    moving on a few chapters in  I can t finish this book    and finally deciding to persevere  Although the character and narrator of the book is creepy and disgusting  I came to realize that is what he is meant to be  This is not just a book about a man s obsession with a child  it s not black and white  The author has written a complex story which takes twists and turns  I am still not a fan with this type of subject material but it was an intriguing read and masterfully done  I had a really hard time deciding how to rate this book  The first half was very disturbing and difficult to read  By Part Two it was easier  perhaps because Humbert becomes much more oblique in describing his encounters with Lolita  Still  no one enjoys being in the mind of a pedophile  And since Nabokov successfully accomplishes what so many people have noted before  his beautiful language makes the reader sympathetic to Humbert and gives the book a beauty that its narrative content doesn t deserve  you really have to wrestle  as a reader  with the nature of desire and the duplicity with which we surround it  as well as the ethics of art appreciation That being said  Nabokov is a phenomenal writer  and it s been a while since I let myself indulge in literature instead of academic non fiction  For his excellent use of language and the introspection this book inspired  5 stars  Video review chat expletive on Chareadzard  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita   Despite this being his most famous and beloved book it took me a while to warm up to it  The beginning dragged a little bit for me but it gains momentum as the story progresses  It only got better and by the end I understood why it s such a favorite The language is really carefully engineered  as usual  and has plenty of little hints  funny wordplay  and allusions to other works  I m sure I missed a lot of these since it references a lot of French authors I ve never even heard of   I especially liked the continual parallels to the poem  Annabelle Lee    A Pretty Disturbing Book  ARGH  I hate Humbert  I pity Lolita  This book was wonderful  I had to put it down several times because I was disgusted by what I was reading and yet I was so drawn to how beautifully it was written  5 stars   This book truly touched me  Most people read this and only scratch the surface  being disgusted and only seeing a pedophile  I was reminded by this book that I have done things and felt things I am too ashamed to ever tell anyone about  I was touched by this man wrestling with himself over his sinful desires  descending into madness because of it  It inspired some intense conversations between me and God and ended with me being so grateful that I have him to forgive me and guide me back home   My mind has entangled the book with the Kubrick film  They play as one continuous narrative  If my memory serves me with any form of accuracy  the film makes Humbert a little more likeable and funny  Is this the right tone for descrbing a nervous guilt laden pedophile  Don t answer that  please  You have to read this just to understand the line in the Police s  Don t Stand So Close To Me    He starts to sneeze  he starts to cough  just like the old man in that book by Nabokov  Vladimir Nabokov is a genius  I m going to read this again soon  This novel leaves you thinking for dayyyss after you finish reading it   Boy  I didn t not think I would find this book as charming and sympathetic as I did  The writing is crazy good  I see what all the fuss is about   I initially picked up this book for a book club and was interested to read it because of all the controversy surrounding it  I went into it knowing the basic premise of the book but not knowing fully what to expect  That being said I was a little surprised as I did not expect things to go as far with Lolita as they did  I had thought it was imagined and that Humbert never would actually touch her   This is a disturbing book  seeing through the eyes of an extremely twisted and manipulative individual who manages to control a young prepubescent girl and who romanticizes their relationship  The main characters view of little girls is sickening and his will power to get what he wants from Lolita is really quite upsetting That being said  I do really love this book and how it is written  If you are new to classical literature this is a good beginner book  Not because of the content obviously  but Nabokov s writing is beautiful and easily understood  The reader is pulled in quickly to the story and at no point did I feel bored or have a hard time understanding what was being said  This is why I gave this book 5 stars  This is my first Nabokov novel and I am interested to read his other works because I feel like his writing style is so unusual to find in many classics  Nabokov was quite brave to publish this book knowing that this is such a dark  taboo subject    With the utmost simplicity and clarity I now saw myself and my love  Previous attempts seemed out of focus in comparison  A couple of years before  under the guidance of an intelligent French speaking confessor  to whom  in a moment of metaphysical curiosity  I had turned over a Protestant s drab atheism for an old fashioned popish cure  I had hoped to deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a Supreme Being  On those frosty mornings in rime laced Quebec  the good priest worked on me with the finest tenderness and understanding  I am infinitely obliged to him and the great Institution he represented  Alas  I was unable to transcend the simple human fact that whatever spiritual solace I might find  whatever lithophanic eternities might be provided for me  nothing could make my Lolita forget the foul lust I had inflicted upon her  Unless it can be proven to me   to me as I am now  today  with my heart and my beard  and my putrefaction   that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac  unless this can be proven  and if it can  then life is a joke   I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art  To quote an old poet   The moral sense in mortals is the duty We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty   Wow  amazing and I understand why it s considered one of the best novels ever written  I have to confess that it was a pretty difficult read for me and I feel like I must have missed out on a lot due to the complex wordplay  literary references and french quotes  Will probably read it again but an annotated version  Disgustingly beautiful  Nabokov je zaista majstor pisane reci  Malo je reci da mi je tema bila sokantna  ali stil njegovog pisanja je zaista predivan  Neverovatno mi je sa koliko detalja opisuje Hambertova osecanja  dubinu njegove opsesije  Bilo je nekih delova koji su mi isli malo sporije i koje sam htela i da preskocim ali na kraju nisam jer sve to utice na krajnji rezultat  Sve u svemu klasik vredan citanja  jedan od najboljih pisaca koje sam ikada citala  This book left me in a more miserable state than I was when I first opened it  My attitude towards it changed overnight from mildly disgusted to absolutely fascinated  or should I say  enchanted     thanks to my professor  I fell for the story  and it makes me sad to realize that our tragic protagonists both die shortly after the story concludes  and the fact that I felt sorry for them makes me wonder if I  too  have lost sight of the line between the beauty and the beastly    as H H  himself did  I can see it now  why it s called  the only convincing love story of our century   and perhaps being convinced is the only true crime  This book is a twisted emotional roller coaster ride  Very well written  If you can handle the subject matter without being triggered  this book is well worth the read  One of the best books I have ever read  Humbert Humbert describes Lolita s name as  lyrical  and  lilting   and the same can be said about Vladimir Nabokov s haunting and musical writing style Nabokov inhabits Humbert chillingly  from his lecherous descriptions of  nymphets   select girls between the ages of 6 and 14 who appeal sexually to the poet and the artist in him   to his cruel branding of adult women as bovine  Nabokov also ensures that his readers sympathise with this apparently perverted man as he falls in love with 12 year old Lolita  becoming emotionally vulnerable to her whilst sexually exploiting her Humbert begins by addressing the reader   Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury   a literary manouevre which mires Nabokov s audience in the fundamental problem of trying to  judge  in black and white terms the vague and dazzling emotional complexities of life  Though Humbert s entreaties and thoughts are unsettling  especially the imagining of his wife  Charlotte  dead  so that he can pursue sex with her daughter  and the use of narcotics to sedate Lolita so that he can explore her body  Humbert is a weakened man  His too fond remembrance of detail Lolita s  monkey  feet  the sinking of a long thumbnail once into Lolita s mosquito bite  the downy hair on her  colt  like body suggest an obsession that is one sided  The stark contrast between Humbert s poetic phrasing and Lolita s coarse and childish voice emphasises the emotional chasm between the two  as well as Humbert s potential to never recover when she realises her own autonomy and power over him Clare Quilty  the glamorous character that makes this possibility reality for Humbert when he seduces Lolita  is played amazingly by Peter Sellers in Stanley Kubrick s movie version of the novel   I  read  this book in an audio version  superbly narrated by Jeremy Irons  who played Humboldt in the movie version   The spectacular prose transcends the repellant subject matter  Simply one of the finest arrangements of the English language in existence  It takes a true master like Nabokov to take such a morally vile and unreliable narrator and turn his horrifying tale of weakness  manipulation  and violation into a work of astounding beauty that one cannot look away from Even though its plot and characterization are inventive  deeply nuanced  and clever  the sheer brilliant fever dream gorgeousness of the words is the crowning jewel in the book s tarnished crown The annotated edition of this book is  in particular  a treat for lovers of beautiful language and wordplay  It acts as a helpful guidebook to the myriad labyrinth of subtle joke after joke and sly play on words that  Lolita  seems to shudder with on every page  Although I ve read it countless times  it feels as if every time I read it brings a new small bit of beauty that I didn t notice before  Any time that I travel  the annotated edition is stuffed into my carry on  as I can pick it up and open it at any point and just gorge on the loveliness  For my part  as one of Nabokov s fellow synesthetes   Lolita  is a vast sinful dessert buffet laced with mescaline   Lolita  follows a paranoid narcissist whom I wanted to hate  But Nabokov s writing is so beautiful  and his characters are well developed  even a predator s humanity is palpable  I grieved for Dolly and Humbert  too  The narrator s quotes on love are beautiful beautiful beautiful and poignant as hell  Of course they re famous  But I wonder  given the nature of their nonconsensual relationship  does Humbert really love her  or is he just obsessed and delusional  Is Nabokov making a statement about the nature of love by examining this relationship  Does Humbert love Dolly for who she is  or could any young girl have become his obsession  Should I read Lolita again in a more academic setting  I would like to focus on duality as well as the eroticism brought to the text by sexually charged diction through out the novel  Elements of a classic crime  remorse  and redemption parable are also an interesting addition to this text   Far from feeling any relief  a burden even weightier than the one I had hoped to get rid of was with me  upon me  over me   The last few pages are so beautiful it hurts  Humanity is too complex  Humbert is really sick  he hurt a child too much  He broke her  I wish Lana del Rey would stop romanticizing this shit   ALL TIME READ Lolita proves handy as my lemon test for figuring out whether people are worth knowing  If  when discussing it  they reveal that they think it is a book only or even primarily about an old dude sleeping with a young girl  then I do not discuss literature with them anymore It may not be worth arguing with people over  But it certainly is worth severing marginal friendships over   And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita  Despite its protag s perverse predilections  this book beautifully captures obsession in words  The last fifty pages had some especially dizzying prose  I did take some issues with it  comme les expressions francaises excessives and Humbert s TMI meandering  which I dunno whether that s a character trait  or Nabokov himself  He s an excellent unreliable narrator  however  and the journalistic device of a reflective doomed man was well employed with all his winks to the reader and the wordplay coinage and the overused alliteration  These are guilty pleasures that would normally incur a red pen  but again  the point of view permits it   A very light cloud was opening its arms and moving toward a slightly more substantial one belonging to another  more sluggish  heavenlogged system   You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  Wow  Nabokov really proves his skill by turning this deplorable subject into a thing of beauty  I ve heard people complain about this novel as if it s defending pedophilia  It s true that the reader is addressed as a member of the jury  which seems to present the subject as somehow debatable  but there s really no question that every treatment of Lolita is a crime But the reader is unable to just shout a sentence  bang a gavel  and keep H H  as far far away as we want him to be  We have to keep listening to his seductive prose and find ourselves reluctantly  horrifyingly moved  His words and intelligent psychoanalyses start to make us see him as a sort of victim too   and what does that make us  And what of poor Lolita  more symbol than person  The blinded narration blocks our own view of her  She has no voice or even a true name  And this work of labored  tortured  doomed   and evil   love  with so many lines we can t help but see as romantic   claims to be for her  to immortalize her  But then where is she      my Lolita remarked   You know what s so dreadful about dying is that you re completely on your own   and it struck me  as my automaton knees went up and down  that I simply did not know a thing about my darling s mind and that quite possibly  behind the awful juvenile cliches  there was in her a garden and a twilight  and a palace gate   dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me  in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions      In case the jury needed more evidence  I loved the last fight scene with Quilty  especially because of its comic absurdity with the party goers  reactions and the length of the death  That the reality of murder matched up with H H s dreams of futile powerless attempts seemed to solidify his character  And the parallels to  ironic   impotency show that he thinks of himself as a       moth or butterfly  still alive  safely pinned to the wall   nature study       Even though that s really what Lolita is to him I wish I d read in class or book group   there s so much to analyze and discuss  Oh  my Lolita  I have only words to play with    Lolita  written by Vladimir Nabokov  is a classic fictional novel known for its controversial mannerisms  some readers may call it a tragic comedy and others might even consider it a romance novel  Ultimately  the most important characters in this book consist of the middle aged handsome European Humbert Humbert and a twelve year old American girl named Dolores Haze  Throughout the book Humbert gives Dolores a plethora of pet names such as Dolly  Lo  Lola  and  the most famous of them all  Lolita  Additionally  the reader is able to be immersed in the mind of what the outside world would undoubtedly label as a psychopathic pedophile  Lolita s feelings towards Humbert are very mixed as the story goes on  because as she grows older herself she slowly becomes lucid to the situation she is actually in  Nabokov has somehow crafted a feeling of pathos towards Humbert at many points in the book as well  this is mainly because the book is written in the first person point of view of Humbert himself  Through this element of literature the reader can truly see why the main character is who he is  In as many ways as he can  Humbert makes his unrequited love towards the tween or  nymphet  girl known   This book would certainly be recommended to a very specific group of people  due to its extremely graphic and controversial plot and prose  In my opinion  I would recommend this book to a person who is open to different points of view and is not ultimately set in his her ways  Additionally  the language can be very complex at times consisting of advanced terms and historical references  In order to truly appreciate this book  one must be highly educated in such topics  Lastly  this book illustrates scenes that may be offensive to some readers so if the topic of pedophilia sounds deterring to you then this book is most definitely not for you   It sounds creepy but it is outstanding  Lolita  From the first paragraph  lyrical and vivid  Delightful in its alliterations  stacatto sentences mixed with long lush robust ones Engaging  interesting at the very least  Funny even  in parts  An interesting look into a mind of a mad man   You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style   Ugh  I loved the prose  It flowed very well and it sounded lovely to the mind s ears  The imagery  The word play Considering the subject matter  even though I loved the prose  it was uncomfortable to read sometimes  as it very well should   The protagonist  while despicable  was not entirely an unsympathetic character  Humbert is not only aware of his transgressions  he berates himself for it  he regrets  he gets the gravity of the situation  He knows how twisted and fucked up he is  he explains his theory as to why he is that way  and we see him battle for normalcy  and how much he struggled with this  at first  He has charm  he is attractive  he is intelligent  he is a  sort of  romantic  But he is what he is  and what he is is someone who does some pretty bad things  Despite his apologies and the charm  he remains irredeemable to my eyes  Was it love or was it not  I think it was love  Scary thing  love  I think love doesn t always mean you treat your beloved well  It was a destructive kind of love  thus resulting in a tragic life for young Dolores  Poor lolita  You know those people who can rattle off Shakespeare  or line after line of a famous poem  That s not me  Lolita not only compels me to memorize a phrase here  a paragraph there  first one  actually   but a few choice phrases stick so firmly in your head that it s almost impossible NOT to memorize them  The memoirs of an love affair  written so extraordinarily and passionately that it d be easy to forget it is the memoir of a pedophile   that is  if Nabokov didn t remind you of it constantly  I will never forgive him for a few especially brutal sentences  but then again  I m glad I never caught myself secretly rooting for Humbert Humbert  the fiend   Brilliantly written  the relationship between H H  and Lolita is analogous to many relationships in today s day The tour across America and the Midwest gives a nostalgic and sentimental look at how things were 60 years ago now   Let me be mawkish for the nonce  I am so tired of being cynical  We are all captives of our own desires   and live in the boundaries defined by the desires of others  Or  as Nabokov claims  the story has no message moral purpose  Nonetheless you re bound to read yourself into the novel  and  thus  walk away with some sort of moral tinge afterward  Not that I have read a vast array of classic novels  but this book is definitely in my top three  right up there with  Fahrenheit 451  by Ray Bradbury  I just absolutely love how Nabokov writes  There are so many plays on words and beautiful descriptions of the most terrible lusts that one could spend their life uncovering and connecting them  I shall definitely re read this thoroughly when I am not so pressed for time  Don t worry about its controversy  this is definitely worth the read  Even those who despise classic authors will find this book enjoyable   The innocence of a child is the most beautiful thing  So YES  Nabokov s Lolita is wrong  detestable  sad  horrific  but in the end  it is art  If you re not willing to be seduced by art  why read  If you want a lesson in  morality   don t look to Nabokov  Yes  I was seduced by Nabokov s art  and saw how nymphets could be goddesses  which is very disturbing  If you really let go of your defenses  and try to imagine the world through the perspective of HH  at certain moments  YOU would have become a pedophile So is Lolita dangerous  I think not  If I had a daughter  I d be more suspicious of a lover of morality than a lover of Nabokov s Lolita  Because art is true to life  It s honest in that way  whereas you never know what these moralizers really are underneath the facade  They say all the right things  but who knows On Nabokov s writing  genius  One could never picture a scene so clearly as he does  Oh so poetic and seductive  the language  it seemed even to my non native ears  Structurally a bit boring perhaps    I saw the movie first  that was my mistake   First reaction   This is hilarious  H H  is just so weird  Haha  As I read further   God  He is slowly creeping me out    And much further   Urgh  He s a FREAK and a MANIAC alright  At the end   Noo   He did love Lolita in his own obsessive  miserable way  Oh my god  He did  This is a very startling insight in the mind of a person like Humbert Humbert  Fascinating and enjoyable  but at the end of the novel  you ask yourself  How do I love  How do I show my love  Or is it even love I am feeling   It makes you shudder  One advice  Read it   Like a Greek tragedy  but leavened with irony and acute observation  Nabakov makes us see the world from the twisted perspective of Humbert Humbert  Looking at other reviews of this book on Goodreads it still has the power to shock  Although we don t share HH s predilection for young girls  I think it shocks us that we can relate to many of his human experiences of longing and loss  Perhaps this book has a very ethical effect  It forces us to ask ourselves questions about right and wrong and think deeply about the consequences of obsession and transgression  Beautifully written story What I didn t get was people who felt like they sympathized with HH I ll admit  the anticipation in ACT1 had me almost rooting for him to get past Charlotte and actually see what would materialize with Lo  but when it actually happened you realize how sick his plan actually was From then  even IF it was her who initiated the first encounter  it s all just disturbing Who doesn t see that he robbed her of her childhood  Her outlook on what s normal I almost felt like there were some luls in ACT2  but I was missing out on a lot of the clues along the way I had to go back and reread ACT2 to actually get it You know it s a great book when you wake up in the middle of the night still thinking about something in the book  and needing to pick it up and go back to it Had to give it 5 stars  While pretty messed up  the book is unforgettable  As much as I found myself twisting my nose up in disgust  I continually kept turning the page  What a beautifully written  hopelessly romantic  questionable yet definite classic tale of love  lust and passion   Nabokov s Lolita somehow manages to be both brilliant and disturbing simultaneously  This tale recounts the story of Humbert Humbert  a man obsessed with his young stepdaughter  The reader is taken nearly completely into the mind of Humbert  giving his actions a sense of insane logic and reason  While I was wary of this novel at first  I quickly found it to be something of a page turner and Nabokov s wordplay makes Lolita fun to pursue  I would recommend Lolita to anyone  but with the warning that it is not for the faint of heart   Writing was amazing  major plot twist at the end  must reread   While the subject matter was stupefyingly revolting  and the main character unabashedly evil  Nabokov s writing is a revelation  He somehow turn this amoral mess into a wonder filled book  That is the power of his pen  It deserves its place as one of the greatest novels ever written  I don t think this kind of classics requires any kind of rating  I give it a 5 star  when people read this book  it might instantly strike their mind that this book is all  EROTIC  but when we go into the deeper level of this book it is all  TRAGIC   The Protagonist of the Novel is the negative character who is highly obsessed with an adolescent girl  PEDOPHILE   later the girl realizes this and uses it to her advantage  and she is addressed as a  NYMPHET  to my surprise  its very sarcastic  I wonder if a girl of 12 can be considered as such  This book is perfect example of Psychology  Manipulation  Obsession and Freedom at a time  One of the Best Books and a must read   Beware reader   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   Humbert Humbert is on a mission  With velvety smooth prose that slips over and envelops you  he tries to distract you from the cold and calculating way he abuses Lo and invites you to see this as a love story  with poor Humbert Humbert its unwilling victim  Lo reminds him so much of his first love and sexual experience  Annabel  With her  nymphet  like qualities Lo draws poor Humbert to her like a moth to a flame  And so Humbert grooms us the readers Or so Humbert would like us to think  Sadly for Humbert  he isn t as smart as he thinks he is and he lets slips morsels regularly that reminds us that he is a cold and manipulative predator  and that Lo is only a little girl  We know that before Lo  Humbert sought out children and it was only fear of being caught that stopped him acting on his impulses  We see Humbert marry and groom Charlotte to be closer to Lo  We see Humbert groom Lo and we see him attempting to convince us that her normal childish actions indicate consent to his abuse of her  We see Humbert s blatant disregard of Lo time and time again       and her sobs in the night   every night  every night   the moment I feigned sleep   This is a complex and layered novel  I am guilty of having being prejudiced against this novel before reading it  through a misunderstanding of what this novel was about  There seems to be an misunderstanding in some aspects of popular culture that this is a novel endorsing paedophilia and the sexual abuse of children  I found the opposite to be true  This book clearly demonstrates the dynamics of sexual abuse  through the various methods Humbert uses to groom Lo  and even to the fact Lo s voice is silenced in the novel  We never hear her speak except through the distorted versions Humbert gives us  This isn t a book to be read quickly  it needs to be read slowly and carefully  with the reader remembering to not be drawn into Humbert s slippery prose  but to remain wary and never accept him on face value  It needs to be remembered this is not a love story  This is the story of a predator  Despite being irritatingly slow paced  this novel was simply spectacular  With its deep  and twisted   characters  capturing plotline   Nabokov s unbelievably beautiful style of writing  Lolita is easily among the best books I have ever read   This is the most awful  disturbing  depressive and yet addictive thing I ve ever read  I wonder how some people find this novel to be erotic I thought that this might be a 50 s version of Fifty shades of Grey but I was shocked and was in tears when I finished reading it Yes  she said  this world was one gag after another  You know  what s so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on your own  Behind the awful juvenile cliches  there was in her a garden and a twilight In the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac  unless this can be proven  and if it can  then life is a joke  I just want to wrap her in a furry blanket and protect her from all the evil in the world     sob  Lolita is one of my favourite books  Nabokov takes us on such a journey through the mind and words of a monster  yet we get seduced by him at the same time   Ban than cuon sach nay  cung giong nhu  tieu nu than  Lolita  la mot  nguoi tinh be nho  de khien

it gets meta and you re not sure if it s a literary device as to veil the monstrosities of Humbert Humbert  whether this is actually a complex and deranged character s way of speaking or if it is Nabokov s own tongue coming through This book is complex  dark  sad  and suspenseful but also unique experience and a masterpiece of fiction  The book starts of very colorful and descriptive  and for the the most part  stays that way  But there is this underlying and ever increasingly loud discontent and anxiety bubbling just beneath the surface and you re never sure what s going to happen as you re seeing the world through the eyes of an unreliable narrator and a deranged psychopath  All in all this was a unique experience for me and I d recommend it to any adventurous reader or anyone mature enough to deal with the serious issues presented in this novel   This year  I ve read Portrait of a Lady  Turn of the Screw and Lolita  esp Part 1  in a row  horror stories better said as tyranny   all of Nabokov s books are about tyranny  even Lolita  Perhaps Lolita most of all    Martin Amis  but maybe not  I have not reread Lolita since I went through the proofs in the spring of 1955 but I find it to be a delightful presence now that it quietly hangs about the house like a summer day one which one knows to be bright behind the haze  And when I thus think of Lolita  I seem always to pick out for special delectation such images as Mr Taxovich  or that class list of Ramsdale School  or Charlotte saying  waterproof   or Lolita in slow motion advancing towards Humbert s gifts  or the pictures decorating the stylized garret of Gaston Godin  or the Kasbeam barber  who cost me a month of work   or Lolita playing tennis  or the hospital at Elphinstone  or pale  pregnant  beloved  irretrievable Dolly Schiller dying in Gray Star  the capital town of the book   or the tinkling sounds of the valley town coming up the mountain trail  on which I caught the first female of Lycaeides Sublivens Nabokov   These are the nerves of the novel  These are the secret points  the subliminal coordinates by means of which the book is plotted    Nabokov  316 Just a litany of beauty here Other   Gutting  I stopped 200 pages in to rest   Part 2 is amazing    the last 100 pages  from the play and on   N s introduction to Lermontov s A Hero of Our Time is all about the chronology of information vs  its narration  Humbert uses this slip over and over to break our hearts   Best opening and best ending  all in one   Do not let other fellows touch you  Do not talk to strangers  I hope you will love your baby  I hope it will be a boy     And do not pity C  Q  One had to choose between him and H H   and one wanted H H  to exist at least a couple of months longer  so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations  I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita   No doubt  one of my favorite books  I think I must have read it about four times    Nabokov s prose hooks me every time  And every time I feel the same loathing and pity for Humbert  so well expressed in what I think is one of the best starts to a book  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  My soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue making a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the

Nabokov was playing with my head  I read he wrote the book and tossed it in the trash can  Later  his wife rescued it and sent it to the publisher  I would love to know what he really thought about the subject matter  Was he disgusted by Humbert s perverse obsession  Was there something of himself in this story  As a mother of a daughter  the images conjured by the two main characters  are highly unsettling  A book about a pedophile becoming a piece of world literature  specifically in the prude United States  There s hardly another topic which could be less PC than this  Lolita must be a truly extraordinary work of fiction to achieve this  And it is  It s not really about identification with Humbert Humbert but it s about understanding  Which is a lot  a most astounding feat  Even the victimized Lolita is more than just a victim  At the same time  she s a child   not an innocent one though     a femme fatale and an obnoxious brat  The facetted characters distinguish this book and elevate it to rare heights  The structure of the plot and the outstanding narrative voice are further strengths  Best of all  it s immensely readable  Most people don t understand what this book is about  Nabokov is fascinated with deviants  the insane  and psychopaths   cf  Pale Fire  Despair  etc  This book is not a love story in any way  but about how you can make even the most horrific acts sound beautiful  It s also insanely well plotted   This is a sublime and powerfully poetic book filled with pathos  beauty  reverence and sadness  We follow a weak and flawed character through his compulsions and obsessions as he descends through paranoia and delusions into madness  At first he tries to justify himself but gradually comes to admit that his actions are monstrous  Pedophilia is a sickness and a criminal act  This book is a work of art that never sinks to lewdness or pruriency  This book is incredible  Daring  lyrical  witty  and so insightful and realistic that it s shocking in places  The character of Humbert Humbert  if encountered in the real world  would be reviled and hated  But in the world of Lolita  you can only see him as a love struck oaf with a terrible affliction for little girls and a tendency to conveniently forget things  Nabokov is a genius  This is a writer s novel  more than a reader s  The intense value of this book is not so much in it s plot and adventure and compelling pacing  If you read it like you would a thriller or romance  you will be bored out of your skull  Pages pass with little action or forward motion  The voice is arrogant and blousy  And despite it s controversial reputation  there isn t a single dirty word or clearly described sex scene in the book  It s mostly a brilliant unbearably arrogant jagoff waxing about his obsession with a girl named   well she has many names  Here is what the hub bub is about  Here is why people  like me  lose their minds over this book The puzzle of it  The unreliable narrator  I read this one and a half times before I realized  that although the book is called Lolita and is about Lolita and Lolita is the main point of every page  I had NO idea who this girl was  None  Was she innocent or trashy  Was she a victim or a manipulator  Was she smart or stupid  I can t trust Humbert s opinion of her  he s a sociopath  So I had to re read  searching her out  between the lines  for the hints Nabokov scattered  It was a mystery to decode  What really happened here The words  Every one  placed with purpose  Every SYLLABLE  placed on purpose  Nabokov strings words together that haven t been strung together in that sequence ever before or after  and they re more beautiful than poetry  Think how hard it is to string together words in a fresh way and still make perfect sense  better than sense This book is music from the first lines  The alliteration  The word play  The tricks  The in jokes  For instance  Humbert s childhood love  the one he believes set him down the path of forever loving girls  is named Annabel Leigh   Annabelle Lee  is the title of Edgar Allen Poe s poem about love and death containing lines  She was a child  and I was a child  in our kingdom by the sea   Which precisely  poetically  beautifully mirrors Humbert and his Annabelle s relationship  PLUS Poe married a 13 year old himself  See  layer upon layer there  But it s not shouted at you  It s simply  playfully mentioned  and then Nabokov moves on  The book is so full of that  A lover of literature catches it and is delighted Oh there is more  But long reviews are dull  Enough for now  I love this book  I have read this book again and again  I have also listened to the audiobook with Jeremy Irons   love that  too   It is an icredible  heartbreaking story   True in a way that only fiction can be  and while some may think the writing can be a little overwrought or obscure  I find that it makes Lolita a book that constantly offers up a new treasue  and the old treasures keep their shine  too   There s nothing I can really say about this book that hasn t already been said  It s disturbing  intense  filled with suspense and mystery  contains excellent character development  assaults you with conflicting emotions from the first page to the last  and perhaps most importantly  asks you a question nobody wants to force themselves to answer   Could you identify  and even sympathize with  a complete monster  For many readers  H H  provides the answer himself  He starts off like the rest of us   young  in love with another little girl  and relatively normal  As he grows older  he delves deeper into his monstrous urges and allows them to consume him  This eventually results in his meeting  and subsequent  adoption   of the eponymous Dolores  Lolita  Haze  He captures her youthful essence wonderfully with his words  and her spirit with his actions  As they spiral downward in an incredibly awful and morally detestable romance  the readers find themselves liking H H  as a character while simultaneously being disgusted with what he does to Lolita and how he consumes her life This does not stand as a book for the weak hearted  in any capacity  Nor is it a novel with an unpredictable ending or premise  Having been told where the story will lead from the outset  the reader must brace themselves before diving into it  a pretty train wreck  this is not  The mutual  destructive ballet that H H  and Lolita dance throughout the story leaves no one unscathed   including the reader In its own way  this stands as its most incredible contribution to the world of literature  While the writing is superb on its own merits and the story willing to approach things a modern author wouldn t dream of going near  ultimately  Lolita  entrances because it isn t afraid to hurt anyone who reads it and make them question their own morals and ethics on a deep and potentially damaging level  If that s not a cruel gift to give one who buys your novel  there just isn t one that is  The first time I started reading this book  I stopped just after HH picks up his new stepdaughter from camp  It seemed as though the whole book was going to be about depravity for depravity s sake  the kind of story that tries to be as horrible as possible in order to shock and upset people  When I tried a second time  only the beauty of the language got me through the discomfort of the events  and the plot seemed contrived and unsatisfying  It took a third read through to be able to appreciate the little intricacies of the story and the writing and above all the characters that make this a really good book  Nabokov is a literary genius  Lolita is beautifully written   it reads like poetry   subtle metaphors  lurid description   it s absolutely astounding how he can take something so controversial  and seemingly one sided  yet completely cause you to question your own ideas on society and life  I found myself despising the character who should  by all social norms  be considered a victim  and sympathizing with the basest of criminals  That s Nabokov for ya    La gente deberia dejar de lado los prejuicios y disfrutar de una gran obra literaria como lo es Lolita  Es deslumbrante y maravillosa y onirica y de todo Resena completa  http   thebooksaremylife blogspot com    I doubt I have the words to do justice to this novel  It is perhaps the best written work that I have ever read  The language is utterly beautiful throughout  whilst never too challenging or pretentious Here  for example  a paragraph describing Humbert observing Lolita playing tennis  My Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot  pristine armpit  burnished arm and far back flung racket  as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip  It s almost effortless written  and was just a joy to read  An ode to the English language  more than anything While the writing itself is no doubt the star of this book  there is an engaging  depressing  believable story as well  Sure  the subject matter may make some uneasy  but there is nothing particularly graphic in content  Please don t let that deter you from reading this  It s a masterpiece of literature  Ce livre raconte l histoire d un homme dans la quarantaine qui tombe amoureux d une fillette de 12 ans  Ce roman m a amene a deux sentiments extreme  Autant je detestais les actes de Humbert Humbert  autant j ai trouve ce livre genial  Meme si c est l histoire d un pedophile  ce roman est a la hauteur des grands classiques par la facon dont il est ecrit  Si on change l age de la fillette et qu on change l epoque  on a l impression de lire un livre qui a ete ecrit par Balzac  Nabokov est un grand ecrivain et il est tres bien servi par l excellente traduction francaise  When I was in junior high I used to carry this book around  posing as a sophisticated  worldly sort  I never actually read it  Now I am  The prose style is brilliant  I am hooked  I can t say that I didn t read with glee of Humbert roasting on the pire of his own self indulgence  What a savory read  a challenge  I think it will require another read to pick up the subtleties I missed in this first go around   This book is one of my all time favorites  Admittedly  I m a fan of complex characters in fiction  and Humbert Humbert has often been my measuring stick for others  Yes  he s a despicable monster  but he s also charming  witty  someone you could see yourself liking despite his noxious flaws  Moreover  the language in this book is delightful  the kind of prose you could just wrap yourself in   When I read this book  I had a very different response than most respondents  I wondered where the sex was  I was reading this as a 16 year old   a virgin  a bit socially isolated  literate but not well read  And I found myself thinking how much less explicit this was than the Penthouse Forum faux love letters that I had read secretly in my bedroom  It s a small point  but it is to say that this book is less like the masturbation of a creep and more like the bedsheets into which he spread shattered innocence I did not read the story carefully  tracing back allusion to action  Nor did I appropriately investigate the annotations  The result was a reading experience that gave me some actual insight into adults  They are kids with lots of experience and misconception and cultivation  strains and realizations layered into the folds of their brains and of their skins To me  what makes this story work to this end is the odd way that the young Lolita herself is involved with Humbert  the tricky balance of cynical distance and understanding compliance she shows  Consenting adults frequently have similarly unbalanced and often far less healthy relationships  abuse  extreme dependence  lack of love   But since this one defies statutes and morals  it is reviled  The truth is that what is repugnant about the story is that it compellingly draws us towards the idea that love defies all boundaries including the law  safety  even mutuality I m sure if I were to read it again  I would be disgusted by the gratuitous sex  But I haven t read Penthouse Forum recently   Lolita is my wallowing in the recesses of another s mind  This book is a snake mind pit  It also broke my heart for the realization that knowing other people can be completely and totally foriegn  It is incredibly depressing to me how many people I ve known  all female  who took Humbert s word about anything Lolita felt  Nabokov s genius was also in the telling between the lines  Those beats in spaces  the silences  How could they miss that  How could anyone get so lost in the wallowing that they forget everything else  Lolita is one of the most unusual stories I ve ever read  Humbert  the main character  is hardly the sympathetic protagonist  but by the end of the story  I actually felt more positive about him  He was a con man  a pedophile  and a terrible snob  How could anyone feel sympathetic toward a pedophile whose dream girl is 12 years old  The prose is gorgeous    witty  playful  lyrical  really excpetional  The audio version is read by the incredible Jeremy Irons  with great finesse and feeling  If you missed this classic along the way  I highly recommend it  especially the audio version   A book about a prepubescent girl and a pedophile who ends up renting a room from her mother and thus living with said girl  why read this  because      Nabokov is the Master of words  of stylistics  of gutting out whatever lies deep in the seemingly intractable depths of feeling and thought  Every sentence is almost like a poem in and of itself  My first Nabokov s book  and first Russian lit I enjoyed his tone  how he described Lolita  how he described his hatred towards her mother  his memories and early lives in Europe  It was vivid  and at the same time left quite a lot to the imagination  especially his description on his travel with Lolita  I enjoyed the morally vague in the characters  Humberg  of course  and Lolita  So good I give up on any writerly activity  Good night The best way to read this annotated version is probably to know French  so that you can read the French dialogue that occasionally appears  then read the whole book  ignoring the annotations  then read the book again  reading the annotations when they appear  Otherwise  it spoils the book considerably  However  if you have no patience at all  then forget it and just read the book with the annotations  You will get a lot more out of the book in terms of references and connections to other parts of the narrative  but all the twists and surprises will be handed to you  Amazingly written  Some of the most beautiful language and descriptions I have read and that s saying a lot because the subject matter should actually be quite disturbing  yet the way it is written you have a hard time not sympathizing with Humbert although you know what he is doing is completely and utterly wrong  Read this in high school and must re  read  Beautiful  beautiful writing   America s most famous pedophile and nymphet are so much more interesting than I expected  For heaven s sake  Nabokow writes some of the most beautiful  funny  chilling English prose I ve ever read  after writing his first nine novels in Russian  The story kept me turning pages  though I did have to walk outside for some deep breaths of air  The use of language in this book is elegant  If for no other reason you should read it just to boost your internet depleted vocabulary  And then of course there is the image of a nymphet scampering around with an older man  For we who are on the back 9  this is good  It is good for the imagination  It feels kind of wrong  but I loved this book  It is very clever writing that makes the reader  almost  sympathize with  or at least find amusing  a creepy old pedophile  to feel that maybe the  nymphet  got what she deserved  I loved Humbert Humbert s wry turns of phrase  and Nabokov s sharp eye for detail  My absolute favorite book of all time  There aren t words to properly describe what this book means to me  Nabokov is a master of words  a genius at phrasing things just so  giving them such life and power that they hit you hard and stay with you  Three years have passed since I first picked it up  and I have yet to completely put it down  This is less of a review and more of a tale of overcoming adversity  I never read Lolita in high school or college  where most people read the bulk of classic novels and literature  so I went into this cold  This is not a light read  Now  I m not a complete dumb dumb but one should warm up for this kind of book  I often had to re read passages  sometimes entire pages  Sometimes I even had to put it down after re reading a passage a second time  it s just not in the cards if you have to re read a second time  It was a slow and painful process  but I did it  and it was good I was encouraged to not be too hard on myself with this tough read  as this was often a conversation starter on public transit  No book I ve ever read has caused anyone to come up to me  let alone comment on it s difficulty or ask how I m liking it  etc Excellent book  beautifully written  yet I think my next book with be something easy  funny and uplifting  So much love and so much pain  He schemes and weaves a world for his nymphet  While I despised Dr Humbert  I couldn t help myself from giving in to his sincere adoration for his dear Lo  This is truly one of the complex characters I have read and haven t been able to stop thinking about him since I put down the book   He broke my heart  You merely broke my life    Lolita  Vladimir Nabokov Might be the most amazing work of fiction ever  Plainly put  it s about a pedophile  yet somehow this is a pedophile you can relate to  dare I say even be sympathetic towards  This is what makes the book so disturbing and brilliant  not to mention Nabakov can write like a motherfu  er   2009 bookcrossing review Well  here s a bit of a controversial book  It s also the first book by a Russian writer that I ve read  that I can think of   I really enjoyed it and I would like to read more of Nabokov s work  What actually first set me on to wanting to read this book was the memoir  Reading Lolita in Tehran   She had such a passion for her books in that  and it actually added a few books to my wishlist so to speak All I really knew about this before I started was that it s about an adult man taking advantage of a young girl  Lolita is known to everyone  I suppose  although I wonder how many people have actually read the book  It is amazingly written  really  really well  and I got quite addicted to the story so I ended up spending a lot of yesterday just reading it The characters aren t exactly the most likeable in the world  The narrator  and dirty old man  Humbert Humbert  is a Swiss man living in the States  He goes to lodge in the Haze household  where widow Charlotte Haze lives with her twelve year old daughter  Dolores  Lolita for short   And he is immediately lusting after the daughter   the nymphet  as he refers to young developing girls who take his fancy  Women do nothing for him  only young girls   the guy is a proper pervet with mental problems  And he ends up in the position of having complete control over Lolita  The mother  Charlotte  falls for Humbert with his French accent  and she ends up marrying him  On the day that she finally discovers his perversion  she is killed in a car accident and unable to save her daughter  The crazy thing is  before this happens  she is very cool with her daughter   I can t imagine Lolita feels overly loved   and resentful of her  as if she is only there to interfere with her life  She is probably jealous of her youth and fearful of the fact that she is now leaving that period of her life well behind her So with mother dead  Humbert heads off to the summer camp to pick up Lolita  At first he tells her that her mother is seriously ill in hospital  He then plans what turn out to be bungled attempts at drugging her so that he can then rape her without her knowing as he drags her across the states from motel to motel  And one of the sad things is that when Lolita finds out that her mother is dead  she realises she has no where else to go other than to follow Humbert and do what he says  and that she feels that this is preferable to becoming a ward of the state Lolita isn t the most likeable character either  She is a stroppy little bratt  which I suppose all kids go through a phase of  plus it s probably a cry for attention due to her mother  She flirts with Humbert when he moves into their house  And when the sleeping pills he gives her turn out to be not very strong  it ends up being her that comes physically on to him and instigates sex  It does smack of young teenager showing off and pretending to be mature and worldly wise by telling Humbert about sex and how she has already done it  And how she later will do acts for him in return for pocket money    child prostitution  And whilst she isn t exactly likeable  you have got to feel sorry for her because she completely misses out on her childhood and that safe family environment that kids should have when growing up   Wow  You have to steel yourself for this one  but I had to steel myself to read The 19th Wife  too  Neither one are my thing  obviously  This one blew my mind  The writing  in his fifth language or something like that  is absolutely breath taking  It brought to mind so many other authors that I love  even funny ones like David Sedaris  that must have read this book and love his style  Fabulous gutwrenching story  Lolita is such an intense read  especially if you have watched the film beforehand  There are many parts that the film missed out but it is beautifully written and the scene at the end is brilliantly written as well as adapted to the exact text  I fell in love with Nabokov s style and would read it again   Welp I can t do this review thing right now  All I can say is it s a deliciously written novel about the palpable  maddening love fetish European gentleman  Humbert Humbert   snort  feels for American white trash Lo lee ta   light of my life  fire of my loins    And it s hysterically good  It should be called the book which Nobel prize miss not the other way round  I think that sums it up all  A very good psychological drama  Only the broadminded should read it  od svych dvanacti jsem Lolitu precetla asi petkrat od zacatku do konce  nespocitam  kolikrat jsem ji listovala a cetla si uryvky  a pokazde v ni videla neco jineho  cim jsem starsi  tim vic je mi lito Lolity a nad Humbertem se mi obraci zaludek  Nabokov napsal H  tak procitene  ze to cloveka strhne verit tomu  ze vlastne Lo svedla jeho  ze

favorita   Lolita e um romance do escritor russo Vladimir Nabokov e foi a primeira obra que li do autor O romance foi originalmente escrito em lingua inglesa e publicado em Paris  e sua historia e narrada por Humbert Humbert  um homem de meia idade que se torna obcecado por Dolores Haze  uma menina de 12 anos  a quem ele chama de Lolita Eu conheci a historia do livro atraves da adaptacao cinematografica protagonizada pelo maravilhoso Jeremy Irons  Acredito que e uma historia conhecida ate por aqueles que nunca leram o livro ou assistiram ao filme Atraves da obra  termos como ninfeta e Lolita passaram a representar a atracao que mocas bem jovens ou mesmo meninas despertam em homens mais velhos Embora eu tenha adorado a escrita  como o Vladimir consegue ambientar bem todas as cenas e mostrar bem essa obsessao do Humbert Humbert pela Lolita  alem de ter uma qualidade na descricao de momentos intimos sem precisar de ser extremamente descritivo e nem usar termos e expressoes vulgares  nao e uma historia que agrada Como mencionei e muito bem escrita  mas nao e bacana ler sobre um alguem se aproveitar da fragilidade de outra pessoa  quanto mais um homem de meia idade se aproveitar de uma menina de 12 anos  principalmente porque no texto  mesmo sendo contado pelo proprio Humbert Humbert  fica claro o quanto essa relacao nao estava fazendo bem a ambos e principalmente a Lolita Nao vou aqui levantar qualquer bandeira  mas o livro trata claramente do abuso infantil e para mim seria nojento ate se o adulto da historia fosse uma mulher e a crianca abusada um garoto Lembro mais uma vez que voces nao leram qualquer expressao  termo que seja violento  porque o autor consegue colocar tudo de modo mais romantizado  E para falar a verdade  isso parece deixar a situacao ainda pior  a ponto de parecer mesmo uma amostra do quanto era prazeroso para o Humbert Humbert ter a Lolita naquela situacao Uma coisa interessante  apesar de soar uma bela desculpa esfarrapada  e o Humbert Humbert falar sobre a criminalizacao das relacoes sexuais com menores de idade e citar casos nos quais manter relacoes sexuais com criancas e ou adolescentes e ou foi culturalmente aceito  De fato  o personagem faz um belo resgate historico e cultural sobre o tema  citando desde paises menos desenvolvidos ate os antigos costumes da realeza europeia Eu recomendo a leitura  porque apesar do tema polemico  o livro e um classico e o tratamento dado pelo autor tanto ao texto quanto ao tema e magnifico  Lolita   who doesn t think they know what this book is about  upon hearing the title  The name Lolita is forever linked to the sensational reputation of this great book  Perhaps an unlikely candidate for one of the great books of the 20th century  but it gets my vote  Every time I reread this  I seem to have a different reaction  this time I was struck most by the dark humor  but what always stays the same is my amazement at VN s way with words  It s hard to believe English is his adopted tongue  It s also hard to type  adopted tongue  in relation to this book without getting a little queasy  This story is so incredibly sad  It is a testament to Nabokov s great writing that I sometimes felt sorry for Humbert Humbert  I didn t mean to feel that way  he was raping his stepdaughter after all  However  he was so fundamentally wretched  so pathetic in his love for the poor girl  that at times I just couldn t help myself  And while for a lot of the time there is very little going on in this book  I didn t feel bored for a single moment  And although I was very slow at reading this  that was due to the fact that the writing is so beautiful  and you just can t rush over it  We had been everywhere  We had really seen nothing  And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely  trustful  dreamy  enormous country that by then  in retrospect  was no more to us than a collection of dog eared maps  ruined tour books  old tires  and her sobs in the night    every night  every night    the moment I feigned sleep  Amazing   Wonderful book  Nabokov does and excellent job in the creation and character work of Humbert Humbert and Lolita  I would recommend it to everyone   I was hesitant to give this book 5 stars because of the creepy subject matter  But Nabokov s choice of words and the effortless way he weaves them together was just glorious  He also was able to turn a disgusting  despicable character into someone I felt sorry for at the end  I listened to the audio version of the book which was read by Jeremy Irons  His voice and cadence was the perfect match for the poetic writing   I was going to give this novel four stars  until I read the essay by Nabokov at the end of the book When reading this book I wish i had known to read this essay first  I like to really understand and get something out of the book and in the essay Nabokov clearly states  Lolita has no moral in tow   Lolita still is meaningful  and for this i m going to give a metaphor  Think of a bodybuilder who only uses his muscles for atheistic value  he doesn t use his muscles  the way we think muscles are used he s only using them to show off them  as an art Nabokov is doing this same thing  he s using his writing capabilities as an art The reader may get moral value from this book but Nabokov did not mean for the book to have any moral value but to show off his art like a painter shows off his work of art at an art gallery  So read this book all the way through  including the essay  and enjoy Nabokov s work  This is one of my all time favorite books in the whole world  how   I ARX U  can a book about the WORST THING be such a joy flight  the guilt that lives in reading this book  language as rich  bright and delightful as the metaphyisical poets could make towards  and the constant relish in na bo kovs commentary of AMERICAN LIFE  Ha  unlike david harrowers  awards awards awards  play BLACKBIRD this isnt about true love trapped in wrong body  for as h h  admits in the final stages  they could never combine to speak of god or shakespeare  not in this evil  lolita is a big honest poem about america  and the tyranny of a  nymphet  child boldly manipulating a wretched  lost  imp of a man  tis hard to feel for DOLORES as VICTIM when she is twisting him inside out before our eyes  LEADING the vile man in to the sooo depraved eden  genius thing  and reminded me heaps of albert camus  alberrrrrr camooooooooooo  s The Outsider  im not sure what killing arabs on beaches and molesting 12 year old girls have in common  cant believe i just wrote that  but there is something in the two protagonists make up that speaks and wreaks of NATURE and what can we do  5 STARS MARGARET Estoy contentisima despues de Lolita  Estoy feliz de haber querido leer a Nabokov  ya teniendo expectativas altas  y poder decir que esta obra supero lo que yo esperaba de ella  con creces  Tengo muchisimas hojas dobladas en las puntas  justo donde hay frases o pasajes enteros en los que me deleite con la escritura de Vladimir hasta no poder mas  No hay con que darle  es un genio  un maestro  No por nada se dice que es el ruso que escribio  la gran novela americana   Me gustaron muchisimo ciertos momentos  como la magistral escena del primer contacto intimo de H H  con Lo  la cultura del motel  la paranoia intermitente del protagonista  el dolor irreversible de la ultima vez que ve a su ninfula  y el ultimo acto de Humbert en libertad  que no es otra cosa que la evidencia de que su amor por la nina es su unico movil  no tiene otra razon por la cual estar vivo  No solo disfrute la historia sino los detalles mas minimos  por ejemplo  la introduccion del personaje de Charlotte  ella fue pintada en mi mente con una claridad sorprendente  hasta su ultimo detalle  No voy a copiar todo porque transcribiria dos paginas  pero les muestro lo siguiente   Era a todas luces una de esas mujeres cuyas pulidas palabras pueden reflejar un club de libro  un club de bridge  o cualquier otro aburrido convencionalismo  pero nunca su alma  mujeres carentes por completo de imaginacion  mujeres absolutamente indiferentes  en el fondo  a la docena de temas posibles de conversacion en una sala de estar  pero muy exigente acerca de las normas de tal conversacion  unas normas que  como si estuvieran envueltas en transparente celofan  dejan percibir claramente nada agradables frustraciones   Me encanta  Es decir  me repugna  y la amo porque todo en ella me desagrada y eso es exactamente lo que Nabokov pretendia y lo plasmo de un modo magistral  Abrimos el libro para encontrarnos con un Humbert Humbert marcado por una obsesion particular por las ninfulas  La mente hombre es un libro abierto  literalmente   y su perversion es tan consistente  tan real  que te deja pensando si estas sorprendido o asqueado  Y es muy probable que estes ambas cosas  Porque asi de genio es Nabokov  no baja ni un segundo el ritmo  ni en su aventura furtiva con Annabel  ni en su matrimonio fallido  e increiblemente comico   ni en toda su historia con Lolita  Lolita  la nina malcriada y maltratada a la vez  Lola  Dolly  Lo  Lo Li Ta  Eterna como el amor frenetico que le tiene Humbert  Una historia de amor que impacta  enternece  sorprende y repugna  Una novela que no necesita acercarse a la vulgaridad de la pornografia o a la linea de la erotica best seller  y que cautiva el doble que estos dos juntos  Un libro de un ruso que plasma tal cual la cultura norteamericana de la epoca  Dos personajes entranables  Para mi no hace falta aclarar las 5 estrellas que merece No quisiera spoilearlos porque es preferible acercarse a esta historia sin haberse anticipado con nada  asi que abstenganse  a criterio propio  de las siguientes lineas  Ya mencione lo mucho que ame la prosa de Nabokov  Frias aranas de panico corrieron por mi espalda  Era huerfana  Una nina que carecia de familia  absolutamente desamparada  con la cual un adulto de cuerpo vigoroso y mente lasciva habia tenido intensas relaciones sexuales tres veces aquella misma manana  Tanto si la realizacion de aquel sueno de toda una vida habia superado mis esperanzas como si no  en cieto sentido habia ido mas alla de lo que me proponia  y me sentia arrastrado por una voragine  Me habia mostrado descuidado  estupido e innoble  Y permitaseme ser absolutamente franco  en algun lugar  cerca del fondo de aquel negro remolino al que me veia arrastrado  brotaba de nuevo la angustiosa punzada del deseo  tan monstruoso era mi apetito por aquella miserable ninfula    It s not about whether you like a character  Obviously  the main character took advantage of a girl and had little to no empathy towards her  but that s the point  Nonetheless  it s Nabokov s mastery of telling taboo events that we rather not hear about  Or do we  Being grossed out has little or nothing to do with the quality of good narrative  We have plenty of examples  In my opinion  you can love it or hate it  but it s worth much more than one star   The writing in this novel is so glorious that it can almost make the difficulty of the subject matter take a back seat  There is  contrary to belief  very little abject eroticism in the narrative  but Nabokov s mastery of the language  not his first language even   is so profound that he can make any given passage drip with anticipation  lust  madness  longing  humor  sadness and yes  love I chose to view HH as the ultimate unreliable narrator  and this choice allowed me to read the confession as a complete fantasy  rather than the diary of the crime This is truly a masterwork of fiction  and after reading the afterword  where Nabokov claims his best work by far is in his native tongue  it almost makes me want to learn russian   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul    From the very first sentence  I fell in love with this book  If Humbert Humbert s witty good humours are not enough to make you forget your moral conscience  the beautiful sentences certainly will  You will end up pitying  even loving Humbert Humbert  in this  beautiful  humorous  poetic  and almost romantic  book about a poor pedophile and his beloved Lolita If you cannot get over the hurdle of the pedophilia theme  just shut your brain and enjoy this as a beautifully written masterpiece  It s worth it  Nabokov has written the most delicious  seductive prose I have ever read  I can effectively measure my life  well  at least my reading life  in two sections   before and after I read Lolita   My friend Matt sent me his copy from New York  He had taped the spine of his red hardcover edition to obscure the title and then used a Sharpie to darken the tape  He did this  he said  on account of prurient eyes and puritanical looks from others on the subway I stripped the tape away and began reading  Stunning  Personal  A nice motel tour of America  I can t believe someone can write like this as a late onset second language learner When I was nearing the end of the novel  I was sitting on an airplane leaving Phoenix  Held high  the book screened most of my face  but my eyes peeked over to notice a young  female Latin student of mine cruising down the center aisle  She gave a half wave  glimpsed the exposed truth on the spine  and walked to her seat  Students would call this  awkward   Lolita   Que decir de Lolita  Las palabras sobran ante una obra tan devastadoramente hermosa  tan perversamente bella  tan desesperadamente amorosa  En simples palabras  si existe una mejor novela que la escrita por Vladimir Nabokov  yo no la he leido  Este es el pinaculo de la literatura de la segunda mitad del siglo XX  Un libro perfecto   Teresa Teresa   seras tu tao louca e pervertida quanto Humbert Humbert Pois que nao julgas nem condenas um amor assim  aos doze  aos vinte  aos    Lolita  luz da minha vida  fogo da minha virilidade  Meu pecado  minha alma  Lo li ta  a ponta da lingua faz uma viagem de tres passos pelo ceu da boca abaixo e  no terceiro  bate nos dentes  Lo Li Ta   Terminei Lolita ha dois dias e tenho a cabeca em polvorosa com tanta riqueza de linguagem e de ideias  E ja escrevi dezenas de coisas e nada se aproveita  excepto Nabokov e genial Lolita e um livro unico  One of the most beautifully written works I have ever read  This is the dark story of Humbert Humbert and his obsession with the young  Lolita   Humbert  from an early age  exhibits unusual proclivities  namely the sexual  hungering desire for very young girls     nymphets   They re not necessarily very pretty or bright  but to HH  they exude an aura of come hither disingenuity that he finds impossible to turn away from  Dolores Haze  Lolita  is such a girl and through a series of accidents  finds herself in the inescapable grasp of this desperate older man  Nabokov  you did it again  I read a series of your delectable short stories a few months ago and thus I turned to Lolita in eager anticipation  I am not disappointed  Despite its extremely disturbing plotline  Nabokov draws you in with the seductiveness of his language  Each sentence is so rich  it s like biting into a particularly succulent apple   you know the kind  I went back and read certain sentences over and over  simply for the sheer visceral pleasure they gave me And because his writing was so forceful   it made the outre plotline that much more vivid and disturbing  Reading into HH s almost painful honesty made me squirm but also hunger for more   to delve into the mind of such a man who was capable of such atrocities   Lo Li Ta Repaso una y otra vez esos miseros recuerdos y me pregunto si fue entonces  en el respaldo de aquel dia  cuando empezo a hendirse mi vida   Ah  Lolita  si tu me hubieras dado una oportunidad para conocerte y amarte Por favor lector  a pesar de tu exasperacion contra el torpe autor de esta resena  infinitamente circunspecto   no omitas lo esencial  Imaginate disfrutando la obra de Nabokov tanto como yo Disfrut   I picked up Lolita expecting a wild adventure born from a provocative idea as the title would suggest  I ve read bunch of reviews peeling the surface after surface of the novel in which there s discussion of morality and romance and such  My review would pale in comparison as to such review  but this as many things I ll have to impart with  Started the book  found it to be rather an easy read  compared to many of the classics i have traversed through the years  Nabokov did confess the biggest tragedy in writing this novel is that English is not his main language at the end of the copy of my book  So yes an easy read  witty in most of the parts  obsessive in which way he expresses his love towards the cheeky  irritating  prodigious at presenting distasteful conversation  The first part in which she is falling in love with Humbert is so innocent and I find it as a highly preposterous idea for Humbert to be earnestly trying to make it a reality for himself to make this child as a lover  But by the second part which Humbert successfully possessed the child  I ve found that I m on his side now  since this child suddenly had turned into such a hateful character  despite my understanding that she is in actual a plaything for him  and she probably had lost the interest in this older man and probably just want to tear this cage away and live normally  Humbert guy  i pity him  such extent he will go to just to caress lolita all over again everyday  to nod at all her commands  again i m aware she is under his oppressive lust and jealosy   and i do feel for dolores too such a child  to be spending her youth in such a manner  despite having quite an understanding of the world  irritatingly irritable indeed  this situation is  and after going into wild hunt  great search for his dear lolita  in the end he found out she is pregnant and living a life in which he is not right by her side  oh dear lolita why in the world would u seed such tragedy  humbert in the end is such a sad man to me  i dont think ill be able to enjoy a novel quite like this ever again  Humbert is truly a tragic cast in this beautiful novel  a murderer for all lolita s sake  a killer in knowing lolita s been taken from him in such a way by a man which lolita actually love  but that man abandoned lolita after all that   such an end this novel has  and he ll do just about anything for lolita to be all of him  oh such tragedy  Nabokov s masterpiece doesn t need my praise  but I would urge everyone I know to read it  I don t know how I ve missed reading it before this  I would also add that the author s afterword is also the best example of such that I ve ever read  This is one of the most delicious books I ve read  Luckily for me  I didn t have any expectations except the usual ones  regarding the plot   but what is really genius is its literariness  There is poetry and humor on every single page  and in itself  the novel is poetic  Humbert Humbert is not so much a  character  but a self aware and literary character in the literal sense  a writer unraveling through language  and  borrowed  literature   I can understand why he has been compared to Proust and Joyce  at least in the review quotes on my 1960 s copy   He lingers on the subtlest of actions  perceptions or thoughts with detailed description and embellishment  He constantly plays with words  names and significance  reminding me a bit of Lewis Carroll  And it s very  very funny    in a cynical way  This review refers to the unabridged audio edition  read by Jeremy Irons Somehow I made it into my 40s without ever reading this classic  I had heard that the Jeremy Irons narration was one of the best narrations out there  of any novel  so I decided to give the story a shot in this format I was blown away on every front I don t even know how to describe the writing  It s unobtrusively clever  It s sarcastic and smart  It s lyrical and poetic  but not cutesy or gimmicky   It s above my head many times  too  I neither speak French nor understand the references to literature and societal norms of the 40s and 50s   It s beautiful     and it s describing this horrific individual and the terrible actions he undertakes and the lives he ruins The aching desire which the narrator feels for his Lolita begins as something which is easy to identify with  Everyone has wanted something they cannot have  and while the obsession is beyond what most of us have dealt with  anyone who has yearned for something out of reach will identify with some aspect of it  at first  But then it gets worse  and worse  and still worse  And we re taken on this descent into hell  and the whole time the prose  the imagery  the writing is delighting us  It s an experience The expert narration of Jeremy Irons takes it to a new level  He brings life to Humbert  keeps him fully believable  He injects just the right sarcastic edge to the humor  the right tones of desperate desire  of shame  of anger  of every emotion the story drags us through  This is a classic of the 20th century  and one of the most expertly crafted novels I ve read  and having it read to me in this way was an unexpected treat It s not easy to read  It s uncomfortable  especially as the father of a daughter  But it s that good  If I could give six stars to this masterpiece  I would do it  Best book I ve ever read  And I m being dead serious  It took me ages to finish this book because I couldn t just leave Humbert  I know it s sick  but damn    That fucking perv stole my heart  my life  everything  I was almost in tears reading the last chapters of this shit and well  I just can t  Read it fellas   Read it  Finally  Don t ask  why now Been dying to review  Full review coming this Sunday  I ve never read a book like this before  After being repulsed by the first couple of chapters I didn t think that I would be able to carry on  Once I distanced myself from the content I was able to appreciate the language and Nabakov s writing style  Reading some of the reviews on here has made me marvel that some people have been drawn in by Humbert s supposed love for Lolita  This book really does show how powerful and persuasive writing can be  Wow what a book   I had a couple issues with this book  aside from the obvious feeling of disgust at the pedophilia and self pity of the main character  as the reader is SUPPOSED to feel that way   The book had little to no paragraph breaks throughout the entire thing  some of the wording was confusing  and google translate always had to be kept on hand for whatever of the French  as well as a bit of German and Latin  I could not translate on my own  These  however  were not too big of issues and overall the book is very good  with the ending likely being my favorite part  as it usually is for books I rate 5 stars   Everyone told me I would love this book  and they were right And  as always  kids  REMEMBER THAT LOLITA IS NOT A LOVE STORY LIKE SOME PEOPLE THINK  IT IS ABOUT PEDOPHILES TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A CHILD  THAT S NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL  I REPEAT  NOT A LOVE STORY  PEOPLE NEED TO STOP CONSIDERING IT A LOVE STORY  THAT S GROSS  I ve heard about this book my entire life  but meanwhile I ve read a couple other Nabokov novels and found him incomprehensible  This novel was very comprehensible and gave me some insight into the mind of a pedophile  also how one can start with small crimes and go on to larger ones  And listening to Jeremy Irons reading the book  I think I got much more out of it than I would have if I d read the print version  This is a novel which should be approached and dealt with very  very carefully indeed  What Nabokov has done here remains as liable to detonate and rip the world apart now as it did when it was first published nearly 50 years ago In particular because child sexual abuse is more in the headlines that it ever has been  Lolita is a novel that is likely to divide popular opinion  In much the same way as Imre Kertesz  Fateless does  it forces the reader to face the dilemma of what you do when something so repugnant is depicted so skilfully  With such sensitivity to the protagonists in the writing  you can t help but sympathise with them while at the same time having to constantly wrestle back to the forefront of your mind the reality of what is laid before you Lolita is a well known story of a man s affair with a 12 year old girl and the escapades they go to in order to maintain the secrecy of their relationship  It is astonishingly well written  Nabokov is one of the best writers of prose I think I ve ever read  Of that there is no doubt  and I am very much looking forward to reading more of his novels  But it s the fact that it s so well written that brings about the dilemma that I ve mentioned and the novel is pure genius for this construction The novel is also genius for the fact that it is just as  if not more  relevant for us today as it was on publication  Back when this was written  it wasn t only paedophilia that was taboo  Homosexuality was also very much something people would hide from the authorities  Today  one of these has now become perfectly acceptable to popular culture in the United States  the setting of Nabokov s novel  while he other is still regarded as a criminal offence One might argue that homosexuality and paedophilia differ in that the former occurs  at least in society s accepted form  between consenting adults whereas the latter does not  But Nabokov also challenges this assumption  How reliable a narrator Humbert Humbert really is we will never know  But  according to him  it is he that is seduced by Lolita  not the other way around  Does this then justify it  At what age are we able to make choices about what we do with our bodies  Homosexuality in the UK used to be a criminal offence and was then legalised for consenting adults over 21    then 18    and now 16 years of age  How did this reduction happen  Have we evolved to become more mature sexually at a younger age or is this simply based on society s view of what is acceptable or not  How can sex at 15 years 11 months of age be a crime when  a month later  it is a right So  will 2065 see a US society that accepts a 42 year old marrying a 12 year old  Maybe it will  And if you find this repugnant  what do you think will prevent it  Why will your grandchildren not find your current  prudish  and  bigoted  views about paedophilia derisory and so  oh  Old Testament  When society makes its moral rules simply through democratic opinion  all you need is a majority for it to be acceptable  When Lolita was published  it was unthinkable to many that a 16 year old boy could ever legally have sex with another and yet we live in such a time  What is unthinkable to us now will almost certainly be permissible in the future  History has taught us that and the novel as an art form has been its voice This has not only made my Hall of Fame  the first since Growth of the Soil over two years ago   but it has equalled the highest ever rating that I ve ever given a book tying with Cry  the Beloved Country at 95   That is quite an achievement  but definitely a deserved one  I just finished my 3rd  reading  of this classic  but this time I listened to Jeremy Irons  narrated audiobook  It was easily the best audiobook I ever listened to  His sonorous English voice conveyed the ruined aristocrat  perfect for all the funny  snarky comments Humbert makes  He brought a lot of weight to the end of the book  and the tragedy and the wistfulness were point on  If you can get past the  ick  factor of looking at the world  and of course the title character  through Humbert s eyes  I highly recommend this version  I am unaware of any work of fiction that has ever been written in such clever  beautiful  eloquent prose as Lolita  Nabokov was a master of language  absolutely unparalleled At the time I write this review  I have just finished reading listening to Lolita for the third time  I notice new clever word play each time I read it Aside from the linguistic elegance of the novel  it s also brilliant and insidious in its ability to make the reader feel sympathy for a monstrous  murderous hebephile  This  as other reviewers have suggested  is Nabokov s game  He uses the power of language to manipulate his reader s emotions in ways that will clearly disturb them  and should disturb them   Do not let the stigma surrounding this novel fool you  This is not erotica  It is not child pornography  Most of the sexual contact is implied through the clever use of language and rarely does it venture toward the realm of being  explicit   I have both read Lolita and listened to the audiobook version  Jeremy Irons is a fantastic narrator  But I m a bit puzzled by the notion of Humbert Humbert having a British accent instead of a French accent  although Irons speaks impeccable French   HH lived in Britain for a time but he was raised in France  was he not  Or perhaps I misread  This is a small point but  given the linguistic excellence of Nabokov s work  I hate for anything to interfere with its authenticity  Never the less  the audiobook version is excellent and I absolutely recommend it if you prefer to listen rather than to read  One advantage to reading this novel over listening to it  however  is that French is used intermittently and it s helpful to be able to look up what the French means using your favorite online translator  Beautifully crafted  incredible prose  and a manipulative unreliable narrator make this book a rightful classic  I couldn t stop reading  Lolita I read Lolita for a summer course  and I am glad the situation forced me to read this wonderful book Lolita  by Nabokov  is a delightful and humour read  It is  in essence  a parody of a love story  With intelligent and witty writing  it is very hard to put down  I suggest the use of The Annotated Lolita  as Lolita is filled with dozen upon dozens of allusions to everything from 1940 s comic strips to butterflies  The Annotated Lolita is editted by Alfred Appel  Jr   who does a wonderful job at writing an introduction and an extensive notes section  which I kept a finger stuck in throughout my read of Lolita  To be short  I would call Lolita a Must Read   My second favorite book of all time ever  This novel held me in its warm  intimate grip the whole way through  I laughed and cried and felt as if the book and I had begun its own personal affair  The story at its root is about the foibles of a man who has never matured past his youth and the social consequences of his attempt to regain what to him seems a stolen past  This is ultimately Humbert Humbert s story  Lolita is just the runway Everyone should read this novel   Lolita no es un libro convencional  Es un libro espesamente  adulto  y que necesita cierto sosiego para leerlo  Nabokov construye cada centimetro delicadamente y cada pagina se disfruta  con esa combinacion de  amor   obsesion y  a veces  con ciertos toques de humor  por no hablar de el despampanante detallismo  Para mi  Nabokov sigue siendo el mejor escritor que he tenido el placer de leer  junto a una historia fresca y que se aleja de lo convencional  Muy recomendable   Lo  Lee  Ta DAMNNNNN I have three things to say about this book 1  God  I wish I could write like that2  It has thoroughly raped my mind  and I despise that I like it so much3  It was a wonderful  witty  twisted  lovely  sordid  detestable  haunting  enchanting book  and  though I thought some parts rather tedious  I still adored it all the way through  This book is as exquisitely written as it is disturbing   There is no reason why this time would need another review  its beautiful  flawless and daring  There seldom are authors who write in the point of view of the antagonist and Vladimir Nabakov might most arguably be the best of them  Its only a pity that he was denied the Nobel he so vehemently denied  Such elegantly crafted is the novel that you ride with story  You see with your mind the rise of desire  the agony  the road to redemption  the salvation  the fall  the rise and the final conviction  There seldom comes a story half so visual as this  hardly so perfect as this  Just beautiful is what I feel the story is  When Nabokov wrote Lolita  he didn t sit down and pound the thing out in one go  The story was written in vignettes  out of order  On the backs of napkins  leather bound books  a parade of typewriters  He assembled them later  As opposed to a relentless march forward through time like most books  Lolita is a clumsy dancer s waltz   it steps forward  then back  then back twice  then forward three times  before ending in one final tumble into the orchestra s percussion section  The velvet curtain drops  You are left to wonder what became of the dancer   In noi lo spirito e la carne si erano fusi con una perfezione che deve risultare incomprensibile ai rozzi  prosaici giovanotti di oggi  coi loro cervelli fatti in serie  Molto dopo la morte di Annabel sentivo i suoi pensieri scorrere tra le mie mani  Molto prima di incontrarci avevamo fatto gli stessi sogni  Oh  Lolita  mi avessi amato tu cosi  Come puo un libro che tratta un argomento cosi poco piacevole essere di piacevolissima lettura   sobrio  elegante  mai volgare  la penna di Nabokov merita tutto il successo che ha e non ci sono moralismi che tengano  Took me years to understand it better  and even with an annual re reading  don t think I understand it completely  Delicious like a rich  airy dessert  the tongue relishes with abandon but far too complex for the mind to comprehend  Then again  like dessert  i don t have to understand it to GET it  After this book  am now obsessed with the way Nabokov obsesses  if not his obsessions  Bagian satu oh so beautiful  Begitulah seharusnya ketika kamu mencintai seseorang Saya pikir saya akan membenci Humbert karena perlakuannya terhadap Lolita  tapi informasi yg ia sampaikan mengenai sifat Lolita membuat saya memutuskan untuk berdiri di sisi Humbert Well  mungkin memang seperti ini seharusnya pledoi  Mengajak orang untuk mendukung tindakannya Agak  turun  di bagian dua khususnya di setengah terakhir kisah perjalanan mereka  entahlah  agak datar  Tapi Lolita tetap layak dapat lima bintang  Keren  Nabokov is a literary genius  especially given that English is not his first language  Definitely is one of the all time greatest novels   Obviously  the subject matter is sensitive  I don t condone pedophilia at all  However  the story is unique and beautifully written  I was surprised at how much I liked the book itself  I was preparing to be incredibly disgusted during the whole thing  While some parts are very creepy especially for a woman to picture herself in the Lolita s place  I would still say that if you enjoy a unique story with lush imagery go for it   This book is amazing mostly because when it was written  For a book to be written in the 1950s that s so evil is pretty amazing  I have to admit  the book could get boring  I can only read how beautiful a nymphet is so many times  However  the idea of getting inside the mind of a monster was a pretty scary and interesting concept  Parts of this book are hard to read because of the subject matter  but that s what makes it a good book  That and the writing is great   My first review haiku The annotationsReveal a deeper beauty Mystery abounds  By which I mean I read the book in college and thought it was very good  a bit convoluted  but not great  Then I read the annotated version and found out almost every page was full of anagrams  references to other great books  poems  plays or relating Nabokov s study of butterflies  If you liked  Lolita  but weren t hip to all this stuff  as I wasn t  pick this up and give it another go  If you haven t read  Lolita  pick this up but maybe read it once through without all the annotations  it gets to be kind of a lot flipping back and forth  back and forth  and knowing the flow of the story and the characters helps as you descend into all the hidden treasures Nabokov put in is masterpiece   I ve learned about  the unreliable narrator  for years  and heard the term applied to so many books  I have a good grasp of what it is  but I d never read anything that I honestly thought  this narrator isn t reliable   This book demonstrates a brilliant use of the unreliable narrator device  You know at a certain point that Humbert is not trustworthy and that he s simultaneously leaving information out to make himself look better  while leaving hints in because of his own self loathing  He wants to betray himself  but he also  as a human being  wants to preserve himself as  a good guy  I ve always had strong opinions about pedophilia  but this book made me question and reexamine them  It s definitely worth the time it takes to read it  It s fascinating I highly recommend getting the audio version  It makes it feel almost more real to have someone speaking to you  telling you the story  This is an enchanting book  it is so magically written  Nabokov weaves words like a spell  There are so many reviews on this book  there is not much that I can add But add this book to your  read before I die  list  It is certainly up their with my favorites  Esse nao foi um livro facil de ler e nao foi um livro facil de avaliar  Mas posso dizer que agora entendo o motivo de Lolita ser considerado um dos romances mais importantes do seculo XX  Tudo que eu sabia sobre esse livro era muito pouco perto do que ele realmente foi pra mim   A obsessao de um homem de 40 e poucos anos por uma ninfeta de 12  e so o pontape inicial pra uma historia muito mais profunda  bem escrita e com personagens intensos  Humbert Humbert e um protagonista que me enganou  me conquistou  me fez sentir odio e sentir pena  No geral  esse e um livro sobre crueldade  obsessao e queda  Apesar de eu ter amado  nao e o tipo de livro que eu recomendo pra todo mundo  E preciso ter o minimo de interesse pelo tema  colocar em mente que H H  e um  narrador nao confiavel   e mesmo assim ele pode te enganar as vezes  e mergulhar de cabeca na historia Esse e o tipo de livro que te sacode  te tira da sua zona de conforto e desperta sua curiosidade  Um livro que nao acaba quando termina A edicao que li  publicada pela Alfaguara  conta com dois posfacios  um deles escrito pelo proprio Nabokov  e ainda assim nao foi o bastante  Lolita e um livro que te deixa com vontade de saber mais sobre o contexto em que ele foi publicado  sobre o impacto que ele teve na epoca e sobre as marcas que ele deixou pra literatura contemporanea  Foi um livro que acrescentou muito na minha vida como leitor   I had a hard time with  Lolita  at the beginning but there are reasons behind it 1   I did not started off neutral and unbiased  For me there is always a strong negative feeling associated with paedophile  This book was really a challenge in sense that I had to keep those feelings low to keep on reading2   Being critically acclaimed and all  I took the book a tad too serious  I should have started off with a frame of mind along the line of  It was a work of fiction  for godness sake 3   I didn t quite actually get the European and American cultural references  Those were giving me hard times And I was about to chuck the book out of my window when things fortunately  started to pick up  And this was during the second half of the book  The ending I thought  was the best  There were not only the sweetness of revenge but also an offering of a lady with three boobies and stuttering painful cries in fake Bristish accent after multiple shot wounds  I thought THOSE were WICKED  And oops  I probably had given this book a fiver based on that ending alone  For the next reread  it would be done in a less uptight and more leisurely manner  We ll see then if I d feel any different On another note  Humbert reminded me of certain male person in my life that happens to have unacceptable  affinity  towards young girls  I m not saying that he is similar to Humbert but at least I for now I think have some understanding of people with paedophilic tendencies Humbert is a dirty old man but nevertheless  he loves Lo and would go to death for her  How many claims of true love would be willing to go that far  Lolita is  indeed  Nabokov s best ever written book so far  who knows if  The Origin of Laura  may exceed this   And it s the book I based my undergrad thesis on  So yeah  Humbert and his sense of beauty  poor  poor Dolores and her indifference  and nasty ol  Quilty beau There s no roller coaster of words more beautiful than  Lolita   Thank God Nabokov decided to find refugee in English  My opinion on this novel drastically evolved as I read it  Initially  I was fairly underwhelmed by the plot  which felt overshadowed and overpowered by the relentlessly disturbing nature of H H Gradually  I felt increasingly compelled by the story being told  which became more powerful and quite emotionally moving as the novel progressed  The second half of the book  and the last several chapters  in particular  was beautiful  Of course  H H  never becomes any less of a monster  despite his many attempts to appeal to the reader in melodramatic flickers of contradictory self awareness  That said  it s interesting to read readers  various interpretations of the apparent  evolution  of the central characters  As many have said  Nabokov s style is impeccable  It s a beautifully written book  I would urge anyone who has second thoughts about reading the novel after being appalled by H H  during an initial glance to read it all the way through  Where to start  Easy to see why it s part of The Canon  Complex and utterly  utterly human  Disturbing and engrossing  Crackling prose laced with a surprising amount of humor  Felt like I was only getting 15  of the clues and jokes that Nabokov sprinkled in the text for  the astute reader   Sometimes a bit too highfalutin  but it fits the narrator  Probably will re read this one   Beautiful  I m astounded by Nabokov s ability to write and translate his own work so gorgeously   This book has a great hook  Scholarly foreigner Humbert Humbert hooks up with middle aged Mom with an eye on young Dolores  Lo  Lolita       The book is amazing in that you actually feel a tinge of compassion towards despicable Humbert  I think that is why Lolita gets rated so hight  Either that or we are all pedophiles  First of all  though the author made a rigorous attempt to make readers sympathise with  Humbert  it never worked  To this day I still wonder how the author was able to engage in such a book  creating the protagonist s persona on pedophilia  as well as stupidity  But  the author did succeed in creating amazing literature  so I ll give him that   First of all  you can t talk about  Lolita  unless you ve actually read the novel  As all actual readers discover  you will find no moments of intercourse explicitly described  if you re looking for titiliation  look elsewhere   There are certainly scenes of criminal behavior  abuse  and the mania of obsessive pediophilia  however   Secondly  the novel is a linguist s delight    some of the best wordplay and puns I ve ever read  I keep meaning to read more of his work  but haven t yet  Thirdly  this annotated version is a must in order to get all of the allusions  Jesus  It s a sad book  I read this book the first time in my late teens and was absolutely horrified  Since then I have reread the story several times and every time I am astonished anew  also this time I listened to the unabridged audiobook version narrated by Jeremy Irons who did a marvelous job at reading this story French academic and literary scholar Humbert Humbert comes to America to renew his life after his divorce in France and a prolonged stay in a psychiatric hospital  Soon he meets Dolores Haze the 11 year old daughter of his new landlady and widow Mrs  Haze  Dolores his LOLITA   LO LEE TA  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  So what is it what makes a book about a pedophile so fascinating  In an almost perfect way  Nabokov describes the pedophile Humbert Humbert  without judgment  without representing the sex offender as a bad person  and alone for this reason the story is so impressive  Here  it is the style which is so clearly manipulative and ironic  The plot is predictable  and Nabokov succeeds again and again to outline detailed possible actions and then allow them to collapse into themselves  We feel the love of Humbert towards his Lolita   without him never acknowledging the GIRL Dolores   and we quickly recognize the depths such illness brings with it  One is constantly torn between disgust and comprehension  between pity and hatred On top of that Humbert is a smart storyteller  who often tries to manipulate the reader with incredible questionable arguments  trying to justify his acts and desires  The further the story moves along  the more he loses the outlook on reality and becomes more and more victim to paranoia  We do not just see Humbert s obsessive and insatiable lust for the young Lolita  but we also see what life with him does to her  how she cries at night  how she learns to manipulate him to achieve her own ends  how she grows to hate him more and more  She considered me as if grasping all at once the incredible    and somehow tedious  confusing and unnecessary    fact that the distant  elegant  slender  forty year old valetudinarian in velvet coat sitting beside her had known and adored every pore and follicle of her pubescent body  In her washed out gray eyes  strangely spectacled  our poor romance was for a moment reflected  pondered upon  and dismissed like a dull party  like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come  like a humdrum exercise  like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood  We are shown a story of decadence and decline  the beautiful ugliness of corruption presented with a narrator who manages to persuade us to sympathize with him from time to time  even so that he is a ruthless and despicable villain  Nabokov s use of language and translation of a difficult topic into literature   well  absolutely amazing   Kolkoto i da ia preprochitam  nikoga niama da razbera kak i zashcho dumite rukhvat pred svoia smis l  No sega imam neshcho kato opit za definitsiia  Lolita e prosto polus n  v koito pris s tva edinstveno uset t na rukhnalite pred svoia smis l dumi Seriously one of the best books I ve ever read  and I continue to count this among my top five favorites  Let us first accept the fact that we may all feel very uncompfortable with pedefilia and move past that  This is a beautifuly written  incredable creative  artful novel that should be on everyone s list   I can t believe how much I love the writing in this book  Although it is horrific when things like this happen in real life  for some reason  Humbert Humbert as the unreliable narrator turns this story into an interactive guessing game  Is what he is telling us the way it is actually happening  No  probably not  His version is romantic  which is not the reality of the situation  But  I truly enjoy Nabokov s style of writing  and this book is part of the reason  the master  Lolita  This book almost ruined me by the end as Nabokov pulls you into the thoughts and realms of a pervert you begin to not only understand how his psychotic thinking has evolved from missing love in his lift but shockingly and willing sympathise with  I want to focus more on how Nabokov mastered the story and less about his writing style although fluid and beautifully descriptive  This story could break the strings of any human being for anyone who has loved and lost  As a reader you can not help but find Humbert a non violent  passionate  kind and loving person where unfortunate past events have set a foundation on these qualities being directed so fatally upon a wrong aged beauty  I liked Nabokov s thorough complexity in the dynamics  You think Humbert the pervert  the 37 year old man  the brawn would be brutal and power strong  when in actual fact Nabokov juxtapositions them with Lolita being the powerful  strong child and Humbert the fragile  aching grown man  My sympathy was not for Lolita but for Humbert and I never thought an author could be so good as to make you sympathise with a paedophile  that is how brilliant this book is   Lolita e semplicemente Lolita  E pura adorazione  Ho mangiato questo libro  ma non nel senso che l ho divorato con foga o con appetito letterario  L ho proprio assaporato  ho sentito nello stomaco tutto quanto  La scrittura poi  Vabbe  ho perso la testa  ve l ho detto  Sono in adorazione   Gosh  when did I first pick this up  Sometime back in high school  but I don t recall the exact year  What does stay with me are so many of the lines    far too many are lush and lovely to capture here  but it s meant that it s one of the few books I ve re read  breaking it out for a full view and also to gaze over just a few pages at a time  To call it poetic would be an understatement  An ode to the English language is right    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lolita in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  A perverse love story within one of the greatest novels of the 20th century  It is hard to imagine another writer creating such a masterful book centered around an incestuous relationship  An amazing piece of writing that should be read by anyone who enjoys literature  Nabokov is able to play with words in dazzling ways and challenge one s thinking at the same time  An artistic exploration with humor and sensuousness  love and perversity Recently reread  3rd time  and would like to kiss the dirt Nabokov s feet walked on  Interestingly  the hard to find not Kubrick film adaptation s striking rendition of the second half of the book readied me to appreciate the  other  story in Lolita  in particular how necessary the downfall of their relationship is to present a complete portrait of love a relationship  what s beneath them  Ouf  J ai termine Lolita de Vladimir Nabokov  Mon onomatopee n est pas necessairement la plus joyeuse qui soit  vous vous direz surement que je n ai nullement apprecie ce bouquin  mais bien au contraire  puisqu on dit souvent que les apparences sont trompeuses  Mes petits commentaires a propos de cette autobiographie fictive n auront certainement pas d impact  cependant j ai envie d y mettre mon avis  ma sauce  mon opinion  Ce livre est d un vocabulaire fortement enrichie compare a mon elocution juvenile  du moins  je ne peux pas lui enlever le merite d etre extremement bien ecrit  soit dit en passant  Il me permet de me poser quelques minutes  a quasiment toutes les phrases pour reflechir a ce qu il vient de raconter Au debut  tout est complique  nous sommes perdus et en plus  nous insultons le cher Humbert  Cependant  au fil de l histoire  il devient terriblement romantique  attachant et troublant  tu ne le detestes pas a la base mais il peut paraitre repugnant  sauf qu apres etre bien entre dans le livre  les mots coulent comme de l eau  Ces poemes  malgre qu ils soient traduits  sont des arts pour les papiles  Tu sens sa douleur  son desesperoir et son incomprehension Malgre tout  la fin nous laisse sur notre appetit  quoiqu un peu logique  puisqu etre mechant n est nullement dans sa nature Bref tout ca pour dire que ce livre fait reellement parti des cent livres a lire avant sa mort  Il merite d etre au moins feuilleter P S    Merci World of Warcraft de vous inspirer de tout ce qui existe dans ce monde  ainsi j ai pu livre ce chef d oeuvre litteraire  merci  You get so far into the narrators head  you can see where he s coming from and it s insane   It s one thing to hear someone is a genius and another thing entirely to hold in one s hand the evidence  I don t use the term lightly  but good heavens   anything else would be an insult  And English isn t even his first language  I read Lolita in a constant state of astonishment  due  in part  to the evil of the protagonist  but also at the beauty of its conveyance  I saw Lolita more vividly than any movie  more vividly than  I think  I see the world around me  During the second half of the book  I was also petrified with a sense of rage and wished dearly that HH would get his comeuppance   it didn t happen  Arrested  yes  but not nearly good enough  And Lolita    I wish I could give her a hug and let her  finally  have a voice  I wish I could have stopped the car  grabbed her hand  and saved her  Heartbreaking  Enraging  Horrific  And overwhelmingly gorgeous  I don t care what anybody says  this book is probably one of my favorites  Aside from the very    different topic  the language of the book is very cute  Nabokov always makes me laugh when I pick up this novel and read silly lines that Humbert Humbert says such as  Humbert the Hound  or quirky little lines here and there  not to mention the occasional bouts of French keep the reader  well I know me  quite interested   Among the works by Nabokov that I have read I think I still prefer The Gift and Speak  Memory  but there is no denying Lo s perfection  The prose is liquid lightning  One thing I don t get is why so many people make the remark that this book is interesting because it  forces you to sympathize with a pedophile   At no point did I feel anything akin to sympathy for Humbert  I was just constantly amazed by Nabokov s composition of his spectacle  H H  s endlessly amusing arrogance  wit  and depravity  A perfect rendering of a demented human psyche  Also  a completely hilarious and subversive send up of 20th century middling American petite bourgeoisie  A dark comedy taken to the highest regions of artistic success  The most beautiful language I have ever read  Yes  you get it  I worship Nabokov and his masterpiece with my whole heart  If you are fond of  russian soul  writing style but also love Fitzerald s eternal American Dream Gone Wrong theme I can only recommend you  Lolita   it s a wonderful mixture between the western and the eastern literature that upon finishing reading it  leaves somewhat bitter sweet taste behind  This was another re read So  I first read this book the summer I was 15  And it strikes me how much like a nymphet I possibly was     I remember reading it while sunbathing in my parents  backyard  as knock kneed and awkward as Lolita herself  When I plunged into this again  I thought   Wow  I m really going to get so much more out of this now that I m older    I must have missed SOOOO much reading this so young  Truth  Pretty much got it all the first time  So     yay me  I guess In short  this book is absolutely stunning  Nabokov s prose is amazing  Witty  charming  playful  Just wonderful  However  I did find it somewhat odd that the Time review printed on the back of my copy said the book was  Wildly funny   I mean  Witty  Yes  Playful  Yes  Clever  Yes  Wildly funny  Um     I don t think so  Funny just seems     too base  to out of place for this work  I don t know  call me old fashioned  What s interesting to me  is that the same two sentences got me both times     reading them  it was like I was lazing about in my parents  backyard again  Sorta spooky  Here are the two bits I carried with me  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   p  9 At the hotel we had separate rooms  but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine  and we made it up very gently  You see  she had absolutely nowhere else to go   p  142  The first  of course  because it is absolutely flawless  How someone who s native tongue is Russian can write such beautiful alliteration     wow  Tip of the hat to you  author The second because it is one of the few moments the narrator really shows us how vulnerable Lolita Dolores really was  this is right after she discovers her mother is dead  don cha know   And I think that is such a heartbreaking moment in the book  In the midst of the word play  the  Days  Hays  Daze  Haze  of it all  you see how helpless this little girl was  and how   if in a similar situation   we might be equally as vulnerable   The story is great  But I warn thee   the wording is very confusing  Russian literature is always a bit confusing but you get the general idea even if you don t understand every sentence  or even paragraph  so don t worry  If it is so difficult to understand  read the summary on sparknotes  But the book is definitely worth reading and praising  This book is so well written  Vladimir Nabokov is a prose wizard  His wordplay  descriptions  and writing style are just so expertly crafted  He also commits so well to the memoir style of recounting events  as told by Humbert Humbert  Humbert s voice is so strong at times I forgot I was reading a novel and not this man s actual memoirs  Nabokov succeeds brilliantly in inhabiting Humbert s mind  and has crafted a compelling unreliable narrator  I m a big fan of the unreliable narrator pulled off with aplomb as it is here   I ve always been fascinated by reading from the POV of sociopaths and the like  Instead of the sociopath point of view that s almost become commonplace in psychological thrillers  Nabokov explores the mind of a pedophile and sexual predator  The results are disturbing but fascinating Lolita is about Humbert Humbert  a European man living in 1940s America  who has a strong predilection for pubescent girls or  nymphets  as he calls them  He meets the nymphet Dolores Haze  who is to become his Lolita  and a life consuming obsession is born I found Lolita to be compulsively readable  It s brimming with dark humor and brilliant use of of the English language  the play on words and the quotable passages abound  Nabokov also keeps so many great extended metaphors running throughout the novel  Humbert is a monster  but he is also a multi dimensional character  and I think the novel is all the more fascinating  and must have been all the more challenging and difficult to pull off with finesse  which Nabokov definitely managed  in being from his perspective  The more I think about it  the more sad this story really is  Nabokov possesses the skill of being able to switch from being humorous to very sad in an instant  He illustrates the humanity of the characters brilliantly  and Humbert even displays character growth and definitely indulges in some serious self reflection by the novel s end  This book is great  Lolita is certainly a masterpiece of prose  and I can see why it is a classic  This is one of the few books from college that I remember and continue to love  1991 is the first year I read this  but I continue to read it again and again and every time I am moved and intrigued  I was lucky enough to have read this while a student of Dr  Appel  and  if I had taken his class as a freshman or a sophomore rather than as a senior  I would have been a lit major rather than a political science major  Of course the writing is incredible  All of the adjectives you ve heard apply  elegant  insightful  sad  funny  witty  beautiful  musical    it s all true Here are two points that I haven t read  although I don t doubt that someone has made them First  this is a story of an impossible love  Many  if not most  of the great love stories from Eloise and Abelard through Anna Karenina to the Scarlet Letter involve this element of impossibility    the romantic conflict between MUST and CANNOT  The only true paradises  as Proust said  are paradises lost  Or  I would add  those that can never be attained  And even sadder than that  if we care to enter Humbert s heart for a moment  is the fact that the nymphet he loves    ANY nymphet he loves    will have grown  within a couple of years  into a young woman and no longer attractive to him  And isn t this a reflection of our own condition  the human condition  Love is overwhelming but it is only here for a few years  Much as we  like Humbert  want to stop time  it won t  The audiobook of this novel is so incredibly amazing that I can t really describe it  It s Anthony Hopkins  speaking in the most beautiful  fluid language  about a pedophile that you actually have fleeting moments of    compassion  for   But the words  the words   OH MY GOSH  the writing is so amazing  I feel super weird putting this as one of my favorite books  but seriously  I can t wait to read more Nabokov   It s so odd how beautifully written this book is when it makes you cringe so often  The book really gives insight into the character and honestly the style really reflects the his emotions and insanity as Humbert Humbert tries to delve into his own subconscious  A greatly set up ending  if you can stand the material in this book  do give it a go  This was my first very big book that I had read since I hated reading before this book  Now I knew the hype or the hysteria that has always surrounded this story and the name Lolita  and I always presumed the the main character Humbert was a disgusting man looking at an innocent child like that  but I saw the beginning of the 1997 version of the film and I enjoyed the beginning and I am still to yet the 1962 version by the amazing Stanley Kubrick but I have a feeling that it will be better  Now the beginning line of Lolita is the most amazing and breath taking sentences in any book  when I first started it it took me awhile before I began again because of the impact that had on me  and straight away I knew that I would love this novel and I was right  I don t feel that Humbert character is at a disgusting man but I think he is a damaged man and the story when he tells the reader about his childhood sweetheart I think her name was Annabelle and her death and their moments they had together and how after that he was affected by it shows his state and I felt sorry for the this character that the death of this girl he loved has such an impact that he modelled any girl since off of her and I think this is why he became obsessed in a loving way with Lolita  I find their relationship strange and the beginning I feel that they both had feelings for each other and that is clear without a doubt and maybe Lolita was playing on those  but I feel that their story was one of love and I feel they both loved each other no matter the age difference  though I still think it was wrong that he feel in love and had intimate relations with a 12 year old and older I still love their relationship and his character a lot  I find their story the greatest love story I ve ever read and I feel they are both as guilty as each other  Lolita definitely seduced Humbert and he went along with it I feel she wanted an intimate relationship with him as much as he did with her so I think on that front of  rape  that it is un true  But the beauty of this novel is the way it is written and how damn convincing Humbert is and how he persuades you throughout so my view might be they he wanted it but yeah oh well  I felt the childhood was not just destroyed by him but herself as well she could of left many times but choose not to  The ending line is beautiful and left the same effect on as did the first line  but in the last line I cried because you clearly see he devotion and undying love to his Lolita who has lost and won t ever claim back and that is heartbreaking  I loved this novel and without it is my favourite novel ever and nothing can compare to this and they it made me feel towards these people  I love it    I should be clear  this book isn t for everyone  In fact no book is for everyone  My favorite book will bore you and your favorite book will bore me  We  and our favorite books  are different  But that isn t necessarily the case with Lolita  Lolita is different because not everyone will feel comfortable with the theme  And that is perfectly fine  The theme is one of a 40 year old man falling in love and taking advantage of a 13 year old girl  Not everyone will want to read about that  And in most situations I wouldn t want to read about it  But Nabokov writes about it perfectly  There is no lewdness in his writing  It isn t pornographic  He doesn t justify or try to rationalize his character s actions  nor does he attempt to glorify or sensationalize them  Instead he portrays they thoughts  the musings  the despair  the grief and the immense amount of emotion Humbert Humbert feels for Lolita  That is the true theme of the book  Humbert s emotion and his inability to control or do anything about it  He knows his actions are bad  He knows what he is doing is destroying his love  He knows and understands  but he is helpless to stop himself  The prose is beautiful  long winding sentences that lead to lofty heights or dungeons of despair  The characters are never good  Nor are they purely bad  They are real  they are as real as the emotion that is felt throughout the reading of this book  It is this emotion that overcomes the discomfort and the aversion of its topic I should say that this book is in no way obscene  Nabokov is very careful of this  There are no four letter words  There are no graphic details  There isn t even any innuendos  And at the same time the reader is able to follow exactly what Humbert is doing with Lolita and is also able to understand what Lolita is doing to Humbert  The fact that Nabokov was able to do this without being sensational or obscene is remarkable and makes this book worth reading  It is a far cry better than any romance novel or modern day love story and if you can handle uncomfortable plot I would highly recommend reading it  If not  that is fine  Everyone doesn t have to read the same books  During the first chapters of the book  I couldn t decide if I loved H H for his wit or despised him for his disturbing narcissism  among other traits   by the end if the book I deduced that I could never be fond of such a loathsome character outside the narrow limits of pity without hating myself  However  the ending was so heart wrenching  I couldn t help but empathize  Wow  This was my first experience with Nabokov  and it s one I won t soon forget  I ve never seen such a display of prosaic wit and allusion  return  return It s a shame that he  like Burgess  is mostly known as a guy who wrote a controversial book that got made into a Kubrick film  There s so  so much more there  fldmyr ykhdhk fy hdh lqSh l  wSf qS  Hb shdhh byn  jwz wTflh lknh mf mh blkthyr mn lmsh r bd  lktb fy lsrd wlwSf

so   that I actually found myself hiding the title in public  The title alone conjures up the most foul of images within the general public I shocked myself halfway though when I began sympathizing with H H   an obvious pedophile  There were instances when I hoped he succeeded in escaping with Dolores Hayes  that she would love him and they would end up living a happy life together  Only the greatest of lyricists could create such emotions in the reader  The language was beautiful  calm  alluring  Not once does the author resort to crass  distasteful word choices to explain the romps that ensue  A few subtle lines invoke the reader s imagination to complete the sequence of events  And yet  even after completing the book  and enjoying it thoroughly  I honestly believe I would still hide the title  A sad admission for the general perception of literature by American society  deserving of the praise  wildly funny and completely fucked up  i felt very sick reading large portions of this  the best use of an unreliable narrator i ve ever read  really really goddamn good Don t look at me weird  but this book is one of the greatest  unrequited  love stories ever written  Shows you how to feel for a child molester  Beyond wonderfully written  it s to delight in every sentence  I really think as a prose work  it s amazing  I wish I could read it again and again from the first time  because it was such a good experience  This book is famous for a damn good reason  beyond its subject matter  Outstanding  Also enjoyed the book on tape read by Jeremy Irons  and the movies  the old one and the new one   Beautifully written  superb story telling  Lolita is one of those books you simply cannot resist  The story of a man and his obsession for this prepubescent girl is that of love  despair  lies  and confrontation  but overall  it is the perfect analogy of what happens when a man gives into his deepest desires without restrain or morality  4 5 stars Pedophilia is a topic I try to not get involved in  It s very confusing and grey for me  Whilst we do hear stories of those horrible  completely immoral people who use children for the sexual fantasies  I imagine there are also a rather large group of people who struggle with pedophilic thoughts but restrain  These people can t control their longings or urges  but should be fully accountable for the actions they take  I don t know if it should be considered a sexuality or a mental illness  Anyway  at first Lolita was not a book that I would naturally want to subject myself to  However  I came across the first chapter of it and just had to read it From the very first line I was absolutely taken by Nabokov s prose style  He uses the most exotic of words  but never does it feel verbose or over the top even though I needed a dictionary every second page  The most memorable moments in the story are not in the actual events  but in how they were written  His word play is incredible  beautiful and empowering  especially so when they cross languages  English was not even Nabokov s first language  yet he is able to use it better than most  if not all  of the English writers I ve come across Humbert Humbert  the main character  falls under the  monster  pedophile explained above  You have absolutely no sympathy for this man who marries Lolita s mother so that he can be with her daughter  And he justifies everything to himself  and to Lolita  to make their forbidden relationship seem alright   as if society is the monster  not himself  When I mentioned this on a reddit thread I got a response from someone saying they did not read it at all as Humbert justifying himself  but that every word he says is a blatant lie  I love how both of these things are equally as feasible Lolita is going to be one of those books that I am able to read over and over and over again  Not only because of its incredible prose  but of the so many ways it can be read  I hear a lot of people commenting on how ridiculously funny the book is  but to me it is heartbreakingly sad  I wonder if I will be able to see the humour in it on re read And now here I just want to put type out the first chapter  just because it is the most marvelous chapter I ve ever read  Read this slowly and out loud  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  a certain initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns   My most treasured book  This book is one of the more controversial I ve read  Not because it says profound things  or is too offensive  but rather touches on such a taboo subject  It s based on a man  Humbert Humbert  who falls madly in love with the girl  Lolita  who s only about 12  The book is revolved around on Humbert trying to justify his love for the girl  and everything is just so fascinating  There is some french in the book  so you may need a translator  but it s well worth a read if you find this taboo as interesting as I do  Part of the appeal of this book is Lolita comes on to Humbert on occasion  rather than the traditional way  It s like exploring the mind of someone who is in love with young children  and his justification for it  At first  you may feel like  Oh he s just some creep who wants us to think it s alright   But  by the end of the book you really start to sympathize with him  which is so strange due to the taboo nature  If you think that love between an Adult and Minor and hate it with all your passion  and won t dare to hear a word otherwise  skip this book  If you are fascinated with this taboo  READ IT RIGHT NOW  If you re neutral  give it a read sometime  The results may be surprising  This is one of my favorite classics  It s intense and adult  so I m definitely glad I read it a little later in life  so I could handle the subject matter  Nabokov paints such tragically sad and irredeemable characters that it s hard not to keep reading just to see how they finally end up  Beautiful but like watching a train wreck at the same time   I absolutey adore this book  One of the most beautifully written texts  I am particularly in love with the casual cruelty of Humbert  and the way in which his love  both eros and mania  is conveyed  The representation of women in Lolita is from the point of view of the unreliable narrator  Humbert  reveals the underlying psychological issues of Humbert  which he aims to solve through his obsession with Dolores  The language and character development is simply magical  Forget the theme if you will and ignore the scenes if you must but remember how he wrote in the first person  How he captured a sliver of how all our minds work and speak to themselves  While I was rummaging through a heap of books in a secondhand bookshop in Maradana  I came across Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita  a book that I was longing for reading for a long time  I had watched the movie Lolita  both the black and white version and the color one and that had increased my curiosity to read the novel Nabokov s narrative style of writing cannot be compared with any other writer s I have read  It is so interestingly detailed  One has to respect Nabokov for covering such a controversial theme in 1950s with his real name  One cannot have that courage even today  Narrating a sexual relationship between a middle aged man and his 12 year old stepdaughter is unimaginable in any rate be it literary or otherwise  But Nabokov shows a great discipline in writing the story without including a single vulgar word Of the two movies made of the story  I kind of prefer the first movie  the black and white Lolita directed by Stanley Kubrick at a time censorship was too rigid  Sue Lyon does the justice to Lolita while Peter Sellers is remarkable as Clare Quilty  Shelly Winters plays Charlotte Haze in a dramatic way too  I am not that happy about James Mason who plays Humbert Humbert  He is too old for the character In Adrian Lyne s color Lolita  Dominique Swain is excellent as Lolita and so is Jeromy Irons as Humbert Humbert  Both Frank Langella  Clare Quilty  and Melanie Griffith  Charlotte Haze  are equally hopeless I have seen a Sinhala translation of Lolita somewhere but never got a chance to read it  I m curious as to how the translator has coped up with Nabokov s narrative style in Sinhala  El mes interessant de Lolita no es la historia  que tambe  sino la manera com esta escrit  Hi ha escriptors  i Nabokov n es un exemple  que mes que escriure t enduen a un mon i t hi fan estar  No escriuen per entretenir  escriuen per mostrar una visio del mon  una manera de ser hi  I per aco no els oblides   NOTE  Spoilers ahead  Read ahead with caution What I find in Russian author Vladimir Nabokov s 1955 novel Lolita is not  despite what a modern reader might infer  a moral novel  It does not condemn hebephilia nor does it condone the practice  Instead  I see an author utilizing his signature tools to great effect  These include literary trickery  flowery language and the use of suggestion  It is this which sets his writing apart from others in the 20th Century  and it is no surprise that Lolita is his most controversial and well known of his novels  At once  it is a confession and a road trip novel  structured along the lines of a tragedy to mask the events which unfold Born in 1899  Vladimir Nabokov was raised in a prosperous family in St  Petersburg  until the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution  Nabokov was forced into exile on several occasions in his life  In fact  this led to him being labelled as an emigre novelist  often involving characters exiled and trying to habituate to new surroundings  The protagonists of his Russian novels  such as Mary  The Gift  Glory  Despair  are outsiders to their respective societies  Nabokov himself went to Trinity College  England  before moving to Germany where he wrote his Russian novels  Again  he was forced to move in 1938 because of the rising Nazi Party and their anti Semitic Nuremburg Laws  his wife  Vera  was Jewish   He only stayed in Paris for about two years  until the Nazi occupation of France  in which he moved to America in 1941  This change of scene also meant a change of language  Starting from The Real Life of Sebastian Knight and Bend Sinister  Nabokov would write his novels in English from now on  Lolita was born out of a short story from 1939  The Enchanter  but instead of the pseudo charm of Humbert Humbert in the finished project  this predator is creepy  often compared to a spider  In this short story  he fails to seduce the young girl and kills himself  Lolita  to an extent  can been analysed to represent Nabokov s loss of Russia  and the narrator s attempt to regain lost love through any means possible  After losing his first love when he was 14  before he got the chance to consummate their relationship  Humbert becomes constantly stuck in the past  literally  he is only sexually attracted to young girls  whom he dubs  nymphets   These  nymphets  are between the ages of 9 14  often painted as sexually promiscuous and mystical  The majority of readers  as I sometimes did  will feel uncomfortable reading his descriptions of Dolores  legs and body  even divulging into laws about consent and trying to justify his obsessions  Try reading that on a busy London Underground train The themes of Lolita are common in previous Nabokov s novels  Humbert s aspiring adultery on Charlotte Haze  Dolores  mother  mirrors King  Queen  Knave and Laughter In The Dark  Yet  Lolita is also about cruelty  and the ways one justifies their cruelty for a common good  Although he indulges in Dolores  she is the one who speaks the least  Nabokov merely hints at her emotions  mainly because of Humbert s unreliable narration  This trick is pulled off in such a way  through his first person perspective to his rather romantic and delusional language  that at times I question the events of the novel  I am constantly left in the dark over Humbert s true intentions  and the events that happen outside of his perspective  Given Nabokov s notorious secrecy  and love of riddles and games  how can one truly understand Lolita other than the author The language of the novel  as with Nabokov s other novels  is simply beautiful  in stark contrast to the rather distressing subject matter  Take the famous opening lines  for example  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  an initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns  We are led to believe  right away  that his mission is a romantic one  Take the rather hyperbolic language  the combination of  sin    fire    soul   or what about the clever wordplay  The insistence of counting on a  murderer for a fancy prose style   How can one not be seduced by this language  The flowery  pretentious language masks the horror of Dolores  abuses and softens the blow of her rape  The fact that this is technically meta fiction  the novel s format being a confession for court  contributes to a sense of realism despite the fantastical claims that Humbert was in love with Dolores Lolita was first published by French publishing company Olympia Press in 1955  It would not be until 1958 where both America and England would agree to publish Lolita  given its incredibly controversial subject matter  Even today  some readers tend to attribute Humbert s thoughts and actions with that of Nabokov s  insisting that the novel reflects the novelist  However  this is fairly reactionary  as Nabokov seemingly toys with Humbert  setting him up for several falls  Nabokov  however  is not a moral writer  As mentioned before  he does not condemn Humbert s desires but does not condone them either  His sitting on the fence makes his viewpoint more dangerous to a reader  It s easier to side with a partisan than an all rounder  Alas  Lolita s legacy should not be the thoughts of a  dirty old man   but a game of deception of what is and is not real  It is a chess game that Nabokov will always win  as he went to his grave not fully explaining Lolita  Perhaps it never was meant to be  Words cannot express how beautifully written this novel is  I truly understand why Lolita is a classic  The brilliant yet utterly disturbing novel about a frowned upon romance between an adult man and a measly 12 year old girl  It took me quite a bit of time to read it because I was completed fascinated by their romance but was conflicted through the entire thing because I know it was wrong  Wooh  Books is just stepping into another universe  world  perspective  person s place  etc  They are one of the greatest things man has to offer and here is an astonishing example   Lolita  luce della mia vita  fuoco dei miei lombi  Mio peccato  anima mia  Lo lita  la punta della lingua compie un percorso di tre passi sul palato per battere  al terzo  contro i denti  Lo  Li  Ta  Era Lo  semplicemente Lo al mattino  ritta nel suo metro e quarantasette con un calzino solo  Era Lola in pantaloni  Era Dolly a scuola  Era Dolores sulla linea tratteggiata dei documenti  Ma tra le mie braccia era sempre Lolita  Questo basta  Forget everything you ve ever heard about this book  because it s likely to be wrong  Because of the misinformation floating around about this book  I had avoided reading it for years  wondering why anybody would want to read about a twelve year old prostitute  an alluring nymphet  who seduces an older man  This is one of the things I d been led to understand the book is about  but I wonder if the people who said that have actually read the book Another thing I take exception to is the blurb on the back of the copy I read  the 50th anniversary edition  which claims this book is about  love   If that s the case  the person who wrote the back cover copy has a strange idea about what love is  And Nabokov  in his author s note at the end of the book  says no such thing  So  my advice is to skip the book jacket  forget what anybody else says  including me  and go read the book  It will disturb you and maybe even disrupt your sleep  as it did mine  but it is an important story by a master storyteller and you owe it to all the Lolitas in the world to try and understand what they  we  have gone through So  given all these strong negative statements  why did I read the book  And why  oh why  did I give it 5 stars  The first question is easier to answer  I read it because it is assigned reading for a class on novel writing that I m taking next month  Since I knew that this book has been called  by some  the best novel of all time  I can see why it would be given as an assignment I give the book 5 stars not because it s the best novel of all time  or even the best I ve ever read  The writing in the book is amazing and Nabakov has an incredible command of the English language  not his native tongue  but his skill with English puts most native speakers of it to shame  He s funny  entertaining  evocative  and the story is  at times  gripping  On the other hand  the story also drags in places  especially the middle section  and the ending is rather weak  almost like a cartoon episode or a bad movie or something  So  no  I don t think this is the best novel of all time  but it is a very good book Now  to the story  which is most definitely not about a young girl who seduces an older man  The main character  Humbert Humbert  is an older man who is smitten by a young girl  Delores  who he calls Lolita   but he is delusional  which should be obvious to even the most casual reader  He thinks Delores seduces him  but in fact she later says that he raped her  which of course he did  He also thinks Delores Lolita has a special supernatural quality  along with certain other young girls  that allows them to cast some sort of seduction spell over men  The guy is delusional and Nabokov goes to great pains to show us just how out of touch with reality he is  Humbert also believes he loves Lolita  despite the fact he kidnaps her  rapes her repeatedly  holds her captive  and forces her to perform sexual favors in order to have the most ordinary things of childhood  like clothing  time with friends  etc  And  yes  he pays her  in pennies and dimes   for these favors  but this does not a prostitute make  Lolita is a sex slave  pure and simple  like so many other tragic young people in our world  Despite telling her story through the eyes of her captor  Nabakov shows us just how broken her life becomes as a result of this horrendous abuse  It is a disturbing story  certainly without a happy ending or even very many happy moments  but it is an amazing book by an extraordinary writer  I will be interested to find out how this book is discussed in my upcoming novel writing workshop  and I m glad that somebody finally forced me to read it  I wish  now  I had read it years ago  Knowing this was a  scandalous  banned book in many places  and that some have even taken the time out of their day to burn it  I decided to see what all of the fuss was about It wasn t nearly as scandalous as I was led to believe  yes  it does cover pedophilia and yes  it did make me wonder how the author was so good at sounding so familiar with the mind workings of a pedophile  Lolita herself was what I didn t expect  And boy was her mom  special   It was well written  how else could it also be considered a classic   and Lolita  herself not the writing  was so disappointing to me as a woman  It was a fascinating read  Great book  very well written  Funny story  I happened to be looking for jobs as a children s English teacher when I read this book  and was holding it in my hands as I was being interviewed for the job I eventually took  Thank God I didn t run into anyone with more than a glancing familiarity with the concept of reading for pleasure  or that might have been trouble for me  Painfully beautiful  even more so with how twisted and distorted it is  But as you read all you can mutter to yourself is how purely gorgeous the writing is  Nabokov talent lies in his description skills  he could be writing about the most overly ripe  ugly banana  and make it sound like Picasso himself gave the bruises to the fruit  Simply mind blowing  In my top 5 favorite books of all time  The language is so precise  the imagery exquisite  and Nabokov works in his own personal interests  think butterflies  into the text  It s not what you think  popular culture has ruined this novel s reputation  which is part of why it is a  must read   The annotated version is the only way to go  unless you speak as many languages as Nabokov did      A stunning book by the most magnificent writer of the English language And we must remember that this author s native tongue is Russian  Impossible is this Vladimir Nabkov  A story about Humbert Humbert  a vile and self absorbed man who preys on the innocence of a pre pubescent girl  Dolores Haze  Lolita   to satisfy his own retarded emotions and sexual fantasies  And yet  I m stunned to reveal that I found this man  Humbert Humbert  to be sympathetic  and God forgive me  I also found his telling us  the reader  of his feelings and memories of her to be so sensual and erotic  Only a genius writer could accomplish that  Now  if you will all excuse me  I m going to go say a few Our Fathers and one or two Hail Marys   I find this book fascinating because it is written from the point of view of villain  As he tries to beg for our understanding to why he felt and did those things to Lolita the reader can find his or her self sympathizing with him  I caught myself many times feeling sorry for him and mad at the girl  When I realize it  I felt horrified and guilty for it  It is so well written and I think that it should be in everyone s to read shelf   It takes boldness just to pick up Lolita  but once you re in    This pinnacle of literary style and form are wasted on anyone more interested simply in the plot   You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style    11  The neologisms   puppybodies    the pace that shifts from over educated French cliches to quick  organized spurts of consciousness and full bodied scenic imagery  the playfully poetic juxtapositions   mislaid her virginity    carry the reader along as well as any novel can  Even without these pranks of genius  and even if you could remove the nymphetic voyeurism  babies  bathwater    Lolita s narrative is still driving  more so in the first part   with full  developing characters  A question    Artistically minded readers may search for some grand scheme of meaning  some message that isn t quite obvious  Is it just a story  or did Nabokov unconsciously allegorize his love affair with the English language  as he says at page 32   Oh  my Lolita  I have only words to play with     Nabokov  light of my life  fire of my brains  My sin  my soul  Na bo kov  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Na  Bo  Kov  I ve never read a book quite like this Every word so carefully chosen  So many cross references and puns  A mystery wrapped in a perverted riddle  The first half is one of the best 150 pages I ve ever read  It s sad only in that it reminds me how stupid and inelegant I am in comparison  I read this while on the beach in the Carribean at my friend s destination wedding  Boy did I get a lot of stares  I m pretty sure that made me enjoy it all the more  There is something sort of thrilling about laying on a beach surrounded by people telling them how you are reading a book about a 12 year old having sex with a 35 year old and then watching their faces    On a serious note  the language and writing style Nabokov uses was really seductive  He brought you in and made you  if not sympathize  at least understand HH s obsession with his step daughter  I had a visceral reaction to numerous portions of this book and that is a rare thing  Obviously the subject matter played a role in that  but i think it was more to do with the fact that the writing wrapped you up in the story and made you feel like you were a part of it  almost like you actually were HH and were struggling to control your own locked up desires  Lastly  I was really impressed with how Nabokov was able to convey such salacious sexual behavior without ONCE ever actually getting graphic in print  I think that that is something that a lot of today s writers can learn from  The power of suggestion is really much more effective then spelling everythign out for the reader   I finally read this book  It has been on my to read list for years  I was astonished by its humour  I never expected to read this and laugh  Nabokov sets the tone with his fake opening letter  I do understand that it is a book of caution  but I think it is also a book of traveling the US  Dolores is difficult to feel sorry for  and Humbert Humbert is difficult to hate  They are multi faceted people who come alive in this book   Review pending   Despite leaving this novel disturbed  I have never encountered a novel like this before  I didn t feel like an active participant in the novel but an on looker  I felt as if I was sitting in the same room with Humbert Humbert while he hashed out his sickness  I am left feeling as I have been provided a sneak peek to his mental sickness and maybe on my way into understanding his logic or reason for being attracted to nymphets  I am planning on a reread to see what else is revealed to me or if I feel the same about it  I hate Humbert Humbert and will be haunted for life for listening to his story  The words in cased in the novel became to loud to ignore and will unfortunately stick with me forever  The novel was beautifully written but in needs of some fine tuning but added to the story since Humbert Humbert first language wasn t English   Playful  endlessly inventive  humorous  passionate and depraved  It is easy to see why this book is considered one of the greatest of the 20th century  Will definitely have to re read this at some point as it is easy to get intoxicated by Nabokov s language  a re read I think would reveal even more  True enough  the pleasures of  Lolita  are intellectual rather than carnal  but that s only as it should be  This may be   as one dust jacket review claims   the only truly convincing love story  of the 20th century  but it s also an intellectual feast of word games and allusions and surprising asides    a book that rewards many a re reading  A couple of years ago I saw Edward Albee s striking play   The Goat or Who Is Sylvia   As I listened to  Lolita   beautifully narrated by Jeremy Irons  I was struck by a common note   The Goat  took transgressive behavior that is generally viewed as comic  buggering a goat  and  without ignoring the humor of that behavior  made me view it seriously  and without letting me forgive the transgressor  allowed me to feel empathy for him  and to learn more about the human condition we both share   Lolita  takes transgressive behavior that is viewed as shocking and disgusting  the sexual abuse of a 12 year old  and  without ignoring the horror of that behavior  made me view it comically  and without letting me forgive the transgressor  allowed me to feel empathy for him  and to learn more about the human condition we both share  Nabokov s language  filled with rhythm  consonance and assonance  alliteration  the most intricate and precise choice of word  lifts the reader up and out of simple moral judgment  Nabokov s prose is so extraordinary that I found myself performing a kind of reverse visualization  where I could  see  the words marching across a page as listened to them  I also felt a particular and peculiar bond with a tale told about a journey across the America of 1947  the year of my birth  Humbert Humbert aspires to an immortality composed of  aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets   the resolution of ache and fear in peace and beauty that we all seek  As he approaches his tawdry end  he stands on a highway overlook and listens to a  vapory vibration of accumulated sounds   the melody of children at play   majestic and minute  remote and magically near  frank and divinely enigmatic   He realizes  that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord   And despite the overpowering urging of my superego not to do so  I found myself granting him a kind of redemption  It is hard to rate this book so highly when HH s passion is such a thing of disgust  However  the language  characters  plotting and so on are simply brilliant  I have never read  for example  anything where the description of the world so beautifully reveals the consciousness and attitudes of the narrator  I don t understand still how the author manages to create such an uncomfortable and  at the same time  delightful mood  but I have now experienced it and I want to read more of Nabokov  First off  let me disclaim by saying that I listened to the audiobook  as opposed to reading it  That makes a difference to some people  It was narrated by Jeremy Irons  who played HH in the 1997 film by Adrian Lyne  I ve never seen the movie  but after listening to him read  I must  He so perfectly embodied the character that it gave me chills  He really brought the character to life  And perhaps that colors my feelings about the book as a whole also That being said  Wow  This book was    amazing  The language was beautiful and rich  The tone was very tongue in cheek  If you can forget about the subject matter for a few moments and just let yourself get lost in it  it s WONDERFUL  But then you remember what it s all about  and it gives you a squicky feeling inside  On one hand  you begin to empathize  or at the very least sympathize  with HH  But on the other hand  he s a complete monster and you revile him I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who can read with an open mind     hm  this was tough for me to read    yes  quite typically for its  controversial  issues  it helps to read Nabokov s thoughts on Humbert Humbert  the style  though  i can surely imagine was riveting to the public of its time in a similar way people call the Beatles  groundbreaking   it is certainly impressive  the greatest thing about this piece is considering  like Cervantes  the amount of thought that went into the many allusions and word games  i appreciate that this novel is a puzzle filled with secrets that will keep one interested and researching read after read  should one have the stomach to rinse and repeat  hm  i will add though  to qualify the five stars   this book can get tiresome  yes  it is often brilliant but sometimes  you get miserably fed up with the obsessively contrived words and wish for more insight into characters besides Humbert    though I am confident this is a structural intention  NOT the quickest read ever for this reason  but certainly thought provoking  A one of kind artful classic that disturbs  confounds and stuns as it implores us to read on  I had not remembered how strange and beautiful this novel is  More than anything  it is a miracle of voice  It took me nearly two weeks to read  and I am a very fast reader  because there wasn t a sentence that I could breeze past without marveling at it  for word choice  for rhythm  for the incredible clarity of Humbert s mental state as revealed through  his  remarkable voice  If you haven t read Lolita  or if you haven t read Lolita in years  I heartily encourage you to do so  Most people are familiar with this iconic tale of the sexual obsession of an adult man  Humbert Humbert  with his juvenile step daughter  Dolores Haze  he renames her Lolita   Humbert eloquently defends his motives to an imagined audience and his ornately detailed reminiscence of the object of his passion struggles to obscure the monstrosity of his actions   THE EPITOME OF ART  Absolutely in love with this book  It s taken me all of August to read it because the story is a little slow  and the writing is complicated  but it is the BEST writing I have ever encountered  I only wish to ever write half as well as this  Oddly I love the characters  Lolita is a very witty little girl and Humbert  Humbert  crazy in his own fancy  intelligent way  Definitely read this book if you re into classics  Lolita is a Modern novel in an effect very few authors were able to produce  Its narrator  Humbert Humbert  is a troubled man whose seule instict is to persue the magic moment in which he found love and surrender in the arms  and legs  of his mate Annabel  at tender age of 16  Dolores Haze  his second wife s daughter  has nothing but a physical resemblance  which is enough to feed the most passionate  insane and persistent obession that will end up in pain  suffering and the ultimate tragedy to each person involved in the construction of the Myth named Lolita  Stunning use of language and wit  The first chapters particularly were a standout  I admit the man s obsession made me feel a bit nauseous  but not because of lol s age necessarily  his obsession was just beyond what I could stomach  and spoke to nothing of her mind and little of her personality  Too much of the limbs  the smells  the movements of the body  so that it was all flesh    Some way further across the street  neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart  the outline of a restaurant sign  a large coffee pot  kept bursting  every full second or so  into emerald life  and every time it went out  pink letters saying Fine Foods relayed it  but the pot could still be made out as a latent shadow teasing the eye before its next emerald resurrection  This is a mostly insignificant  albeit metaphorical  passage in the book  but how can you not love a book wherein something so insignificant can be so beautifully conveyed  Nabokov basically takes over your mind when you read Lolita  At least that s how I felt  He knows you re struggling to dislike Humbert  But that you do kind of like him because he is really funny and painfully aware of his sins  At one point in the book he calls you out on the fact that you re rooting for him  Which is pretty incredible considering he wrote the book around 60 years ago  I like books where the author transcends words on a page and becomes solidly nested in your head  And knows that he or she is in your head and teases you about being there  That s beautiful to me  Lovely writing about depravity   What is it about the worst of the world that produces the best prose   There is not much point to review this book  except to refute the claim that this is modernity s only compelling love story  It is not a love story  It is a glimpse into darkness  But it is worth reading  I bought this book when I was 14 because I liked the cover art  I got about 15 pages in when I realized I was SO not old enough to be reading this  In college I picked it up again and became completely immersed in Nabokov s writing  The subject matter is obviously disturbing  but Nabokov s writing  the characters  and the insight he brings into the best and worst of human nature is so valuable   I thought the book was lovely  Although there were some elements I didn t much enjoy  the book was overall good  Humbert is obviously the one to trick and confuse the reader  making him seem bad one moment  then a victim the other  as many other reviews say  It just bothers me  whenever I ask an adult about the book  I had heard it was a college level book  and I m not there yet but the man at the bookstore said it was one of the top required novels for most colleges   some give me looks like I m a pervert   There s more to it  if you look past to the true meaning  Together with the first sentence of Garcia Marquez s 100 Years of Solitude  the opening of this book scores as one of the beat I have read So how do you rate a book that so effectively explores the mind of a pervert  And how do you justify admitting that you think it is a great book Admittedly  it s about a relationship that the protagonist in a moment of lucidity admits robbed a child of her childhood  But it s also about the vast landscape of the US in the first post war years seen through the eyes of an observer experiencing it for the first time  everything from awesome natural beauty to the seedy succession of motor courts  Perhaps this is what makes the book feel creepy at the same time that it reads like great literature  in this experience of America  we sense the voice and reactions of Nabokov the author behind the words of the protagonist  So how can we be sure that the protagonist s taste in sexuality    something he clearly expects us to disapprove us  despite the repeated allusions to practices in antiquity or to Poe s Annabel Lee    doesn t in some way have a nod of approval from the author  Nabokov of course denied it  and handles the matter with the refined sensibility of an aesthete  the depiction of Dolores Lolita on the tennis court is more erotic than the account of the first sex between Humbert Humbert and his step daughter  In addition to being about hopeless  self destructive attraction to a nymphet and omnivorous depictions of America in its grandeur and grit  it is also literature about literature  It feels as Nabokov never forgot a book he admired  and weaves his text into the larger fabric So yes  I think it s a great book A note on the edition  I bought the annotated edition because I had heard of the author s penchant for obscure literary allusions and multi lingual puns  Dutiful as I am  I read the lengthy  erudite introduction first  then tackled the novel  looking up every annotation  I gave this up after a few pages  though  and my enjoyment soared  Still glad the notes are there  When it comes time to reread the book  I think I ll read all the annotations first  then the book  But I don t recommend doing this the first time through  though  Just settle in  enjoy the book  and don t worry what obscure reference you might be missing  despicable  sad  and i had to google the plot afterwards  but still one of my favourite books  I read this in the middle of what was  historically  my longest dry spell I can t tell if it made it worse or better  Exquisite language  especially as read by Jeremy Irons Lush  decadent  voluptuous  And disgusting I simply loved the litany of gray vehicles following  maybe  I felt the  giving crunch of the damp gravel   the juicy tidbit I had sucked out at last from a hollow tooth   ugh I have to give 5 stars in spite of the drag of the middle of the book  what would be tedious description from any other author is enthralling    Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming  This is a fault Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated  For these there is hope They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book  Books are well written  or badly written  That is all      Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray  Oscar Wilde Aesthetic pleasure attained from an artwork which describes or paints vividly the overtly horrifying or the unequivocally immoral is often construed as horrifying or immoral in itself  the Reader or Viewer in this case is regarded as  condoning  or  sympathizing with  the evil or horror depicted in the artwork  for how else can he she  like  something that is supposed to repulse human sensibilities  For Wilde  Beauty is an elusive entity independent of the literal content of the artwork  it is that shade of vermilion  the caress of sunlight  the perfect angle of the splayed body of the murdered child which appeals to our aesthetic sensibility as we  for a moment  forget to be appalled by the sight of what we really see and are enraptured by how perfectly and beautifully it is presented  The more I think of the nature of aesthetic pleasure the more I am confounded  How does it really work  and how much do we actually condone in the process of being transported to a state of ecstasy  I can look past the frigid reality of death or the gushing spurt of warm blood from a slit throat as long as it is done with taste and is somehow  poetic   That s all it takes for the squalid or the unbearable to be turned into  Art   And perhaps that s where genius lies We became first acquainted  Vladimir and I  through a hardbound edition of Invitation to a Beheading I found yellow and pungent with the scent of years gone by in my college library  and reading through the Kafkaesque nightmare of Cincinnatus  that ultimate black comedy of the human condition  fighting and struggling against an unknown terror  an unnamed crime  I humbly agreed to the general opinion that Nabokov is good  A remarkable prose stylist  language is a plaything in his hands  a fistful of sand that is transformed into stardust and rosewater on the page  Lolita is perfectly worded  and that is an understatement  As an artwork  it rips you apart  dazzles you and leaves you breathless  only to rip you apart all over again as it courses through unflinchingly the mire of human duplicity  madness and obsession  The book does not condone incest  dear Reader  as it revels in it  spouts it unashamedly  it is perhaps  if we must talk of  meaning  at all  a parody  a satire  a farce  it ridicules and mocks rather than sympathize  for there is little pathos  little that I found at least  between the velvet of its pages  Poor Lolita  Lola  our very own Dolores Haze  you poor nymphet of broken  barren trees  is dehumanized beyond any ounce of compassion  I left her stranded and so irrevocably dead  What did it matter  Lola is all of us  there are so  so many of us that perhaps the horror is normalized  we hardly flinch anymore  And Humbert  what of cher monsieur Humbert  Is there any sympathy for the devil  There must be  in the hearts of many  there must be a few hesitant sighs and sobs  But I left him mad  so beautifully mad and alone  his claws dripping with honey and fresh blood  the soft flesh of his tongue quivering with poetry and music  mon chanteur  mon amour Humbert  We do not condone  dear Reader  We are merely broken and recreated again by this sliver of life  of reality  of Truth if you will  We are merely transfixed by Beauty  the goddess of blood and mire  of excrement and wails of abandoned children  the champion of daffodils and the innocence of virgins  for don t you see  She is all of Life  She is all of Sin and Virtue  She is the high vaulted skies of Heaven and the despair of Hell  It is She we worship  we the Readers of immorality and morality all of which is juxtaposed in one immense drama of Human Existence  Pardon us  After finishing this book I was completely confused by the review the New York Times had so famously given it at it s beginning     the most compelling love story of our time   This book  which is about the habitual rape and torture of a 12 year old girl is told from the point of view of her tormentor  Humbert Humbert  However  as it is told by him this book focuses on the responsibility the young girl carries of her own sexuality and his deviance  Lolita  the daughter of his landlady turned wife becomes his sole property after the mother s death  Taking her on a long road trip Humbert rapes Lolita  which from his point of view is merely tantalizing and agonizing sex  His possession of Lolita is turned into her possession of his soul  Humbert is tied to this young lady  whom he regards as a nymph  Lolita is a sexually developing girl  and this is mis interpreted by him as sexually active  The end of the book does reveal the disgusting nature of their relationship and Nabokov responsibly points out that Lolita was not an equal party to this odyssey This book does offer an insight into cunning  immoral and ultimately sick mind of a pedophile  Excellently written  and beautifully told with very stunning descriptions of the forests they travel through and the American landscape this story is painted on  This book should be read in college as a masterpiece  but I think people have a hard time getting past the sex    for good reason  it s rape  Lolita is like a really beautiful painting of a most despicable subject matter  Breathtaking  but at the same time repulsive  I was totally engrossed while reading it  but at the same time I couldn t wait for it to be over  Vladimir Nabakov is an excellent wordsmith and his prose really struck a chord with me  but at the same time the subject matter of this novel made me feel a little uneasy  The main character Humbert Humbert is a conceited  depraved  vain  hateful misogynistic sexual predator  Due to Nabakov s prose however  he is also a most enthralling and entertaining narrator  One second he filled me with disgust  and the next he had me chuckling and even feeling sympathetic towards him  which made me feel disgusted again   It is this duality  the balance between the beautiful and poetic and the ugly and repulsive  that makes Lolita such a fascinating read  If this was just a novel about a man in his late 30 s who likes little girls  I doubt many people would bother reading it to the end  but Nabakov manages to imbue Humbert Humbert with a certain veneer of culture and learnedness  He might be a brute and a monster  but he is a clever and well behaved monster who easily finds justifications for his debauchery  One also has to wonder if there is any of The Russian expatriate author himself in Humbert Humbert s old world judgement of the new world and it s popular culture  It certainly wouldn t surprise me if that was the case  I heartily recommend Lolita to everyone  The subject matter might be difficult for some  but I don t think it was ever intended to be easy   Maybe the best writing of our time  lyrical  crass  heady and dreamy  There is no other character such as Humbert Humbert  both revolting and enthralling in his sad and pathetic desire for Dolores Haze  It s a love story  It s a love for the unattainable past  This is literature not simply fiction Must read for everyone   I m usually not so keen about the supposed to be classic novels   but this book is so far the best I ve ever read  despite my high demands for books   It has an amazingly beautiful language  thus creating an interesting clash when describing horrible things  The author included poems and wordplays of unbelievable talent  in my opinion  and a great study of human beings and their behaviour  You re able to study the characters  personalities and analyze them deeply without getting everything served on a plate  Absolutely every line of this novel is poetry  every combination of words is a work of art  It is one if the most beautifully written novels I ve ever read   Nabakov pains and entices the reader with every syllable and description of the misperception of the turmoil of a stolen life  with what appears to be a love story   Leggerlo e stato incredibilmente intenso  Confermo quel che pensavo verso meta libro  sono disgustata e allo stesso tempo affascinata dalla vicenda  ma estasiata dal libro in se senza dubbio  E divento completamente adorante se penso che l inglese non era neanche la prima lingua di Nabokov  eppure sia riuscito a scrivere in questo modo bellissimo  Per tutta la questione della morale che inevatibilmente viene convolta  chiamo amore quello che prova Humbert  ma e senz altro un amore disturbato  sbagliato e ossessivo  E mi sembrano idioti quelli che da questo libro traggono l insegnamento  non importa quello che dicono i moralisti  l amore e sempre amore bla  bla  bla  no  e da idioti  Mi sta bene chiamarlo amore  ma non penso che l autore volesse mandare un grande messaggio di pace e o giustificare la pedofilia  Non credo di essere neppure abbastanza brillante per comprendere a pieno quello che l autore volesse dire  ma io ci leggo una storia meravigliosamente intricata  perversa e dolorosa  E scritta magistralmente  Oh  l ho gia detto che amo come e scritta  Lo stile  la lingua   l intrico di spine   e il fatto che il libro non sfoci mai nel volgare  sebbene farlo  vista la storia  sarebbe stato molto facile  ma rimanga sempre in bilico  senza mai rivelare troppo o troppo poco  E poi ben venga il fatto che questo libro fa discutere  di sicuro questa lettura mi ha lasciato qualcosa  di enorme  e continuero a parlarne  a rileggerla e a ricordarla  Mi e piaciuto cosi tanto  nessuno riuscirebbe a farmi cambiare idea  non importa quali fattori negativi io possa aver bellamente ignorato accecata dall amore per il libro  Commentare un classico e pericoloso  avro detto un sacco di cose stupide  ma davvero  credo che la pensero cosi inevitavilmente  ad ogni rilettura  Che sudata questo libro  ma ne e valsa la pena  It s always fascinating to be able to see a great author discuss his book  but unfortunately with writers from the past we don t often get the chance  Luckily someone uploaded to YouTube a black   white tv interview Nabokov gave on Lolita  Isn t the internet great Part 1  http   youtu be Ldpj_5JNFoAPart 2  http   youtu be 0 wcB4RPasE 4 9 Full review to come   Humbly  humming  ho hum Humbert Humbert  our pedophile protagonist that finds a  nymphet   the titular  nymphet   within his grasps and thus begins his inevitable destruction Not sure how I would feel about this book  but provoked by many an appearance on all time must read lists and intriguing reviews  I stumbled forth as a tepid reader  I believe my trepidation understandable when you take a look at the central theme   a sophisticated 40 year old becoming obsessed with a pubescent girl    and at first the storyline followed as you might imagine and to top it off in the first person narrative of that very culprit  I was more than a little wary of reading on  part of me wanted to keep ignorance in tact  turn the blind eye   but the very aforementioned narrative reels one in and keeps you interested enough to get to the second part which made me extremely happy I stuck with it  There s a mystery element to this story that is unique and again the style of writing is perfect  All I can say is though the subject matter made me uncomfortable  it impressed upon me the importance of keeping one s mind open   Wonderfully written  Vivid imagery  Very sexy  turned me on for months Without a doubt  Lolita is one of the most confident novels I have ever come across  I say this in regards to the state of the writer  Nabokov  and the inevitable horror that has often been the reaction to this novel over the years The idea of an unreliable narrator is somewhat canon  Many writers have used the concept of perspective to their advantage  but  in my opinion  none as successfully as Nabokov in this work  He has  much like Dr  Frankenstein  created a monster  However  this monster is not the tragically misunderstood creation of someone  but the insistingly misunderstood portrait of a despicable human being who is far too good at assembling words to ever let on that ordinary descriptions of his actions would paint him as a vile and disgusting human  At times throughout Lolita  I felt shame as I was able to identify with such a repulsive man Most unreliable narrators rely on a sense of flawed goodness that keeps them compelling  but Nabokov manages to sidestep the idea of fundamental empathy toward someone by making him so dazzling with his use of language that we can sometimes forget who he really is  Humbert Humbert  for the majority of the novel  has absolutely no redeeming characteristics  It is not until nearly 250 pages into the text that there is anything regarding pity we can show him  The question is then  what on Earth led me to page 250  I would haven given up on him within 20 pages theoretically  The simple answer is that Humbert s use of language is so powerful that it keeps me reading without a clear understanding of why  His constant outbursts  rants  and horrific behavior should logically remove him from the average reader s empathy  In most any great story with a central protagonist  he or she must prove themselves worthy of the reader s care and empathy  Most authors do this by simply making their characters alive  likeable  and realistic  Nabokov does this in Lolita by making Humbert the smartest  cleverest  most charismatic person I ve seen put to print in a long time  He spends the entire novel distracting you from the true nature of his being  Even when confessing his desires  he is so wordy and poetic that his intentions can easily be missed  He is one of the most creative villains I ve ever come across  and he is the narrator of the story  If any other character had narrated this story  it would have been terrible  If not for Nabokov s mastery of these linguistic techniques  this novel would have just been a nasty story about child abuse  In his hands  though  it becomes an experiment to see how much we  as a reader  can be influenced and distracted by heavily biased elaborate prose  It is easy to lose track of the action in this novel  and it is because Humbert hides it so well Overall  I can t describe this novel as anything but a masterpiece  The ambiguity of morality  the questionable narration  the wordplay  the complex characterization    It is nearly perfect  Lolita was certainly not a pleasant  simplistic story  but my god if it isn t one of the most thought provoking literary experiments I ve ever encountered  It is dense and complex  but it is worth every bit of the time you can pour into it  This novel will stay with me for years  I love Nabokov s writing style in general  and this book    Lolita  is my favorite of all his books I think every single person has to read it  Very recommended and that s why I m adding it to most recommended and my favorites shelves here  This was one of the trippiest  most well written books I have ever readDespite the fact that Humbert Humbert  the protagonist  admits upfront to his pedophilia  it s almost impossible not to be drawn to his side REPEATEDLY throughout the novel  I had to stop quite often to draw myself out of the narration for fear of completely forgetting that what Humbert was doing to his Lolita wasn t actually acceptable in society at all Nabokov truly has done an amazing job Fantastic Nabokov expresses perfectly the inner dialogue of a person  normal or nymphet loving  I imagine  and the use of French  referring to oneself in the third person from time to time  it all works beautifully Very carnal and passionate  Silken prose  Poetic  Hilarious  A wonderful read  possibly a necessary one    Notes after finishing Beautiful tragedy  poetic and sad  the writer uses the language so well that the scenes are perfectly described  Truly wonderful read  I enjoyed it thoroughly and will be hard pressed to find something better for a long time  I m guessing Must admit that  towards the end and through some of it  mostly towards the end   I felt disinterested in Humbert s paedophilia  Felt certain parts served little purpose  I didn t need to be reminded of his sexuality all of the time To conclude  a necessary read  Absolutely delightful  Five stars  but not entirely perfect  Tragic  happy  hilarious  upsetting and thought provoking Who is worse  Lolita or Hum    I can t wait to read this book again  I bought the ebook while I was a third of the way through my paperback  I love this book so far  I consider deviance to be amongst the primary characteristics of my persona  I m not a child molester  don t get me wrong  more of a small time criminal hobbiest     so the way the author gives you a glimpse into the mind of a pedophile is mesmerizing to me  Only about ten chapters in and I get the feeling this one will be at the top of my list upon completion  Hauntingly beautiful and entirely fucked up   Lolita  is a remarkable work of literary fiction  and a remarkably difficult piece to pin down  At its factual core  this is the memoir of a pedophile  In its artistic essence  this is a tragic love story  To read  Lolita  is to be in a perpetual state of cognitive dissonance  and it is a testament to Nobakov   to language  even   that substance so tainted can be so absorbingly beautiful  Lolita  tells the tale of Humbert Humbert  a pensive British gentleman in his late thirties  A perfectly boring man in all other respects  Humbert has a terrible secret  He is  to his anguished and perpetual shame  hopelessly attracted to  nymphets   young  nubile girls between the ages of 8 and 12  This lifelong predilection is irrevocable and absolute  but for most of Hubert s grown life  it rarely manifests itself through his actions  That all changes the day Humbert meets   and falls tragically in love with   the young  pretty  snotty  and unmistakably childish Lolita  Twelve year old Lolita s and thirty eight year old Humbert s lives become inextricably intertwined  and Humbert s infatuation   not purely sexual  but carrying with it all the eroticism of romantic love   begins to leak into the outside world  Lolita  is told as a memoir  with Humbert Humbert serving as your humble narrator throughout  And what a narrator he is  Humbert s language is haunting and beautiful  as only the words of a man desperately in love can be  And while Novakov s prose is often extravagant and ornate  it is neither gaudy nor overdone  and dramatic language rarely gets in the way of understanding  Humbert slides seamlessly between tragic romantic  waxing poetic  to objective witness  recounting facts  I wandered various public room  glory below  gloom above  the look of lust is always gloomy  lust is never quite sure   even when the velvety victim is locked up in one s dungeon   that some rival devil or influential god may still not abolish one s prepared triumph  In common parlance  I needed a drink   15  Nobakov doesn t play with word to be impress  but play with words he does  you d be wise to keep a dictionary on hand at all times   here is the highest density of vaguely familiar and totally foreign words I ve ever encountered in a work of fiction The edition I picked up also included a few pages of commentary by Nabokov himself  and it was fascinating to hear the author s take on this gorgeously perplexing novel  I was tickled when Nobakov   whose works are overanalyzed in English classrooms around the world   declares  in complete frankness   I detest symbols and allegories    314  Nobakov doesn t write to analyzed  Substance is a means  not an end  In his own words   for me a work of fiction exists insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss    315 And indeed   Lolita  is aesthetic bliss at its infuriating finest  A tragedy  a love story  a work of art  and a piece of smut   Lolita  is equal parts disturbing and enthralling  It poignantly proves the power of words  and will sweep you away in its beautiful language even as you writhe inside  A psychological chore and an intellectual mindfuck   Lolita  is  above all else  a literary masterpiece  and is entirely deserving of all the accolades hence bestowed  In common parlance

written in Russian it would be much better  So    wow  my bows to Nabokov and his shitty English  P Was fur ein Buch  Den Schreibstil fand ich absolut umwerfend   I can t believe I waited this long to finally read this book  The experience is so multi layered that it is difficult to articulate  However  I will try First  the writing is so yummy and full and luscious that you practically swoon over it I loved the way Nabakov plays with my sense of morality  I found myself alternately cheering Humbert on  then Lolita  wait  then checking in with my moral compass and finding it had been totally turned upside down  I was mesmerized by the story for the first half of the book then suddenly the pages turned more slowly  methodically and I found myself getting a little bored with it all until I realized the genius of it that you were following the roller coaster of the characters In the end  I found that moral compass back in order the ride  oh what a ride This is a rare and beautiful bird  this book  Don t wait  A masterpiece tragedy  A comedy  An atrophy of moral sense  A sad tale of a man who in his own unwillingness to be in touch with his own humanity  then is unable to see her as human  All she is to him is a distraught  disorienting  maddening object of his desire that he labels as love  At times  this book was impossible to put down and at the same time too unhinging to continue reading  I am so glad I picked up this book  I had been wanting to read it for a long  long time  Finally  I bought it and began reading it almost immediately  This book is a masterpiece  I adore it with all my heart and it is possibly one of my favourite books  The writing and EVERYTHING about this book is perfect   Five stars for its intellectual contribution to the world of literature  WARNING  This book is not for light readers and fans of rom com  erotica etc  it would be too boring for them to read Though the book has been considered by many critics as an erotic novel  though for me it isn t   you wouldn t find any hardcore sexual acts in the book   Fans of 50 shades  this book isn t for you  With tons of obsolete words  French phrases and complex sentences  you ll surely get lost in translation if you won t read it continously  Because of my busy schedule  I hardly had a time reading Lolita  it took me two painful months before I finished it  so I always got lost  So don t do what I ve done  if you have a lot of time  read it at once  You also need a French dictionary for those French phrases and an English dictionary for antediluvian words that you ll surely encounter throughout the book Reading Lolita is a good exercise for the mind  hahahaha One  or An Other Story about Humbert HumbertThey entered the novel at night  by stealth  and took up position on the sixth floor of the Book Depository Building  Then they waited for the morning to come Only one of them was armed  The others had come along to lend moral support  They had never been involved in a character assassination before  If the truth be told  they were a little nervous  They surveyed the roofs and windows of the adjacent buildings  They were pretty sure nobody was watching  Nobody was there to watch  Everybody was downstairs  lining the streets  waiting for the Mardi Gras floats to pass  happy  cheering the contestants they liked  remaining silent or jeering the ones they didn t The one opened his case  took out the parts of his rifle  and assembled it with practised precision  The last item to be put in place was the telescopic lens  He lifted the rifle to his shoulder and looked through the lens  The first thing he saw was the streetscape below  Then he scrolled to the right until he saw the T junction around which Humbert and Dolores would come He didn t have to wait long  Three minutes  Perhaps it would have taken another two minutes for their open limousine to reach the point where it was closest and the line of vision was clearest  The one had rehearsed everything the previous weekend Twenty seconds later  one of them whispered   Now  Now   The tension had been too much  Without removing his eye from the lens  the one smiled  It was a signal that the others took for permission to relax  The one knew what he was doing  He had done it before  He would do it again  although they didn t know that at the time Another forty seconds later  the one dropped the rifle from his shoulder  One of the others asked   What are you doing   The one didn t answer  With a single deft action  he removed the silencer  He placed his left elbow on the window ledge  lifted the rifle and pushed the barrel between the drawn curtains He only waited ten seconds more  He found Humbert s head through the lens  then thought better of it  even though he had planned his course of action methodically  He lowered the rifle a fraction and fired the first shot into Humbert s heart  If Humbert s perverse story was to be believed  that was its lifeblood  its source  its origin  It was a direct hit  Humbert didn t explode  In this way  at least  it was all a bit disappointing for the one s audience  His head nodded forward  then slumped backwards  though Humbert still seemed to be alive  wondering what had happened  what did his author have in store for him  Surely  it wasn t  going to end like this  with a bang The blood pumped wildly out of Humbert s heart  though it was mainly invisible to this audience  held in by his vest  barely staining his pressed white business shirt  Humbert s head tilted forward slightly  as the life fled his limp body  The one could still see his face  His next shot tore into Humbert s left eye  The third shot was aimed for his right eye  Up to this moment  nobody on the street could tell anything untoward had happened  Even the sound of the rifle shots had been less than expected  drowned out by the carnival music and crowd noise With the third shot  Humbert s head finally did explode  propelling a slurry of brain and blood and bone fragments  willy nilly  over Dolores and her pretty pink floral dress  She took off her heart shaped glasses and looked up  until she seemed to detect the windows in the Book Depository Building  Only she ever appeared to see the one and the others who were peeking tentatively through the windows on the one s left  so as not to be in his way  She kept her silence though There were still forty seconds remaining  The one didn t wait to witness the commotion  He could watch it on TV as soon as he got back to his hotel room He had three bullets left  He turned and faced the door of the apartment  He looked at his watch  Twenty seconds  ten seconds  five seconds  The door smashed open  even though it was unlocked and could have been pushed open  What have you done   The man was alone  older than the one expected  paunchier  He could imagine his sly  intellectualized grin as he sat at his desk  composing his lecherous words in the comfort of his deceitful monogamous relationship  How dare you   Was it a challenge  Was it a question that the one genuinely wanted to be answered  No response came  Nabokov simply continued his approach towards the one With the same efficiency with which he had dispatched Humbert  the one fired the remaining three bullets into the author  They were all aimed for the heart  Nabokov fell backwards onto the floor  He grimaced in pain as his hand reached for his bloody red chest and he realised his time had finally come The one noticed Nabokov s eyelids start to descend  He put his rifle down and knelt beside Nabokov  With his left thumb and forefinger  he separated Nabokov s eyelids and stared into his eyes  watching as all sign of life escaped them  Eventually  the author was dead  It was time for each of them to turn their back on the novel now  safe  and come back to reality  Life for the one  for the others  could resume as intended  as normal  The one had righted another wrong  This is one of my favorite books  The writing is delicious  I can t believe English is Nabokov s 2nd  3rd or 4th language  He s a genius  I had started the book decades ago  when I was too young to get past the subject matter  and I m so glad I tried again  I was laughing and appalled at the same time  Wow  Like Vanity Fair said  Lolita is the only genuine love story of the century  This book is so distractingly passionate that you disregard the fact that the narrator Humbert Humbert is a pedophile  It just shows the fervor and irrationality of love in such vivid and beautifully structured language  Lolita is unforgettable and awesomely tragic   This deserves all the stars and none at all  It is the most singular  revolting  witty  and breathtaking book I ve ever had the pleasure and disgust of reading  What a beautiful book  The story is  admittedly  the kind that makes your skin crawl a little bit  but the way it is written just blew me away  I found myself feeling sorry for old Humbert Humbert every once in a while  until I remembered what a scoundrel he was  Nabokov s writing just has a way of drawing you in and making you forget that you re supposed to really hate this fellow  The descriptions were so vivid that I could imagine each scene  but they weren t overwrought  I also have an affinity for alliteration  and it s certainly aplenty in this work  As controversial as this book is  I instantly fell in love with it after the first couple of pages  Even though Humbert is wrong with his adoration of Lolita  according to most people   towards the end I found myself feeling intense sympathy for him  Nabokov has a way with writing with such sexual intensity that sometimes we barely notice that we are being drawn in even more  From what I have read of him  he likes to use that technique in almost all of his works  The movie was quite an interesting one to watch  especially after having read the book  L autre soir un air froid d opera m  alita Son fele   bien fol est qui s y fie  I neige  le decor s ecroule Lolita  Lolita  qu ai je fait de ta vie   This is probably my favourite book  If not  it is definitely up there  It is so beautifully written  I couldn t even  The plot is obviously what make the huge variety in the opinions  but you can t argue upon that Nabokov is the master of Litterature and that this is an absolute masterpiece  This is a mad mans work though  and therefore not for all and sundry   Years ago  back in Iran  I spent hours and hours in illegal book market to find a copy of this book  The forbidden book called  Lolita  which was so famous it was impossible to ignore  Alas  no luck finding it  Years passed and I forgot about the pursuit  until 3 month ago  I saw it in my local library  It was a moment of pure ecstasy  All of a sudden all my desires for this book rushed into my veins  I started it  I finished it I don t consider myself even slightly capable of writing a review for this book  Nabokov did what he could do best  deceiving the reader till the last page  playing with words  scenes  characters    Lolita  was one of my best adventures  every word  every description and every line  opened a new world to me  It s not an erotic book  it s not even a romantic novel  It s something Nabokov created to shock everyone  to prove he is comparable to or even better than great Russian writers like Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy   Nabokov is a superstar  This book broke my heart  His prose is so cold and at the same time so emotional  He makes what should be melodramatic seem spare and real  His protagonist both repulses and draws his reader close  In the end  the reader feels implicated in the crime but also strangely drawn to it  At the same time Nabokov s prose both pushes and pulls us away  A masterpiece  I read Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita  in the back of a semi cab in early June a few years ago   My husband was an over the road driver and I was a cab wife who had just graduated with a lit degree   There s a shroud of severity around this book  and I began reading it with a heavy  serious tone  Which is why it confused me into the first few pages that it was so damn funny  Not from mere situation  but from the voice of the narrator  the social attunement of the author  But it s not all humor  as the dark overtones of the book surface within the first few pages as well  Even as a whimsically linguistic book  a real passionate craze unfolds  I found the narrator unreliable and nearly all the pop culture rumors of the book to be untrue  I didn t like any of the characters at the end  but the language and storytelling was so fantastic  it is now one of my favorite reads A more complete review I wrote can be found on my blog  http   theunlacedlibrarian blogspot c    Like a song that I

being I read another of Nabokov s works  Pale Fire  a few years ago  and I was impressed by his style  After reading Lolita  I wanted to read more of his books  and I seriously wish I could use the power of words to express myself like he does Great book  Disturbing  Lolita    a warped love story of a precocious 12 year old girl  who seduces a 37 year old man into sleeping with her  Not really  but I m surprised how many people still believe that s what this is   even people who have read the book  I ve noticed in reviews that praise is heaped upon Nabokov s writing  but not the content  Yet I don t see how the two can easily be separated within this story  Every page makes for uncomfortable reading  though with poetic rather than graphic language and that s part of it s brilliance  It s worth emphasising just how beautiful the writing is  with superb detail  word play and alliteration throughout  I won t go into details about the characters or plot  because I m assuming you ve a  read it and know what happens  or b  haven t read it  so should find out for yourself by reading the book  be warned there are passages that will make you feel a little sick in your mouth  Lolita is a story of abuse  If this isn t content you can stomach  then leave the book alone  If you can accept that sometimes the most disturbing and depraved subject matter  can still make a beautiful story  then maybe give it a read  You might be surprised It deserves every one of it s 5 stars from me   I found this book difficult to read from the very start  It wasn t because the words but because of how dark and how obsessed this man was with little girls  It was scary and can make someone feel uneasy to the point of illness  Yes  this book made me sick  very sick  But  thats what makes it unique and enjoyable and proves that Nabokov was an amazing writer  I mean to make someone litterally sick just by the written word  Powerful  I wouldn t recommend this to everyone  It s too intense   A true masterpiece  Great narrative accompanied by ludic language One of Sal s favorites   I had to find out why  It s very good writing  however creepy      Now that I ve completed this book  I must say  it is definitely one of my favorite books of all time  Should you choose to read this book from cover to cover  you too  will be surprised at how endearing it actually is  The book pulled me in  Nabikov has a habit of creating words that aren t in the English dictionary  cross reference w Dictionary com   although his usage of them is entirely creative  He is extremely verbose  his prose  a delight 5 Stars  Hands Down  Putting the ethical debate aside  Lolita is surely one the most exquisite  eloquent and vivid books of all time The meticulous descriptive talent  the depiction of emotions  love and hate  the sensual artistic portrayal of lust    it was simply a treat for the senses As for the topic itself  I have developed a keen appetite for such controversial subjects  and I enjoyed the intellectual and moral conflict Nabokov induced in my mind  Outstanding   Nabokov wields the language like the best of them  and it was the third one he learned  I expected it to be great   I didn t expect to enjoy it so much  or be quite so impressed  A classic that finally lives up the  need to read  pile  unlike so many others that do nothing but bore and disappoint  Hot and depressing  There s no fool like an old fool I love I love I love this book  33 Foi disso que foi acusado na epoca  pornografico  e quase nao conseguiu ser publicado  Mas nao se trata de pedofilia e sim de obsessao  E cada leitor vai ter sua visao de quem e o verdadeiro cruel da historia  ele com sua paixao doentia ou ela com sua  doce inocencia   Ele afinal e vitima ou algoz  what a hoot  a poke in the eye to all who see this as nothing but a  Dirty Book     it s one of the saddest stories i have ever read  I first read Lolita while in high school and from the very first chapter  I was transfixed  And the provocative subject matter doesn t flinch from any of the seedy  slightly guilty dark inner monologue of Humbert Humbert s unending devotion lust towards his precious Lolita  I recommend this novel only for anyone whose not afraid to delve into the darker more taboo recesses of their hearts and souls to experience through Humbert Humbert s eyes on what it feels like to engage in an elicit sexual relationship with an underaged girl  And the consequences that soon follow  Holy shit  I d read  in bookstores  the first page a dozen times before I finally decided to pick up this book  I can t say anything about it that hasn t already been said  Holy shit  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul Who can forget this opening line  dirtiest book ever  or the dirtiest book ya can admit to readin   but for me it was definitely the dirtiest book ever  i needed a shower after readin  it  i mean ol  humbert did mama and daughter  but especially daughter  seven ways from sunday   but i ll definitely read it again  filthy  but literarily filthy  Widely and wildly misunderstood  misinterpreted  and strangely accepted as a defense of pedophilia  Nabokov s notes afterward should make all my former freshman year dorm mates hang their heads in shame at their literalism and naive trust in narrators  Not to mention I loved it and the language slides around you like stepping into a shower  Or a waterfall  Or a landmine  Lolita  Lol  Lee  Ta Lolita is an emotional storm  to put it in simplest terms  If you love books  then I implore you to pick this one up and read it today This book manages to be optimistic  grotesque  disgusting  lyrical  hilarious  depressing  beautiful  charming  and like taking psychedelic drugs Many of its passages feel so fresh  impressive in their manner of inventing new ways to describe casual ideas  Much of it feels like a haze  like walking through fog and seeing beauty  despite the flowers crushed beneath our feet Humbert is a total pig  and I hated him throughout the novel for what he manages to do the the psyche of Lolita  Because of the terrible actions of Humbert  I found myself completely loving Lolita  wishing I could have protected her  loving her for a very different reason than Humbert does  She is surprisingly creative  becoming more and more rebellious as the story unfolds  Knowing how her story progresses  if I knew a person like her in real life  I d be proud of where she is now While the book does have the stigma of being written from the perspective of a pedophile  this book is a powerful read because it will remind you of the strength we gain from our connection to humanity  It s an impressive novel  and I m even surprised at myself for how willing I d be to rave about it s story and writing  Go read it  I had to start this book maybe 3 or 4 times because his writing style felt very dense  I am so happy that I gave it that last chance because this is the only book I have read where I was constantly surprised what magic someone can do with language The prose in this book is unbelievable  I really look forward to a time when I will have time to read it again  There are books that I enjoy  and then there are books that I absolutely ADORE  It s one of those books that makes you wish the author was still alive  However this book is not for the easily offended  Why  Simple  because the protagonist is a pedophile  Stop here if that was already too much Moving on  This disgustingly amazing ironic novel features a bittersweet one sided love story  Funny enough  even with the suggestive first paragraph  I find it hard to classify this book as smut  Rather it s a story that reeks of taboo  comedy  and drama  The protagonist Humbert Humbert has somehow gained my sympathy when telling of his deranged relationship with a prepubescent young lady  I m trying my utmost best not to spoil anything  Finishing the book left me asking myself   Was he obsessed  Or was it truly love  If so  what form of love was it  I suggest this book highly to the brave and open minded   This book was so well written that it was very disturbing reading  I had to take several breaks from the story just to cleanse my soul of the main character s mental depravity  Reading the story with the maturity of an adult and professional educator makes it even more difficult as I can not view the story or characters as just fictionalized images  Nor can I view Lolita as the seductive teen she is portrayed in the media images associated with the story  For the Lolita that Humbert Humbert became sexually obsessed with is but a pre adolescent girl child of 12  getting to understand a sick person from his own point of view  we learn that when it comes to love  and passion  when it comes to that we are all a little sick  we all have suffer obsession  Love at the end brings the warmest and the darkest feelings of the very deep soul of all human beeings  Great book   Lolita was full of beautiful language that never bored me for a moment  and I ll definitely be reading it again someday soon   When I first started this book a month or two ago  I wasn t quite sure what I was getting myself into  The book pushed emotional and social buttons in me that I had seriously thought about abandoning Humbert Humbert s story and leaving the mystery known as Lolita forever  For whatever reason  I finished the book  and I am more than happy that I did  Although many will disagree  I forgive Humbert for all his crimes  and I almost detest his little Lolita Probably my most favorite book to date   In the beginning I thought this was not going to be a masterpiece but it really is  I thought that this theme is absolutely unacceptable but it has so many aspects and stuff to think about   I would give 4 5 stars though  just because it was extremely difficult to read it in English  Nabokov is Russian and the funny thing is that the original texts is written in English  That s why I actually read it like that   because I have a confession that the ideal way is to read books as they were written   To say I wasn t hypnotized by the lyrical magician  that I didn t buy into even knowing to my core that HH is a base decrepit shifty poet yarn spinner   the relinquishing of responsibility by invoking Annabelle Lee  the prebuscent living ways of the Greeks   would be disingenuous   I as a gentleman of the jury sympathized with HH   fell under Nabakovs spell  found myself transported to a golden world of high style   the mundane lifted above and beyond the seraph s realm   lolita is at once repulsive and mesmerizing the work of a master chess player setting snares   snatching our Royal representatives and accepting our thanks  Repeat readings are sure to slide just beyond the surface of things  Benarkah ini sebuah bentuk plagiarisme dari seorang Vladimir Nabokov  Atau pengarangnya sekedar mengalami cryptomnesia  Ah  entahlah ketika saya sudah terlanjur larut ke dalam buku ini  saya tidak peduli dengan masalah masalah eksternal semacam itu    lalu saya putuskan untuk menganggap ini fenomena cryptomnesia saja   Dolorez Haze  di mana kau sembunyi Mengapa kau sembunyi  sayang   Aku bicara dalam bayang misteri  berjalan dalam teka teki  aku tak bisa keluar  kata burung kepodang  Humbert humbert adalah tokoh yang saya benci sekaligus saya kasihani  Pada satu sisi  ia adalah seorang pedopil  maniak anak anak yang terkadang perasaannya begitu menjijikkan  tetapi di sisi lain cintanya kepada Lolita membuat saya merasa sangat kasihan  Kalau dibilang bahwa buku ini membawa pengaruh buruk dan vulgar  saya rasa itu kurang tepat  Apakah untuk memberikan pesan moral  maka seorang penulis harus membuat tokoh sesempurna Mary Sue atau Gary Stu  Oh oke  banyak buku bukuyang membuat tokoh tokoh semacam itu demi mendapatkan pengakuan bahwa ceritanya bermoral dan membuat pesan pesan kebaikan  tetapi sekali lagi ya  yang namanya sastra itu kan menyuarakan kebenaran tanpa perlu berkoar koar yah  jadi kalau tokoh tokohnya terlalu sempurna saya nggak bisa membedakannya sama buku motivasi  dan kalau pesan moral terlalu jelas  pembaca jadi seperti merasa dikuliahi  bukannya malah merenung dan mencari kebenaran itu sendiri  Oke ini sudah OOT  kembali ke topik Sekali lagi  tidak ada bagian yang kelewat vulgar di buku ini  jadi saya bingung mengapa buku ini dulu sempat dilarang terbit dimana mana  kalau tidak salah di Prancis juga  Mungkin karena isu pedophilianya ya  tapi menurut saya buku ini memperlihatkan bagaimana dampak dari kurangnya relasi antara ibu dan anak  antara Dolorez dan Charlotte Haze   sehingga membuat Dolorez menjadi anak yang bandel  membuat Humbert menemukan celah untuk menyusup di antara renggangnya hubungan Ibu Anak tersebut  dan ketika momennya tiba  Charlotte meninggal ditabrak kendaraan   yah  jadilah Humbert  dengan kedoknya sebagai wali Lo  Dolorez  alias Lolita  bisa dengan mudahnya membawa Lolita bepergian  dan tentunya dalam sepanjang perjalanan itu mereka bercinta berkali kali  Mungkin bila Lolita dibesarkan dengan cara yang benar  ia akan merasa jengah  memilih untuk kabur ke Dinas Sosial atau apalah  dan tidak mudah percaya begitu saja kepada Humbert Humbert  dan memanfaatkannya tentunya   Tidak jelas apa yang diinginkan oleh Lolita yang misterius ini  tetapi sepertinya ia hanya merasa tak punya tempat perlindungan lain selain Humbert  dan juga ia paham bahwa Humbert yang menyukainya  yang tergila gila kepadanya  sangat mudah untuk dimanfaatkan  dia tak pernah mencintai Ayah tirinya  kan  Toh ketika ia terpisah dengan Humbert  ia tidak mencoba mencari Humbert  malah ia menyembunyikan alamatnya sampai suatu saat ia dan suaminya membutuhkan Humbert karena mereka tidak punya uang sama sekali  Dan pada bagian ini  yang membuat saya terharu adalah ketika Humbert meminta Lo untuk pergi dengannya  dan ketika Lo menolak  ia tidak memaksanya  Malahan ia juga menawarkan mobilnya kepada Lo bila Lo mau  Seperti inikah bentuk cinta yang sangat buta  Sepertinya begitu Review yang terlalu panjang ngomong ngomong  karena saya suka sekali dengan buku ini  Penulisannya yang menggunakan sudut pandang orang pertama tidak membuat saya merasa diceramahi oleh buku ini  atau merasa bahwa Humbert sungguhlah bawel  karena gaya penulisannya yang indah  Intricate  Disgusting  Beautifully written  Revoltingly disturbing  Humbert Humbert is one of the most disgusting characters to be dreamt of  As I read the novel  and the seduction of Lolita by Humbert Humbert  I was at once disgusted  and fascinated by the story  This was masterfully written and psychologically disturbing  In short  Humbert Humbert is a pedophile who can not control himself and his Lolita  His obsession leads them on a cross country American odyssey with lies and deceptions to preserve an illicit relationship  Although at times  Humbert tries to appeal to the readers sympathy and his point of view  I failed to commiserate  I would have pummeled Mr  Humbert to death without shedding a tear  One of the best books ever written  in my opinion  If you re put off by reading the thoughts   machinations of Humbert Humbert  I mean  just his name is incredible    then I m not sure why you re bothering to engage in art at all  If art doesn t challenge you  disturb you to your core  then it s not doing its job   But he s a BAD MAN   people cry with horror   disgust  To which my response is  yes  of COURSE he s a bad man  my little leprechauns  That is the point  The language in this book is like the best tasting menu I ve ever savored  It is incredible   delicious   surprising   will long remain in my memory  I first saw Kubrick s film as a young teen and was transfixed by James Mason  I mean  who else could have been as lecherous   beguiling    I also completely thought Lolita seduced HH   felt not an ounce of sympathy for her  I didn t read Nabakov s book until my early thirties by which time the story had an entirely different meaning for me   Oh  Nabokov    Confronting  salacious  bold  daring and yet beautiful  You can t help but eliminate all judgement stemming from your morale but love Humbert and his relentless yearn for romance  Nabokov has accomplished something beyond a cult success with Lolita  Every book buff has to grab a copy   Brilliant  My new favorite classic novel The subject is rather touchy to the max  a middle aged man in love and obsessed with a 12 year old girl is enough to scare anyone off and enough to get me interested  I bought it when I first got here to Oz and it sat on my shelf for a few months until a few weeks ago Took me awhile to get through it  It s not the world s most thrilling book that you can t put down  but you did want to know how it was going to end  hence you keep going  I love the fact how there is no sex written in this novel  if there was  I must of missed it to how beautifully it was written  It leaves it up to your imagination Most importantly of course  it is well written  lyrically and beautifully written  And if you eat chocolate ice cream while reading it  then its just like heaven  In the end  I guess Humbert was really in love with Lolita and wasn t just a total pedophile   even though he was  what man goes around saying that young girls are nymphets  the character of Quilty was like what Humbert could of been  but wasn t  So yes  controversial  totally  But an excellent and well written and good book all up  As I m sure many readers were  I was staggered by the beauty and disgusted by the cruelty  H H  Is one of the most despicable  lovable  sympathetic and selfish characters I ve ever read  I found myself shifting from laughing out loud to wincing in pain mid sentence  Nabokov said that this was his love affair with the English language  and his believable romp across post war America brought his tryst to its full  lusty climax  Not recommended for fathers of 12 year olds with weak constitutions  The fathers  not the daughters  I definitely wouldn t recommend this for 12 year olds   My sin  My soul  Lo  Lee  Ta  Thus begins the most lyrical  beautiful  funny  horrifying and horribly sad novel of the 20th century  Nabokov s Lolita   a twisted love story between erudite pedophile Humbert Humbert and his beloved  nymphet   12 year old Dolores  Dolly  Haze  whom he calls  Lolita    is the only book I ve ever read that could make me smile  choke up and cringe at the same time  often on the same page  It s a must read for anyone who wants to learn how to create a distinctive character voice  and how to play with a reader s sympathies Humbert is nothing but distinctive  and he wins our sympathy even as he does unspeakable things  Nabokov never spells out exactly what Humbert is doing  or wants to do  to Lolita  His narration is so poetic  sensitive and funny that the reader doesn t realize his true intentions   the rape of a child   until he has won them over  We like Humbert  and see ourselves in him whether we want to or not  Don t get me wrong  Humbert is a profoundly sick man  and what he does to Lolita is monstrous  But Nabokov is such a great storyteller and a master of voice that Humbert has us from the first page  and we find ourselves rationalizing his crimes  We even find ourselves disliking Lolita  a crass adolescent who is  in her way  just as manipulative and selfish as Humbert  Nabokov has an insidious way of making us share Humbert s delusions  as he fools himself that his behavior is acceptable  even noble  we fool ourselves into rooting for him Unsympathetic characters can still win us over  provided they change and grow as people in a way that reminds us of our own journey  For all his sickness  Humbert genuinely loves Lolita  and eventually comes to understand the full  unforgivable wrongness of what he has done to her   This is in contrast to his rival for her affections  Clare Quilty  who sees her only as a piece of tender flesh   The last scene between them  in which he sees that she has outgrown him  is heartbreaking  That Nabokov can make our hearts break for a child molester is a testament to his genius and Lolita s power as a love story  even if it is a dark and ugly one  Dove finisce la perversione  l abominio e dove inizia l amore  Le due cose appaiono nel romanzo cosi teneramente e saldamente allacciate che staccando l una vediamo morire l altra Del suo vizio il professore costruisce un opera d arte  anzi si puo dire che coltivi il proprio peccato come la piu rara e preziosa delle orchidee e  pur essendo un anima infernale  muove il suo pugnale delicatamente  tracciando ghirigori fantastici nell immaginaria notte  sempre piu cupa  che tesse intorno alle esistenze di Dolores e di sua madre Charlotte Da quando Humbert Humbet entra in scena esiste nella sua mente un progetto incosciente e cosciente  ma il suo diabolico avvicinarsi alla bambina possiede il profumo di un fiore adolescente che si apre all amore Le sue pratiche di povero maniaco che non vuole  almeno all inizio  sfiorare la rosa che beve con tutta la pupilla  commuovono e disgustano allo stesso tempo A questo punto il romanzo assume i contorni di una complicata autodifesa dinanzi a una coscienza che sa di avere un pubblico  Egli infatti si definisce innocuo  inadeguato e passivo Chi legge ha l impressione di udire i battiti di un cuore innamorato  ma i sogni che lo avvolgono sono oscuri  terribili  La mente diabolica rimane allacciata a un anima di cerbiatto  delicata e fragile come cristallo Come ebbe inizio tutto  Il professore dice Lolita comincio con Annabel A tredici anni Humbert Humbert conosce una coetanea sulla Costa Azzurra  Il delizioso e innocente amore che lo avvince diviene un antro scuro e vellutato in cui addormentarsi  Morendo in quella stessa estate  Annabel lo chiude in una malia incantata e sognante  diventa la strega dei suoi ricordi  riempiendo quasi tutti gli spazi ombrosi e preziosi della sua memoria e avvelendandoli  finche una bellezza ancora piu radiosa non l avrebbe risvegliato del tutto  gonfiando  un azzurra onda marina dentro il suo cuore   Lolita incautamente riapre la ferita inferta da Annabel  ne fa sgorgare il sangue folle che la sommerge Per leggere la recensione per intero  QUI   Sublime  I m working real hard to find the right words to describe how I feel about this book It is not a book I would recommend to everyone  Actually  I would not recommend it to anyone  I believe people need to find their own way towards stories like this  because it will take you completely out of your comfort zone and you need to be willing to do it by yourself Since the very begining you need to understand what you are getting into  It definitely is not a traditional story  that s what made it so controversial in its years  and it would be now if it was released in this century  indeed   You ll find yourself reading the thoughts of an old man that s falling in love with a young girl  Some call him a pedophile with an obsession  I ll avoid those words  It will guide your imagination to a place that s not happy  but neither it is sad  It will be very uncomfortable  but at same time you won t want to take your nose off the book  Because  in the end  even if you know that something wrong is going on here  but at same time  you wonder why it is so wrong H  H  is a passionate man  He loves literature  and art  and french  and definitely loves Dolores Haze  He would do anything for her  in the begining  he does not want to hurt her  but his growing selfishness is blinding him  Humbert wants Lolita only to himself  but he can t see the mistake he s making Dolores Haze is  indeed  a dolor in the ass the most of time  Selfish  arrogant  shallow  That s Lolita  But she wants him  in the begining  she does  But Dolly gets tired very easily  and then her attraction for Humbert disappears  but she can t get rid of him now It left me thinking a lot the opposite personalities of these characters  He was so willing to do everything she asked  and she was making an actual effort to hurt him  Both realize that what s going on is not a good thing  for any of them  The first realizing it is Lolita and she wants to escape  but Humbert can t see it yet  In the end  he does  and he regrets what he s done to her The narrative is magnificent  What an educated man H H  was  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  There is nothing more satisfying than reading a well written book  Humbert was a very romantic man  there s no discussion about that The ending was perfect  another would have been so predictable  Actually  I thought that Humbert s passion towards Lolita would stop she grew up  but I was so mistaken  because obviously H H  would love Lolita until his very end To finish  nothing else to say that if you give this book a chance  do it with an open mind  it is not just the controversial story of an old man and a girl  Find the nooks  admire the narrative  and you ll know why this book is so good  This annotated version is excellent  Lolita itself is not what it appears to be   it is much better  If you want to understand what s going on  it s essential to have this annotated version  I read Lolita first  checking out a few of the notes  and then just decided to read the book but recording words I didn t know  I have gone back and gotten definitions from the dictionary and the notes  Then  I read the Introduction which offers the literary analysis that the reader needs  I m looking forward to re reading the book itself and probably checking out more of the notes this time   This book is so unique in the way that it pulls you in while the story line completely revolts you  The madness of the narrator is apparent from the very beginning  Nabokov s mastery of the English language and all of it nuances allows the imagery in the story to jump off the page at you  To call this book thought provoking would be a colossal understatement  After reading this I can see why it was on banned book lists  The story something that will resonate with every reader  OMG   I was so blown away by this book  I resisted reading it for years because it seemed so smary  It s anything but  The language  the wordplay  the literary tricks and games Nabokov plays are astonishing  I have just downloaded a 2 part lecture on Lolita from Open Yale U  and plan to re read the book but with the annotated edition   This is a totally weird sick strange story  No wonder this was banned in some countries    But I loved it I felt odd while reading this  In my sensible mind I know how sick the story is and that Humbert is middle aged and Dolores is just a child  I know that it is sick but somehow all the time I was on Humbert s side  At some point I realized I was actually hoping Lolita would just obey and they both would be fine  That made me think how well this book was written  It is awfully strange to realize that you are hoping that the pedophile gets the happy ending Anyways  I don t think this book is pornography  Or that it somehow changed me to think positively of those kinds of men  or women   no way  I wouldn t be surprised  though  if some people would judge this book based on the thoughts they get while reading  Or they would think that Nabokov somehow approves pedophilia  Obviously  that is not the case I m sure readers will have very very mixed feelings about Lolita  I loved it  I found the story mesmerizing  The language was playful and I felt like Humbert was dreaming in some parts  I can t really point out any specific reasons why I loved it    But I definitely think you should read it if you haven t done so yet  Thoroughly disturbing exploration of a man s cravings and exploitation of a young  pre teen girl Undoubtedly the most discomforting aspect of the book  and the most startling to my mind  is the sheer credibility  almost likability  of the central character Humbert Humbert  and his almost helplessness  despite the sinister nature of his desires   And no  of course I m not endorsing his behaviour  for those that like to take the rough end of any stick  Nabakov s courage in undertaking such a story is admirable  and the book succeeds in shining a humane light on a dark subject Absolutely worth reading  Lolita is my favorite novel  Hmmm  Sounds banal  put that way  I m tempted to both to gush and to sputter  but I don t think either would incline me to read a book I hadn t read  So I ll just say this  It s a book about a pedophile  which ought to make the bile rise in the throat of any moral being  One of the things I remember most about reading it the first time was how completely  and how shockingly  Nabokov succeeds in disarming our preconceived objections to his monster  When I read it then  I thought it was a story about a one sided love affair  And that s one of the stories it tells  It s perhaps the only book I know that demands to be read a second time in order to be appreciated fully  Other books benefit from a second reading because of the chance to linger over certain of their pleasures that we passed too quickly the first time in quest of plot  This is the case with Lolita  too  it has many favorite lines   charming bits of dialogue  But it has something more  Only  I think  when you ve read it once can you return to it and appreciate how carefully Nabokov has laid in the pattern of Humbert s downfall  only when you know his nemesis can you recognize him poking his head into the frame here and there in the most unexpected places  I m older now  and I ve read this book several times  And now I think my first analysis was shallow  I think Nabokov disarms us not to present us with a dissection of halved love  but in order to challenge us to see past Humbert s charm and convict him not because of the taboos he breaks but because of his cruelty and selfishness   Cruelty and selfishness  which we are all capable of      a weak solution of Marelene Deitrich      an ex convict s saturanalia with a couple of fat old whores      Who knows what heartbreaks are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a romp   4 5 StarsI mean really  how could I give it anything less  From a technical standpoint  Lolita is a masterpiece  Nabokov s prose is nothing short of surgical  and the man possesses remarkable precision  I ll admit  what drew me to Lolita was the dark and taboo subject matter   and Kaya s glowing review   This is a book entirely about one man s obsession with what he calls a nymphet  and Lolita herself is hardly even a character  I understand why  since Humbert doesn t care about Lolita at all  Instead  Humbert only cares about the fantasy he projects on her  and that s exactly what makes him so despicable and loathsome character  True  he s a pedophile  and his sexual interests are repulsive  but that doesn t make me hate him  There are other pedophiles in fiction who I ve emphasized with  Sergeant Hatred from the Venture Bros for example  is portrayed as a well meaning and kind man  who understand his impulses are wrong and struggles against them  I was also reminded of Kevin Spacey s character in American Beauty  who lusts after an underage girl before realizing his mistake  Spacey s character is not a truly perverted man  but instead a repressed and damaged soul  pathetically grasping for anything which could make him feel alive  What makes Humbert Humbert stand out as a terrible fucking human being is his apathy  H H  possesses a complete and total disregard for the feelings of others  He has no empathy  and never pays Lolita s emotional needs even the slightest bit of attention  He claims to love her but does nothing of the sort  His lust for Lolita is an affront to humanity and anyone who has ever been truly in love  He bastardizes every human connection and convention  all while boasting and speaking like the most pretentious English Major I ve ever encountered  He describes himself as handsome despite evidence to the contrary  and sees everyone around him as inferior because he knows some big words  It s Humbert s apathy which made this one of the most disturbing books I have ever read  If there s one scene which stuck with me it s a scene where Humbert tells Lolita her mother is dead  and we never see her reaction  Why not  Because Humbert doesn t care  It s been said that the best villains don t know they re villains  in which case Humbert Humbert must be one of the best villains of all time  Fuck you Humbert   It feels wrong to say I love this book  because of the subject matter  But  I do  The depth of the writing  the word play   fantastic  And in English  French  and Latin  The invented words  so clever  The plot of Lolita doesn t need to be reviewed  We know it Obsession  lust  unreliable narrator    This is my first reading and this book is going to stay with me  So many many layers to this story  I have read that there is an annotated version  Definitely will be on my list to read in the future  I have wanted to read Lolita for a long time  and it really surprised me  I vaguely knew the premise and honestly  I thought it was going to be a lot more graphic and outwardly creepy  However  the main character is a such a fascinating  unreliable narrator that the layers of his story and the unwritten side of Lolita s story  continue to peel back even after I finished the book  The literary allusions and language were incredible  Nabokov is one of my favorite writers hands down  Such beautiful sentences constructing a truly bizarre and disturbing account   Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita is not for the faint of heart  Unlike Humbert Humbert  the weak hearted and strangely likable narrator of the book  many readers might be stunned or turned off by the thought of pedophilia  and if not by the thought alone then by the detailed description of the love affair between the narrator and his  nymphet   However  this novel is much more than a sexually explicit piece of erotica  it delves into psychological and moral questions  revealing in a surprisingly sympathetic light the mind of a character that would typically act as antagonist rather than protagonist  The controversy of the novel runs deeper than the subject matter  Through the course of the novel one begins to question the narrator s reliability and eventually his likability as Nabokov opens up different perspectives on the subject while continuing to utilize only the voice of his narrator  Humbert Humbert  In reading this classic piece of literature even avid readers will find themselves challenged and entertained by the author s resplendent vocabulary  particularly stunning when you recognize that his first language was Russian  and the tongue in cheek tone that is pervasive throughout the novel  Lolita undoubtedly earned the controversy that surrounded it as well as its acclaim and designation as one of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century  It will test the mind and morals while also providing an entertaining read that will keep the brave reader hooked until the bare  bloody  brilliant end  Lolita I m not sure where I got the idea that this book was semi pornography     but nobody told me that it would be so dang funny  Or that it would take such delight in the English language  And  apparently  it s what all the smart people are reading  Loved it while it creeped me out at the same time  I don t know what the experience would have been like if I had read it instead of listened to it  Told in the first person and with the stunningly gorgeous language that Nabokov strung together  I can hardly imagine that this could be told in any other way  Jeremy Irons does it brilliantly  I find myself visiting this occasionally and changing my votes from  4 stars  to  5 stars  and back to  4 stars     My problem is the tag given to the 5 star rating here at Goodreads   it was amazing    I can t say that about Lolita if I m talking about the plot and how much I LOVED it and re read it  things like that The problem with Lolita is in the popular media starting with this book cover    a young girl wearing lipstick and bright red nail polish  So what s the aim  Those who had read this  I think  might get my point here The reason why this book is so hard to rate with this  it was amazing   tagline is because the controversial theme of the novel  But when reading it  you can t help but to admire what an amazing writer Vladimir Nabokov is  If you check any book listing  you ll find this is to be included  So why  here are several reasons  Spoiler is not included but if you find something I have added by a mistake please let me know   The movie makers may forget   even the 1997 film  starring Jeremy Irons  an actor I really admire  is pathetic   readers might be persuaded by the narrator TO FORGET  the fact that Humbert Humbert is  one of the most unreliable narrators ever written in the history of fiction   He is somewhat like Florentino Ariza in Gabriel Garcia Marquez s Love in the Time of Cholera  If you fall into the traps of these men  you are just like the characters they seduce in the novel  They commit crimes in the name of rationalization masquerading as  love They have the ability to charm the reader into sympathizing with their situations  Humbert in Lolita is a  view spoiler   pervert  a rapist  a child molester a pedophile and a murderer   hide spoiler   but he makes sure to charm seduce the reader with his wit  intelligence and verbal acrobatics and we sometimes ends of forgetting what he really does  he makes sure the reader will read his story till the end  and so far  I ve not seen a single review with readers stopped reading in a middle  out of disgust or fear or any other negative emotions  The other thing about this book is due to it s subject matter  at times  rather difficult to read but don t take it personally  Vladimir Nabokov is not sympathizing with a pedophile  It is not an exploration of Freud s psychoanalysis Nabokov seemed to have a very little interest in it and Humbert himself rejects it   it s not a study of the mind of a pedophile  in fact the novel has very little to do with the above  AS SHOCKING THIS MIGHT SOUND Humbert proves Nabokov s skill as a writer  It doesn t matter what the subject matter is  this is a master piece of the art of writing  Best way to read  Lolita  is to read between the lines  question Humbert s reading of events  Don t look at Humbert s  Lolita  observe Dolores Haze  she ll tell you everything  Nabokov has created a conundrum  a puzzle for the readers  He uses the best tricks of the language to tell the tale of his protagonist and this protagonist will get you  You ll hate him but you will read him but don t get fooled by him  that s when you will get irritated and rate low  I think  Recommended      fy lbdy

edition read by Jeremy Irons  who is every bit as good as you would expect   Nabokov is simply brilliant his depiction of the pedophilic narrator Humbert Humbert  somehow simultaneously deserving of both contempt and empathy  Truly a classic  Disturbing  lovely  tragic  and monstrous  Brilliant   I m now on my second reading of this book  having read it back in the sixties and of course it s much different this time around  I ve seen the Kubrick movie version a couple of times but not the newer one  Sue Lyon was definitely too old for the part but a girl young enough would have made it even more controversial  Also  this edition has an introduction by Martin Amis who is decidedly not the  illustrator   which the edition I first read did not have  It includes some spoilers so beware  I guess he assumes the reader has already read the book  True in my case anyway  Some impressions so far  HH a very sick  immature  controlling sexual narcissist but not evil  Also very funny  bitter  lyrical in his observations of people places things  Perceptive about post war American culture  Now at the end of the first half and feel already a kind of sadness for Dolores  now in the clutches of her new  parent   Of course we already know what her ultimate fate is to be I d forgotten  along with many of the other characters in the book  Why  As I was reading I realized that HH has a literary descendant in Ignatius J  Reilly of New Orleans  A fellow narcissist  Another observation    in the hotel lobby scene while HH is waiting for the pill to work  there s a brief confusion about someone named Braddock  Remember the hotel scene in  The Graduate   Now finished with this brilliant  sad and funny book  According to VN  his and other  fiction for him  exists only insofar as it affords me    aesthetic bliss    Nuff said  I felt the same kind of emotional spiritual high at the end of  Housekeeping    The Crossing    Felicia s Journey    Suttree  and  A House For Mr  Biswas  that I had at the end of  Lolita  I hope to read it again in a few years   Con el epilogo escrito por un Nabokov sin la mascara de personaje anonimo  me hizo apreciar mas su obra y simpatizar con sus ideas mas alla de su Lolita  The ending left me with a shrunken heart  This book is just BEAUTIFUL and I believe everyone should read it  Yes the plot is as a whole very messed up  but whether you like it or not  with Vladimir s magic of language you d feel like his thirty six year old man voice is on top of your head  flawlessly  and at the same time manipulatively  navigating you a reader through Humbert s life  I never really understood before why people would highlight sentences and make notes in the margins of books   in this book  there were so many passages that were so brilliant that I wanted to keep flipping back to read them again My favorite was this casual aside of blackmail vs   mauvemail  in the middle of this sentence  Then  figuratively speaking  I shattered the glass  and boldly imagined  for I was drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature  how eventually I might blackmail   no  that is too strong a word   mauvemail big Haze into letting me consort with little Haze    Brilliant  When I first read this book  it felt more surreal  and maybe I was more Quilti ed out myself  dissolute or unfocused and it all felt like a lustrous cloud of language  unforgettable  I thought  Now  to hear it again  and to hear Jeremy irons read it  the dramatic peaks were more clear  the voices  the characters  the tensions  Now I gotta see the Kubrick flick again    and maybe even the Jeremy Irons one  Lolita es una historia de amor  locura  pensamientos profundos y actos desesperados No es una novela que recomendaria a cualquier persona en cualquier circunstancia  pero sin duda  es un clasico muy recomendable  peculiar  complejo y polemico  La narracion en forma de memorias del personaje principal  el angustioso  torpe  sentimental y pervertido Humbert Humbert es un trabajo genuino y rebuscado por parte del magistral Nabokov  Incluso sus fragmentos de  lo que yo llamaria  delirante  y divagante   locura poetica gratuita  tienen su finalidad en la representacion del personaje y su mente de una manera excelentemente humana  sus inquietudes  aunque denunciablemente depravadas  son humanas aun en su perversion  En resumen  algunos fragmentos pueden desquiciar levemente al lector  impaciente  medio moderno  pero el total de la novela es lo suficientemente redonda para verme obligado a darle 5 5 estrellas como puntuacion  I love lolita  The story is fascinating and a genius piece of writing from Nabokov  The decision to make Humbert Humbert the narrator of the story was essential to the whole novel and really created that interesting conflict within the reader that makes things interesting  My biggest issue with the novel is how many people seem to misread this story  although obviously I do not support pedophilia or child abuse in anyway   This constant misreading of the tale as some type of  love story  is always really concerning to me as the only way you could maybe interpret love being present in Lolita is HH being in love with an idea he s created  and even then I think  obsessed  is a more appropriate word than  love    This time around I decided to try the audio version  narrated by  of course  Jeremy Irons  Utter perfection   This is one of my favourite books hands down  It reads like poetry  horrible manipulative poetry  This can be a difficult for some people because if they find themselves enjoying it they wonder if they re a little perverted  I just say no Humbert Humbert is trying to seduce you throughout the book into being sympathetic towards him and sometimes he does succeed so don t feel too bad  I will object to anyone who calls this book romantic love story whatever  you are demented and never speak to me  I first read this when I was 16 and it is still my favorite book  It s hauntingly beauitiful and really  the most romantic work that I ve come across  Pre Re Read Thoughts  It is time  after 14 years  for me to revisit this book Post Re Read Thoughts  Once again  this book has left me heartbroken   A friend of mine insisted that I add this to my library the very moment she recommended it to me  as I absolutely love reading new material  this book found its way into my eager hands a few hours later  I devoured it in less than a couple of hours and was left completely stunned A beautifully disturbing symphony of words  Nabokov s words are so lovely and they evoke so much  The subjective narrator added so much to it  Humbert s fragmented memories and sophisticated prose and yearning for the reader to sympathize with him    despite the fact that  at the end of the story  he described himself as a  maniac  who deprived Dolores of her childhood    was a sort of morbid beauty that I wish I could possess in my own  crappy compared to Lolita  writing  This book is so lovely  I recommend it to anyone who asks what my favorite book is   Deeply disturbing  I didn t think that I would like this book as much as I did  but I really loved it  It feels a little odd for me to say that I loved it though  because of the subject matter  but I found it haunting and beautifully written  I have a feeling I ll be reading it again in the future  There were so many moments that stuck out to me  particularly near the end when HH keeps making comments on Lolita s lost childhood  finally understanding how he had ruined a large part of her life   I stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope  to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background  and then I knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord   After moving in with a new landlady  and her young daughter  known as Lolita  Humbert Humbert becomes crazed in love and obsessed with Lolita  With no luck at love in his adolescent years  Humbert hopes to find love in and back from Lolita  Soon after a turn of events  Humbert and Lolita find it s just the two of them  with the open road in front of them  The two enter a love affair  where they soon find themselves on the run from the police  Nabokov has written pages that suck you in  details that give you vivid illustrations  and most importantly  leaving you wanting more at the very end  Personally  I never wanted to sit this book down  Lolita is for the readers who want such great detail  that they are able to imagine the characters and setting in their head  Another reason for the reading of Lolita  you feel like you know the characters and the thoughts going through their head  This book is well written  and for readers who crave twists and danger   In a word  Lolita was   exhilarating  I love the writing style  the characters  the plot  everything  Although I have to say I might have rushed through the book a little  making it hard to pick up all the joyous little details the writer is famous for  Passing over that  I think the whole theme of pedophilia was well done  It could have been explicit and nasty  but the writer made everything into an act of love  which is purely what the book is all about  The ending is somewhat heart wrenching  a little bit humorous  and tied the book together very well  I desperately want to know what became of Lo and Dick  as well as Humbert himself  Amazing book  Definitely need to reread later on more carefully  Should be on everybody s to read

nZran l nkm wjdtm knzan mkhfyan fy Hql lrb   One of the first books that I read that challenged boundaries and norms  It will always be one of my favourites because of that    This is going to be a short and spoiler free review because there are already tons of reviews out there and some of them are really good I just want to clearify 2 things to help anyone whos considering to read this book 1  What this Book is not This isnt a romanticization of either pedophilia nor a romanticization of a relationship between a young girl or child and an older men This doesnt glorify the idea of any Lolita esque type of girl 2 What this book really is The perfect excample for an unreliable narrator A verry well written novel and probably the only novel that will ever broach this issue so well  Any other novel that will atempt the same thing will either be a cheap rip off or just distasteful Reading this I recomend to just admire the style of writing and the genius of Vladimir Nabokov in creating this piece of world literature  False This is one of these books that are very irritating and very fascinating at once  which is a bewitching thing  I cannot stop reading it but while i am reading it  i am kind of freaked out by many passages  But i think it is kind of important to read stuff like this  where the protagonist does so many bad and weird things but you still kind of understand him  You know why he has to do what he does  And this is so irritating and that may be a reason for some people to hate that book   but i like it  And nice flowery russian writing style    Ahora hay que ser cientifico si se quiere ser asesino  Y yo no soy ni una cosa ni la otra    Vargas Llosa termina un articulo sobre esta novela diciendo que Humbert Humbert   personaje  narrador y uno de los protagonistas del libro   amo con la cabeza y sono con el corazon  El mismo H  H  dice e insiste  en mas de una ocasion  cosas como estas al lector    no omitas estas paginas esenciales  Imaginame  no puedo existir si no me imaginas   Mas de uno es el que asegura que no es una novela pornografica  Que ni siquiera llega a erotica  Y sin embargo  es provocadora en mas de una cosa   Y como no va a ser provocadora si la historia central   mas no principal   se pasea entre una jovencita norteamericana de doce anos y un cuarenton europeo que intenta cazarla  la caza  se  casan   se le va y finalmente la  caza   Que termina siendo su padrastro y hombrecillo   asi  en diminutivo    Ella  Dolores Haze o Dolores a secas o Dolly o Lolita o Lo  El  Humbert Humbert o Edgar H  Humbert o H  H  a secas     No somos demonios sexuales   No violamos como los buenos soldados  Somos caballeros tristes  suaves  de mirada perruna  lo suficientemente bien integrados para controlar nuestros impulsos en presencia de adultos  pero dispuestos a dar anos y anos de vida por una sola oportunidad de tocar a una ninfula  Hay que subrayarlo  no somos asesinos  Los poetas nunca matan    Un clavado en el itinerario del obsesivo pervertido padrastro incestuoso del profesor Humbert  Eso  asi  como un clavado  que toma vuelo para saltar  para subir y despues comienza a jalarlo a uno la gravedad hacia abajo  hacia al fondo y mas alla   Porque estara muerta y sera inmortal si ustedes leen esto   Y mientras uno recorre por todo esto uno se encuentra ademas con una que otra puntada  con mas de un chascarrillo linguistico o jugueteo de palabras  cosa caracteristica de Nabokov en esta novela   Trata tambien de como la decadencia suele terminar en algo patetico  Y si es patetico y se maneja con maestria  por lo tanto  termina siendo divertido  Lo digo por el final  pues me parece que para el lector    torcido    sera de los mas divertido  Y todo esto sin caer en el asunto moralino   Lo terrible de morirse   sabes   es que ya no puedes contar con la ayuda de nadie   Complex  funny and disturbing  with a little of that je nai sais qoi kind of wonderful that you get from immigrants  Lolita is quite possibly my favorite book  There is a sentence near the end of the book that is over ninety words long  and it distills much of the poetry  irony and pathos of the entire novel in one langorous image  If I was stuck on a desert island with only five books to read for the rest of my life  Lolita would have a golden ticket to be my lifelong companion   Even more astounding the second time  sighSigh Sigh  So good   It s my first time to read a novel for Nabokov and it wont be my last  Lolita is not at all as people describe it  pornographic novel   not in the least  The idea is quite out of the norms  but the narrative itself is not libidinous  Nabokov s style of writing is great  the way he presents a pervert is genius  It is psychological  so sometimes I pity Humbert  especially when he loses Lo  Annabelle  Dolores or what he creates as Lolita   I don t think I will ever get tired of this book It is indeed a love story  not between Humbert and Lo  but rather between Nabokov and the english language  maybe it s because I read it when I was very young  but I will always think that it is one of the most beautifully written books ever  It s light to read  it s charming and  to me  it conveys a range of emotions so perfectly written that  when I close my eyes  I m able even to smell the too sweet summery air  to feel the orange or pink tint in the pages  To me  it s a book that makes me feel warm  The story in itself is lovely  not because of the  love  in it portrayed  if that obsession could even be referred to as love  I guess I just like the fact that Humber tricks us into thinking that he s the good guy  perhaps in the same way he tricked Lolita  How he tries to deceive us by giving his tale a romantic filter when  in reality  the man knows that he is guilty  and feels very little remorse Villains are never hard to write  but good villains  the best villains  are the ones that trick not only the reader  but also the reader    And Humbert is one of the most miserable  pathetic and yet weirdly understandable characters I ve ever read  And Lo    I was around her age when I first read this book  which is probably why I could sympathise with her and  in a way  see the whole story through her eyes rather than Humbert s  and I think it made me see the novel in a completely different light than if I had been  say  a thirty year old man  Either way  Lolita is a charming book on charms  guilt  obsession  but NOT on love  And it s a work of art as well I ve tried finding books similar to this one  and so far  only Jeffrey Eugenides  Virgin Suicides has come close  not in the style of writing  but rather in the atmosphere created  If anyone could link me to any similar books  I d be suuuuuuuuuuuuper thankful   xx Instantly became one of my favorite books  Lovely  lyric use of language  Nabokov has a better grasp of English than most native speakers  I didn t know it at the time  but there was no doubt in my mind as I was reading this that it was written originally in English  The language is too good  and it is a thoroughly American book Lo lee ta  I finished my re read of this novel while riding on the subway  Next to my seat were two seats covered in ripped up pages from a magazine  I didn t notice what was on the magazines until the nearing the last chapter of Lolita  a couple entered the train and while moving the ripped up pages to sit down  discover the content in laughter and whispers   Hey man   did you see this   said the male counterpart to the couple said to me I turned to him to discover him holding up a torn piece of magazine with a photo of five  overweight individuals in their 50 s naked having an orgy  I can t say I did   I said smiling He took some of the other pages that his girlfriend was holding and begin showing them to me  They are all like this  How funny  And look  what are you reading  Lolita  What a crazy sex triangle going here  I laughed and continued reading  I noticed the woman put the pages into her purse before they got off  I finished the book two stops later  Also written in 2010  Looking back on this  my thoughts on Lolita have changed vastly  Nabokov s novel deserves another reading from me Lolita is a novel that is grotesquely funny  depressing  and aesthetically pleasing to the reader s eye  At times  it reminded me of Thomas Mann s Death in Venice and at other times  it reminded me of Titus Andronicus  The little Poe references helped to win me over as well This isn t an astute point  but Lolita is about Nabokov s obsessive love for the English language  He admits this in his afterword  And I think this is true for authors who speak English as a second language  There has to be true dedication to that language in order to write as masterfully as they do in it  I had a class on American literature once and we read novels by immigrants  Kerouac s On The Road and Maxine Hong Kingston s Warrior Woman  so we had a long conversation about exactly what makes one an American and what one does when they translate The discussion was never really finished  but what we thought was that to be an American  one has to be an immigrant so that one actually feels the process of trying to become American  As for translating  my professor was an immigrant himself and had translated other works before  he was from China   He told us that in order to translate  the translator must betray their language  Nothing translates well  Food translates well  music translates well  but language can never truly be translated  You lose the beauty of the original language  If I were to translate something from Japanese to English  the phrase would lose all heart and feeling that the Japanese language has  kimochi  man  kimochi   It s interesting  because eventually  Nabokov translated Lolita into Russian  In the afterword  Nabokov wrote   My private tragedy  which cannot  and indeed should not  be anybody s concern  is that I had to abandon my natural idiom  my untrammeled  rich  and infinitely docile Russian language for a second rate brand of English   So is he a traitor to the Russian language because he didn t write the novel with the intention of writing it in Russian and had to settle for a translation instead  Or is he a traitor to the English language for translating the beautiful English into Russian In the Russian translation of Lolita  Nabokov had a different afterword   Alas  that  wonderful Russian language  which  I imagined  still awaits me somewhere  which blooms like a faithful spring behind the locked gate to which I  after so many years  still possess the key  turned out to be non existent  and there is nothing beyond that gate  except for some burned out stumps and hopeless autumnal emptiness  and the key in my hand looks rather like a lock pick   It s kind of depressing  when you think about it The language is only one part of the novel  though  When I was writing out my notes  I started to think that Humbert was like Apollo in the story of Apollo and Daphne  It s an obsessive love that one never triumphs over  In desperately loving that creature  it takes away from the individuality of it  The tree is there  but Daphne has left the building  She s just a body and nothing more  And this is exactly what Humbert does with Lolita  In Reading Lolita in Tehran  Nafisi states that the women really identified with Lolita s character  And I think it s because their religious culture is one that puts the women on a pedestal to protect them and also to respect them  But in objectifying a woman s beauty  they re actually disrespecting their women  Humbert disrespects his ladies by respecting them  He holds Lolita up on a pedestal as this nymph of perfection  but she s not perfect and by seeing her as perfection  I believe she comes to realize her imperfections Yes  Humbert stripped Lolita of her innocence  but there s more to it than that  There s a moment in the book where Humbert is watching Lolita play tennis and he realizes that she could be great at it  but she never puts in the effort  The same is true of her schooling  She s a smart girl  but she s doing horribly in school mainly because she doesn t care for authoritative figures  good job  Humbert  and she never puts in the effort  Humbert s broken her spirit  She has no drive because Humbert s filled her up with everything that he loves and left her with nothing Probably most interesting though was that the hotel where Humbert first had sex with Lolita and the play she takes part in later have the same name  The Enchanted Hunter  The first mythological figure I thought of upon seeing that name was Artemis  who surrounded herself with nymphs  In fact  I think Daphne was one of Artemis  nymphs  I might be wrong  Either way  in the play  Lolita is allowed to become a Diana figure  a hunter  And it s interesting  because Humbert states that the play s message is that the only time when reality and fantasy meet is in true love  For Lolita  her fantasy is to be a hunter figure because she s been the hunted the whole novel  For Humbert  The Enchanted Hunter represents the moment for him when fantasy became reality As for the Poe references  I thought that the biggest reference was Humbert s narration  Ever since I first read The Tell Tale Heart  I ve been told   NEVER trust the narrator  NEVER   But I think that s a misunderstanding  In most of Poe s stories  the narrator is defending their action  It s not that the narrator is lying intentionally  but more of a self delusion and a need to get things straight with you  the reader  I felt the same way with Humbert  I don t believe that Humbert is a character who would lie to the reader  Self delusion  definitely  but lie to the reader s face  I don t think so   merinding  galau  nyeremin  but overall  keren  One of the greatest books ever written by one of favorite authors  His was genius  I was younger  see  there was this guy  named sean garrison  he was from he Ozarks  he was in Louisville and he was a just man  without a doubt  He once said he would fight anyone over the merit of Hank Williams or Robert Johnson  I feel the same about Lolita  Some consider this book too risque and disgusting  and granted the subject matter certainly is  yet Nabokov crafts an intense and psychological reading experience  I felt both drawn in and repulsed by the novel  but I couldn t stop reading it  This book is fantastically written and fantastically disturbing  It s definitely not for everyone   Does this mean I m crazy and demented      Y esta es la unica inmortalidad que tu y yo podemos compartir  Lolita   Que mas puedo decir Es simplemente brillante  nunca he leido un libro mejor escrito que este  el autor tiene una forma de embellezer con palabras hasta lo mas insulso e insignificante  Pese a que debido a su historia pueda parecer un libro vulgar  es todo menos eso  Es sin duda la mejor historia de amor que he leido  Espero con ansias leer otro libro de este autor pronto  While disturbing in many respects  the amazingly vivid and nuanced writing really puts this book on a pedestal  The book is more disturbing because of the author s thoughts and intentions than his actions  The material is rarely lewd  but still conveys a sense of deep depravity  It s a refreshing change in an era of Hollywood gore fests  And of course the book questions the meaning and legitimacy of love and a host of other big questions   I loved her  It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight   Absoloutly  wonderfully  f   ed This book gets me everytime  The content is so strong and  as I am drawn to aberrations  this novel is perfect  The language elevates this topic to art  It s enjoyable to see someone who has achieved what they have set out to do  much like Oscar Wilde s  only novel   Nabokov has achieved what he set out to do  At one point I owned a cassette tape of James Mason reading excerpts from Lolita  and I regret the loss of it    The book is well worth reading  and actually necessary since Sting makes a reference to it in Don t Stand So Close to Me  The movie version with James Mason and Peter Sellers is also a rollicking good time    I was so excited when my girlfriend bought me this book  I ve wanted to read it for a very long time  mainly due to the controversy that still surrounds it  even now It was well worth the wait  I positively adored this book  It s written in a detailed  poetic  beautiful way that made me not want to put it down  That being said  I feel disturbed by my enjoyment of this novel  He has made  nymphets  truly seem wondrous and alluring  His feelings are so raw  so passionate    a wicked kind of honest  Humbert s actions seem almost rational  his love pure  I often found myself forgetting that his Lolita was so young    when I was reminded  I was ashamed that I was hoping his plans would be successful  and that they would somehow find a way to be happy together I definitely understand the taboo surrounding this book  but in my humble opinion  that s what makes it so brilliant  I am so glad that I read this  Uno de los libros mejor escritos no del siglo sino de la historia  Si pueden abrir la cabeza y entregarse van a encontrarse con una maravilla  I feel stupid for even talking about this book  That is  I don t think I have anything to add to what s been said better by others more important  more insightful  more touched with talent  I ve read this book many times and it has always been a new old friend  I m choking  my fingers are choking at the keyboard  They want to write undiscovered words to describe how I feel about Lolita  Five pixelant stars seem an insult  Even the night sky s stars seem like faint praise   I ve been pondering how to rate Lolita for hours  It s safe to say I really disliked the story itself because it made me squirmy reading the thoughts of a perverted character  But  Nabokov is such a brilliant writer that I just sat here thinking about it and decided nope  I m not going to take off any points for the creepy factor  I am far too impressed by the writing  Doubly amazing that the book was written in English rather than a translation   the book that changed my life at 15  I had no idea that a writer could write like that in fact I still can t believe how good it is The plot seems unimportant as the writer takes you on a journey of lust  loneliness  a changing America and most of all his love of the english language  Brilliant  uncomfortable  lyrical  and morally ambiguous  You can t divorce the stunning quality of the writing and the dense network of allusions from the controversial subject matter  and yet discussions of the book tend to adopt one stance or the other  Either way  this is a remarkable piece of writing and a truly provocative   in both senses of the word   novel  The only Russian novel I ve been able to read   and it goes without saying that this is an absolutely marvellous book  Actually  marvellous  is too tame an adjective for this book   enthralling and brilliantly written  it ensnares you from the very first page  Truly the  Lolita magic  exists    Should have bought the annotated Lolita   sigh  One of the best masterpieces I ve ever read  Nabokov s tasteful skill in unfolding the inner psychology of a pervert is beyond imagination  My goodness  This was a most fascinating and challenging book  Superbly written   Nabakov had a glorious gift for prose    Lolita  could well serve as a perfect snapshot of mid century mid America  But the depth of character makes it far more  becoming a empathetic window into the utterly unempathisable  Wonderful stuff   This is my favorite book of all time  The end  Plain and simple  What makes it a work of art is not only the masterful control Nabokov has over language or the rawness of it  It is the fact that Lolita is an experience  The book takes you into private bubble  a world separate from reality  It is you and Humbert  alone together  agonizing together  scheming together  The intimacy of the reader s relationship with Humbert allows us to acknowledge as he does the wrongness of his perversion  and yet justify it and understand why and that it is an uncontrollable evil  Yet because we are so intwined in Humbert s thoughts  we can see that he is not a bad or evil man  He is a character in which we all can experience dark and deep desires and perversions in ourselves  We live in a world where they are acceptable with Humbert  He tests us  makes us delve not just into the soul of himself and Lolita  but into our own souls Lolita is an experience  A complete experience  That is the beauty of it  What makes a book or a film truly great  Catcher in the Rye  for example  has a very similar effect in that you and Holden are together and intimately attached so that you feel involved in the same thought processes as him  He brings you into his world so that you are on the ride with him  The same goes for films such as 127 Hours  Castaway and All is Lost  You are immersed in a world where nothing needs to be explained because you are there  you are one with the character and you are living vicariously through them  The characters somehow represent a part of every person and is relatable  This is the beauty of Lolita to me  It is one of the greatest  most genius books ever written in my opinion  By my favourite novel in the entire world so I m a biased reviewer  Nabokov s writing is everything  Humbert Humbert is everything even though you don t want to admit it  I will continue to re read this throughout my life and everyone should read it at least once  Nabokov s prose is beyond captivating and almost hypnotic in it s elegance  However  while it s easy to get lost in the sheer beauty of the lyricism in this breathtaking novel you re always consciously aware of the monstrosity that Humbert Humbert is  He continuously attempts to sway and manipulate the reader into almost sympathizing with his deluded justification of his own perverse actions  Saying that the writing style is admirable would be a vast understatement to say the least  From the poetic opening line you become entrenched and ensnared in the literary trap that Nabokov is ingeniously orchestrating  The closest analogy I can think of in comparison is that of a spider web in which you entangle your entire mind within it s complex design  What a stunning novel and one of the finest piece s of literature to ever be written  Any review of this work is obsolete because it is a book which needs to be read and experienced to immerse yourself in the startling and repugnant narrative  Over the course of the first part of the book I felt revulsion repeatedly and the vile thought s the main character was envisioning disturbed me to my very core  It was horrifying to imagine that such a delicate and innocent little girl was being left in the care of a despicable predator who was preying on her vulnerability and naivety  It wasn t an exaggeration to say I felt nauseated throughout  Despite the vulgarity of it  the way in which H H beguiles and intoxicates your mind with the setting often vividly describing  and beautifying the 20th century American surroundings is to devastating effect  It s easy to be become enchanted in Nabokov atheistically pleasing style   This book without a doubt is a masterpiece  I have never read a book that was so poetically inclined to do justice to such a taboo subject matter  The mixture of raw poetic descriptive verse in praise of Humbert Humbert s Lolita obsession is certainly striking and evokes the feeling of being inside the character s mind  We are literally transposed into the shoes of a very tragic and ultimately pitiful man who has a propensity toward girls of what we consider today to be an unripe age  Humbert s obsession borders beyond an obsession and becomes his sole purpose in life  To control his beloved Lolita as his rare possession and keep her for all of eternity consumes his very soul  It gets to the point where he worships Lolita as a sort of muse goddess  His descriptions of the raw passion he has for her coupled with the shameful way that he takes advantage of her is the main plot of the novel Along the way we view the world through Humbert s eyes as the people around him are manipulated  conned  and used  all for the sole purpose of keeping his true nature undisclosed  He views certain people as dull and drab and gray  Lolita seems to be the only one in his life who can acquire his artistic brush s colors  Humbert paints her with words so delicately and flowering  He gives Lolita the sole novel s purpose of color  As if colors for Humbert are truly only viewed in the person and spirit of Lolita  every other character being sort of just background noise to Lolita s symphony  Along the way Humbert lets us in on how he believes to have first developed his propensity towards young girls  The spirit of his Lolita was first glimpsed on a seaside long ago evoking poetic notions of Edgar Allen Poe s Annabel Lee  The novel ends in a tragic way which I will not reveal due to spoilers  but ultimately Humbert reaches a deep realization This book was a book that I had to read since it always came very highly praised from all kinds of friends and literature circles  I had to read it in order to see if the hype is justified  Suffice it to say  the hype is justified  Perfectly fascinating    Fascinatingly perfect    Loved  loved this book  Whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers  his fate is fixed in our minds  and similarly  we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and compose the immortal music that would clash with the second rate symphonies he has accustomed us to  Y will never commit murder  Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us  We have it all arranged in our minds  and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him  Any deviation in nthe fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical  We would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor  the retired hot dog stand operator  if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen   Humbert  you swooned to records of the number one throb and sob idol of your coevalsLo  Of my what  Speak English    Humbert  I am your father  and I am speaking English  and I love you  I know these are certainly not the most often quoted lines from Lolita  but they do define a large part of my feelings towards this book  The way Humbert speaks or should I say the way Nabokov has written Humbert  you will find yourself echoing the sentiments highlighted in bold  in the above quote  especially if you aren t well versed or have never ever learned french   a language that is used in H H  vocabulary quite often  A fact which can make you go crazy I won t need to of course state the plot of this book   everyone does know it  What I can write about this classic is only my thoughts and feelings towards it So here goes nothing     I don t clearly recall when was the first time that I heard about Lolita   only that it left an indelible impression on my mind ever since I learned of it before I had even read the book  Why  of course because it was talked about in hushed whispers  something which makes even the most mundane conversation interesting and worth eavesdropping  Not that it was my intention to eavesdrop  all I remember is two girls  older than me   in their teens  giggling and talking in hushed tones about this book they managed to get their hands on   a book mommy and daddy expressly prohibited them from reading  I was with a friend of mine searching for a volume of the latest Nancy drew or perhaps Hardy boys from a local library when I overheard the conversation  And perhaps I was eight or nine  and it seemed fascinating to me that anyone  parents would prohibit them from reading a book  any book   since parents mostly complained of their kids not reading enough   wasting their time playing video games or watching TV and such From then on I had this morbid fascination to read Lolita   which I realized only about now  Sure I saw the movie version featuring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain but until now had never picked up the book Reading it the first thing that comes to my mind is I loved Nabokov  I hated Nabokov  I love that I hate him and hate that I love him  Ugh  quite a mess  but that I suppose is what Nabokov intended to do with his readers when he wrote this book  He intended to mess up with their heads The reason I hated Nabokov   I never had taken 9  yes 9 days to read a book of only 320 pages    The often used french drove me crazy until I found a solution to my troubles as I came across an annotated version by Alfred Appel Jr  the man came as my savior when I was about to throw the book or probably rip it to shreds and burn those later  Okay I wouldn t have been that dramatic but I surely would have thrown the book and abandoned it had it not been for Mr  Appel  help  So THANK YOU Mr  Appel  You made my experience of reading Lolita easier  As I mentioned earlier  Lolita in her frustration echoes the feelings of this poor reader The reason that I loved him   the humorous way Nabokov has explored and written this dark and fascinating subject of course repugnant to even think about  A man in his late thirties  as per my guess  being sexually attracted towards a child and later as her step father having an incestuous relationship with her  As frightening is the subject of this book  as charming is Nabokov in his prose and in writing these characters  A self centred brat and a perverted filthy man  who in their own rights are iconic characters  If this isn t a feat than I don t know what is  How else is it possible that lines like these not only enchant you but also strike a terror within you at the same time   I  on my part  was as naive as only a pervert can be  Humbert as the book  narrator is a monster  he is maddening  he is infuriating and yet he can be quite the joker  especially when he comes up with lines like this one  And when  by means of pitifully ardent  naively lascivious caresses  she of the noble nipple and massive thigh prepared me for the performance of my nightly duty  it was still a nymphet s scent that in despair I tried to pick up  as I bayed through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests  This book has been universally banned and acclaimed at the same time featured as it is on the lists of best books ever written  only because it boldly crosses into the territories  civilized society dare not discuss  things not deemed fit to be even mentioned  People would rather shove it under a carpet than believe there can be Lolitas and Humberts among them  I cannot comment more on this book since I do not consider myself proficient enough to comment on the genius that is Vladimir Nabokov or the brilliance that is his creation Lolita  I can thank him for writing a book that has made an everlasting impact not only on me but every reader out there  who has picked this classic up in whatever way that it did  No person can be universally loved or hated   for every monster there are followers  for every do gooder protesters and haters  Mr  Nabokov just about touches every sphere out there with his book   he maybe loved or he maybe hated  but he cannot be ignored  All I can say in the end is reading Lolita has been an enrichening experience for me This review can also be found at My Blog At first  I was applaud at the subject matter and felt as if I shouldn t be reading it in public spaces  such as on my morning commute  As I continued reading  the beautifully written novel engrossed me in its tale  I started to sympathize with HH and feel like Lolita was in the wrong  Although for me in the end  I felt that Lolita was right in her actions  which made HH a sad  old man  I definitely need to re read this though because I did not pick up on the hints Nabokov wove into the book as to the identity of the man chasing the two  My favourite writer and my favourite book ever  He is extraordinary author  a really unique style   Possibly the best one  Firstly  after reading this    I can t believe that English isn t Nabokov s first language  Even as a monolingual English speaker  I know I ll never be able to write like that  As cliched as it sounds  you honestly do feel like you re inside the narrator s head as you read this  There were quite a few French phrases in the text that I didn t understand  but I looked them up  thank you Google Translate  and they did seem to fit well with the narrative  Lolita also contains some made up words  but given the context in which they re placed  you can understand their meaning perfectly   even to the point where you wonder why they re not formally recognised words  I knew that this book was meant to be shocking  but honestly  I didn t feel particularly horrified or disturbed by anything in it  I don t know whether that s because it s been half a century since it was published and the book naturally lost its shock value over time  or because I ve just been desensitised to these sorts of topics  At the same time  I don t think this detracted from the plot  The interesting thing is  and as many others have pointed out   you actually start to feel sorry for the narrator despite the fact that he s a paedophile  It really is a testament to the quality of the writing that you empathise with Humbert Humbert in any way at all  This is my favorite novel Nabokov s story is twisted and unsettling  He will take you to the most uncomfortable places and hold you there  But  what is perhaps most shocking  is how comfortable you can become with what he is writing about  Through his mastery of the English language  it is hard to believe that he is accomplishing all of this in a non native language  he suspends all of the biases and prejudices of his readers and opens up a new  literary world of possibility  Without the confines of society to check us and tell us what is black and what is white  we can climb into H H  s mind and engage in sympathy  perhaps even empathy  if such a thing exists   This book made me laugh and cry and question  While I think it unlikely that anyone would be naive enough to draw the actions of these characters into the real world and develop tolerance for pedophilia  I suppose that would be the greatest fear surrounding the novel s potential readership  Well  I don t see a thoughtful person falling into such an obvious trap  As such  I feel comfortable saying that I believe H H  to be the most tragic romantic character I have yet to encounter  I wanted him to succeed though I could see his task was vile  And when he spoke the words   I loved you  I was a pentapod monster  but I loved you  I was despicable and brutal  and turpid  and everything  mais  je t amais  je t amais   I could resist no longer and tears fell into blurring puddles onto the pages of my beloved book We should all work through these pages  Una novela diferente y con una tematica tabu  Comence a leerla pensando que seria una novela de tematica trivial pero conforme lei las primeras paginas note que era una historia poco convencional pero muy interesante sin duda   For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aestetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm  There are not many such books   Lolita IS such a book  Read it  I would normally give Lolita a 4  it s fascinating and deeply disturbing  but not at the top of my personal list   but the annotated version is such an improvement on previous editions  It can be a little note heavy sometimes  but it is much clearer than other translations and annotated versions I ve read   This is my most favorite novel of all time  Easily   When i first wanted to read the book  it was out of curiosity  as i love so called  shocking  or controversial reads  When i started reading it  it felt like reading some horror novel     The main character or pervert is disgusting and twisted  He sees little girls as  nymphets   which is obviously wrong and just weird  I thought to myself that i am going to put this book down and not read any further  Never the less  i continued  As i progressed  i could see the story  the bigger picture more clearly  The writer is a genius in the style of his writing and the the emotional output of his characters  The theme is daunting and is shocking  but i really started enjoying the book the further more i got into it  I finally read it through  Funny enough  as i was reading the last few pages  the 1962 version of the movie came on TCM on TV  which i watched  The book clearly has more detail and longer story line  At a certain point you dont know if you should feel sorry or sick by the Humbert  He is clearly deranged  and has a weird point of view of life  but also an interesting one  Lolita is another character altogether  she is a bit wise beyond her years  but youthful  which i think attracted him to her  although he was always a pedophile  In a nutshell  the book is great  shocking  Yes  But i now have sense of what they think and how they trap their victim  Lolita was one  but at the same time  she gave into it     I m not sure entirely what to make of it  It was well worth reading  definitely not everyone s cup of tea  as the theme is obviously something different  But i loved the story  and the characters were vivid  dark and interesting  The plot was good  and ending was great  The afterword by Nabokov is awesome as he explains it  The writing is just pure genius  Well written  and great  Wichard  This is the kind of novel that becomes more powerful as I cogitate after finishing it  I  like the typical reader Nabokov decries in his afterword  expected that the sensual and sexual scenes would escalate throughout the novel  so I was surprised after the first third of the book  when Humbert s desires for his 12 year old stepdaughter fade into the narrative background  I think this relates to human nature regarding anticipatory sexual and romantic encounters  once a desire has been consummated  so to speak  the actual fulfillment is not as poignant as the initial craving was  Only after the novel reaches the point which most offends its readers can Nabokov move forward to the true content of his story There is an obsession here with immortality through art that I was not expecting  Humbert mentions multiple times that if the readers do not imagine him  if they do not imagine Lolita  then neither he nor his nymphet exist  Only in thinking about this did I agree with Vanity Fair s claim that this novel is  the only convincing love story of our century   Humbert s quasi incestual rape of Lolita grows into a deep  albeit unreciprocated  love that starkly differs from the love most humans experience  I do not think Nabokov could have portrayed the depth of Humbert s despair with a typical love story  I was also impressed with the depiction of the American landscape  Having begun and given up on On the Road twice now  I am now wanting to try it again based on Nabokov s use of the road trip to comment on the similarities between America s beautiful though repetitive natural scenes and the cultural void as seen through meaningless roadside attractions and one thousand dingy motel rooms  all the same to Humbert in the end  as long as he has his chance to be with Lo  Nabokov skillfully uses Humbert s apparently pleasant personality to draw the reader into believing Humbert s version of his story  his case to the jury   Though he clearly despises himself at times  he also tries to lead the readers into believing Lolita enjoys her life with him  because he wants to remember her as enjoying it  Only occasionally does Humbert slip up and reveal how miserable Lolita is  reminding the reader what a monster our humble H H  is  Not many authors can manipulative their narratives so well to achieve a necessary impact  The English major in me immediately began searching for scholarly articles about Lolita  despite Nabokov s assertion that there is no moral  no symbolism  and no ultimate hidden meaning in this work  Arbitrary connections do not illuminate literature  but understanding even some of the literary allusions Nabokov is drawing upon  how I wish I had read an annotated copy   augments the beauty and genius of his narrative  I would recommend this book for those who appreciate literature  and who can look past the idea that this book is immoral because of its basic plot   Subversivo  provocador  repulsivo  maravilloso  Clasico imprescindible  Resena completa http   www libros prohibidos com vlad    To think English was his second language and he was able to write with such luminescence without it ever being forced or fussy    What can I say  I ve read this book 5 times now and it gets better every time I read it  Do not get caught up in the fact that Humbert Humbert is a pedophile  Remember that the book is about Lolita  not him  That s why her name in the title  Not only would Humbert Humbert want you to remember that but Nabokov as well  If you find yourself feeling disgusted that you re sympathizing with a pedophile take a step back and realize that that is the point of what Humbert Humbert is writing   it s a rationalization for his actions  Think of him like Satan in Paradise Lost coaxing you over to his side  Another piece of the puzzle and perhaps my favorite is that Nabokov wrote in the introduction of one of his other books  Despair  Hermann  the main character in Despair  and Humbert are alike only in the sense that two dragons painted by the same artist at different periods of his life resemble each other  Both are neurotic scoundrels  yet there is a green lane in Paradise where Humbert is permitted to wander at dusk once a year  but Hell shall never parole Herman  Nabokov knows his creation well  There is a place in Lolita where you see why Humbert is paroled from Hell once a year  This is the one place in the book where Humbert shows his humanity and perhaps the most important point in the book I could also go on and on about how wonderful the prose is but I think others have covered this topic better than I have  Una historia de amor tierna  perversa  contada por uno de los mas entranables canallas de la literatura    Ah well  there it is  Can you imagine that  Lolita  and Pasternak s  Doctor Zhivago  fought for first and second place on the New York Times list for over a year  Hard to imagine in these days of Glenn Beck writing a blockbuster  novel  Whether or not this is Nabokov s  best   it s his most immediately gripping and accessible  an almost perfect balance between the author s distinctive  authoritative voice and the superb telling of the story  Don t worry about the theme of adolescent sex  it s not really about that  it s about character  will and the ruination of a soul who chose that ruination over salvation  Hay libros buenos  Hay libros malos  Hay obras maestras  Y luego esta Lolita   This is the most beautiful narrative I ve ever read  The content   shocking   and that s why it works so well  We are lulled by the voice of Humbert who seems so very convincing that the reader  ALMOST   feels he is right  A terrifying peak into the mind of a very perverse individual  Definitely worth a read once  As a writer myself  I was never so permeated and influenced in my voice by any other writer more than Nabokov  except Henry Miller   It have a wonderful humor to it  It has scenes that will permanently imprint themselves in your head  scenes that are usually insignificant to any other writer  Nabokov finds a metaphor in anything from a layer of dust on a table to a simple twitch of an eye  tey come from every corner of each page   My dear friend Moody recommended this to me  and I haven t yet read a book by one of the famous Russian novelists that I didn t greatly enjoy  This is no exception  it s simultaneously perverse and hilariously satirical while it also hits close to home for anyone who s been deeply  and unhealthily  in love  I especially appreciate how multifaceted the characters are Lolita is a dense read  but worth the effort you put into it  David Mitchell says it best  Lolita is an act of seduction  This is a lovable rogue  you think  this Humbert Humbert  How interesting life is in his company  Then there s a place where  toward the end  and this is one of the most chilling scenes in English literature  he realizes that Lolita has lost her magic  She s not the pliant young fairy she once was  But it ll be OK  he thinks  because I can have a daughter through her and start all over again  That s when you know you ve really been had here  this Humbert figure is a damaged  dangerous piece of work  and you ve been riding along happily in his car for a hundred and fifty pages  Somebody call the cops   Written with unfathomable passion   I bet Lolita won t leave my mind ever   Loved it  His use of language is masterful  Very funny at times  Troubling at others  Wish I d read it years ago  This review s going to be tricky to put together but I ve finally gathered my thoughts and gone over in my head what I really think about this novel  It s a masterpiece of its time  A time when topics like these weren t as scandalous as they are in today s world  and when they were swept under the rug and given the hush hush to it  This is one of the saddest books I ve ever read  It will really play with your mind  and I think there s no right or wrong perspective and there s no one way to think about it  It s just one of those stories that acts pretentious but has a layer of identity under it all  The writing style is difficult  I m not going to lie  Unless you re a literature major  or a brainbox  you re going to find it very hard to get through this book without looking up every two words  But it s all about the characterisation for the reader to get comfortable in Humbert s mind  Then the vocabulary takes a slightly new turn when Lo is introduced  and from there it s a mindfuck  There aren t words I can verbalise to describe what the book is really about and why it s classed as a classic work of genius   it just is  Somehow I sailed through the film  the 1997 version  I loved every second  and it s very faithful to the novel  Humbert Humbert was a monster  plain and simple  But two years ago I would ve summarised him as a tortured writer  His back story is very empathetic  and he is pretty humorous too  so much so that you forget this man is a criminal and you have to remember to hate him Lo isn t so innocent  I place her as a devious little vixen  and she knew what she was doing all along  but her age  and obsession for Popsicles and also  her unhinged questionable twelve year old behaviour offers the reader the idea she s just a poor baby Angel that had been abducted against her will with no mother in her life to hold her back  See the toughness  It s the hardest thing ever to have an opinion concerning these characters because they re all so likeable yet so flawed  It s a brilliant work of art to be able to do that  We usually just pin these characters up as good or evil without second thought    sigh as I drink a sip of tea  I m still getting my head around it and it s been a couple of years since I ve read it  This is a type of novel you won t forget and your mind will whisk over and over  wondering what the true statement and point of this book is  A brain shiver  Instant and forever classic  I plan to re read it in the annotated version in a few years  Chilling  haunting and sad Also  one of those openings to a novel that is so iconic  the words stay with you  Nabokov s Lolita became my favourite book while I was reading it and immediately after I d finished it  The controversial subject matter is interwoven with Humbert s almost lyrical use of language to achieve a result that does not mask the taboo themes as such  but makes the reader overlook them initially  We are invited into the mind of a pedophile and subsequent murderer  which could have ended up in a vulgar book  but Nabokov s romantic approach is laced with dark humour and clever prose   Probably the best written book I ve ever read  Like an orgy of metaphors and allusions and alliterations and imagery  I can t believe someone can write with so much richness in a language that s not their native tongue  Hilariously satirical and darkly comedic about a very controversial subject  so convincingly and multidimensionally depicted from Humbert s point of view  you d almost think it wasn t fiction  So engrossing it makes you question and doubt yourself and how you feel and react as you read  as literary masterpieces should do  Simultaneously anti Freudian as well as revealing so much about human psychology  in Humbert and in reader   As humans  despite possessing the aspect of rationality  we succumb to the senses   which could be considered as a weakness we also possess  at the least  which might be sensible to consider that it is with the human nature to satisfy the senses  Happiness  though surfaces with a person s nature  it transcends to many layers within the human  with the senses being at the foci of the surfaced happiness  It is not amusing to regard that  every human s ecstatic moments are relinquished with the secretly enjoyed sins  when the self wholly indulges into them to take the joy out of these without any prejudices n inhibitions whatsoever Yet  it is also amusing that we as Humans  detest many of these moments of others  without going into the inner details  as we are not equipped with the experience to understand the feelings   Is it fair to do so     LOLITA   as your tongue flutters thrice with the phonetic pronunciation of this word  as put wonderfully in the very first sentence of the book   is an example of the above mentioned Human ecstasy  endured and experienced  which becomes the central theme of the book  projecting the idea that  LOVE is beyond the ethical understanding of human rationality  beyond the realm of moralities that define life and the attributed legalities and law  Beautifully crafted by  Vladimir Nabokov   this book is a narrative by Humbert Humbert  HH    a pedophile and his despicable love towards a nymphet named  Lolita    I hesitated to read it as I never liked the idea of a PEDOPHILE   So  I don t get shocked with people s opinions that this book is a trash and its about a psychopath     I reluctantly picked this one  which challenged my deep opinionated mind about the book life  according to me is a pursuit and a conflict between good and bad  which lie with in us    We never do what we feel as bad  Yet  those we act with the belief that they are good  but still feel as bad because it isn t accepted by the society  So should we betray the self or betray the so called established laws of the society     Don t we break the laws  conveniently and give a reason  in the most convincing manner to convince the society and often the self  Well  thats exactly what HH does in the book Its definitely not a conventional love story  yet the underlying foundation is the same like any other person would perceive the love   honest  passionate  obsessive  intense and sometimes aching  Indeed  no love is complete without the pangs of pain it gives   And  yes  the of LOVE OF HH cannot be faulted to the end  as it has got all the elements  This is a book that can potentially haunt you  Yet  make you think about it  There are moments where you are taken aback  moments where you laugh because of the morbid humor and above all  puts you in awe   ALL THE TIME with the brilliance of its proseThere is much more than the horrifying idea of a pedophile and a nymphet and the associated disturbing elements  and the nature of the characters  at the surface level   in the book to fall in love with  The adept in the skill of the prose  makes anyone surrender to his magical ability to play with words At places  I felt so awestruck that I felt whether the book I m reading is real or is it just an illusion of a beautiful art   And I realized that its definitely the most Poetically written book I ever read At the end you feel for the character of HH   and his uninhabited passion towards LOLITA   Yes of a Pedophile n I ain t joking   Each page in this book left me in awe  excitement  Its a MUST read for all those people who just not love to read  but LIVE to read    makes them delightful and give them infinite joy that cannot be shared and just be within themselves all through the life    The one measure of any book  of anything for that matter  is the transformation it can create in the self from absolute detest to being in horribly love with it    Thats exactly what this book has done to meFor me  LOLITA is a book that is seductively beautiful  shockingly addictive n sinfully passionate  There s a reason this book is a classic  A brilliant and twisted commentary on the modern immigrant and his growing sense of blameless entitlement brought on by American culture  Although  anyone who tells you that Lolita is the manipulative antagonist of this story is probably an asshole   I feel a little sacreligious giving Lolita the same rating  five stars  as I just gave the Bible  but it s really really good  Nabokov is brilliant at creating dual perspectives  one through Humbert Humbert  the creepy narrator  and one that s a more omniscient perspective  though which you can read between the lines and see how absolutely off his rocker Humbert is  even though he s the one narrating  Does that make sense  It s good  Read it   This is it for me  The pinnacle of modern literature  The fact that English is Nabokov s third language continues to blow me away On the flip side his control of languages enables him to create words  to really mold words to fit his needs  I could go on and probably will later Lo Lee Ta  say it   This is an amazing book  Obviously the pedophilia aspect is not enjoyable to contemplate  but Nabokov writes beautifully  and ironically   And while Dolores  aka Lolita  is not a nice person  I am amazed that the popular perception of Lolita is that the young girl is a sex crazed teen who seduces a vulnerable older man when in actuality the older man kidnaps her and bribes her for favors  I had been shying away from reading the book  As the mother of a 3 year old daughter  I was concerned about the subject matter  Several of my Bookish friends  however  told me that the story was excellent and to give the book a try  Wow  am I glad that I did First  Nabokov s writing is absolutely exquisite  I was in awe of the richness and depth of his ability to use the right words to describe what goes on in the head of a pedophile  Yes  Humbert is an unreliable narrator and an abomination to humanity  but Nabokov does an excellent job of having Humbert tell his side of the story  The modern day notion is that child molesters were molested themselves as children  but Nabokov s approach through Humbert was that Humbert is who he is because of an unfilled love that he experienced at the onset of puberty  Humbert uses this experience as the basis to self rationalize his abhorrent behavior by also making Dolores  aka Lolita  a willing partner in his physical relationship with her  In Humbert s mind  he is the middle of the greatest love affair ever know to man  but the reader knows that he is an outright sexual abuser  How so  Well  Humbert gives the reader everything that she needs to know that Humbert is a molestor  which starts on the very first night  when Humbert drugs Lolita prior to his having sex with her  There is no confusion in this book that Humbert is not a reliable narrator  but at the same time  Nabokov is able to give the reader the real story as to what happened to Lolita by having Humbert provide certain information along the way  In the event that the reader has any doubt that Humbert is a liar  Lolita says it all at the end when she tells Humbert that another man had broken her heart  but that Humbert had  broken her life   I found Nabokov s approach to Humbert s justification for his conduct to be much more creative and nuanced than most stories nowadays  which is   I was hurt  and now I hurt others  Second  Nabokov understands that less is more  Frankly  I am tired of all shock contemporary literature that is out there with their gruesome depictions of gang rapes and rest room blow jobs  I want to feel what s going on in a story and not be knocked over the head with disturbing imagery  which is what I am generally left with after reading those types of books  Nabokov made me extremely uncomfortable and sickend by what happens to Lolita without going into detail about what Humbert was doing to her  Using a phrase like  stained and dirty sheets   tells me all that I really need to know as an intelligent person  while making me extremely uncomfortable to boot  I believe that this type of writing is a true talent of Nabokov s  His genius is in his ability to get the reader to make her own connections and to fully become entrenched in the story through her own feelings  thoughts and ideas  Nabokov takes the reader on his  and Humbert s  journey in a subtle way that makes the reader feel her own sense of involvement As you can see  I really loved this book  The story is the story  and a very tragic one  but the real enjoyment that I had while reading it was going on the ride with Nabokov  I cannot wait to read more of his books in the future  He is on his way to getting on my favorite authors  list One more thing   I listened to the story on audio  which was read by Jeremy Irons  and he was fantastic and captured Humbert to the tee  I would highly recommend going with this approach if you enjoy audio reads  It was a freak accident  really  picnic  lightning   that brought me to read Lolita  but I m thankful every moment that I did  Nabokov is a master stylist  Each sentence a diamond  each paragraph a stanza of poetry  We know the story is a deposition of some sorts written by a murderer with a penchant for fancy prose style  With that being said  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  Lolita  is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns   I found the writing exquisite  with many many beautiful similes and allusions  Nabakov had a wonderful command of the English language I agree the popular view that Humbert was a misogynist  told mostly through his treatment of the women in his previous relationships  A sociopath with no empathy for anyone else  interested only in satisfying his own desires  and I think this was partly what made the book uncomfortable reading  It is nigh on impossible to empathise or feel anything for him as a narrator and character within the story  I disagree with the view some have that he was not a victim  however  I think Humbert was a victim  not of a predatory nymphet  I see Lolita as completely blameless throughout   but of his own obsession for Lolita  which ultimately ruined his life and brought about his downfall  The relationship with Lolita did change him   the first person he seems to have treated well  and with an element of respect  was Rita  who he hooked up with during his search for Lolita  It was as though his obsession had overwhelmed the old Humbert  and indeed he treated Lolita and her husband well too  once he finally caught up with them  None of this  of course  exonerates him in any way  and his end was an inevitability that had to see him in prison I am very glad to have finally read the novel  and the story will stay with me for a very long time  I think  Don t let the subject matter put you off  This is a masterpiece  How many writers could create a novel whose main character is a pedophile  a snob  and a self described monster  and whose secondary character  Lolita  is a conniving  selfish  and  we later find out  less than innocent girl woman  The language is a wonder  Funny and always compelling  If you haven t already done so  read it   Nabakov s utterly breathtaking prose narrated by the most despicable character in the history of literature   Humbert Humbert s life is a sad tale of a very disgusting man  but his eloquent way of speaking  his ironic outlook on life will make you turn the pages very quickly From a style perspective  this is the most aesthetically valuable book you can have on your shelf  Also  3 all time on Modern Library s Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century  A must read  lolita terbit di Indonesia tahun 2008  melihat kontroversi yang mengiringi kemunculannya sungguh membuat terpesona dan novel ini ditulis berdasar sudut pandang dari seorang lelaki  novel yang memang tak lekang oleh apapun  I have currently been tackling Proust s In Search of Lost Time and decided that if I really wanted to read about love s obsession I may as well go to the pinnacle of this type of literature and read Lolita   I started this with a few preconceived notions but tried to keep an open mind How can one so loathe a character and a subject matter yet love the book  It s the writing of course  Nabokov takes a sinister and contentious subject and let s you into the mind of a man completely obsessed with what he calls nymphets but never does Nabokov make it a judgement  He let s his main character  Humbert  slowly reveal himself as what civilized people would call a monster  The person that you initially found yourself relating to becomes abhorrent to you instead Humbert is rife with self delusion during a good majority of what he does  He sees his love reciprocated and even suggests that she had seduced him  He is relentless with his desires and while it is rape he sees it as love  So it surprised me that he did show remorse for how he had perverted his little Lolita in the end  Still  he is a monster and a murderous one at that If you can get past your revulsion for the main topic of this novel you will discover some very powerful and wonderful writing  Infamy cradles Lolita much tighter than Humbert Humbert ever could  The novel is the erudite  florid confessions of a European dandy who machinates his way into an adolescent s pants  a taboo that has some mileage to run yet Knowing little about Lolita  I was surprised by the lack of detail pertaining to the deeds  the first such incident is scarcely more explicit than the  Maiden No More  explanation in Thomas Hardy s deflowering of Tess  Nabokov echoes this in the Afterward  when reflecting upon Lolita s reception by publishers and the public       Lolita  misled some of my first readers into assuming that this was going to be a lewd book  They expected the rising succession of erotic scenes  when these stopped  the readers stopped  too  and felt bored and let down  The initial rejections and persistent controversy no doubt stems from the protagonist and narrator s unabashed  brazen infatuation with nymphets  The novel is written as an explanation and a confession  and in doing so we are treated to lengthy explanations of the origins and manifestations of Humbert s whims  Today  murderers  addicts  latex fetishists  grown men who pay to wear huge nappies and women who can t stop eating sofa cushions all confess  sometimes proudly  to their deviant behaviour  A generation of Discovery Channel documentaries and freedom of speech has perhaps numbed us a little  But no one admits to being a paedophile  The last taboo Humbert is  unsurprisingly  an odious character  but one with manners and breeding  A misplaced Frenchman  his discordance with the customs of 1950s USA mirrors his abhorrent sexual preferences  But these are not choices  Humbert is offensive not because he is paedophilic  he is offensive because he acts upon his long standing lust  If I stopped reading after 100 or so pages  I could have sympathy for Humbert who is encumbered  not by choice  and ambles along with some semblance of decorum  despite his powerful lusts consuming him from within  We had highballs before turning in  and with their help  I would manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother  Alas  like a thief who would steal if only he were presented the perfect opportunity  Humbert sees a path to nirvana and without regard for others but with huge caution for himself  psychopath   he crosses the Rubicon Humbert s narration is laced with French and snide denouncements of people and places  making him easily dislikeable  The only gripe I have is that  at times  he slips into a convoluted stream of consciousness with long  long sentences that occasionally drag and snag Nabokov was bold to create Lolita  He is a writer with a sound command of his second language and the publicity and infamy that follows Lolita will no doubt immortalize his talent Best part  Brazen originality Worst part  Long  long sentences Avoid if  You like children Read if  You like children One word to sum up this book  Long  ing For more reviews  see http   101greatexpectations wordpress    Nabokov did an amazing job creating a thoroughly unlikeable  unreliable narrator in Humbert Humbert  Humbert s character really drives the book from start to finish  It was tough to read a lot of the sections but ultimately the book was a very rewarding read that I highly recommend  How in the world that a book with such uncomfortable disgusting subject matter be considered a classic  That s what I kept asking myself when I kept seeing Lolita high up on the lists of great books  I questioned it  I prejudged it  and I avoided it     until I just had to see for myself The answer  Because it is just brilliant literature that overcomes the topic In all honesty  I was helped by choosing to listen to this on audio book and the reading by Jeremy Irons is probably  to me  the best single performance on an audio book I have heard  Taking that out of context    This is a book that is simply of the bonds of jealousy on a man  and twisted way that desire can make even the most intelligent of men to allow his intelligence to falter  In any other book  if she was anything other than a 12 year old girl  this would be a story where our Humbert Humbert would be seen as the hero in a Greek tragedy  But Lol is just that girl  motherless and struggling with her own adolescent needs   not just of maturity but of that parental love that seems out of grasp  He justifies  he agonizes  he cowers  yet he throws himself onto the jury for judgement  But fear not  the writer approaches even the most uncomfortable of topics with the subtle hand and graceful language that you are left only with the brush strokes  While other more brutal storytellers may approach the first time the two main characters come together in the same bed  Nabokov leaves no doubt about the action  shows the challenge in Humbert s mind of the act  and justifies it all   in no more than a dozen words  The language above all else is beautiful  arguably more beautiful that Lol deserves  Yet that is indeed the underlying point  and the purpose of the story itself  In the end  I found myself to be no more different than Humbert Humbert myself    seeing a book that is supposed to be taboo at best and disgustingly horrible on a good day  yet I found myself so in love with it that I could not question my own desire to read  re read  and love this work  While the NABOKOV S PUPPET SHOW  BACKGROUNDS OF LOLITA and THE ARTIFICE OF LOLITA chapters provide quite an exhaustive analysis of Lolita  the amount of references in it is quite overwhelming  basically unless you re already significantly familiar with Nabokov s work you ll probably won t get most of it  But that s my opinion  and in the end who am I to tell Mr  Nabokov how to write anything As to the novel  this is my second read and this time I enjoyed it even more  Another 5 out of 5 Poignant quotes  What drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet  of every nymphet  perhaps  this mixture in my Lolita of tender dreamy childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity  stemming from the snub nosed cuteness of ads and magazine pictures  from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in the Old Country  smelling of crushed daisies and sweat   and from very young harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels  and then again  all this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through the musk and the mud  through the dirt and the death  oh God  oh writer s ancient lust  so that above and over everything there is  Lolita   Don t think I can go on  Heart  head  everything  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Repeat till the page is full  printer   This is another of those books that I decided to re read this year in my grand experiment to read more of the classics  I believe that I first read this when I was in college and living in Grand Forks  ND  I would have had to speed through it a bit as I had readings for classes and the like  and I could tell part of that when I sat down to read it again I remembered parts of it  the large plot points of course  and I had some of the visuals from the movies in my head as well  but I didn t let those influence me during this reading  or at least not in a major way I enjoyed this book the first time I read it  and I enjoyed it this time as well  I am sure that I brought a different viewpoint to it this time  as I had a much more black and white way of thinking the first time round  I found myself reflecting on the subject matter and delving more into trying to figure out why Humbert Humbert thought his actions were okay  and also looking at how others accepted them as well  It can really be a fascinating look at society then compared to now  and that was another thing I thought about as I read I am liking how my experiment is causing me to do this method of reading  and I look forward to doing more with it   It was really hard to give this book 5 stars  I wanted to hate it  but only because it made me so uncomfortable  I couldn t though  because it was so beautifully written  The first half of the book you hate Humbert  the narrator  he s gross and his descriptions of the young girls make you want to barf  But by the second half of the book you start to pitty him  you realise he s simply crazy  with no clue what he s doing to poor Dolores  thinking she could really love him back  When the inevitable happens and he loses her  you almost wish she ended up with him  until you remember what a relief it must be for her to finally be free of that monster I figure anyone who can make me feel sorry for such a disgusting human being  must be an incredible writer  I can t wait to read something else by Nabokov  When I first started reading this book  I was merely curious about the term  Lolita  as I had first seen it used in the Japanese manga and anime context  Reading the excerpt synopsis  I thought it was more of an erotic book about incest and nearly gave up reading the book midway  It seemed to drag out and things weren t getting anywhere  The main characters were a little annoying too  However  I m glad I stuck with it and finished the book When I was done  I was really impressed with the imagery and thought processes I had while reading the book  It had really killed quite some of my brain cells as I was not used to the linguistic style  I must admit I didn t start reading from a young age and hadn t read all the classics  You see  I had the misconception that Humbert Humbert was the real author and Vladimir Nabokov just translated it  Hence  I didn t pay the foreword much attention  However  I came to realise  at about 90  point in the book  that the foreword had explain quite some things and the story would have made more sense to me if I had read it carefully  It was at that point too that I realised that Vladimir  was  the author and not just the author of the translated version  I was really impressed with how his fictitious foreword and constant  author s note  spread throughout the entire book made it seem as though Humbert Humbert was a real person who had written the book but had tried to alter all the names and places to protect the identity of the people involved I can see why this book was controversial  especially at the time it was written  However  I do not know if I m a minority here or what  I actually felt sorry for pitiful Humbert who never in his whole life experienced mutual affection and love  He had loved Lolita so wholeheartedly that it made me really enraged by the way she had treated him  I bet many people out there would have thought that Humbert s deeds were blasphemous and unacceptable  and he is  hence  an unforgivable monster  However  in my point of view  Lolita had not been that innocent as well  She had even baited him while he was still trying to restraint himself  when Charlotte was still alive  Like Humbert had rightly said in the novel  he was not even her first lover  That was when she was only 12  This makes me think about the laws  protecting minors  these days and wonder how much at fault are the minors really are and should they really be guilt free This novel also made me realise that many problems in our current society  social and sexual  actually existed a long time ago  It is just more open and publicised these days  As Humbert also mentions in his  author s comments  in many primitive places and countries  such acts are not against the law and is part of their culture in fact  What is sacrilegious to a community may be simply life to another  So seriously  how do we judge what is right and wrong I liked that this book actually made me think about many issues  not just those I ve mentioned but as of now  I am unable to recall To the people who stopped reading the book  perhaps it was not the erotic novel they had expected it to be or perhaps it was just too wordy  Or maybe  it was just too incestuous and blasphemous  In my opinion  it s their loss  Avoiding something doesn t make it cease to exist  Invent the most despicable character you can imagine and make him tell his story in a novel  Tell an ugly story in beautiful language  Chuckle to yourself  thinking of all the schoolgirls studiously writing essays about your self delusional unreliable narrator while never actually mentioning that he is a paedophile This is what Vladimir Nabokov has done I did not want to be inside Humbert s head  but he put me there That is the mark of a great writer  Well deserving of it s status as a classic  but it s super obvious why the book is considered controversial  So here s what I ll say  you should read it  but if you re more conservative than others  I don t necessarily mean politically ftr   Google the book and make sure you know what you re getting yourself into   I read it again only because of its 60th anniversary of publication  I have never liked it  I do not like it now  however  I acknowledge it is a literary masterpiece  No one could or has since put in words such fantastic erotic imagination  Linguistic masterpiece  yes  but psychologically  not so much  When I first read this I was in college  I was taken by its language  I remember reading some sentences out loud just to experience the physicality of words  Several decades later I am aghast at its nonchalant sexuality  not the pederasty  but that Humbert Humbert can enjoy sex with Dolores without fear of pregnancy  Linguistic pyrotechnics cannot cover up the very biological fact about this story  this much sex with a recently menstruating prepubescent girl should produce at least one passing mention of a worry of a baby or protection or something  This time around the story  or HH s diary  left me cold and unconvinced that it could have taken place like he said  But perhaps  that is the point   At times  this book was painful to read  Good  That s exactly what a story about a paedophile ruining a child s life  should make you feel   Brilliant and hilarious  I didn t love this book for the  romantic  subject theme  rather for the poetic prose and for the things the book offered  it described the emotions  especially the damaging ones  a relationship between two such people would be like  and the fact that Humbert actually feels guilty for treating women in such a way  to the point where his name is a pseudonym   was interesting  Nabokov has a brilliant writing style  and although most people are repulsed by such affairs it is clear through his word choice and highly complex language that he does love Lolita     light of my life  fire of my loins  my sin my soul  Lolita   So I did like it mostly for the brilliant writing style   especially impressive considering English is not his first language  Whilst this book is hard to read due to it s complexity and unorthodox nature  the messaged I gained from it is the power of charm  Whilst  Humbert Humbert  may fool many with his charm  his intelligence and supposedly  good intentions     at the end of the day  what he did was immoral and resulted in the total destruction of Lolita s life  I do quite like Lolita the character herself  she s witty and strong  and is independent in a way  certainly not afraid of taking revenge and making Humbert feel equally shitty    I ve been revoltingly unfaithful to you   What we must gain from this book is that no we cannot fall into the trap of Humberts charm and believe his actions to be  justified   as we are indeed as the reader referred to the jury  rather we must ignore his plea for redemption and instead consider the overall question  is this justified because he loved her  Lolita is the story of Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze  the daughter of a woman who Humbert lodges with  Humbert is infatuated with Dolores  who he privately nicknames Lolita  Humbert moves in with and then marries Lolita s mother Charlotte in order to be closer to her  When Charlotte dies  Humbert and Lolita drive around North America  finally settling in a small town in New England  Lolita spends this time trying to escape Humbert Humbert is a weak  cruel man and crucially  a really unreliable narrator  He makes excuses for his obsession with Lolita while labeling her a nymhette  as though because she is precocious  she is trying to seduce him  There is a clash between her preoccupation with popular American culture and his preoccupation with poetry and classical literature  Humbert places more value on his own preoccupations  looking down on Lolita s very snobbishly  Nabokov saw Humbert as  a vain and cruel wretch  and  a hateful person   He can  however  present a charming and attractive side to people who don t know him  playing on the being a European writer abroad The reader only gets to see the side of Lolita  or Dolores as I try to think of her  that Humbert presents and as I ve said  Humbert is an unreliable narrator  What the reader can gather is that Dolores is in search of attention  Charlotte is not a great mother and so Dolores Lolita searches out any attention that she can get  be it positive or negative  This leads her to flirt with Humbert  almost as though she s testing him out  However  because we only have Humbert s account  it could be possible that Lolita is unaware of her flirtatious behaviour The best criticism I ve ever found comes from Azar Nafisi s memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran  2003   For Nafisi  the core theme of the novel is Humbert s egoistic self absorption and removal of Lolita s independent identity  She writes   Lolita was given to us as Humbert s creature       To reinvent her  Humbert must take from Lolita her own real history and replace it with his own       Yet she does have a past  Despite Humbert s attempts to orphan Lolita by robbing her of her history  that past is still given to us in glimpses  This book gets banned I think due to it being about an adult who is sexually obsessed with a a sexually precocious girl  which is seen as a repulsive thing to be writing about  What Nabokov does is to elevate this subject matter through the beauty and strength of his writing  He really believed in the power of words  Through his writing  an unpalatable subject becomes compelling  Humbert seduces the reader more effectively than he seduces Lolita  She stays with him at first because she feels she has no other choice  the reader keeps reading because they have to know what happens next Books like Lolita are important  They are disturbing  unsettling and absolutely neccessary as they hold up a mirror to society to show us all our imperfections  Lolita is a classic  written by a writer who was determined to make it a show case of the language he adored  I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone  no matter how unsettling they may find it  Lolita is an ode and Nabokov is a wordsmith who faultlessly masters rhythm  I have only been acquainted with one amiable writer who tends to be over friendly with his reader for the sake of elucidation  Kundera   though still preserving certain boundaries  and now I am finally acquainted with a second friendly writer  and that would be Monsieur Vladimir  Nabokov  however  has torn every literary convention that barricades and obstructs the reader  Instead of providing the reader with an account that would vicariously include them  Vladimir is overtly and overly  yet appropriately  presumptuous when it comes to maintaining the writer reader relationship  he speaks to you and it feels as if you are the immediate friend of the very charming antagonist  Monsieur Humbert Humbert  The book is a long story in prose  the story is beautifully recounted  beautifully  Yes  Vladimir Nabokov may sometimes provide you with excessively detailed settings  but it is worth it   This book is about Lolita    This is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita    Light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta    Plain Lo in the morning   Lola in slacks   Dolly at school   Dolores on the dotted line   But in my arms she was always Lolita   I was really looking forward to reading this book  It is deeply disturbing  but It s also a brilliant  It s easy to see how this book was censored in the prudish 50 s  Still  it s a timeless piece of literature that I thoroughly enjoyed Highly recommended  imaginative read  Those who haven t read Lolita get all righteous and uptight about not reading it because of its  inappropriate  subject matter  If only they could get past these self imposed moralities  they would come face to face with one of 20th century s most eloquent non native writers of the English language  What throws me off every single time I read Nabokov is his mastery of the language that bewitches the reader in its clockwork precision and sublime subtlety  Nabokov for me is Russia s Flaubert  a master of craft and style over content  That is saying a lot  considering the controversial subject matters of both Lolita and Madame Bouvery that forced readers then to challenge notions of hypocrisy and morality  For all those women who had a crush on their teacher    and don t say you haven t  I can only describe this book as really creepy but really fascinating  Read it more than once I studied this for a dissertation on the representations of the female in male desire and worshipped every other sentence   in my copy you can hardly see the words for the underlinings This is not  I repeat NOT  a novel  about a paedophile   it s a novel about an infatuation  Well now  It s not every day that a book this notorious lives up to its reputation  Lolita is disgusting  creepy  infuriating  fascinating  well written  and all sorts of other adjectives  The language in the novel is brilliant  especially when you consider that Nabokov was writing in English  his second language  What a dick  I would recommend this novel to any halfway intelligent person that I know  Incidentally  I am shocked that there isn t some shitty art band from New York named Humbert Humbert  I ve been wanting to read this since I saw the plaque in Ashland Oregon claiming that Nabakov finished writing Lolita on Mead St   In Ashland Oregon   Nabakov is a really lovely word smith type poet  I read the last chapter while drunk ten thousand feet in the air  and descending into Albuquerque  and it made parts of the breaths I was breathing escape out of different sections of my clothing in little whorlpools of delight  It s beautiful to read  and scary  the theme  you know  and power issues and all kinds of terrible things   but BEAUTIFUL  And Nabakov DID write in Ashland Oregon  I purposely procrastinated reading this book due to the uncomfortable subject matter  Now that I am reading it  I wonder why I didn t read it sooner  Yes  it touches a deep nerve in the reader that makes the subject matter extremely disturbing  That being said  it is magnificent and I can t wait to return to reading it  It is honest and raw and Humbert  the middle aged pedophile who seduces the 12 year old girl Lolita  is a witty  charming likeable character  At times  you can actually see things through his eyes and even sympathize with this madman  That shows you the incredible capabilities of the writer  The writing is sheer poetry with perfect diction and syntax  There is a reason that this book gets almost all 5 star reviews and is listed in the Top 100 Books of All Time  Jeremy Irons reading on the the audio version definitely added to the richness of this exquisite novel If I could give this six billion stars I would  It is so many things  and I urge people who found it repulsive the first time  or arch the second time  to keep going  It remains a love poem to the English language and an incendiary critique of American culture  A monster saying tender things about a woman he never  ever  really met   As open minded and willing to read anything that I am  I was not in the mood to delve through this work when my second semester Lit professor stuck in on the end of my  Required Readings  list at university  I know it s a classic  and I know that I scoff around at people who reject classics because they re  boring  or  difficult   so it would seem that my love of classics would push me to snatch this up in a heartbeat  Wrong  I have a strong  no tolerance  attitude on pedophilia  sexual slavery  or human trafficking of any kind  So when I heard that this story was not speaking out against such injustices  but rather justifying them as acts of  love   I was slightly queasy  I read it with apprehension and bias  but I wasn t expecting to nearly side with Humbert  our  nymphet loving  protagonist   or antagonist depending on how you look at him   Now  I m not saying that I at all support pedophiles or the rape of innocence in any sort of way under any sort of circumstance  but Nabokov just wrote the damned thing so beautifully that it makes it difficult to fully hate Humbert  He writes a convincing argument  that he loves Lolita  because he is trying to write himself out of a lifetime in prison  But as he is writing to his jury  I as the reader found myself sympathizing with him  saying  Hey  Jury  can t you tell he cares about her  Get off his misunderstood  pedophilic back   This was no doubt Nabokov s intent  However  though I hate the storyline  the lyrical  pleading  lovely prose was what did it for me  I give it five stars not for the love story  the one sided love story   but for the sadness and for the beauty of the writing    Lolita  Light of my life  Fire of my loins  My Sin  My Soul  Lo     Li     ta   Thus begins Nabokov s masterpiece  Nabokov  that russian genius  who has to leave his beloved home and country due to Bolshevik uprising terror  What was Russia s loss and Nabokov s personal tragedy became   in a way  blessing for English readers who were gifted Nabokov s dazzling literary creations in English First and foremost quality of Lolita is its dazzling linguistic pyrotechnics  Each sentence in the book is a glittering inferno which puts you in a rapturous delight and awe and Wow  This is best described by Martin Amis as Variety  force and richness of Nabokov s perceptions have not even the palest rival  Reading him at full flow is next best to sensual pleasure that prose can offer  Books main protagonist is Humbert Humbert  a poet and pervert who is attracted to young girls  called as Nymphets   Story is about his forced sexual subjugation of his stepdaughter Lolita  a 12 13 yrs old girl The main trouble in the look the contradiction of a monstrous narrator and his diabolically cunning prose style Lolita s audiobook version is also a treat  a mouth watering delight not to be missed  It is read beautifully by Jeremy Irons  Highly recommended  I will have to look back at our book club to see when we read this book  but I own it in hardcover and it is one of my all time favorite books  It isn t because of the subject matter  which is kind of creepy  but Nabokov is one of the most beautiful writers I have ever read  As a result  I own more of his books and continue to read what I can  Truly beautiful literature   This book is truly worthy of every single one of those stars you see above  It is not an ordinary book  certainly not  It is a book that moves you inside  makes you disgusted and sick right down to your soul and at the same time fascinated and confused by your own contradicted feelings Nabokov had a challenging task at his hands  and that is to make us identify with a monster  and thus questioning our sense of morals  For this task he chose the most complicated character one could come up with  Humbert Humbert  Chapter 1  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  a certain initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns  For the sake of this identification  within the first pages Humbert Humbert places us as his judges  he plants questions for us to guide our judgment  he makes us experience what he feels when he says her name   This brings me to this popular song by Florance   the Machine   Say my name as every color illuminates  we are shining and we will never be afraid again  Other than the little ballerina nymphet in the video  the resemblance between this song and Nabokov s book stretches to the recurrent usage of words that describe light  glittering and gold  That takes the reader into Humbert Humbert Fantasy like Imaginary place   Humbert Humbert wants to render banal what he does  He wants us to adopt his distorted vision of reality  He wants us to share his passion  by the way  I find this character s voice very passionate  It is noticed in the tone of the prose style    I am not a criminal sexual psychopath taking indecent liberties with a child  The rapist was Charlie Holmes  I am the therapist  This particular passage makes me wonder if he conscious at all of the gravity of his actions  Or is just an act in front of the ladies and gentlemen of the jury  How much of a reliable source this guy is  really One of the things he wants us to believe is that he loves Lolita  I personally find it hard to digest  This is a psychopath  He has poisoned the mother  raped the daughter and made a sex slave out of her  He calls her my pet for god s sake  While one could always argue that it is possible to love one s pet  There is this other crucial argument  Humbert Humbert always sees her as being twelve  this is very well portrayed in one scene the more recent movie  This idea brings me to a beautiful song by fairuz named Chadi  It goes like this Long ago when I was small there was a boywho came from the Woods  andwe played he and Ihis name was Chadi Me and Chadi sang togetherWe played on the snow  and ran through the breeze We wrote little stories on the rocksAnd we waved our arms in the air Then one day the world ignited   People against people dragging the world into it and the battle approachedon the hills and the world approached and descended on the sides of the valley Chadi ran watching  andI was scared and called out to him Where are you going Chadi  I called out to him and he didn t hear me  And he went further and further down the valley and since that day I saw him no longer   Chadi is lost And the snow has come and goneTwenty times came and gone and I ve gotten older   While Chadi is still small And still playing on the snow   On the snow  Just like Chadi  Lolita never grows up  No need to wonder why  Lolita is not Dolores Haze but Humbert Humbert s dead lover that he tries to resuscitate  It is not a human being but rather an idea  a frozen image  This is my theory  although Humbert Humbert contradicts me in this passage  Somewhere beyond Bill s shack an afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate  and there she was with her ruined looks and her adult  rope veined narrow hands and her goose flesh white arms  and her shallow ears  and her unkempt armpits  there she was  my Lolita    hopelessly worn at seventeen  with that baby  dreaming already in her of becoming a big shot and retiring around 2020 A D   and I looked and looked at her  and knew as clearly as I know I am to die  that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth  or hoped for anywhere else  She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet I had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past  an echo on the brink of a russet ravine  with a far wood under a white sky  and brown leaves choking the brook  and one last cricket in the crisp weeds     but thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshiped  What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart  mon grand peche radieux  had dwindled to its essence  sterile and selfish vice  all that I canceled and cursed  You may jeer at me  and threaten to clear the court  but until I am gagged and half throttled  I will shout my poor truth  I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita  this Lolita  pale and polluted  and big with another s child but still gray eyed  still sooty lashed  still auburn and almond  still Carmencita  still mine  Changeons de vie  ma Carmen  allons vivre quelque part ou nous ne serons jamais separes  Ohio  The wilds of Massachusetts  No matter  even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish  and her nipples swell and crack  and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torn  even then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face  at the mere sound of your raucous young voice  my Lolita  Then later on  he confirms my theory   Good by aye   she chanted  my American sweet immortal dead love  for she is dead and immortal if you are reading this  I mean  such is the formal agreement with the so called authorities  Humbert Humbert refers a lot to the Freudian psychoanalysis  I wonder if he is making fun of Freud  or of us the reader who are easily influenced by it  Amid the many layers of this book  I found it particularly hard to put a finger on that exact moment when Humbert Humbert cede la parole pour que Vladimir Nabokov prenne la releve  Where does he stand from he own work of art  his chef d oeuvre   This jumble of words hurled by a demented mind Humbert  and put together in this book by a genius Nabokov   to me  was like a mad painting  Which  at first glance  seemed like a cheap and detestable rendition of a perverted mind  But then something read  prose  pulled me closer and as I cogitated upon it further  the colors read  words  as if started to shine and meander in an utter brilliance  Thus  finally when the spell was broken and I was finished with it  I could only wonder at the presence of such an eccentric masterpiece This terribly tough read for me was a tussle between the hatred I carried for Humbert Humbert and the affection I was developing for the author and his magical way with the words of the language which is supposed to be his third     Look at this      I used to recollect  with anguished amusement  the times in my trustful  pre dolorian past when I would be misled by a jewel bright window opposite wherein my lurking eye  the ever alert periscope of my shameful vice  would make out from afar a half naked nymphet stilled in the act of combing her Alice in Wonderland hair  There was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which made my wild delight also perfect  just because the vision was out of reach  with no possibility of attainment to spoil it by the awareness of an appended taboo    At this point I should admit that this same Humbert fellow was quite funny in his pathetic self  I also believe  in his lousiness  he was making many failed attempts to mould the morality of his thoughts and thus  was constantly calling out to the reader for approval attention There was no warmth to be found in any of the characters  No sense to be found in any of the actions  No fidelity to be found in any of the relationships  No peace to be found in any of the arbitration  BUT  what was found was  an inexplicable and incomprehensible experience This might very much be a meaningless book to many because of its lack of  content  or  take away  or what not  But in the words of Nabokov himself   A work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm This book blew my mind  Lolita is one of those novels that leave an impact on you   the lines repeating themselves in your head over and over again like the tune of your favourite song the characters as real to you as people you actually know maybe even more so The books that never really leave you that become part of you That make you question everything you ever believed to be definitely unquestionably true That enthralls you and devastates you It was a book I was fascinated by pulled in by the magnetic poetry   gripped by the storyline It was a book I didn t quite know what to make of It blurs the line between romance and horror between the beautiful and the macabre  Terminado  Emocionante de principio a fin  Habil manejo de la psicologia del personaje principal masculino   Lui mi ha spezzato il cuore  Tu hai soltanto spezzato la mia vita  Tristissimo  la prosa di un maestro quale e Nabokov rende il libro intero ancora piu coinvolgente di quanto gia la storia non sia  Il romanzo e senza dubbio disturbante  sviscera il desiderio malato del protagonista gia nell introduzione  pagina per pagina veniamo a conoscenza del complicato rapporto che Humbert ha con la sessualita  Molto forte  complesso in certi punti  ma incredibilmente appagante  Il doloroso e indiscutibile capolavoro che non vi lascera insoddisfatti  specie se amate l autore  Prose  magnificent  Me  feeling extremely inadequate for even trying to review anything he does  The writing in this book is seductive  It is beautiful and lyrical drawing the reader in to trust this unreliable narrator  It is as close to perfection as anything I ve ever had the pleasure to read     I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality that you and I may share  my Lolita   It s such an odd feeling to be completely in love with a story in which such horribly vile things happen  and told by such a horribly vile man  At the beginning I got caught up in the romanticised language of Humbert Humbert s narrative but near the midway point I felt a tiny bit ashamed when I realized that I had been rooting for him to get what he wanted  I m happy that I did not read this at 14 like I had wanted to  because I probably would have believed this to be an unconventionally exciting romance  rather than the story of continuous rape and abuse that it actually is Lolita is presented as a confession written by H H  of his time before and with Lolita  up to the end of his life  The beginning of the book contains a fictional forward that details what happens after his death  to Lolita and various other characters  On first pass  the forward may make very little sense  but I recommend coming back and rereading it after you ve finished the book  because I completely missed the reveal that  view spoiler   Lolita dies very shortly after H H  does himself  and only at 17    hide spoiler  Rereading the forward also eased my guilt at enjoying the story and sums up more tidily my thoughts on the novel than my own words could  I have no intention to glorify  H H   No doubt he is a shining example of moral leprosy  a mixture of ferocity and jocularity that betrays supreme misery perhaps  but is not conducive to attractiveness    A desperate honesty that throbs through his confession does not absolve him from sins of diabolical cunning  He is abnormal  He is not a gentleman  But how magically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse  a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring the author  Reading this book so many years after its publication struck me as slightly funny at times  particularly when reading H H s description of what he considers a  Nymphet   Now those same children are referred to simply as  Lolitas   Sidenote  Lana Del Rey s  Lolita    Off to the Races   and  Carmen  now take on a whole new meaning  and I d be lying if I said she wasn t the reason I read this novel in the first place   Holy f     I ve never in my life read prose like this  Nobokov is a genius  fluent in Russian and English  who translated his own works  If you re not in love with this book by page 2 I don t know what to tell you  Calling his writing lyrical is the greatest compliment you could ever pay the word lyrical  It s vivacious  ebullient  and addictive  Everything about the story is fantastic  the characters  the narrative  the visceral feeling its events produce  If you ve not read Lolita  you re doing yourself a disservice  Finished in the lacuna of a lovely Daylight Savings Sunday morning    What a wonderful way to unwind the start of a week  Lolita  Lo  Lola  Dolores Ramblings of a madman  Evil itself  cloaked in crippling pederosis  Humbert the father  Humbert the rapist  Refined  cultured  vile Humbert Humbert begins by justifying and rationalizing pedophilia  He then spends a large part of the book insinuating that he is not to be blamed for his crimes  Till the very end  he tries to pass off Clare Quilty as a greater monster than he  The pangs of his tortured conscience flash through in bits and pieces as the novel progresses  muted by his crippling lust  That is  until the last fifty pages or so  when compunction hits him harder than a champion pugilist The novel itself is brilliant  I would advise most readers to keep a  very detailed  the in built dictionary on my Noook failed to match up to Nabokov  dictionary alongside for reference owing to pompous Humbert s extensive vocabulary  which certainly overshadowed my pitiful stock of words   The style of narration does a great job of bringing out the monster s ugly refinement But what really stands out  is how the entire house of cards comes tumbling down in the end  For me  the concluding period of the book starts alongside the first appearance of Trapp  The slow descent into complete madness and Humbert s full realization  and pitiful catharsis  have been so powerfully expressed by Nabokov that any attempt of mine to critique them would be quite useless Succinctly put  this is a rollercoaster  Not one you will necessarily enjoy  H H  is a descriptive narrator   but definitely one you will appreciate  This is my all time favorite book  From the very first page I was drawn in by pure elegance of the english language  He takes obsession and makes it vivid and beautiful  He makes us understand the mind of Humbert  expertly creates Lolita and weaves in romance throughout  I will be reading this one again in the future  How romantic and dazzlingly tragic  Lolita is a billboard for the demented and distorted way the human life can unfurl and yet still manage to impart a significant exquisiteness In a way  I ll never be the same   I ve probably read this at least 8 times  in high school and college and at different points after that  including when I taught it in a literature class on  freedom and confinement   It s one of those rare works that stands up not only to repeat readings but also to critical analysis without losing its magic  It s also one of the saddest books I ve ever read   That s a good thing   What can be said about this novel that hasn t already been said by way smarter people than me  The thing that brings me back over and over  despite the disturbing subject matter  is the way Nabokov created a wholly unreliable narrator and manages to get the reader objective information  We don t have to be fooled by Humbert unless we want to be  We ve got a choice  unlike poor dolly  or even Humbert himself  What s great about Nabokov s Lolita is that it tells you something about yourself  What s weird about it is that right after reading it  you want to read it again since you know that you are not the same person anymore  It is so sincere that its truth comes as a slap in the face  and I m certain that it will be read as long as people are around  Lolita is the story of Humbert Humbert  a European man obsessed with certain young teenage girls  whom he sees as having the aura of adult women  He secretly dubs them nymphets  He tries in vain to deal with his urges  but soon resigns to them which makes him and his story interesting  Most of the book is his account about his love story with a 12 year old American girl called Dolores Haze  to whom he secretly calls Lolita  Nabokov  who undoubtedly is a master of English language  told after finishing his book that there is no purpose for it  But  I don t know what s his definition of  purpose   For me  the book has a purpose  and a very noble one  it is a daring attempt to bring the reader a step closer to the truth about himself and the people around him  With a captivating prose and fascinating imagination  Nabokov has written one of the most controversial books of the 20th century  and while considering this  one can t but recall the famous words of Oscar Wilde  The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame  Lolita is written in first person  and although I m not a fan of it  its usage is very apt  which otherwise would have made the book a story about a mere pedophile  The first person recount plays an important role in shaping HH s character accurately in our minds  and perhaps kindling a bit of sympathy for him  Lolita can easily be called great  and reading it was a unique experience  Both charming and clever  it will never cease to capture one s intellect and emotions   We hasten to alienate the very fates we intended to woo    Lolita  Vladimir Nabokov The story of Humbert Humbert  a pervert inasmuch as he is a poet  and his controversial love for the nymphet  Lolita  Being only twelve years old  Humbert regardless falls head over heels for her  His desperate and illegal paroxysms of desire for Lolita have been the source of much criticism  but it does raise an important question about the boundaries society places on love  Is it at all possible that his love and desire can be reciprocated by a child  Lolita explores this unprecedented question in depth with the aid of Nabokov s coruscating wordplay and exquisite and expansive vocabulary   A work of beauty  if there is ever a book you are to read and never bother read again  if you re that type of person  or are wishing to look inside the human mind well this is the book  Lolita creates a world so odd  queer  and poignant that it leaves the reader to be a poignant soul for the rest of your life  It has an impact so huge that you dare to start question orthodoxy  perhaps not the themes within this story which make it seem purely normal but to Humbert only  In the case that you do question the vileness of Humbert then you  too  have fallen under the spell of Nabokov  Don t let the beautiful  eloquent  lexicon trick you  It s a crucible which you re about to enter in  Lolita is the most complex and provocative novel anyone can read  It s forces you to be uncomfortable or to love the ones you shouldn t  At times you hate  admire  love  and feel sympathy for Lolita while the feelings being mutual for Humbert but by the end  if you re lucky enough to get so far  then your outlook on life  not just Lolita the book  character  and the others in there too  while never be the same  I can go on and entreat anyone to read this book but I don t need to for if you pick up the book and read the first chapter you ll see the true beauty of Nabokov s prose and what s to come  It s not a love story  it s THE love story to haunt you and make you wonder of how much a Humbert or Lolita you are but these aren t the messages to take away from the book  My favorite quote being  I knew I had fallen in love with Lolita forever  but I also knew she would not be forever Lolita   Which to its core is the biggest meaning of all the love vices we tend to have  Also known as kinks  when we fall in love with a man or woman for something as trivial as their looks  or money  or an activity which they enjoy to do and the feeling for the activity is mutual between you two  This so called love isn t love  it s more of an infatuation or faux love that happens for the thing you love  The idea and Lolita hits hard on this message   Wonderful masterpiece in every aspect  The language that enriches your vocabulary  the form that pushes you to continue with reading  the story that lets you astonished and disgusted at the same time  and lets you think about hidden meaning of some expressions   This book blew me away  I started copying beautiful passages of prose into my journal but had to stop because I was just transcribing the entire novel This book truly deserves its fame  Lolita was brilliantly and beautifully written about a very taboo and disgusting topic  Nabokov almost woo d me with Humbert s charming personality  but I was brought back to earth with the scattered glimpses of Lolita s desperation and misery that Humbert would coolly dismiss  until the very end  I don t think I ve ever read anything more beautiful and  at the same time  more sickly  This book gave a very intimate look into the mind of charismatic  psychotic sociopath  You knew Lolita was planning something  but you would never figure this young girl to be so clever  Genius piece of literature  Despite the lurid content  this is an extremely well written novel  something I wish I had read when I was younger  I doubt I could say anything about this book that hasn t already been said  but from my experience this is a brutally honest look at desire and love that most of us have felt  but never expressed in such a direct manner  I enjoyed reading the memoirs of Humbert and at times even sympathized with him  something that surprised me  Despite any moral objections one would certainly have towards the subject matter  I recommend this book to everyone  Completely libertine  shocking  atrocious in the concept it presents  most would give this novel a low ranking because we cannot love the main character  not even like him  just find him hopelessly depraved  But I don t rate books based on if I like or not the character  The phrasing  the expressions  the prose  are a rare example of an English master author and is here exceptional  I can only think of Julian Greene as an equivalent  And the fact we can despise HH so well is a testimony of the wrting quality giving us the realism of  les tourments   of the despair of the character in his most inner thoughts  Despite the theme and this anti hero I can only surrender to this masterpiece and sigh with envy hoping one day to be able to write only one sentence which would be at the level of one paragraph of this novel  I started this book knowing that it would be a challenge for me  And it was  Sometimes  it was really hard to bring myself to read another page  another chapter  It wasn t just the theme  actually  as I went on reading  it became harder and harder for me to follow the story with Humbert s eyes  I was literally forced to see everything  to ponder over everything  to hear his lies and his self delusions  to listen to him while he tries to justify himself  while he admits to having a problem but still goes down his path until the end  I must say that Nabokov s style   clean  brilliant  ironic  harmonious   help me go through this book with an unimaginable pleasure  as if I could never get enough of is wonderful writing  In the end  I m left with the feeling of having finished a wonderful book  Nabokov manages to discuss a contentious theme such as pedophilia without passing any judgments  He leaves Humbert alone on the scene and he tells us his story  It is then up to us to make up our mind about him  about Lolita and about his actions   What a wretchedly beautiful book  Any sympathy you have with the character devolves over time as he becomes less and less of a trustworthy narrator  It is beautifully written  and even after all the horrible things are past  one is still left on a sort of teeter totter between disgust and beauty  I read this book a few years ago  and occasionally i ll pick it up and read it again when i m in the mood for something Nabokov  The literature is wonderful  it is widely known that Lolita is very  unethical   but that s what literature is all about  This is a great  must read for anyone that loves literature and everything it has to offer  i resisted reading lolita for years because i was so sickened by the passages from reading lolita in tehran  but the english language sections of french libraries are understandably limited  this is in fact a brutal and terrible story  but quite a good novel  humbert humbert is definitely one of the most challenging narrators i ve come across because while he elicits little rational sympathy  his storytelling is so compelling that you almost find yourself seeing things from his point of view  the contrast between the ugliness of the story and the intricately beautiful language used to tell it is the book s most outstanding quality  ultimately the reader realizes what humbert humbert himself suggests  but never seems to totally accept  that he is never able to love dolores herself but only pathetically fixates on a transient creature of his own imagination  utterly mutilating an innocent life in the process   I gave the 5 star for the language  wit  absurd humor and the braveness but it was one of the most disturbing book I read   Looking forward to read it after reading review on it   i ve developed a perverse fascination with books about perversion  in part because so many of them function so masterfully as meta narratives on writing  Please  reader  no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted  morbidly sensitive  infinitely circumspect hero of my book  do not skip these essential pages  Imagine me  I shall not exist if you do not imagine me  try to discern the doe in me  trembling in the forest of my own iniquity  let s even smile a little  After all  there is no harm in smiling       it s impossible to add anything new to the stockpile of words that have been said already about lolita  but then again i find myself rather liking this idea of an endless accumulation of words because if lolita is anything  it is a paen to the sensuality of language  as countless scholars have pointed out  we have no access to the girl in question except through humbert s solipsized  sensualized  aestheticized narrativization of her as the nymphet lolita  so perhaps when people call this book  erotic  what they mean to get at is the erotics of reading  reading as fetish and fetishized language  there is no doubt that humbert is an abomination of a man  and that what he does is vile  sordid  reprehensible  and wrong  but the magnitude of humbert s contemptible crimes is matched in equal proportion to the unreliable rhapsodic frenzy of the words he uses to describe them  and ultimately it s this monstrous and extreme mis match that elevates this novel into something sublime  I believe the poor fierce eyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her purse she might somehow reach Broadway or Hollywood    or the foul kitchen of a diner  Help Wanted  in a dismal ex prairie state  with the wind blowing  and the stars blinking  and the cars  and the bars  and the barmen  and everything soiled  torn  dead  I ve never been so impressed  yet so repulsed  by a piece of literature in all my days until I finally picked up this Vintage International edition of Vladimir Nabokov s disturbing novel  LOLITA  Because the story has become part of our cultural lexicon  we re all familiar with Nabokov s sordid tale of hapless Humbert Humbert s personal destruction because of his unflinching love for the conniving  manipulative  pubescent Dolly Haze  his Lolita   Accordingly  there are parts of this narrative that literally made my skin crawl  But the writing      The writing is brilliant  darkly and fatalistically humorous  and flawless  All the more extraordinary to Nabokov s flowing prose is the very real fact English was not the author s first  or even second  language  but his tertiary endeavor  At the present I am attempting to learn Espanol  it is difficult at best to master a second language  so Nabokov s English fluidity two languages removed from his Russian mother tongue is all the more impressive  The writing is sweeping and engaging and extremely emotional  over and over  I found myself rereading certain passages and paragraphs  out loud  because I was so struck by Nabokov s dynamic symmetry  Again  brilliant  flawless  writing  And again  this story is certainly not for the faint of heart  and you  as the reader  will be deeply disturbed by the problematic chain of events that take place through the pages of this novel  In many ways  this book very much reminds me of Malcolm Lowry s  Under the Volcano   brilliantly written  horrific story  And just like Lowry s masterpiece  I have no intention of ever reading Nabokov s LOLITA again  the literary dichotomy is complete   Una obra maestra  me mantuvo sorprendida y con miles de sensaciones cada que lo leia     Se mi tocchi muoio    A master of the English language  Even if you are not interested in the story  reading it will improve your appreciation of the English language ten folds Masterfully crafted prose  Intense theme  One of my all time favorites  Truly terrible and terrifying tale of child abuse told though the posthumous voice of the abuser  This story is guaranteed to make any parent shudder  but oh  such wonderful narrative flow  It is difficult to believe that English is not Nabokovs native tongue  Such a sad  sad book  Audio version was brilliantly and very seductively narrated by Jeremy Irons who made Humbert Humbert come gloriously to life in all his twisted perversion   Many years ago I was taken to task by a woman in San Diego  California   Why are you reading this crap  It s outrageous   I ignored the woman and carried on  A triumph of style from the this outstanding writer  Nabokov is  il miglior fabbro   Ole   I ve started to read it back when I myself was of nymphet age but never finished  so it was long overdue   Scarcely have I met a female character or just a character in general  so alive and real  jumping off the page like Lolita EDIT  Flowery language   a bit hard on the ESL speaker sometimes  but a great stylistic practice  the abundance of adjectives  not disturbing  interestingly  makes it read almost like a Greek drama  His character building should be taught  One minus point  the kindle edition I have is full of typos  annoyingly so  sometimes I had to read a word or a sentence multiple times to get what it was  It did not take much off the enjoyment   shows the quality of the novel  but it was sloppy work on the part of the editors  Pathetic disgusting Humbert This is a very uncomfortable read which is likely to create more questions about the views you hold of the world   at least it did so for me  I can safely say I didn t like any of the characters though they were spectaculalrly written  don t think I was supposed to   The writing style is excellent and engaging leaving the impression that you are in a conversation with the insane H H  The feeling that Lolita was not real  merely an idealised love is something that struck me throughout the book  it might be interesting to read a book written from Dolores  point of view This is a very good story if you feel up to the challenge and can live with the slightly dirty feeling it leaves you with  If you ever have the chance to use  So  I was reading Lolita     in conversation  this will be a game changer in certain circles  I imagine outrage and the like  Too bad for them  Sure  it s a story of an entirely unlikeable pervert  but it s also intricate and beautifully told  I enjoyed almost every sentence  The humor  yes  it s in there  was the greatest surprise  Mostly I would be hypnotized with the writing and a funny passage  or even random phrasing  would pop up and was that much more enjoyable because it was abrupt  You travel the country and the years with H H  with his particular view of the world  You re looking out of the eyes of a pedophile  experiencing his obsession and madness   I don t know that I d call it a love story  It s more like a fixation  adoration  addiction story  hence the madness   How is that  not  a fascinating read He is abnormal  He is not a gentleman  But how magically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse  a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author  Introductory note by the character  John Ray  Jr   Ph D   Nabokov has delivered a masterpiece in terms of psychology  language  and comedic timing   As strange as that sounds in a book about a pedophile  The relationship between Humbert  Charlotte and Lolita Haze is amazingly well rendered  We can see with perfect clarity how Charlotte resents her child s monopolization of Humbert s attention subconsciously  She seems sometimes a tragic figure desperately in love  at other times  a comic one petulantly envious of her own daughter  Humbert Humbert is alternately a nervous love struck boy and clever deceiver  It s almost impossible to affix to Lolita any sort of personality as of yet beyond a child  Humbert Humbert is too blinded by love for us to get any idea of what she is like in the beginning And then something happens and the book takes flight through all of America  through the cliched movies  and the dead end towns  and the paper walled motels and we get a deflation of all the nostalgic Americana and the idea of  father knows best  in an elegant and witty fashion  And there is tragedy too  yes  Humbert being the monster that he is  he wrecks Lolita s life horribly  and Nabokov lets us know in many ways  obvious and subtle  how  What we first took at as a sort of horrible Dionysian love was in the end not even that  merely selfish self obsession  It s amazing how fast the plot progresses  this book has no spare fat  The language is so playful  clever and alert to cliche  One of the best books I have ever read  For a book of moderate length  I found  Lolita  took a fairly long time to get through  Not that I was trying to research every reference  or anything  I just had to savour the language  To a great extent  it s the ebb and flow of every line  within itself and in connection to every line around it  regardless of meaning  that drew me on through this book  It s poetry disguised as prose  It really is   Is it  art for art s sake   then  I d be quite tempted to say it is  for the most part  Yes  there is a minefield of moral questioning to be set off by the construction  far more than the content  of  Lolita   But the fact is that Art guides us to step into that moral minefield  Art takes us as willing captives  Like I said  it s dense stuff  but you keep reading  This is why I think Nabokov offers glory to Art as one of its high priests  Art for Art s sake   for the sake of Art as something holy  splendid and terrible  fatal as society s blindness  and immortal as Humbert s crime    Crime   Forgive me  This novel does nothing to discourage skepticism  nor was it meant to   However  stepping backwards  the story itself is enough for most of us unenlightened readers   Well  compared to Nabokov  that d be just about everyone   Never mind  why  Humbert is a sympathetic character  as he is for me  at least  He just is  As is Dolores Haze  as is her pitiable mother  as is the ostensibly villainous Quilty  They are all hateful and appealing in so many ways  and this unfailingly humanity with which Nabokov infuses them is enough to prove his mastery  let alone the rest of what he does here  What effect did that overwhelming mastery have on  me   Confession time  I cried  A lot  I don t even know quite why  I could not begin to write an essay about it in my first year university English class   Thank Quilty we were given a choice   All I could see was the enormity of what I had not grasped  of what I could NOT grasp and reflect through whatever sorry focus I took in my writing  It s one of those books that will stay  for now  on my mental altar  to be re approached in the future when I have more capability to grasp Nabokov s subtle insight  I worship humbly from afar  Nevertheless  long after the final page  Lolita skips and teases round the edges of the mind  You see if it doesn t   Nabokovin Lolita oli koetteleva lukukokemus  Kirjan sisalto oli kammottava  mutta samalla tarina oli kerrottu kerrassaan upein lausein ja kielikuvin  Lolitan kieli on ehka kauneinta kohtaamaani  ja suomennos on hammentavan hyva Lolitasta on kirjoitettu paljon  ja sen sisalto on edelleen ajankohtainen  Nabokov kasittelee paahenkiloaan taiten  ja Humbert Humbert todellakin osaa selittelyn ja sanoilla hurmaamisen taidon  Alussa suhtauduin hahmoon melko neutraalisti  mutta huomasin vastenmielisyyteni kasvavan kirjan tapahtumien edetessa  Humbertin luonne muuttuu selvasti tarinan edetessa  ja toisinaan han ei itsekaan tunnu enaa uskovan omia sepitelmiaan  Kertojana H H  on hyvin epaluotettava  joten monet pienet asiat jaavat mietityttamaan tarinan aikana  Toinen lukukerta voisi olla hyvin mielenkiintoinen Kirjalle nimensa lahjoittanut Lolita on traaginen hahmo  jonka sielunelamaan lukija ei ihmeemmin paase tutustumaan  Humbertin kiinnostus tyttoa kohtaan tuntui olevan melko ulkonakokeskeista  joten han ei kertojana tarjoa kuin ohivalahtavia sateita tyton mielenliikkeisiin Nabokov on kirjoittanut kauniin kirjan rumasta aiheesta  Taide tuo parhaimmillaan uusia nakokulmia ja pakottaa kokijan outoihin tunnetiloihin  ja sen tama tarina saavutti  Suosittelen  Lolita is and has everything I d want a book to be and have  with its writing always  always of a quality so high it s hard to imagine it having been produced by a mere human brain and its protagonist simultaneously extremely repelling and incredibly  dangerously fascinating  On my to reread list till the end of my days  till FOREVER AND EVER  It s just that good  One of the most brilliant pieces of literature I ve ever read  I could analyse it for hours at a time  It s a very controversial and touchy work that really dives into the core of a subject many find disturbing  However  it s twisted  It brings guilt to the reader    it flips through every emotion in the book  but the main one is guilt  Through the laughs  smiles  tears  as told by Humbert  anyway  there is guilt in the back of the mind and heart of the reader  It s really a very intense book  Good luck to anyone embarking on this one   Everybody knows what this book is about  The writing is gorgeous and provocative  The subject matter is deplorable  It is a work of fiction  but there is nothing fictional about the author s grasp on the depravity of unbridled human desire  The book  for me  went from intriguing to taboo to uncomfortable to disturbing  About halfway through it started to make me feel a little bit ill  but I kept reading  so I am no better than anyone else  It is a classic  and has relevant social context  and I can t say I would not recommend it  but be forewarned  it is not pretty  Actually  it is  which makes it worse  I wrote a review  I read it  and thought  No  this is not what I think of the novel    so I wrote another one which couldn t describe my feelings  either  And I kept writing one after one   none of them satisfied me  So far this is the fifth review where I am trying to settle down my ideas and decide whether I like the book or not  In a point of fact  I still don t know how I am feeling towards the book myself  Did I hate it  But why then I kept reading it everywhere I went to  Or how could such an ugly  pervert creature such as Humbert Humbert  Long name  let s call him H H  drive me to all sorts of pain by every word he writes The story is about a middle aged man and a twelve year old girl and their love affair  When this evilness of lust   desire meet the innocence of a young girl all that written in a way that no one can ever write like  you know that you are reading a great book  A book that will make you wonder what is love  Is it really a pure thing  Or is it an evil passion one which people cannot control  one that drives people crazy and makes them lose their minds  makes them commit things that are totally against their wills    Spoiler Alert  When the story first begin  we get to know H H s motivations  he tells us about his story at a time when he was a teenager and how he has once loved a girl called Annabel and how hard it was for him to deal with her death  Ever since then H H becomes incapable of resisting nymphets  He s old now  but obviously still having these feeling towards certain kinds of girls  When H H first meets Lolita  He thinks that he only loves her  because she is like a shadow of his first love  His writing style is much more than what I would say   There are two kinds of visual memory  one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind  with your eyes open  and then I see Annabel in such general terms as   honey colored skin    think arms    brown bobbed hair    long lashes    big bright mouth    and the other when you instantly evoke  with shut eyes  on the dark inner side of your eyelids  the objective  absolutely optical replica of a beloved face  a little ghost in natural colors  and this is how I see Lolita     So yeah you will expect to hate H H in the beginning it s always hard to read a book when the protagonist is an evil  selfish guy  but what I found it pretty satisfying is when I realised that H H was actually in love with Lolita  It s actually more like an obsession  for a better description  It all started with a desire to possesses her carnally  but afterwards and only when H H meets Lolita again after years  an older Lolita that isn t a nymphet any more  he realises that he is still madly in love with her no matter how old  how pale she is    and I looked and looked at her  and knew as clearly as I know I am to die  that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth  or hoped for anywhere else  She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet I had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past  an echo on the brink of a russet ravine  with a far wood under a white sky  and brown leaves choking the brook  and one last cricket in the crisp weeds    but thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshipped  What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart  mon grand pch radieux  had dwindled to its essence  sterile and selfish vice  all that I cancelled and cursed  You may jeer at me  and threaten to clear the court  but until I am gagged and halfthrottled  I will shout my poor truth  I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita  this Lolita  pale and polluted  and big with another s child  but still gray eyed  still sooty lashed  still auburn and almond  still Carmencita  still mine  Changeons de vie  ma Carmen  allons vivre quelque  part o nous ne serons jamais spars  Ohio  The wilds of Massachusetts  No matter  even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish  and her nipples swell and crack  and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torneven then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face  at the mere sound of your raucous young voice  my Lolita   Beautiful  isn t it  And far more shocking to know that the writer is Russian  How could he write in such a perfect way  I was really really amazed by his words and the style was WOW especially when H H begs the reader to understands him  this all have made me go through all kinds of emotions  disgust  fear  compassion and even LOVE  Only someone with Nabokov s gift for language could manage to create such a complex combination  right  I know this is a long review so I ll sum up  the book is about an inside ugly person he s smart  amusing and somehow even funny  It s the kind of books that will make you feel guilty for loving them  or for having any kind of compassion or sympathy toward its characters and it certainly will leave you out of words just like I am now  At last  I would love to quote Humbert and say  Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury  I am Malak Alrashed a girl who s trying to keep her self away from every possible sin  have actually read and loved this book with all my soul Do I recommend this book Certainly not  Especially for those who only see the world in black and white  For me  this is the book against which all others are measured There are plenty of people who don t like the storyline  and let this influence their feelings about the book  The protagonist is a creepy  pathologically obsessed old guy who basically kidnaps a twelve year old girl and practices all manner of sexual ugliness on her  which he dresses up as love  I think Nabokov hated this guy as much as the rest of us  Nabokov calls him a pervert in his afterword  and he s right But if you can get past the ugly storyline  there is no better  more elevated  writing than in Lolita  Nabokov didn t learn English until he had learned several others   Russian is his mother tongue  But his mastery of English is complete   way better than mine and the great majority of native speakers   and his joy in wordplay and finely crafted expression shines through in every sentence Here is the writer s writer  and this is his greatest work  It seems to be a true story as the author speaks through a certain  Humbert Humbert  who is judged for his actions  The first chapter begins with the confession of his crimes in front of a jury and then he begins relating his story  Where he comes from  where he grew up  how he became obsessed with  nymphets  and most importantly  his relationship with Dolores Haze  Nabokov s style is simple and direct although he sometimes loses himself in detailed descriptions  I consider him to be an example of Model Author  in Eco s terms   He adresses directly to the reader in many many passages of the book  e g   I hope my style doesn t already seem unbearable  The book impressed me not so much because of the central theme  but because of the evolution of characters  Lolita  although only 12 in the beginning  consents to having a relationship with her step father  but then  as she grows up  she doesn t try to excel her condition until she plans to escape with another adult  She didn t fight back when Humbert wanted affection from her  still she considers him to be the disaster of her life  Although Humbert s love for Lolita never changes  never stops  his judgement is the one who changes  He didn t realize how much harm he was doing to her until he re encounters her after 3 years of absence  3 years of suffering for him  The revenge he took upon the man who took Lolita away from him impressed me  I wasn t expecting such an ending  Lolita    a novel of intermingled feelings who lead the characters  Though I want to read the book where Lolita murders Humbert  this book is still great  Wow  This book is like a country and western song  It has everything a person can want in a story  innocence  loss of innocence  romance  adultery  lust  pure love  unrequited love  misery  drunkenness  rebellion  angst  brawls  road trips  jealousy  rage  revenge  murder  acceptance  joy and peace  I m telling ya  it has everything  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it took a little longer than I liked for it to hook me  I found it a bit laborious at times but beautifully written from a special place in the narrators heart  It is definitely not what you initially think its going to be about  It s pretty amazing and totally worth the read  i kept on restarting from chapter one each time i put it back down  took me three years to finish  essentially grew up with this goddamn book  i carry it around everywhere like an oversized charm   A tale of obssession  A road book  And the time they spent in Beardsley is oddly cosy  The imagery is beautiful and the writing is so so beautiful and you think you pity Humbert Humbert but then you suddenly feel very uncomfortable being in the story  It feels all wrong at the same time as having an empathetic line drawn through it  In the end  I felt myself routing for Humbert  I wanted him to kill Quilty and I kind of wanted Lolita to go with him but of course she mustn t  He stole her childhood  He did horrific things to her that no child should ever have inflicted upon them  How is it possible you feel his love and tenderness creeping through the pages  Surely it s just obssession  But its just not written nastily  I don t know  There s some very beautiful words in the book  and descriptions  Its interesting and horrible to read something from that point of view  and interesting to know what people think of it in our scared society today   Savored every textual particle of this goddamn brilliant piece of a  sinister memoir   Never have I had the pleasure to read  or see  so intellectual  acerbic  and unapologetically perverse black comedy  such mastery of the English language as demonstrated by Mr  Nabokov  To call it a feverishly sentimental scribble about all consuming pedophile s passion would be unforgivably reductive   thus  do not make the mistake  my dear  it is a part morality tale  part apotheosis of the Past  duplicity  language  games   and storyteller s power over his audience  I first read this book when I was about Lolita s age  and it left an enormous impression on me  The subject matter is unspeakable  even today  It makes sense why  What could possibly compel an adult to feel such feelings toward a child  This book doesn t provide any easy answers whatsoever  Instead  LOLITA explores the tragedy of being cursed with such a disorder in a society that lacks understanding  Then it forces the reader to re examine what they think they know about people  The story is horrific  yet intensely human  By no means is it an easy read  but it sympathetically explores an issue that  on instinct  most cannot help but be repelled by  The fact that it manages to be one of the most beautifully written books I ve ever read makes it one of my favorites  Okuduktan pek de kisa olmayan bi sure sonra fark ettim ki bu kitap benim su zamana kadar okumus oldugum en guzel bes kitaptan biri  I loved you  I was a pentapod monster  but I loved you  I was despicable and brutal  and turpid  and everything  mais je t aimais  je t aimais  And there were times when I knew how you felt  and it was hell to know it  my little one  Lolita girl  brave Dolly Schiller  Bir de  eger imkaniniz varsa Ingilizce alin okuyun  Such a misunderstood classic  It gives the reader a very interesting look inside the mind of a criminally insane man  Contrary to what many may assume  the story isn t all that offensive  The sex scenes were alluded to fairly vaguely  making the story about as offensive as your average crime drama on TV  Overall an incredibly well written story that everyone should consider picking up  I particularly recommend this version as there are notes in the margins explaining the more obscure referrences used  Nabokov encanta con una secuencia infinita de adjetivos y epitetos maravillosos  hermosos y bien manejados  tan bien manejados que parecieran metaforas de aquello que describe  El dominio del lenguaje supera la anecdota  que a mi ver fue mejor tratada por Sabato en El tunel donde se expone mas o menos la misma situacion   y el personaje es rapidamente abrazado por el lector gracias a su agil lectura y su caballerosidad para referirse a las cosas mas obscenas o mas futiles dentro del texto Al terminar la lectura  uno termina con la sensacion de que Humbert era mas bien un hombre solo cuyo unico amor no era mas que una gestacion sin nacer  y aunque el no lo advirtiera  esa situacion lo lleva a una locura que todos compadecemos  Resulta imposible acusarlo de sodomista o de asesino porque se trata de un personaje atormentado y herido por esa femineidad cegadora de Dolores  una nina que saca provecho del deseo que produce en los hombres y de la corta edad con la que cuenta  Hay una exoneracion poetica hacia Humbert  si se quiere ver asi  mientras que Lolita no es mas que la figura detonante de los pensamientos de su inseguro padrastro Tuve algunos problemas con el  Lo  que se usaba a veces como el diminutivo para Lolita porque lo confundia con el pronombre  lo   pero uno se va acostumbrando a ese detalle  Tambien tantas oraciones en frances me ofuscaban un tanto  confieso que detesto el frances   pero fuera de eso  reconozco que Nabokov ha sabido capturar la atencion en esta obra  no a base del morbo o de la perversion  sino con la gracia del uso del lenguaje  I don t feel sad when I read books  I ve read a lot of books that some would consider tear jerkers  and yet I ve only cried twice while reading a book  HP  The Order of the Phoenix and Message in a Bottle   I enjoy feeling shocked when I read  The twists and turns that an author takes to get to a certain point I find enjoyable if executed well But I think I know I ve read a really good book when I am angry while reading  I am so involved and invested in the characters that I want to reach in there and just strangle the antagonist until they stop and I can continue on and enjoy the story again Again  Order of the Phoenix  with Umbridge and the detention scene  stabs things   The Art of Racing in the Rain  because I hate people who lie about abuse since it gives those who have been abused less credibility  And now I get to add this book to that list I was so furious at H H   The manipulation  the ego  the abuse    but told using fantastic prose  It was interesting to have such an unreliable narrator  one that I wanted to run over with a moving vehicle  I almost lost it when he went into detail about the lies he told her so she wouldn t run away Oh  anger  Going to read happy things now  I was astounded by this book  I was so captured by my first read  I went out and got an annotated edition and read it again  And I will read it again  Nobokov s use of language is nothing less than mesmerizing  His layered  tricky  clever wordplay  riddles  puns and only letting us hear Humbert Humbert s viewpoint was an ingenious way to make the reader experience what the young Lolita  and others around her  may have experienced  That of being slowly  insidiously seduced into Hum s carefully spun labyrinthian web of treachery I believed from the start that Humbert was a lecherous narcisist up to absolutely nothing but trapping and possessing Lolita  Not just Lolita  but his ideal golden  luminous   nymphet   And  I believe  that is what Nabokov wants the reader  wants me  to see  We witness Hum s  and only Hum s  version of this  love affair  with his little Lolita  I don t believe that Nabokov intended this story to be a treatise validating the virtue of sexual relationships between children and adults  as some have taken it to be since it s initial publication  At the extreme  there are some very real organizations that relentlessly attempt to justify  and advocate for the legal right  to have sexual relationships between adults and children  Nabokov s Lolita has even been used by them to try to justify their beliefs  by citing examples from the book where they say  Lolita is the seducer  is enjoying and finding pleasure with Humbert  What they fail  and are probably unwilling to see  is that first  we only hear Hum s version  what he  a self professed  conniving liar and rapist  wants us to hear  to see  to believe as true  It is Humbert s truth  Not Lolita s  We never hear from Lolita  Second  adolescent girls are not unknown to form crushes on older men  or to have sexual feelings and desires  Nobokov satirises the early 1950 s American teen aged girl s crushes on the overblown  farcical dreamy Hollywood actors of the time  Humbert prayed on this  perverted it  took advantage of it  for his own gratification  Humbert did not care for Lolita  the person  he only saw her as his twisted  magical version of a forever pristine golden nymph  Nabokov constantly tells the reader through Humberts  own tellings of his plans and schemes to get rid of her mother  to drug her so he can have his way with her  constantly bribing her with money  candy  to keep her close and quiet about the truth  We even see  as Humbert s defences are cracking  that he even plans to murder Lolita before she gets much older  or to have a baby girl with her for the purpose of molesting her when she reaches the  nymphet  stage There are so many other levels and facets to this story to pick apart  to marvel at and wonder about  Nabokovs  rendering of Lolita as landscape  and landscape as Lolita  She is the ant captured in the burning  tunneled beam of Humberts  vision of perfection that he would rather set on fire than let it escape his deadly hot grasp  To Humbert  Lolita is everything  and everything is Lolita  And Lolita is his  his creation to possess and destroy as he sees fit  no matter the cost  This is a book I will revisit often  and I know each time I will be mesmerized by Nobokovs  literary genius  and find myself laughing at the absurdity of Humbert Humbert  and that anyone would actually take it to simply be a literal love story  Jeg har visst blitt Nabokov fan  Genial  Nabokov escribe con tanta elegancia y erudicion  Por mas que sea una historia provocadora  no deja de ser conmovedora   Me encanto  Hacia mucho que no disfrutaba tanto de un estilo de escritura como el de Nabokov  me parece unico A demas  esta novela es de lo mejor que lei en materia erotica  Humbert Humbert es un gran retrato de la perversion  Es impresionante como uno se siente atraido y a la vez repelido por el relato  tan bien detallado  de sus deseos y fantasias  Me hizo sentir un poco como una nina otra vez  con esa sensasion de que no hay limites en lo que uno desea mas que aquellos impuestos por un otro externo  Humbert jamas se planteaba si debia o no debia hacer tal o cual cosa en terminos morales  sino siempre en relacion a si seria o no descubierto   De que otra manera se presentan los deseos no permitidos en la ninez sino de esa misma Si bien es considerado un clasico americano  creo que no se puede dejar de notar que el autor no lo es  y eso es  creo  lo que hizo que esta novela me resultara casi perfecta  Rara vez logran los autores norteamericanos movilizarme tanto  suelo encontrarlos mucho menos comprometidos con los deseos de los personajes  y de un lado mucho mas moralista  Por otro lado  me fascina leerlos  suelen escribir las novelas mas entretenidas e inolvidables  Ambas cosas convergen en Nabokov y se plasman en Lolita  lo cual la hace decididamente sublime  Nabokov steps out on a limb with this one  This seemed like a true love story to me  I believe he really does love young Lolita and that he wants to do well by her but the restraints of society simply will not allow it  With her coming of age and wanting to shed him from her you can watch his heart break  Even though it seems like he was controlling and a tad abusive I somehow want the best for him  What a lovely story  There are many accomplished writers but there is no one who can match the skill of Nabokov  What a pleasure it must be to read it in Nabokov s native Russian  The subject matter is somewhat disturbing given the nature of the relationship between the twelve year old Lolita and the much older Humbert but Nabokov manages to deflect this through skillful writing  Is this a story of a young innocent child being abused by an adult  or is it the story of a devious precocious child taking advantage of an insecure man  Lolita is everything the critics have been saying for years and more  I will add more to this  review  later  For now  though  I simply want to note that this book is almost impossible to write about since the first thing one has to do is justify liking it  After all  what is the serious point of this book    that pedophiles are people too Stay tuned   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  Forget about the whole story being unconventional  disgusting or beyond social acceptance  This is probably one of the best written book I ve ever read  The narration was very smooth and easy to follow  I was attached to Mr Humbert s character on how he perceived his sexual feelings and being honest about it  The word choice  plot and change of pace is almost as magical  This book made me understand that our sexual desires have no boundaries  I would totally read this again and hopefully I could discuss it with my friends soon   Humbert Humbert  un sot divortat ce si gaseste alinarea in frumusetea nimfetelor de 10 13 ani  isi gaseste intr o zi adevarata sa iubire  Lolita  O fetita de 12 ani si 7 luni cu bucle blonde si cu o frumusete devastatoare care l innebuneste pe Humbert si care l face sa fie gata sa devasteze orice obstacol pentru a ajunge la Lo a sa Primul pas  scaparea de mama Lolitei intr un mod mai neotrodx  atragerea ei in   capcana   ca apoi un accident sa i curme viata Pasul 2  Lolita  Doar a lui  Gata sa cutreiere lumea cu aceasta  gata sa faca orice pentru a o tine aproape pe tanara nimfeta Dar totul are o limita  ce se intampla cand Lolita se va satura de obsesia bolnavicioasa a lui Humbert Parerea mea Momentul ala cand iei o carte in mana si stii doar ca cineva ti a spus ca e o carte   buna    Pur si simplu o deschizi si dai de urmatoarele   Lolita  lumina a vietii mele  vapaie a viscerelor mele  Supliciul meu  suflet al meu  Lo lii ta  varful limbii executa o miscare in trei timpi  coborand pe valul palatului ca sa atinga  la timpul trei  dintii  Lo Li Ta   Totul pare doar o poveste amoroasa  dar de fapt este vorba espre tulburarea obsesiva a unui barbat de a savura nimfete tinere si nepangarite de nimeni  Obsesia de a proteja inocenta si de a o savura asa cum doar un om ca el ar putea s o faca  Peste tot ni se explica cum Humbert a fost mereu atras de nimfete tinere  ca totul a inceput cu Annabel  o pustoaica de aceeasi varsta cu acesta  dar cu timpul  cu cat inainteaza isi da seama ca adevaratele sale iubiri sunt fetitele de 10 12 ani  Totul este anost  singura preocupare a lui Humbert fiind aceea de a atinge si intelege nimfetele  de a le iubi pecum un   tata    Incearca chiar sa se casatoreasca cu o femeie cu cativa ani mai mica  dar isi da seama ca dezgustul fata de femeile ce si au pierdut inocenta este mult prea mare pentru a putea sta cu ele Totul este scris cu o eleganta uluitoare  fiecare contur al primei sale intalniri cu Lolita pana la ultima ne duce intr un adevarat   carusel   savuros in care intram in mintea pedofilului care produce incestul in speranta de a fi fericit  Si da de fericire  categoric  dar se spune ca    dragostea este un blestem    iar Humbert a experimentat cel mai bine asta Pare o carte dezgustatoare  si poate chiar este pentru multi cititori  dar eu am incercat doar sa fiu deschisa la tot si sa inteleg alegereile pe care le au facut cei doi  A fost antrenant sa citesti ceva ce trateaza un subiect sensibil  sa citesti ceva ce a fost interzis in sec XX si sa ti dai seama la sfarsit ca nu totul este atat de scandalos cum consideri la inceput pentru ca lucruri de genul se intampla mereu  dar suntem prea orbi pentru a le da importanta  Iar ca un autor a incercat sa scrie despre asa ceva in Rusia sec XX mi se pare demn de respect  este o dovada e curaj sa scrii asa ceva   N am zis nimic  I am imbrancit trupul gingas in camera si am intrat dupa ea  I am sfasiat tricoul  I am desfacut fermoarele  Pe toate  I am smuls sandalele  Urmaream fantasma infidelitatii ei  dar mirosul pe care il adulmecam era atat de slab incat practic nu se putea deosebi de plasmuirea unui nebun   Si Lolita  tanara si efemera Lolita  mi se pare un personaj vulgar  dar careia nu i se pune accent pe sentimente decat in ultimele capitole ale cartii  ccea ce a fost usor dezamagitor  deoarece impresia de la inceput a fost una de copil vulgar si materialist  ca sa ajunga intr un final sa si dea seama ca ea cauta cu adevarat sa fie fericita  O evolutie suprinzatoare si neasteptata  O evolutie interesanta in profunzime  o evlutie ce nu puteam crede ca o sa existe in imprejurimi potrivnice ca cele in care traieste Lolita Si Humbert  Mai vulgar ca personajul precedent prin simplul fapt ca si doreste sa ajunga in pat cu Lolita  Marsav atunci cand se casatoreste doar pentru a ajunge la scopuri imorale  dar in acelasi timp este considerat ca fiind    inteligent    Bineinteles ca nu da dovada de inteligenta  actioneaza cu premeditare  dar in acelasi timp previzibil si primitiv  Cred ca l am detestat nu pentru comportamentul sau  ci pentru pretentia ca Lolita sa devina o fata   citita   A fost unul dintre cele mai bune romane citite de mine si cred ca pentru fiecare este o lectie povestea Lolitei  care nu puteam spune ca a ajuns   bine    chiar ea adresandu i se lui Humbert astfel   El mi a frant inima  Tu mi ai distrus  pur si simplu  viata   O recomand fiecarui cititor care vrea sa afle o poveste altfel  o poveste care se ascunde sub minciuna ca ei sunt   fericiti   Nota  5  5Yuki my most favourite book ever At one point in my life  probably twelve  I decided that it would be impossible to ever have one favorite book  I should still stick to that  but Lolita comes pretty damn close  Every sentence is a masterpiece  the topic is intriguing and controversial  and the characters   especially Humbert   are dripping with development   To write about such an obscenity in such a beautiful manner requires a real master of words  I have never been so delighted to read words like when having read those of Nabokov yet I have never been so disturbed as when reading this book The reviews about the book are worth reading  but only after one reads the book Some say that some pages could have been omitted from the book as nothing happened within them    I must admit  in a couple of those pages I stopped and went back to read them again  although nothing happens  but the text is so beautiful that you could actually enjoy reading about  nothing  The book is piece of art  alas it was mostly criticized for its topic rather than its value as literature  Nabokov has presented a personality of a psychopath  yes he made him charming  but isn t that what any psychologist would say about psychopaths   He did a great job and I don t think he has tried to twist the mind of the reader  read about this in a modern book on psychology and you would find the same This was just a comment  not a review  I am not qualified for such a job  DI looked up  psychopath  in Google  its mentions peaked in the 1950s  the same time when this novel was written    Half way through I know I love this book  Despite who the main character is I find myself identifying with him and feeling sorry for him  This is inspirational writing if Nabokov can do that with a character like Humbert Humbert  Probably one of my favorite classic reads Upon finishing the book I m just a little bit in love with this character and will be forever changed because of this wonderful read  Once considered shocking  Lolita is now heralded as a classic I read this book while at university  desperate to encompass the rebellious teenager  but found a story of sadness  mental health and loss  Rather than disappointment  I felt empathy  Rather than revulsion  compassion for Humbert Rather than pedophilia  I saw Romeo and Juliet if Juliet had not been so star crossed A book to behold  the film of the same name starring Jeremy Irons is also a good watch  Lolita by Vladamir Nabokov Book Review The Father husband  Humbert Humbert  of little Dolores Haze inevitably concludes   And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita    Nabokov pg 309  to synopsize the timeless depths of man s capability of devotion   Lolita   written by Vladamir Nabokov  is the testimony of the most realistic love perspective ever written in the history of mankind  Human nature naturally provokes a defense mechanism as we dive into affairs with others  Humbert Humbert symbolizes those emotions  which we bury deep inside  so that we do not show weakness  so that we are not taken advantage of because we love so deeply  Straight from the mind of H H   Humbert Humbert  himself  the recollection in this man s mind occur in several places beginning with his birthplace in Paris  France in 1910  The many wondrous places in which Humbert and his stepdaughter visit on their journey together are countless  ranging from New England  to Colorado  and as far as the Canadian Border  Humbert Humbert is an intellectual individual  who after an early divorce has rented to be a tenant in the house of Charlotte Haze  Her daughter  Dolores Haze  is the centerfold kerosene that lights the match that H H  has stored to embrace once lit with his a desirable nymphet  a child around the age of 12 years of age with glistening features  which just so happens to be Dolores who go by the name Lolita  or Lo for short  He instantly falls for the nymphet as soon as she comes to view  He begins to write about her profusely in a journal  and the downright grotesque fondness that forms within the elusive mind of her mother  Charlotte Haze absolutely despises her daughter  while Humbert and the nymphet find secluded ways to embrace the touch of the hand  which one day turns into an embrace of the lips  Lolita is sent away to a boarding school leaving an open window for Charlotte to confess her love for Humbert  At first he is infuriated  but dwells on the nymphet being his stepchild  and really has no choice if he wishes to embrace her any further because Charlotte has given him an ultimatum written in a letter  marriage or leave  They marry shortly after  and in Humbert s inability to control his wife  she finds the journal he writes where she learns his true intentions  Lethal circumstances prevent Mrs  Humbert from spreading word of the  monstrosities  written in the journal  which leads Lolita and Humbert  on the road to their inevitable destiny  Lolita never was truly his  No matter the betrayal she has committed  he ensures the blood of her heartbreaker is shed  and now here he is present day miserable  and from his wishes  Lo will never lay eyes on the testimony of the man that loved her harder than anyone  In my opinion  Humbert Humbert is the misrepresentation of a lover that society pushes so defiantly against because masculinity and feminism are often mistaken as beacons of ONLY the strength of mankind  but not the emotional availability that follows  Devotion within the realms of love should not be looked down on between partners  but rather embraced just like the devotion of a mother to a child  It may seem immoral that the father of a child submit to such behavior  however this man made a choice  He chose to marry so that he would not separate from her  There is a definite age difference  but personally it is difficult to disgrace this man  when all of his intentions for this girl  are the same that a man has for a woman closer to his age  As severe as the circumstances were  he always took care of Lolita  and never raped  there was consent  or abused her  This testimony had to be written in order to voice to the world  that love is unconventional and is the one thing in the universe that does not necessarily have to have a cosmic order  How can we criticize the preferences of an individual like Humbert Humbert  when we are open to homosexual relations  He sacrificed and suffered  and now the only evidence besides the memories of his love  is this piece of literature  How else can one truly prove devotion so clearly   this is one of those books i return to approximately once a year     this year  as research for a series of Lolita Spinoffs I m writing   DIY Lolita    Lolita Q   A  An Author s Talk       one of those books that  like a love affair  leaves you altered afterward  becomes part of your cells     I read this in high school and I m properly due for a revisit  It was weirdly joyous  conflicting  alarming  funny  a slap in the face  a dance beneath trees  Beautiful writing  have I mentioned that ever  elsewhere  Nabokov s writing emerges naturally  never excessive  but only lovely  And then it is also incredibly sad  The kind of sadness which you don t really know how to place  a sadness mixed with disgust and hopelessness and yearning  Ugh  good  On my 2010 reread list  Lolita is a book I avoided reading for many years because of what I considered the dodgy content  Once I read it  I was hooked  Vladimir Novokov for me  ranks alongside Tolstoy and Turgenov as one of the most potent writers ever  This is a truly wonderful book  the writing is sparkling  fresh and exoteric  The beauty of each phrase will captivate and hold you forever  No one can write about emotion better or with more sensitivity   Lolita changed everything  Nabokov felt words to his bones  in color   iridescent spectrograms    An   American critic suggested that Lolita was the record of my love affair with the romantic novel  The substitution  English language  for  romantic novel  would make this elegant formula more correct     Vladimir Nabokov  Era amore a prima vista  a ultima vista  ad eterna vista  Ho riletto Lolita piu di dieci anni dopo la prima volta  quando a quattordici anni lo amai come si amano tutte le cose grandiose  ma senza capirlo fino in fondo  Ora  a venticinque  scongiurato il timore di averlo esaltato come si fa con i ricordi ho preso piena coscienza di quanto sia immenso  pesante  ma di quella pesantezza che ti porta a leggerlo con lentezza  per assaporarlo parola per parola  Vorrei tatuarmi addosso le ultime quaranta pagine  che ho affrontato col cuore pesante e un groppo in gola  Sono felice e grata di tutto questo splendore  Lolita lives up to its reputation  It is a disturbing novel written in the aggrieved  smug  self pitying  self justifying voice of a terribly unpleasant and disturbed man who strives mightily to make you feel sorry for him  And yet it is also a poetic work rendered in breathtakingly beautiful and playful language  The novel was translated from Russian  but it reads as though it was written in English to begin with  such is the felicity of the language  Written in any other way  it would simply be a disgusting story of a pedophile  but Nabokov manages an astonishing achievement in making this disgusting story not only not prurient  but a true literary classic  And I still can t believe I actually read it    Normally I only give books 5 stars if I loved them to bits that is not the case because this isn t a book where you adore the characters  Lolita will make you uncomfortable but despite that there s something undescribley beautiful about this elegant  thought provoking    daring novel  It s a classic for a reason  My first review and I often have a fear of this type of activity  which is a massive understatement due to my own insecurities and frequent mis understanding  mis trust of my own head  To continue  one of the most beautiful books I ve ever picked up Unsurprisingly scowled upon by many acquaintances and  randoms  on long train journeys during my reading of it  I ll leave my personal thoughts on their narrow minded inability to understand the complexities of the text and how the subject matter  when put into the most simple language in answer to their  What is it about   questions possibly confused them and the first  most obvious conclusion was drawn followed by disapproval being communicated at me   say no more I would highly recommend this to readers looking for content that evokes a relatively high degree of questioning as to where the line is drawn between right and wrong in the area of obsessional love in the paradoxical purest form To explain in a brief and straightforward way it is written narrated from the perpetrators viewpoint and experience of the illicit infatuation with the young Lolita and addresses  The Jury  with pleading offerings as to why his apparent uncontrollable feelings are entirely justified and intensely real My own experience on having read this left me with a deep sense of the inner pain and conflict that is consistently present throughout his account of the circumstances that lead him into the life of Lolita and the involvement of their relationship which  in my opinion  is a complex mixture of sadness loneliness  elation  humour and tragedy I will end this review here  being my first and the fact that my own paranoia regarding my thoughts and opinions are completely invalid but I hope that anyone thinking of reading it will most certainly go ahead  I highly doubt you will be disappointed  This was a very well written book about a pedophile  I only read this book because of Lana Del Rey shes my favorite artist and her music was playing in my head as I read this book which probably made it better  I liked the 1940 s theme and I liked it whenever Lo talked because she was so charming and i wondered why humbert loved her so much  The beginning of the book had me turning pages non stop right up until he gets with lolita and then it just becomes pages of wordplay which is fine  But then it goes back to being interesting and the ending was hilariously brilliant  It had allot of dark humor in it  At the end I felt sorry for Lo and I sympathized with her allot  This book captures an obsession with youth which can probably relate to many of us even now  Its difficult to read and since I m 16 I had to read it twice to understand it and I find it funny because the 1st time i thought it was a sweet book and the second time i realized all the gross stuff he does to Lo  The way he writes is like hes romanticizing a 40 something man being with a 12 year old and like they were forbidden lovers  Its kind of sad really  I recommended it if you like English but if reading is a little difficult for you or you like simple books don t bother with this book   Before you try to kid yourself that this book is anything but  I am making it clear that this book is about a sick  predatory  pedophile  No amount of genteel manners  feigned restraint  or concern for Lolita s welfare can change the truth of what Humbert Humbert is  While Lolita  a 12 year old  rebellious  non virginal  wildly manipulative girl  may have permitted the initial act of sex with her 38 year old stepfather  she lacked the maturity  judgement  and legal ability to consent  Humbert Humbert  a grown man whose sexual desires are limited to female children who are just tiptoeing near to puberty  took advantage of Lolita s desire to defy her mother and believes that Lolita seduced HIM Although Humbert had initially shown moderate restraint around Lolita  once the green light was given  Lolita became both his daughter and his sex slave  Her life became one of pampered doting  beautiful clothing  private schools  and obligated all night sexual performances with the man masquerading as her father  Though Lolita is a conniving  self centered child who seems permissive sexually with her stepfather  Humbert chooses to ignore that she spends her nights weeping in bed after having to satisfy his insatiable needs Lolita is not more mature than other girls her age  She doesn t look older or more developed than the other girls  Humbert isn t trying to fool himself that Lolita is a woman  Lolita looks like a child  and it is that which flames the lust inside of Humbert  Her flat chest  her hairless body  her unblemished skin  her sassy immaturity  THESE are the things Humbert craves  He is a predator of children who manages to limit himself to one victim by convincing himself he is in love with her  Lolita s psyche is so mangled by the pedophilic nightmare she lives  that she seeks refuge with a man even more depraved than Humbert Humbert  Upon losing her  it becomes Humbert s mission to  save  Lolita from the harm of this  villain   However  Lolita saves herself long before Humbert can even find her  Although Lolita never even understands that she needed saving In the end  it isn t the crime of Pedophilia that sends Humbert to prison  which is where he is writing this memoir during the entirety of the novel   It is his rage which sends him there  Humbert believes  to the very end  that he loves Lolita  He knows he is a scoundrel  He knows he is insane  He knows Lolita never loved him in return  And he knows he did Lolita great harm  However  he truly believes that what he did was for love  Humbert maintains that LOVE is what prompted him to bribe Lolita into having sex with him every night for two years while also treating her as if he was her father and protector  making the sin not only pedophilia but incest  For those of you out there who think Lolita is a book about a sexy  savvy teenager who takes advantage of the lust of an older man  you are absofuckinglutely wrong  Lolita is about a child who was exploited and ruined  and never even saw it for what it was   And about a man so in need of control and so sick with depravity that he was willing to dehumanize a child to fulfill his fantasy of love   Mesmerized  Golden threads woven together in intricate designs  Made me dwell on the words  sentences  insights to life  Unforgettable characters that make your heart bleed  Did not know  what really to concentrate on  there is just so much to soak in this book  Must read it again before I die to seep it all in entirely   The book is a classic for a reason  Even if you really dislike the main character  Humbert Humbert   like I did  its still very well written   As someone who wrote novels in his second language  Vladimir Nabokov has captured my lexophile heart in ways that no American or English novelist has  In this celebrated novel  which Nabokov himself considered his masterpiece  one of my favorite word plays in the text was when the post Lolita  post Rita Humbert Humbert  who  after receiving a letter from his daughter  resumes his search for Lolita     with a blue block ice for heart  a pill on my tongue  and solid death in my hip pocket  I stepped neatly into a telephone booth in Coalmont    In brief  Lolita is the story of a middle aged man who prowls on the eponymous twelve year old girl  whom he succeeds in making his prey   his sex slave  I must make that plain  lest you think otherwise because this novel has the most entertaining  but deceptive narrator and master solipsist in the name of Humbert Humbert  For a child rapist  H H  is very witty and wickedly funny  He invites us into his web of undeserved sympathy by telling the story of his failed puppy love with the adolescent Annabel and his failed first marriage with the unbelievable adulterer  Valeria  These  he makes as excuses to marry a second wife in order to get access to a much younger bride  Reader  he is not to be pitied  But Nabokov  in his genius  lets us indulge in Humbert s amusing invention of the dark events surrounding his sexual abuse of Lolita Of her  Lolita or Dolores Haze  we hear little about From Humbert s inconsistent memories  we learn that if she were dedicated  she could be a competent tennis player  that she has trouble concentrating in class  but that she likes acting in a play  We only get a sense of her value as a human being  as an innocent child  when in the end  after hearing the sounds of children playing in the background  Humbert makes this heartbreaking realization      and then I knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord  Well said  Humbert  But too little too late  What you will not find in this novel is any suggestion of pornography or lewdness  That is not Nabokov s intention  What he tried to do here is to give us that highest form of individualism  What he gave us here is art   Uma obra perturbadoramente bela com uma escrita e um encadeamento sublimes  que me despertou sentimentos controversos  Durante grande parte da historia  considerei Humbert um homem nojento e cobarde  Nojento  por nao se impedir de fazer o que faz a Lolita  mesmo tendo momentos de lucidez  em que tem consciencia dos erros que comete  Cobarde  por ser tao timido  tao pacato e inerte como uma lagartixa a repousar ao sol  Tudo lhe cai no colo e deu me a entender  quase ate meio do livro  que queria mostrar se inocente  aos olhos dos leitores  dos seus pecados  Nao era capaz de fazer mal a Lolita  nao de uma forma violenta  e tudo o que queria era aproveitar se dela  sem ter de a enfrentar  com um receio que tornou Humbert aos meus olhos ainda mais abominavel  Primeiro  tem a sorte de se casar com a mae de Lolita  somente porque ela o ama  Depois  ve a morrer na estrada  por acidente  quando tantas vezes sonhara em mata la  sem nunca ser capaz de o fazer  Mais tarde  tenta manipular Lolita  e como os comprimidos nao resultam  o autor arranja uma forma brilhante de inocentar novamente Humbert o maniaco  descrevendo Lolita como a adolescente ousada  mais do que parecia ser   sendo mesmo ela que acaba por seduzi lo  Mais uma vez  o destino esta sempre do lado de Humbert e isto irritou me muito  Esperava um pedofilo violento  preto no branco  embora ja conhecesse os contornos da historia  atraves do filme que vi ha muitos anos  Esperava alguma bravura por parte deste Humbert para concretizar os seus planos  Este amante de ninfitas pacato e doce provocou me arrepios  porque escondia tao bem a maldade do leitor que eu ja sabia que ele seria o pior dos maniacos  Isto pos me a pensar nas caracteristicas de um pedofilo e ver a historia de Humbert retractada na primeira pessoa assustou me muito  O que dizer de Lolita  Uma menina de doze anos sem duvida diferente  ousada  tambem ela pervertida  que acaba por ajudar ao jogo a que  de qualquer forma  nao escaparia  Talvez a sua ousadia a tenha salvo  mas gostava de saber mais sobre ela  sobre a visao dela das coisas  A historia contada na primeira pessoa  pela voz de Humbert  limita muito a imaginacao do leitor em relacao a esta Lolita  e so mesmo no final do livro e que Humbert nos mostra um pouco o relato da crianca sofrida que ela mostrava ser  quando tentava esconder as lagrimas  O que e que ela sentiu com tudo isto  Como e que esta experiencia mudou a vida dela  Sei que esta historia e sobre Humbert Humbert  o  pai  incestuoso  mas ficou este vazio em relacao a menina de doze anos que o leva a loucura Ao longo do livro  os meus sentimentos foram mudando  Humbert tornou se mais aquilo que esperava dele  ciumento  possessivo  violento  e Lolita mais aquilo que esperava dela  uma crianca estragada pela vida que a obrigaram a viver  ansiosa por uma fuga Foi uma obra que me prendeu ate ao ultimo minuto  pela escrita magnifica  pelo enredo e pelos personagens excelentemente retractados  e sobretudo pelos pensamentos  alucinacoes e loucura de Humbert  Chorei pela vida desta crianca  pela infancia que perdeu e por todas as violacoes que foi obrigada a suportar  mas creio que chorei tambem por Humbert  nao diria por pena  talvez seja demasiado benevolente  mas amargura pelo tormento da sua mente  que nunca o abandonou  O vicio ou a doenca  chamemos lhe  que o contaminava  consumiu o e devorou o e nao restou nada daquele homem aparentemente doce  que nao desejava bater  nem violar  Desejava apenas o prazer carnal e o amor proibido de uma crianca   Nao a podia matar a ela  claro  como alguns pensaram  Compreendem  eu amava a  Foi amor a primeira vista  a ultima vista  a todas as vistas   Confesso que nao esperava por isto  Este homem aparentemente louco conseguiu  em algum momento de lucidez  dar uma enorme quantia de dinheiro a sua Lolita e deixa la partir para a felicidade  De alguma forma  este desfecho deu me alguma paz Vladimir Nabokov era  sem duvida  um grande escritor    Lolita   e um classico a nao perder  Opiniao  http   carinarosaautora blogspot pt 2    This surprised me in many ways  I had heard that the prose style is beautiful   and it is   but I didn t expect it to be funny  Yes  funny  With the subject matter being the pedophilic love of a man nearing 40 for a 12 year old girl  I expected a much grimmer narrative  The first person POV gives us instead Humbert Humbert  with his many literary allusions  multi lingual quotes and cultural references  which reward re reading the book  and his sense of humor  which colors many memorable scenes  His remorseful  apologetic tone shouldn t haze the fact that this is NOT a love story  Modern usage of the name  Lolita  suggests a much more seductive  manipulative type   but when the story opens  Dolores Haze is really just a regular  curious girl  whose interests are comic books and pop music  It s a one sided love lust and we get a sense of who Humbert really is  a man who is very charming  smart and convincing   but also mentally ill and criminal  As you can tell from the 5 star rating  I immensely enjoyed reading Lolita   it s beautifully written  offers an interesting narrator and a multi layered  captivating  tragic story   while playfully alluding to the great literary tradition that preceded it   Is there a character full of as much shit as Humbert Humbert  If you ve never read  or listened to a reading of  Lolita  it s easy to be dismissive  It is  after all  the memoir of a manipulative  self aggrandizing pedophile who kidnaps and serially rapes his 12 year old step daughter  Lolita is  also  a gorgeous piece of writing  The story itself is supposed to be as difficult and impossible and exactly as off putting as it is  Humbert Humbert is an unreliable narrator at best  a weak  delusional  loathsome  narcissistic character in reality  That Nabokov is able to pull this book off is a wonder and feat of creative and technical genius Nabakov illuminates the hateful  selfish  sinister Humbert using language and prose that Humbert thinks is a testament of his love for young Dolores Haze  aka Dolly  Lo  Lolita   I was simultaneously repelled and enthralled  The technical skill and execution lays out an impossibly disgusting tale of blind  unrepentant  obsession  Nabakov uses language and word play and builds a tyrant of a character who controls the entire narrative  We can t believe anything that Humbert says because Humbert is telling the story and is completely incapable of seeing beyond himself  But Nabakov writes in such a way that it becomes very obvious  very early on  that Humbert isn t what he seems and that all the ways that he wants the reader to be sympathetic are exactly the ways that we readers will come to loathe and despise him The only insight that we get into the other characters  Dolly Lolita being the most important and most obscured  are through small  marked moments that Humbert is incapable of dissecting in any way that is negative to himself or self revelatory to the kind of person that he really is  Of course  Nabakov sets the reader up to see exactly those things  Of course  and as some of the reviews indicate  there are still some people who are completely unaware of how the novel works  And that it is intentionally as distancing as it is  Let me say emphatically  Lolita is NOT a love story  Humbert Humbert is NOT a character to be sympathized with and the author does NOT intend that you do so  To feel sympathy for Humbert is to ignore all the clues and cues left behind  That he kidnapped and raped a 12 year old child and proceeded to hold her hostage and manipulate her for two years  There is nothing redeeming about Humbert  not even the empty murder of Claire Quilty at the novel s close  Quilty s murder  as per usual  has everything to do with Humbert and the loss of what he felt was his own possession  his Lolita  It s about jealousy  pure and simple  And in the only glimmer of real insight  it is sometime before he heads off in search of Quilty that Humbert realizes and admits that he knows next to nothing about Dolores Haze and that in the course of relaying the events of the last five years he has conveniently forgotten or left out parts of the story It is amazing to me that the term Lolita has gained any real traction in modern usages because the Lolita  as defined and articulated by Humbert  is a fiction  She does not exist  Humbert has made her completely up  It s very clear to the reader  but to Humbert  well  he is as clueless as they come I don t think I would have made it through this novel if anyone else besides Jeremy Irons had been reading it  It was artistically  a gorgeous affair  however  the actual content of the story  its technical genius notwithstanding  is quite unsavory and very disturbing  Still  Irons made it a compelling read and he performed Humbert so well that it set my teeth  very often  on edge  I pulled one star for no other reason than that Humbert  who loves to hear himself ramble  drove me out of my tree quite a few times spouting pointless drivel and nonsense  I suppose I should add that star back because  really  that s quite the point of who this character is  No one else matters except himself  Even the demented illusion of love that he claims to feel for Dolly has nothing to do with her and everything to do with his fantasy of the Lolita  Now that s how you write a villain  Nabokov has a huge crush on language  Everything he writes is beautiful and complex  I ll let Humbert Humbert speak for his book  This then is my story  I have reread it  It has bits of marrow sticking to it  and blood  and beautful bright green flies    I found this book captivating and beautiful  and not the least bit disturbing  and that alone is a little disturbing given the subject matter  But Nobakovs  Lolita is a fine example of what a novel with a controversial theme can be  He manages to weave this forbidden  erotic  confessional with style  taste  integrity  even sympathy for Humbert  who is as much a victim of Lolita as she is of him  And that s not easy to do folks It was no wonder to me within the first few pages that this novel climbed it s way from  smut  to one of the greatest literary works of all time  and very quickly after first printing I might add  Writers of romance and erotica could take a lesson or two from Lolita  This is about as good as writing gets   This was my second reading of  Lolita   Why would Nabokov  an author I greatly admire  choose such a despicable subject and character to write about   Lolita  shows how evil is not all one thing or another  One feels Humbert Humbert is a very flawed human but somehow he truly loves Lolita  Lolita herself is not totally innocent in the affair  Aren t we all suffering from some kind of obsession  As a writer Nabokov is superb  This book requires one to be open to the dark and seamy side of life  It is well worth the effort  The language that Nabokov uses in this book is gorgeous  Yes  the topic is frightening  but we cannot hide the creeps of life  and the subject cannot hide brilliant writing  There are so many hidden messages and profound sentences that it really does take at least two times to read the book to fully understand the cavernous meanings  I see many reviews showing disappointment of the book  but much of it is about the topic  If you truly love literature  this book is a must read  This is not a review  some blabbering that I decided to jot down Forget aesthetics  Enough of that has been written and discussed  Nabokov s word play  imagery  style all of them have been critically analyzed by a lot more competent persons than I am What was concerning me when I started to read this is that this is story of a pedophile  narrated by none other than the pedophile  A loathsome creature  abject human being   if human being at all   indeed  Based on that prerogative  just from that focal point  the prospective reader can discern that a book which deals with pedophilia is a contemptuous thing and should be hated and or should not be read  And this is where that pristine theory of  let s not talk about immorality  should be derelict  As Nabokov himself wrote  judging a piece of fiction just because of its theme is a little ludicrous  well entirely ludicrous  if you ask me   How about indulging the grey cells of the brain into a bit more perspiration  or orgy   sorry about that  couldn t resist  I think in every society  in every part of the world  there exists a finite set of social taboos  Just for an example  in the part of world which I inhabit  talking about sex would result an instant arch of eyebrow  I am not stereotyping here  it is just how things are  Now  I am not either trying to justify or vilify talking sex  But the point that I am trying to make is that the reception of the topic is muted when we speak of sexuality and I am not talking about an intercourse here  I am talking about an overall perception  discussion or at the very least  opening your mind to the very possibility of such a discussion  Just as any other topic like education or crime or whatsoever  And this is where I think  Lolita  is important  Tremendously important  It shouldn t be bifurcated either as good or evil but it should merit a discussion of where the line blurs and how the line is being blurred  Is it just a story of post coital jubilation of a 37 year old with a 13 year old girl and thus inherently must be thrown into the bag which always smells of pungent  acrid poison  Or does it make the reader think about the vicious criminality of infamous Dr  Humbert Humbert who later realized his horrible sin of 2 perpetuating years  Now  our narrator is downright one of the most vile characters I have come across  if not the vilest  The affinity which he tries to structure as  love  in the second part of the book   to me   is just pure  lust   Absolutely abrasive  one sided  evil lust  And that is not because he is a criminal  but he is  a pathologically methodical and insidiously rotten to the core of his heart  He not only rapes the child but he keeps her senses numb under mutilating  crushing weight of physical and mental torture and behold  then he keeps devising ways as to how he can keep the torrent of rapes going  We see a morbid cretin if focused beyond the soft gelatin of those radiant eyes  One part of his abominable musings that caught my eyes is this       I would have to get rid somehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nymphage had evaporated   to the thought that with patience and luck I might have her produce eventually a nymphet with my blood in her exquisite veins  a Lolita the Second   bizzare  tender  salivating Dr  Humbert  practicing on supremely lovely Lolita the Third the art of being a granddad  What abysmal  putrefying thought But this same rapist  after a number of years  finds Lolita as an expectant mother and realizes that  he had mercilessly trampled and violated each and every law ethic morality right known to the human kind  He has irrevocably ruined her childhood to such a degenerating mess that even self immolation wouldn t be enough to absolve the sin  This is where we note  I covered my face with my hand and broke into the hottest tears I had ever shed  I felt them winding through my fingers and down my chin  and burning me  and my nose got clogged  and I could not stop     Genuine  on the surface  eh reader     probably what Nabokov thought And then comes the masterstroke  Did he want to kill her when she refused to go along with him  The putrid flesh that he is  he might do the same  Then I pulled out my automatic   I mean  this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose I did  It never even occurred to me to do it  Only a sinisterly genius writer as Nabokov can do this  And this is where Lolita is important  This is not merely a story of a pedophile  plus lush landscape  plus brilliant storytelling  plus thrill to know the deepest  darkest corners of mind of a psychopath But this is a piece of art  This is a sublime yet historically important piece of art that unquestionably deserves to be read by generations after generations  Think of the sacrilegious crimes of the erudite H H  Can any human heart beat any cord that might resonate with putrid Humbert s  No  But it did  didn t it  And a writer who can inflict that is not immoral and his writing is not immoral  The book which can evoke such a feeling is not immoral but an astounding  monumental achievement in literature and art  This is a book which has managed to perturb the linearity of wholesome hate toward a pedophile Do Read P S   I have little clue as to where I reached or what points did I make after declaring awe for this book  But  I guess that doesn t matter  It is a supreme example of art and any reader can dissect it in any way possible  In my edition of Lolita  there is a short letter by Nabokov at the end of the novel where he states that the original idea for the story sprouted from an article he had read in a newspaper  The article described the first painting of an Ape  which was of the bars of his cage  That is a beautiful way of summarizing the essence of this novel  I could go on and on about the prose  the characterization  etc  but really it would just be a poor reiteration of what hundreds have said before me  A brilliant novel both witty and sombre   Will I sit down at this keyboard and tell you I take the part of the pedophile  Will I type away at my acceptance of his needs and deeds and tell you that  H H   has done well for himself  No  I won t  I find him filthy and disgusting  I find him dirty and guilty of the worst lewdness  his even existence is indecent to this world  he is cunning in his attempts to fulfill his desires  intelligent in hiding his true self and abject in his never ending quest for young flesh  These said  I thoroughly enjoyed him as a character  His flaw is built into his spine  he cannot function unless he is sick  and of course  as any human being  he chooses life  even under his soul killing auspices  As a character  he is one of the finest constructions I have ever witnessed  even if you don t approve of his actions  you understand his reasoning  you can t help not to  because he is as real as characters get  As a human being    I have a deep hatred for pedophiles   I plan on spending my life actively removing them from society   and it still didn t deter me from enjoying this fiction  That s what people have to remember about this work   it s fiction  Yes  it has true things lined in it  it gets embarrassingly close to the heart of man  and that is exactly why I love it  Now  for anybody that thinks Nabokov is a monolith writer  only constructing blocks of literature that no one can possibly be able to digest  let me present to you exhibit 1   I had more  but I really don t want to spoil the fun for any of you who might have not read it     yet  He is subliminally funny  You could say he is a comic  A very subtle one referring to his second wife  Charlotte  Lolita s mother  I had pushed her  pinched her  prodded her   and nothing had disturbed the rhythm of her calm and powerful breathing  However  when I had done such a simple thing as kiss her  she had awakened at once  as fresh and strong as an octopus  I barely escaped  Written the way mercury flows  in a bobbly  thick but detached manner   Lolita  is an absolute high point of literature  Not last century s literature  not modern literature  but literature in its broadest sense  literature since it came into existence  Rarely am I so drawn in and feel handcuffed inside the pages of a book  rarely do I get to feel the creeping up my spine of fear when I envision the imaginary hand of an author extend through the book and motion me forward  motion me to come and take part in the debauchery of his world    Rarely does a reader get the privilege to say that a book has left them barren  or parched  or filled with joy  or any strong  debilitating feeling on the spectrum of our hearts  I got this with  Lolita   Lo  Lee  Ta  The soft tap on the third sound calling at my mind s door  insinuating the image of a frail  devilish nymphet behind my eyes  is the tap that gives this name its power  A diminutive by nature  this name creates the girl character more than anything else  It minimizes her traits  so as to experience her in her most childish form  whilst at the same time maximizing the echo of her own personality  She is a little demon  a tiny rogue wreaking havoc in a man s heart  an embryonic incarnation of femaleness  a baby with her big woman shoes and pearls on I ll leave you with this  about four months ago  before I ever read Lolita  I wrote a poem that I think summarizes my view of this ideal of a girl character  a young  sweet thing  barely loosefrom the hinges of childhood least not yet fully escaped  the shiest of smiles plays underimmaculate irises  where pools theawakening promise of womanhood  there s not enough man in any manto stop him from wanting such foodfor his hunger of flesh  his hunger ofdominance  possession and evanescent bliss fugitive perfection  what she is to them  there s no sweeter sin  she s the purestof all the devils man knows   one of my favorite books of all time  very controversial dark emotional mentally stimulating  it s the only classic book of which i wanted to read  Nabokov captured Lolita in a way no one else can or will  she s a child  12 y o   and though i don t believe she s a 100  innocent  she is a victim  but i believe Nabokov wanted to put to display all the characters in his book for our judgement  not only Lolita  but the pedophile Humbert Humbert and everyone else the writing is somewhat difficult sometimes because the description gets very long in some passages  but the plot and story line are easy to understand and judge and imagine it s a very powerful book  I get goosebumps every time i think of it  I      I can t even put into words how much this book means to me  It s a masterpiece  It is a work of art  Vladimir Nabokov s writing style is like      an orgasm and a sunrise and Beethoven s Pastoral and a ballet all put together  It changed my life  It changed what I though prose could be  It changed the way I thought about words  It  like  set me free  It made me realize that I can put any words together that I wanted to  It taught me to dig down deep while I wrote and really feel for the words and link all those words together no matter what they might be  because if those are the words that I feel  then thet re the right ones to reflect my story  Anyway  this book is perfect  And offensive to most of the people in the world  But it s wonderful  One of Nabokov s controversial novel  As much as the subject matter  pedophilia is shocking and disturbing  This book is masterfully crafted and its sparkling prose is  I think unmatched  It is considered as an  erotic  novel but its never lewd  The main character is also the villain  I don t know how Nabokov did it but I feel more empathetic to the main character Humbert than the  nymphet  Lolita How could you love the main character who is a deranged maniac  Isn t that disturbing  I highly recommend this book  I would definitely read it again and again and again  One of my favorite classic novels  Nabokov achieves a breathtaking and original use of the English language in Lolita  His book comprises masterfully worded  disturbing ideas and events  my favorite sort of novel  It contains one of them most interesting and enjoyable murder scenes I ve read  and follows a painful  drawn out storyline that left me always relishing in my antsy ness  similar to the enjoyment I used to get from the pain of a loose tooth  Read it  obviously  It s a well deserved classic   Masterpiece  Really great topic  so unusual characters  just loved it  I read this book when I was in IX  that time our librarian had a strange look over me when I was taking this book from my school library     after reading in those days   early 2005 i realized why he had so  I think this is a must read for every adult if you want to feel some fantasy   as this book does contain some x  rated content that is not suitable for everyone  Love turns us all into monsters  at one point or another  Nabokov is a master of English prose  I lost count of the pages I reread aloud  relishing every last syllable   Un libro que ha introducido una palabra nueva en el diccionario Solo con eso se puede hacer una idea de la influencia que ha tenido en la literatura La trama principal es conocida por todos  un cuarenton europeo  culto  snob  profesor de literatura  se obsesiona por una nina de 12 anos  Para conseguir sus objetivos  no duda en casarse con su madre y convertirse en su tutor legal cuando esta muere en un extrano accidente Historia dificil de leer  tanto por la tematica como por la prosa rebuscada y culta de Nabokov  Es una obra maestra  muy bien escrita  rebosante de cinismo  ironia y trampas para el lector La trampa mas importante es que todo el libro es un ejercicio de meta literatura  un libro dentro de un libro  Nabokov tiene la genial idea de presentarnos todo como la version del protagonista  El no se moja  no toma partido   todo es una autobiografia donde Humbert Humbert nos cuenta lo que quiere o lo que recuerda y eso es lo mas perturbador del libro  ya que nos olvidamos que todo lo que se cuenta es SU version de los hechos   Por que debemos darla por cierta   pero lo cierto es que nos hacemos seguidores de ese personaje  oculto tras un pseudonimo  El libro se puede dividir en tres partes En la primera  para mi la mejor del libro  un Humbert lucido  cinico y tremendamente ironico  nos cuenta su vida y como conocio a Lolita  una nina de tan solo 12 anos  Sabemos que Humbert es un pedofilo  el mismo nos lo cuenta  con naturalidad  lo justifica y pretende hacernos participes de ello  haciendonos ver que la nina es consciente de no ser tan nina  pero debemos recordar siempre que estamos leyendo su version de los hechos El cinismo e ironia con la que escribe esta parte nos hace tomar simpatia  aunque no queramos  por el  Y aqui NAbokov despliega toda su cultura y refinamiento europeo con unos giros de lenguaje geniales La segunda parte  quizas la mas repetitiva  narra el viaje huida con Lolita  una road movie por la America profunda  Aqui ya empezamos a atisbar que Humbert tiene mas problemas aparte de la pedofilia  Pierde el control ferreo con el que mantuvo enganado a todo el mundo  se deja llevar  en el fondo es manejado por esa nina que no es tan inocente como parecia a la vez que consuma la aberracion de secuestrarla y violarla repetidamente  El relato empieza a perder coherencia  el autor  Humbert  recordemos  adelanta acontecimientos  vuelve atras  empieza a verse que la obsesion por Lolita es algo mas que una aberracion sexual La tercera parte  la decepcion  la busqueda de la nina perdida  el comprender que paso y finalmente el climax final  Es la caida en los infiernos de Humbert  su decadencia fisica y mental  sabemos que es un paranoico  esquizofrenico  abusa de las drogas y el alcohol  no nos lo dice claramente  lo debemos ver nosotros  hasta que finalmente encuentra a la nina  que ya no lo es  que ha envejecido prematuramente y esta le rechaza  Eso es el punto final para Humbert  que emprende la ultima mision que desemboca en un violento y estilizado climax final  largo y desagradable y una de las mejores escenas de la novela Curiosamente  es solo al final  cuando mas perturbado esta el protagonista  cuando realmente toma conciencia del dano que hizo  cuando quiere redimirse de haberle robado la vida a una nina  cuando se da cuenta de que realmente esta enamorado de ella  pero ya es tarde  muy tarde  lo unico que puede hacer ya  es vengarse en su nombre de quien verdaderamente le hizo mas dano  de quien realmente ella llego a estar enamorada  Humbert toma conciencia de su maldad pero tambien de su papel secundario en la historia  de que pese a su prepotencia snob y culta  el no era realmente nadie para Lolita  I think Nabokov is incredible  There hasn t been a time when I haven t found something new and fascinating and wonderfully subversive about Lolita  There is always a reaction to it  no matter who is reading it  A person is unable to be unaffected after reading  I m always stunned when there are some to say that Lolita is responsible for the events that occur  particularly since she is only a child  It just shows how convincing Nabokov truly is when writing a disingenuous first person narrative  Nabokov  marry me    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of my tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta I have not read a lot of classics  but so far Lolita rates as one of my favorites  The writing is magnificent  and I was hooked from the first sentence  How often do you simultaneously loathe and empathize with a character  Humbert Humbert almost convinced me that he really loved his Lolita  but as he never really got to know her  I think he was just obsessed with the idea of her  He also had all the power  so theirs could never be described as an actual relationship  Humbert Humbert is such a complex character   just as he had me under his spell and I could almost understand  but not forgive  his choices  he would shock me to the core  And poor Lolita  living with constant sexual demands  emotional abuse and having to deceive every one she knew about her real life  The total helplessness of being abused by the person that should be protecting you  The author gives us a distressing look into the mind of a pedophile  I ve never really thought about why a child would sexually appeal to someone  and who would have thought it would be for all the same reasons that most of us find them beautiful The Story  Humbert Humbert is a middle aged  frustrated college professor  In love with his landlady s twelve year old daughter Lolita  he ll do anything to possess her  Unable and unwilling to stop himself  he is prepared to commit any crime to get what he wants  Is he in love or insane  A silver tongued poet or a pervert  A tortured soul or a monster  Or is he all of these  The language and sounds of this book are amazing  Also amazing is the fact that Nabokov s first language wasn t even English After I read it for the first time  I tried to find a deeper meaning to justify the horrors in the plot  Later I read something by Nabokov which basically explained that it was just meant to be horrifying and grotesque  The reader should really just read it as a good story  That it is  I didn t read this book for a long time  thinking it simply a cliche and probably over appreciated because of it s taboo topic  I couldn t have been more wrong Lolita is beautifully written eliciting an unexpected sympathy for the main character Humbert Humbert  The writing is unexpectedly funny and heartbreaking and the tragedy is that while everything about this story is wrong it is also deeply romantic and engaging  It will set your morals on your ears and fully envelop you in the world of Humbert Humbert s deviance which is something only a truly skilled author could do  This is one of my absolute favorite books  I ve read it over and over  and every time it thrills me  Nabokov s command of the English language is staggering  as is the way he blurs the lines between Humbert Humbert and Lolita  who s in control of the situation at any given time  who s emotionally in control  who s the adult    Some passages are so gorgeous they make me catch my breath  others make me squirm uncomfortably  others make me laugh out loud  I feel like I could read this until I died and it would be new every time  I listen to this on audio and it was absolutely  dripping with color  texture  rhythm and melody  Jeffery Irons read the text and was brilliant  The text  of course  speaks for itself with intricate details  descriptions and language choices  Nabokov was a genius and master of settings  This is an amazing work  The story itself deals with terrible  terrible things  but the delivery is among the most beautiful and tingling things I have experienced   I can t possibly oversell this audiobook  read by Jeremy Irons  whom I could listen to all day long  five stars on that basis alone   But Nabokov of course is a master of language  and despite the detestable subject matter  one gets swept up in the beautiful web of words  orchestrated and yet so natural  Not to mention the curious insight into the nature of a human  however monstrous  I loved it  You enter the mind of a pedophile and you want to close the book for all the things he says  thinks and does but you can t  He seduces the reader just as much as he seduces his victims  The words my goodness the words  I was biting my nails waiting to underline the next beautifully worded sentence  So  obviously I was more in love with the prose than the plot  such torture  I recently read some of Poe s work and if you like his style of writing  you will love this   The novel Lolita written by Vladimir Nabokov is one of my favorite books of all time  It begins with Dr  Humbert Humbert  an englishmen who as a young boy was madly in love with a young girl he had met on holiday  She was the love of his life but unfortunately something tragic happens and their love cannot continue  Dr  Humbert Humbert grows up and gets his doctorate in English Literature  He eventually moves to America where the real story begins  He rents a room in New Hampshire where he meets the infamous Dolores Haze   Lolita The story itself is perverse and somewhat disturbing  yet at the same time comically beautiful  The eloquent diction used throughout the book really enhanced the pace of my reading  Nabokov s beautiful writings really displayed the tragic hopelessness that Humbert feels as he falls deeper and deeper in love with Lolita  Although as stated before  perverse  if you re a romantic then you will find this book admirable  I recommend this book for an older audience  not only because the motifs and themes behind the story are somewhat adult  but the word choice and syntax is quite mature as well  I found myself involved deeply in the book and I can t wait to read more by Nabokov   I enjoyed this book to the point that I was actually afraid to finish it  I came to a stage that I would close it just because I couldn t continue  because it was too painful for me to read  I felt Humbert s pain  and he got me clinged to this book  and even worse  obsessed with Lolita  he described her in a way that made me believe I knew her my whole life  and in a way that made me actually justify his imperious love for a young child At times I felt I was Humbert  and some times I felt I was Lolita  and somehow it made me cry just as I have lost my childhood  and at times I was the jury  and Humbert has told me the whole truth  and I believed him  and I felt I needed to free him from his obsession  LOLITA became a success because of its  scandalous  content  The truth is that it s a lot more unique for its style  which is incredibly lush and beautiful  almost every sentence working on multiple levels  Page by page  this is probably the finest novel ever written  A 20 page essay could be written about almost any page  It s that good  and it s this    not the  scandal     that most stays with me  The subject matter of this book is disturbing  obviously  However  it was still a great book  The writing is so well done  and the characters so intriguing that it keeps you reading  I would like to reread the annotated version to pick up a little more of the nuances of the writing  This was written so well  I thoroughly enjoyed this book while at the same time being completely disgusted with the narcissistic  pedophile narrator  I also needed a dictionary to keep up with Nabokov s collection of pornographic SAT words  The version I read  0679723161  has a note from Nabokov in the back that was pretty interesting  He talks about the process of writing Lolita  If I can figure out how  I will post the words I looked up  though it looks like the internet is full of dictionaries devoted to Lolita vocabulary   Gorgeous Prose  an aesthetic joy to read  however for some reason it wasn t something that i found easy to read at points  Sometimes difficult to keep hold of what is happening  That being said I could almost certainly pick this back up crack it open at any page and enjoy  Certainly seems to deserve its status as a classic  I don t know if you can really ALWAYS count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  but in the case of Humbert Humbert  it s certainly true Words are strung together so beautifully that it s so easy to get caught up in the poetry and imagry despite the subject matter  Check out the audio book  read by Jeremy Irons  if you can  I give this book all 5 stars because of the art of the writing  That is  take it apart into each of it s pieces  Take it down into the pieces  character  plot  concrete descriptions  oddities  and the sentence by sentence  you might not agree with the material  which is the only reason I even feel like I need to defend my stars   but as far as story telling  it deserves all 5 stars  I loved this book  it was an uncomfortable read  but then it would be due to the subject matter  One reads this book from the point of view of the villain  Humbert  he is not likeable  and it is clear Nabkov does not like him either  but that is what makes it all the more interesting  and funny  Scary Humbert Horror movies   ghosts like chucki  It etc  never scared me   not because I m really brave  which I m not  but simply because they were not real  What rather scared me were criminals like Hannibal Lecter or Joker  Dark Knight  or John Kramer  from  Saw  movies   because they seemed so real   men who had their philosophy  who had reasons for doing what they did  You would think men with such mentality can exist in real world  Humbert is one of this latter category   only much more real and thus scarier This guy has art   he can be poetical  can make you confuse his lust into what he  want everybody to see  as love  He invents pseudo logic   coining terms like nymphets  He uses the word to describe a girl who has reached sexual maturity earlier than her age but he conveniently forgets to mention that sexual maturity doesn t come with mental maturity  He tells you he wasn t D s first lover but ignored the control that he exercised over Lolita  That his Lolita was still an innocent child after all Once you devoid him of the art with words   what is left behind is a sex addict  At least in whole of first part  he comes out as a sex addict who would do anything to have his desires  Just look at the facts   he marries Dolly s mother to have the child  Is this the way of a lover  He excuses his actions by telling us that he wants to have his desires without harming anyone but then he fell deeper and deeper  He even gets ideas of killing the mother  He couldn t stand against the temptation to rape her for a single day  He hits the bottom by planning to get a second Lolita from her   and then may be a third one He is afraid that he won t be able to  love  Doleras   once she is an adult  Think of an old guy who would say he doesn t love his wife because she is too old now  Won t you be quick to call him pervert He takes special pains to have Dolly s submission How much will you value the consent of a twelve year old who just lost her mother  her father  her only family now wants to have sex with her and  as Humbert keeps reminding us  who is just discovering her sexuality      And you must not read much in that he still loved her years later or that she loved him back  They had developed a habit of each other  It wasn t love  if love is not just a stupid habit The guilt and the remorseIt is only when she runs away  and thus it is too late  that he remembers what his lust cost the child  May be  much of what he did was because of a difference in sexual interests   that nature made him so  It was his tragedy  The acts of madness towards end completed his fall  What annoys me is that he took Doleras down with himself You are not supposed to like him  Look at what it did to the girl  His opinions are not that of author  At least to me  the book is like those works of art   think Salman Rushdi s Satanic Verses  through which the artist is trying to point the world to its dirty realities  Most of us want to turn our gaze away   want to forget such things  Yet  these artists   like that boy who laughed at the king in H C  Anderson s tale  Emperor s new clothes  can t lie to themselves and   not only that they will keep pointing that us  whatever we choose to make of the information  Humbert points out that he was so because of his sexual interests and argues there so many others like him  It is this really that author has pointed out  You can t derive an author s opinion from that of his protagonist Hamburg and Emma Besides giving appearance of an ancient Greek tragedy set in modern times  it also reminded me of Madame Bovary  Not only are both books based on taboos but both of them are highly realistic   with out moralizing  and consists of characters who backs their actions with romantic reasons  Both Hamburg and Lolita meet tragic ends   and their lust ruin lives of many others as well I shouldn t love this  and I shouldn t feel sorry for a pedophile but the way Nabokov writes makes you feel almost sympathetic for Humbert Humbert  it makes you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable and exposed and that s what I love so dearly about this book The plot itself was AWFUL  And by awful I don t mean it was poorly written or outlined  I mean the idea of a 40 something year old man having a love affair with a preteen girl was awful  and I shouldn t have found this book so beautiful  The language was beautiful  the way Nabokov weaved his words together was just extraordinary  Absolutely exquisite writing style  A bit dense at times but I m not complaining I absolutely enjoyed everything about this  I liked the way it made me feel especially   uncomfortable  at some times even exposed  As a young female reading the very intimate thoughts of a pedophile I felt extremely vulnerable and uncomfortable  even if they were just words on a page  knowing that there are sick people out there who are like this  who truly think this way and see young girls in such a way    it is really horrifying to read  I loved that  A really great book  beautifully written  one of my favourites  to be honest  Holy Shit  hvor er den her godt skrevet  Kompositionen er klassisk  skrevet i tre akter

satan  I had never read this novel until very recently  After constantly seeing it on various  Best Novels of the 2oth Century  lists over the years  I determined that I should actually read it  A good decision  it turns out  The language and writing are absolutely fabulous  It is easy now to appreciate all the acclaim for this novel and for Nabokov in general  As I was reading  I was continuously noticing little masterpieces  paragraphs and even individual sentences  It is worth mentioning that  unlike the relatively benign James Mason character in the film adaptation  Humbert Humbert as written by Nabokov is utterly depraved  I have since picked up a volume of Nabokov s short stories and I also intend to read  Pale Fire  in the future  The word name Lolita always had a negative connotation for me  I became familiar with it at a relatively young age  when a famous villain in Bollywood used to say this name in a movie whenever he used to get horny on seeing a damsel  Aauu   Lalita  Lolita as I used to thought    my Indian friends should know  And then I had an aunt I was not much fond of  whose name was Lalita and I used to call her Lolita   unlovingly When I was in 6th or 7th standard  we had a Physical Education teacher  Pun fully intended   who according to the complaints by some girls and the rumors that were doing the rounds was accused of inappropriate behavior towards the girl students  And the complaints were True  He was later fired  scandalously  or resigned  quietly  much to the relief of many  How we all gossiped  Oh how cheeeeeap  Doesn t he have mother or daughters at home  At that time we didn t know that there is a bloody term for such swines  The categorization of things were quite simple  it used to be either Good or Bad and in case of Bad  the reaction mostly settled at   Oh let s not talk about it   Yes  Don t talk about it  The charm of convenience  In this book however  Nabokov talked and how mercilessly he did  It was few years later that I became aware of the existence of the book named Lolita written by a writer whose name I couldn t pronounce then and already adjudged the book as DIRTY and never to be read   ever  I was not always a reader and never encouraged to be one till the age of 19 and even when I became one  I had the task of becoming a broad minded reader from a narrow minded one and I am solely responsible for this transition  Big Deal  No  not really  it s just that this arrangement made me appreciate various forms of arts especially movies  music and books and then of course  Lolita became as a must read  while I was exploring the sea of words around the world  The brilliance of Nabokov would have been established in my mind had I read any other book by him  but Lolita  the seductress that she is  demanded to be read before any of those books and reading it is what I did  This chef d oeuvre is glowing with perfection  Every word of this text is emitting a light of such splendor that for it being readable by someone  it had to dim a little by its despicable theme  Pedophilia  And that theme could be the sole reason why it is detest by many  Is it a fair reaction  Of course it is  Is the filth containing between words too much for one to handle  May be  Did Nabokov played a master stroke by pulling off one hilarious passage after another and making the reader laugh Hard while talking about Humbert s vicious intentions  That s why he s great  Right  These are some questions I asked myself on the surface  but there were many other questions waiting to be answered that had a more generic role with respect to this book  Wikipedia describes this book as a Tragicomedy but I beg to differ  I didn t feel any remorse or sympathy towards Humbert at the end  view spoiler  when he realized his love for Dolores  hide spoiler   and how he was manipulated but it all seemed  fair enough  to me  As far as Dolores is concerned  her character sketch  her playfulness  her awareness about her impact on Humbert and the fate she faced at the end was the perfect recipe to be consumed by readers to produce a pitiful belch at the most  because as must have noticed by many  the whole damn narration is from Humbert s point of view and poor    Dolores was more or less left at the mercy of worthy unworthy readers  But since Humbert himself confessed his intentions  his dilemmas  his happiness  his sadness  he might have believed himself as a victim of a tragedy and him being an anti hero  But whatever is the case  it was not easy being one of the members of the so called Jury that Humbert addressed his readers as  There was a constant tug of war between various emotions that I experienced while reading the book  Following are some examples  I adore her so horribly No   horribly  is the wrong word  The elation with which the vision of new delights filled me was not horrible but pathetic  I qualify it as pathetic  Pathetic because despite the insatiable fire of my venereal appetite  I intended  with the most fervent force and foresight  to protect the purity of that twelve year old child    Hmmmm Thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into Lo s hair from behind  and then gently clasping them around the nape of her neck  I would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a quick connection before dinner          The most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest  in which they were involved   Now you re saying  but it s too late  And the loving adjectives Humbert used for his misfortunate wife  Phocine  my brand new large as life wife  etc   Hahaha  I can t say what was more unbearable  the irony of the whole thing  the magnificence of Nabokov s prose or the study of one s own character that could be one possible purpose behind writing this work of art  I really don t care about this interpretaion Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America  I was laughing while spitting expletives  I identified a potential murderer in me  Yes  If Humbert was real  I would have killed him   I questioned myself about the set of morals that govern our civilized world and consequently questioned my role in executing such morals in real life  What was good in my upbringing that I ve become the person that I m today and what was is wrong in the upbringing of Humberts and Lolitas of the world that made them self destructive  And lastly  what is the extent of dependence of one person on another that cultivates the deadly emotions like obsession  possessiveness and LOVE  I m having a strong inclination towards studying Psychology Anyway  I recommend this book to those who LOVE to read  not like but love  else it won t be easy to marvel at the wonder of this outstanding painting of words  If Nabokov said that of all his books Lolita had left him with the most pleasurable afterglow  then it will left you with that afterglow too after reading it If Nabokov said that Lolita is his favorite and she was like the composition of a beautiful puzzle  then you would love to solve that puzzle If Nabokov said that he shall never regret Lolita  then being a reader one won t ever regret reading it   GOD DAMN THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN  EVER  IT ALSO INCLUDES THE VERY BEST POEM ABOUT UNREQUITED LOVE AND LONGING EVER WRITTEN  IT IS A MASTERPIECE  AND EVERY REVIEW SHOULD BE IN ALL CAPS  ALWAYS SO EVERYONE CAN FEEL ITS AWESOME POWER  IF YOU HAVEN T READ THIS  YOU ARE DEPRIVING YOURSELF OF AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE  My favorite book  If I could give it six stars  I would I read this book on a road trip from California to New Mexico between driving shifts in that tiny green Geo Metro that belonged to my parents  I think I bought the book for  1 25 at a used bookstore called Best Books where they would clean the paperbacks with lighter fluid I didn t know what to expect from this book  and I remember reading that first paragraph about 10 times before going further  I was in love with it from the get go  and I don t recall ever feeling so close to a narrator as I did to Humbert Humbert  of all people It s a book clearly written by a person who loves language     you could almost sing it out loud  I still remember how I went to bed that night in a tiny hotel room in Las Vegas  New Mexico  with nothing on my mind but passages from this book  I read it again the next day It really worked quite a spell on me  as this bizarre review demonstrates rather astutely  I read this first perhaps 8 or 9 years ago and immediately fell in love  Never has the first page of a book grabbed me like Nabakov s Lolita  I will never tire of this fine read  I could gush all day long about this book  Simply put  if you haven t already or even if you have    just read it  This is more a comment than a review  but I got a real kick out of reading all the comments about the pedophilia and everyone s horror of it  Then I went over to THE TWILIGHT SAGA and read all the reviews of how everyone loved those books  I was left to conclude that a mature man making moves on an under aged girl is acceptable if that man looks like a 19 year old   Edward is what    112   Humbert was the predator  Lolita was the prey  But wait    Edward is a predator    really    he s a vampire  Okay   so he marries Bella    but he s still 90 years older than she  So the question I would ask is    would LOLITA be more acceptable if Humbert had married her  Bij elke zin  elke gedachte is het likkebaarden  En neen  dat komt niet door het onderwerp van het boek  pedofilie   maar door de absolute beheersing van deze schrijver van de Engelse taal en zijn unieke beschrijvende kracht waarmee hij onze alledaagse  quasi onbewuste gedachtegangen ontrafelt en schaamteloos blootlegt  en dat is meestal geen mooi zicht  En dan doet Nabokov nog zijn beklag dat hij met het Engels bijlange zo goed niet uit de voeten kan als met het Russisch  met zijn ontelbare fijngevoeligheden Je wordt er nederig van  Excellent  And discomforting  Jag har last ett par klassiker pa gymnasiet  Jag har last ett par klassiker efter det  Men jag har aldrig last Lolita av nagon konstig anledning  Kan vara att jag tycker jag har aldern inne nu  Detta ar inget man laser nar man ar 16 for da kan man latt misstolka vissa grejer kanske  Jag vet inte  Jag ger mig inte in i det  Men vad jag vet ar att detta var sa ofantligt bra  Hade jag fatt valja en bok i min bokhylla att bli signerad av levande dod forfattare hade det blivit Lolita  Den ar bara sa bra  Relationen mellan pedofilen Humbert och nymfetten Lolita ar bara sa vidrig egentligen men anda sa vacker  Laser ni boken sa se aven till att lasa efterorden av Nabokov  Nu ska jag se filmen med Jeremy Irons  Ni ska bara veta hur manga ar jag vantat pa det   This seriously has to be the most wonderful hardest book I have ever read  It took me months to finish  Even with that being said  it was incredibly well written and downright amazing  I wasn t always in the mood to read a book with such heavy content but  when I did  I became engrossed in the tale  If you haven t read this book    do it  Its a classic for a reason   Despite its critical acclaim  I ve postponed reading this novel for many years due to its subject matter  And even after beginning the novel I had difficulties bringing myself to read it  I find crimes against children particularly difficult to stomach Having said that  I must now honestly confess that this is one of the greatest novels I ve ever read  Nabokov s writing is comparable to Tolstoy s in his ability to portray human emotion  He writes with such description and such honesty that the images leave an indelible mark  The last chapter contains images that are so profoundly sad  yet so beautiful  that I actually sobbed  I highly recommend this book for very mature readers who appreciate great writing  I was introduced to Lolita by Lana Del Rey  I know  I know  but as a 14 year old who goes to a Christian school I really didn t have many ways to be introduced to one of the most controversial books of all time  Either way I read the book because of her and I watched the movies because of her  Yippie  I watched the movies first  I watched them in chronological order and I loved both  though the 97 version was better because the 62 version dealt with censorship and Kubrick fucking up the script  but what inspired me to read the book was when somebody said that they wanted to read Lolita from Dolores  point of view  Well it turns out that book already exists  it is called Lo s Diary and it was by some Italian woman who s name I m too lazy to look up and from what I ve read on this website it suckedHardHopefully when I take my hand at telling Lolita from Lo s point of view it won t be so bad  And sadistic  I downloaded a PDF of the book onto my phone  illegally  fight me  and I read the entire time For the review I will be using gifs and pictures from both movies  I will only be using images that match what happened in the book so expect a lot of 1997 pictures Anyway  here is my review for Vladimir Nabokov s Lolita  The story starts with  Humbert Humbert  a French man  played by James Mason in the 62 movie and by Jeremy Irons in the 97 movie  telling about his romance with a girl just a few months younger than him named Annabelle  The summer before he started ninth grade Humbert fell in love with Annabelle and she loved him just as well  They spent their summer at the beach  going out  doing everything that teenagers did  and every night they would desperately try to have sex only for somebody to walk in on them  Sadly near the end of the summer Annabelle dies and Humbert is left heartbroken and begins the rest of his days searching for a girl just like his lost love   For the next two decades Humbert sits on playgrounds watching girls playing  he fantasizes about school girls  he has an affair with a prostitute who acts childish  and he even marries a woman who also still has that childlike wonder about her  You see Humbert likes a special breed of girls called nymphets  Nymphets aged 9 to 14  which reminds me I m on my last year of being a nymphet  This might actually be a good thing  are sexually precocious girls who know how to tempt a man  This is what Humbert is desperately looking for  In May of 1947 Humbert moves to Ramsdale to prepare for a semester of teaching at Beardsley  He was going to stay at the McCoo s house  and fondle their 12 year old daughter Ginny in his native  humbertish   but the house burned down before he got there and so he ends up touring the Haze house  according to the foreword Haze is not their real last name but rhymes with it  He then meets Charlotte  played by Shelly Winters in the 62 movie and by Melanie Griffith in the 97 movie   Charlotte is pushy  has no filter  and smokes a lot    She also gives the most boring tour in the world and so just when Humbert is about to give up they go out into the backyard and he meets 12 year old Dolores Haze  played by Sue Lyon in the 62 movie and aged to 14 and played by Dominique Swain in the 97 movie and most likely aged to 13   And so Humbert moves in right away and luckily for him Dolores likes him as much as he likes her  Unluckily for him Charlotte also likes him  A lot of flirting ensues    That summer Charlotte decides to send Dolores to a summer camp and right before she leaves she gets brave and   While Dolores is at camp Charlotte decides it would be best to send her to a boarding school and so Humbert marries Charlotte just so he can stay close to his little darling nymph  But the honeymoon doesn t last long when Charlotte finally gets into Hum s journal and finds out the truth  While trying to fix everything Charlotte rushes out of the house to mail letters to Lo telling her about the man Humbert Humbert truly is and she gets run over by a car  She dies immediately  Humbert goes to pick up Lo and they kiss for the very first time since she left for camp  They then go to The Enchanted Hunters where Humbert drugs her and plans on molesting her but since the drugs didn t work too well she keeps waking up and going back to sleep before Hum can put his hands on her  However the next morning Lo tells him about this little  game  she played with this boy named Charlie at camp and GUESS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT It isn t until the very next day that Humbert tells her what really happened while she was at camp  From August 1947 to August 1948 they travel all over the United States  Each and every day they have more sex and Dolores gets sick of Humbert  She makes him make multiple stops because if not they ll only stop for food  the bathroom  and sex  At some point Lo starts earning money which turns into a huge fight between the two of them In 1948 Dolores starts an all girl s school in Beardsley  There she sneaks around with boys her age  becomes very secretive  and seems even more annoyed with him than she ever did before  She then wants to star in the school play and although he doesn t want her to she eventually convinces him to let her do it   NOTE  in the book she doesn t get to do the play but in the 62 movie she gets to star in it  I just needed to use a 62 picture  One night Humbert gets a call from Lo s piano teacher that she has missed two weeks of practices  He confronts her about it which then leads into a huge fight between them  She tells him about how he tried to touch her while they lived in Ramsdale and he responds by slapping her This does not end well  She ends up running away and Humbert finds her sometime later in a phone booth talking to somebody  Lo tells him that she wants to get away from Beardsley and that she doesn t want to do the play anyway  They go on another trip but this one lasts a bit shorter when Dolores gets incredibly sick  Humbert takes her to the hospital and when he goes to pick her up again  She s gone  Apparently her  uncle  picked her up and took her away the day before From 1949 to 1952 Hum searches high and low for Dolores  He then asks a woman named Rita for help but she s really only around for like five paragraphs so she was pointless  One day in 1952 Humbert gets a letter from a Mrs  Dolly Schiller  He goes to the address and finds out that Dolores is now pregnant and married  It turns out back during their travels a man named Clare Quilty was the man who wrote the play that Dolly stared in back in seventh grade and that s where they met  She told Quilty about Humbert and they began conspiring so that she can run away  When Lo finally got better he picked her up and drove her to Duk Duk Ranch where she found out he was into some 50 Shades shit  Clare wanted her to star in some porn but she said no and so he kicked her out along with some other girl named Fay Dolores and Fay worked at odd jobs until Fay did   something   and Dolly met Richard Schiller  They got married and now they re expecting a baby and will move to Alaska after Humbert gives them some money Hum gives the Schiller s a lot of money and then goes to find the man who took his darling nymph from him He finds Clare Quilty s mansion  breaks in  kills him and is then arrested  In his jail cell he writes Lolita  or Confessions of a White Widowed Male  and at the very end wishes the best for Dolores  Richard  and the baby  Sadly Humbert dies of heart failure in November of 1952 and Dolores dies in child birth while giving birth to a still born baby girl on Christmas day 1952 Holy shit  This story was intense  Before I give my overall feelings I need to give my interpretation Humbert Humbert is an unreliable narrator which means he twists the story in his own words to make it as sad  as upsetting  as happy  or as romantic as he wants  Because of this everyone has their own interpretations of this story Dolores never had a good relationship with her mother and so she turned to books for friendship and knowledge and through these books she learned about sex  She ended up knowing way too much for a 12 year old girl and so when she lost her virginity to Charlie they called it  games  so that way they wouldn t get in trouble with the camp counselors  At The Enchanted Hunters when she and Humbert first did it she thought it would be like some love affair  it would be a forbidden romance because she genuinely liked him but as he used her and abused her and started raping her and keeping her prisoner she realized that he didn t really love her he loved the idea of her and her ageIt s obvious throughout the entire book that Dolores hates Humbert but she seduces him and acts like she loves him so that she can get money and so that she can run away from him  Of course Humbert writes it so that we think that she loves him so much So my final opinion  This story is deep  It s a story of obsession  morals  and unreliable narrators  The fact that people think this is a love story is sad but like I said interpretations reign supreme with this story  5 5 stars     Revelation  Lolita isn t about love  or about sex  It s about language Lolita is not what I had expected it to be  I was expecting a dreary  unpleasant  gloomy novel that one must grit one s teeth and slog through for literary cred  The kind of book  like Of Human Bondage  that I would appreciate  but not enjoy  I was expecting to power through frank yet ironic descriptions of unspeakable acts  told dispassionately  as if daring the reader to get all up in arms about it No  no  no Lolita is so beautifully written  So luminescent and glowy that it practically sparkles  The narrator  who calls himself Humbert Humbert  sucks the reader in with his incredible use of language  Puns  alliteration  sprinkles of French  and other assorted types of wordplay abound  That is the trick of this book  It is narrated so beautifully that  before the reader even realizes it  he or she is sucked into engaging intimately with Humbert s words  His linguistic powers are so vivid  and so beautiful  that it is easy to forget that Humbert is the quintessence of Unreliable Narrator  That is  perhaps  the entire point Lolita is certainly not about Lolita  If anything  it is about Humbert Humbert s construction of Lolita  The reader is never inside Lolita s head  we learn of her only as Humbert s possession  Humbert takes away Lo s past  her self  and her humanity  In fact   Lolita  s real name is Dolores Haze  Humbert is the only character who calls her Lolita  Everyone else calls her Dolly or Lo or Dolores  So in a very real sense   Lolita  is a construct Still  we re afforded glimpses at the other side of the coin  Humbert tells us  for example  that in their first sexual encounter  Lolita seduced him   rather than the other way around  He tells us that Lolita is entirely in control of the relationship  And yet we also hear that she cries herself to sleep every night when she thinks he has dozed off  We see him control her financially and physically  He threatens and intimidates her  and continually reminds her that if she leaves him or reveals their relationship  she has nowhere to go Humbert is a terrible person  He is a rapist and a murderer and a pervert  Despite its beauty  Lolita isn t about how he is a victim of society  or how she is a manipulative young succubus  A lazy reader could conclude either of those things  perhaps   that s how damn unreliable Humbert is as a narrator  Consider his perspective of the character Clare Quilty  who is exactly his mirror  in both sexual and academic predilections  He is even described as being similar to Humbert of physical appearance  Humbert frames Quilty as a pervert  an abuser  a rapist  a monster  However when it comes down to it  Humbert and Quilty are both  objectively  the same type of predator Nabakov himself described Lolita as record of his own  love affair with the English language   In the end  it s not about whether Humbert is bad or whether Lolita is a slut or whether pedophilia is a social construct  It s about language  and how it can be used and manipulated into making lies true and terrible things beautiful  A book that will haunt me for the rest of my life  Nabokov s beautiful prose caged me in Humbert Humbert s disturbing mind from its opening lines to its last  I have zero sympathy for pedophilia  but Nabokov creates an immortal black hole in your soul for you to be simultaneously disgusted  disturbed  sad and agonized by this infamous narrator  And no  Vlad  I ll pass on the aesthetic bliss   There is great duplicity in Nabakov s choice of language  The text is enchanting  melancholic and holds a level of sophistication throughout  but its raison d etre is grounded in the mind of a pedophilic narrator  Humbert s compulsion to deceive and masquerade his actions with seductive words  in this context  for the authors empathy  is a persistent simulacrum  fulfilling his escape from guilt and morality  Whilst repulsive in content  Nabakov challenges you in a way that s hard to put down   Mi trovo a non sapere che giudizio dare  mi e piaciuto  quindi   3 stelle  ma e davvero questo cio che conta  Ultimamente sto rivalutando quanto davvero conti il  piacere  di qualcosa  se una cosa mi piace e non mi da nulla e pur sempre un piacere  O traggo qualcosa dal piacere stesso  Dai andiamo con 4 stelle  non e stata proprio una lettura perennemente piacevole  ma ancora  e questo il punto  Allora 5  no 4  ora sono stufo  3 Dicevo  l ho trovato spesso estremamente difficile da leggere  a parte le pletora di termini per cui ho dovuto consultare il dizionario  grazie Kindle   parlo proprio di di significato  del tra le righe  Ho dovuto rileggere e rileggere alcune frasi per capirne a pieno  ah  a pieno   il senso  e il tutto mi ha lasciato con la grande sensazione che questo sia uno di quei  pochi o tanti non so  non ho mai riletto nulla a parte non fiction per ora  libri che vale davvero le pena di leggere e poi ri leggere  non a caso  Curiously enough  one cannot read a book  one can only reread it  A good reader  a major reader  and active and creative reader is a rereader     Vladimir Nabokov  Lectures on LiteratureSe due indizi fanno 2 3 di prova direi che posso essere al 66  certo di amare questi Russi  nonostante mi affatichino parecchio  e ci metta una vita a leggerli   Mi sento coinvolto nella loro analisi psicologica  che spesso stuzzica parti nascoste di tutti   mi sento ignorante alle loro citazioni letterario storiche che non colgo  e mi sento anche stupido a leggerne alcune recensioni che mi fanno subito saltare all occhio elementi che avrei dovuto vedere ma che invece mi sono passati sotto lo sguardo in sordina  e allora si  rileggero Quindi a tra qualche mese o anno Lolita  per ora starai nella mia nuova  shelf  per cio che voglio ri rileggere  e la prossima volta credo optero di leggerti su un edizione con note   Lolita  luce della mia vita  fuoco dei miei lombi   I read this when I was in my early 20s and thought it was the most romantic and sad book I d ever read  It wasn t until I started Reading Lolita in Tehran that I realized it was far more subtle than that  I feel like an idiot and no longer trust myself to interpret any work of fiction more complicated than a Harlequin romance  I suck  This goes on my list of the most influential pieces of literature I ve ever read  So complex  so full of moral ambiguity  Much like human beings  When I read it first  I was so disturbed  I didn t even want to look at it again  Many years later  I did  and read it a second time and was no less disturbed but by then was able to appreciate Nabokov s ability to communicate  with such a light touch  such heavy subject matter  Love and hate this book  Nabokov hated Humbert  And rightly so  because Humbert is not the romantic  tragic figure he wanted himself to be viewed  He is an incestuous  rapist pig and a murderer  plain and simple  He took advantage of a young girl  A twelve year old girl  Sure  she fooled around at summer camp  but a lot of young girls start discovering sex at that age  That doesn t give adults pretext to rape them  and if you have that mentality  you re screwed up  It s easy to get seduced by the prose  but you have to remember what Humbert is I read this last year and while I was blown away by the prose  I managed to keep my head and remember Humbert is not the victim  Dolores is  To quote one of my favourite movies  Hard Candy  which  funny enough  also dealt with paedophilia    It s just so  easy  to blame a kid  isn t it  Just because a girl knows how to imitate a woman does  NOT  mean she s ready to do what a woman does   So when I m looking for good books to read  I rely on various  best of  lists  and some are pretty disappointing  However  I fell in love with  Lolita   The tags to define the style and genre include categories such as  russia    modern classics    adult    novels   but the one key missing tag is  genius   I cannot fathom the pure craftsmanship of psychology behind this work  The mastery of the mind and language by Nabakov in this book is just astounding  I love it  and there s no way to know based on these generic tags how amazing this book is  So richly written  and Iron s voice makes Nabakov s words even more succulent  So  not the content as much as the psychology and genius of this book is what truly captivates me  Please suggest other works you have found of similar caliber    processing  I am not going to review this book  It is by far the best book I have ever read  and  frankly  I lack the sophistication to analyze it at length  I have never read a book that so eloquently and beautifully uses the English language  It is the story of Humbert Humbert  and his ultimately failed love and obsession with Dolores Haze  You can read a systematic plot summary here   Simply one of the best written novels of all time  This was an incredible read  I had read this in my apartment right after I finished law school  I was now a lawyer working for one of the Big 5 at the time  It was a great job  I had also just purchased a leather chair and ottoman to read my books in  I got a hold of this book off of a list  I read it  I blushed  I searched my apartment in fear that the police were going to burst in and arrest me  The first 2 3rds of this book  might be the finest thing ever written  The book  in my opinion  implodes  Yet  the magic that this book created   how I saw Humbert Humbert   it was all amazing  A truly great book   This is a poem disguised as a novel  I love reading it out loud  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  That s the most beautiful beginning   Wow  I loved it  So interesting  so well researched and written  Sadly such a fun and interesting and exciting read  Yes disgusting  but there are people like Prof  Humbert out there  One of my top 3 favorite books of all time and I can t imagine it being knocked out of that spot ever  I personally listened to it  via Jeremy Irons and he absolutely knocked it out of the park    Anyone who does not give this book 5 stars does so based upon the fact that it can be considered crude and offensive  Nabokov s flawless prose is what made me fall in love with this book  and the rest of his works   He is a master of wordplay  and you are truly left in awe wondering how anyone  let alone a man who s first language is Russian  has such a mastery of the written word  This is certainly a MUST READ for anyone who loves the art of language  One of my favorite books of all time  It was called by I think the ny times as the only real love story of our time  I would have to agree  Nabokovs writing style is just intoxicating and written  as Humbert Humbert admits  like a madman  I ve read this about a dozen times and will read it two dozen more times by the time I die   A despicable villain tells an artful  amusing  entertaining  insightful and distorted  tale of personal exploits that virtually no one would approve  Lolita s villainous and unreliable narrator  as a character study or psychological profile  is as much a page turning focus of interest as the novel s well crafted plot and deftly drawn  very inappropriate heroine   I can t believe that this masterpiece sat on my bookshelf for a number of years before I actually got through the book  I purchased the book because of its reputation as being a great literary work  but then found myself too disgusted with both the subject matter and the quotation on the front of the novel proclaiming it to be the only believable love story ever written  I mean seriously who could consider characterizing a relationship based on pedophelia as a love story  Throughout the years  I would take this book down from the shelf  read the first paragraph or two and ultimately return the book to its shelf  Some time would pass and I would start the process all over again  One only has to read the first paragraph of Lolita to see that Nabakov is a master at prose and the fact that he wrote the book in his third or fourth language is a testament to his genius  Knowledge of Nabakov s prose kept luring me back and ultimately my inner strugged finally ended and I am glad that it did because the book was well worth the read  Nabakov is a master of prose and the book in no way attempts to legitimze pedophelia   Nabokov s use of language is nothing short of stunning  Lolita reads as a dark  sometimes comedic parable  The story unravels a disturbing commentary not only on the nature of obsession but on romantic relationships  no matter how flawed   dstn gyryy dsht w mnw b khwdsh khshwnd w dr khthr mwrd mn rw b khwdsh twnst hmrh khnh

khh ynj nyftmsh Despite my personal belief that everyone should read it  this book is not for everyone  If you are in the mood for relatable characters with simple developmental arcs that tie up in a neat little feel good ending  look elsewhere  If you simply don t have the time to spend dissecting the layer upon layer of satirical allegory and word play  move on This book is not easy in any sense and that is what makes it a classic  It is truly timeless  containing clever references to the political currents present at the time of its writing  nested within an overarching allegory on the fragility of civilization Nabokov prided himself on a sly sense of humor and considered his books to be more of a game played between author and reader than a simple narrative  Lolita is the epitome of this philosophy  treading the line between outright hilarity and heartbreak while simultaneously barraging the reader with non stop inside jokes  esoteric references  and even puns Far from becoming bogged down in complexity  the story straddles its inherent paradox with ease  maintaining a captivating pace even as our heroes stumble through a fog of lust and ego  and painting a picture of nightmarish banality with a beauty that will take your breath away  The characters  Humbert and Lolita  occasionally captivating but more often despicable and one dimensional  are not the main attraction  Its only once the reader abstracts a little away from the deliberate grotesqueries of the plot that the true magic is revealed  Nabokov s mastery of language is awe inspiring  An accomplished logodaedalist  he coined  nymphet  among many others  his delight in word play is evident and contagious  At times his prose is even melodic  I find myself stuck on a line for days at a time  running it over and over in my head like a particularly catchy beat      the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo Lee Ta  Now stop and consider that English was not his first  or even his second language Lolita is a masterpiece of American fiction  It is a peek into the workings of a great mind and a seminal study in language  It saddens me to think that so many people will put this book aside without further examination  burn it and ban it  when just past the deliberately horrifying premise is a genuinely joyful celebration of the human spirit in all its absurdity   All I can say is that Vladimir Nabokov is a genius writer  No one can deny that this isn t a well written book  It is no wonder it is considered a classic  However  I never really made a connection with the story so I can t say I actually enjoyed the book  But it is wonderfully written  The descriptions are so rich that sometimes you forget you re dealing with such a disgusting main character as a narrator   This instantly became one of my favourite books after reading it  I just can t say anything that would do it justice  Nabokov is a wonderful stylist and Lolita is absolutely captivating and breathtaking  I was surprised at every twist and in suspense about what would happen throughout reading the whole novel  Just stunning  I have heard a lot about this book which is what made me want to read it  read it a few years ago and it still resonates in me  Yes it is about a creepy pedophile but the way the book is written  how something that is a controversial topic can be written so damn beautifully bears a deeper look into it  I will most likely read it again  this book surprised me  What surprised me that dispite the situation in the story the story itself has a wonderful flow of language and style and reads smoothly  like dark chocolate  if a bit of hemlock added to it  A tour de force of the English language  Brilliantly composed  full of puns and anagrams  most impressively penned in the author s 4th language  the content may disgust the puritanically minded reader  but the real love affair is not between the lecherous old man and the young nymphet  but between Nabakov and words   This is absolutely just wow  A must read for open minded people  I am deeply intrigued by this book  I have been thinking about it and all the  layers  since I finished reading it You can look at this novel in two ways  basic paedophilia or look more into it   peel back the layers in a sense   try to understand the feelings surrounding the book Humbert loses his first love at a young age  only to be haunted by his love for the rest of his life  trying to find her in other women  This is course does not work for him  in order to have his love back he needs to go back  he finds love in a young girl  In a way  rekindling his childhood love On one hand people may think Humbert deserved what he got in the end  how Lolita betrayed him  left him for another man and how his dramatic life ended  On the other  all Humbert wanted was to feel love like he did as a young man   to have someone love him as much as he loves them You can tell Humbert s feelings towards Lolita were true  A tragic love story gone wrong  There are many emotions surrounding this novel  betrayal  love  lust  confusion  As the novel goes on  the feelings just keep building up   this book is one of the most addictive and terrifying tales I ve ever read  I couldn t put it down and finished it in record time and will probably read it again in a few years  it s one of those books from which you pick up things with each reading  my love for Nabokov knows no limits   I was hooked on this book from the minute I picked it up  and only slowed down in reading it when I realized just how much the narrative lulls you into liking the main character  and trusting him  You find yourself liking Humbert Humbert  before remembering what he really is  and suddenly feeling like a bad person for liking him   This is good testament to Nabokov s writing  which is amazing  That being said I don t know what dark night of the soul led to him thinking of and writing this    Beacause you took adavantage of a sinnerbeacause you took advantagebeacause you tookbeacause you took advantage of my disadvantagewhen I stood Adam nakedbefore a federal law and all its stinging stars     Don t think I can go on Heart head   everything  Lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita lolita Repeat till the page is full  printer   Finished this book on 17th September  2007 right in the morning 3 00 AM   which brings me to office on a Monday morning drowsy and full of sleep   but I am thrilled   I can feel the obsession  the frustration of Humbert Humbert of losing his true love again   well most of the people have interpreted this art of literature as an erotic piece   to sell their movies  plays  editions   etc but no it is not an erotic piece of literature    as in the foreword  there is not even a single sentence which pores out of any word or dialogue which can make it a pornographic read In one line  it is a story of a boy called Humbert who loses his love Annabel at the age of around 12 13 and such powerful was his obsession for that girl that the boy remained in love with her  even after she was dead  He started seeing her in other similarly aged young girls  which can be termed as inappropriate  immoral etc  and when he sees a girl in his new rented place  girl to whom he gets easily access to    becomes his Annabel   He loses his Annabel again in the last and that is what made this novel a bittersweet ending  Happy becuase an immoral guy like Humbert suffers   and sad because a lover loses his love again   never to find again  infact my favorite piece in the whole book was the paragraph in which he begs Lolita to come back to him   frustrated  dying and yet wanting to live life with his lover   Anyone who wants to read an unconventional and powerful book it is a must read  I loved the way VN has created each and every scene   created the tempo and left the reader there  challenging the reader to read on  Para mim  Lolita e o melhor exemplo da historia da literatura de como o talento de um escritor determina a grandeza de uma obra  Se formos pensar bem  a trama de Lolita e de romance de segunda categoria  Um homem de meia idade fica obcecado por uma menina de 12 anos ao ponto de se casar com a mae dela  a fim de nao perde la de vista  E ha um assassinato  Um romance policial psicologico tao ao gosto dos americanos  E essa imagem fica ainda forte ja que o livro se passa nos EUA dos anos 1950  Mas a linguagem de Nabokov e arrasadora  O discurso do narrador e ironico  perspicaz  melancolico  patetico  delirante  profundo  O texto e uma delicia em si  Os comentarios do protagonista a respeito dos outros personagens sao verdadeiras perolas de crueldade interior  All I can really say  and it s not very intelligent is    wow  I read it because it was on the Modern Library of 100 Best English Fiction books and was intrigued when I read reviews about it  What struck me the quickest was how well written it is  Nabokov has an extraordinary command of language and how he manipulates the imagery of the books draws you in from the outset  The subject matter is creepy and there s no getting around that  the narrator is a pedophile   but Nabokov treads very lightly  It s a gripping  sad story about one s man s obsession and personal demons and the effect of these on his victim s life  I don t get the quote on the cover by Vanity Fair  I m paraphrasing   The most convincing love story of our time   It s not a love story  even though the narrator would have us believe it is  It s one perverts massive attempt to justify his sickness  His love is for a creation of his own imagination which he imposes on a child  His love is not kind  caring  protective  respectful or gentle and certainly not reciprocated willingly  This would be a good book for a Book Club as it could get some real interesting polemic going   A masterpiece  Nothing else to say  One of the most well written books that I have ever read  I never thought that I could empathize with a hebaphile but I I did  I would constantly have to sit the book down and remind myself that the protagonist is sick  Amazing book   As a new born Nabokovian with only Lolita  several times over  and now half of Ada or Ardor under my belt  i feel the need to pause here for a moment and consider how i wish to proceed in this devastating love affair  i haven t the education or sophistication to express the kind of scholarly appreciation worthy of this dear man s work  only a Magdalene wish that  were he here  i might lay my cheek against Mr  Nabokov s thigh and thank him  and his Vera  tearfully for such beauty   This quote basically sums it up In response to an American critic who characterized Lolita as the record of Nabokov s  love affair with the romantic novel   Nabokov wrote that  the substitution of  English language  for  romantic novel  would make this elegant formula more correct   Nabokov uses the English language as huge phallic rapier to stab your face  And  like  IT IS NOT EVEN HIS FIRST LANGUAGE GUYS  He basically crafted the world s most well written  most interesting  most incredible dick joke  I d give this the  six star  rating  but honestly  sometimes it is way freaking creepy  I in no way approve of abusive relationships pedophilia but this is simply an enchanting book  It s dark and violent  yet eerily beautiful  It has created an ache in my heart for Dolores that will never be filled  Humbert destroyed a real girl and filled her with fantasies and his own desires  It s devastating  this book  It evokes a sort of nostalgia for some strange  sad childhood summer that never happened   Nabokov is a master  He expertly uses all the tricks of the trade that go generally unemployed by most contemporary writers  The story moves so well that if you blink you might miss his magic  his sleight of hand  So much diabolical material between two covers  So much sex  deceit  weakness  and control  You won t be dissatisfied  Quite late to the Nabokov party  surely in part due to the author s immense popularity and quotedness on Tumblr  we could say I had some expectations regarding it all   and we could even say I had one too many expectations  albeit most of them tacit  My initial approach was like going to a museum of natural history  very critical of whatever collection of bones awaits me  made with the sole aim to impress and inspire certain thoughts  What I have found in this particular case  despite Nabokov s afterword  where he is intent on arguing against some of the possible readings of Lolita   is impossible to describe  at least in form as short as this  Not just an ode to the wondrous and monstrous English language  but a tale  a parable of sorts  about patriarchy and  male  desire  about  love  and  need  and everything in between  about its mechanisms and politics  while showing a man   to use the words of Godspeed You  Black Emperor    trapped in the belly of a horrible machine   with  the machine bleeding to death   not that I necessarily see him as a victim  quite the contrary  but sticking with him makes you look at the bigger  if not biggest picture  the maching has many faces  one of them being his own   All encompassing  rich in texture  forceful and pathetic  apologetic while offering no apologies  there are countless layers to this slow burning affair  Simultaneously exhibiting exceptional resistance and such pliability to interpretation s   Lolita is a rarely seen mix of inviting and scandalous and controversial  while being all and none of these things  Still trying to find words to make sense of it all  of the immensity and the sparsity  of the paradoxes on countless levels of narration  one thing that remains clear as day is its cult status  Not at all what it at first sight seems to be  Nabokov s novel is sure to upset you and inspire you in the ways you barely thought possible A tiny disclaimer  though  Not for the easily scandalized  In the Afterword  Nabokov suggests that  Lolita  is the record of his love affair with the English language  and it is a really beautifully written book  Because of the subject matter  I felt almost guilty to be enjoying the prose as much as I did  It was both fascinating and deeply disturbing   fy m yr lHb wm yr l khlq hl kn hnk Hb n tyqn nh lm ykn

books I have read  It is one of my all time favorites  because Nabokov s writing itself is pure art  The story is creepy and unlike anything I ve ever heard of  it is one of the reasons I was even hesitant to begin this book  but that quickly changed  I ve read it a few times now  and each time I catch something I did not previously  I can only stay silent and in awe of this book    It s true  All has been said about this master piece and yet    At the end your heart is skipping beats and your eyes tend to circle all over your space looking for something impossible to describe   Penso agli uri e agli angeli  al segreto dei pigmenti duraturi  ai sonetti profetici  al rifugio dell arte  E questa e la sola immortalita che tu e io possiamo condividere  mia Lolita  Uno dei libri piu belli che abbia mai letto  e di sicuro quello scritto meglio  Mai avrei pensato che il viaggio nella mente di una mente torpida potesse essere cosi sporco  ma di quelle macchie di cui non aspetti altro che insudiciarti l anima  Lolita e la storia di un amore deviato  ingiustificabile  e allo stesso tempo immortale come quello dei vecchi poeti  E la storia che racconta in uno stile d oro la decadenza di un uomo  un folle che spezza cio che di piu caro al mondo ha  Lolita  fuoco dei suoi lombi  anima sua  suo peccato  Ma questo libro e anche e soprattutto il pianto di uno scrittore che non puo scrivere nella lingua che ama  e che pure ci regala un capolavoro eterno Splendido e dire poco  Vladimir Nabokov is my favourite 20th century author  The manner in which he tells his stories is pure art  the man had a way with words that few others will ever hope to have  His lack of hesitation to write about dark subject matter  of course  only serves to endear him further  Wit and tragedy as presented in  Lolita  are spectacular to behold  as the story of Humbert Humbert and the fragile object of his obsession unravels in very much the same way a caterpillar reveals itself to be a butterfly  comparison made specifically because Nabokov absolutely loved butterflies   It s a one sided love story and a tale of dark obsession and madman s ramblings  which is the stuff I live to devour  so it would be of little surprise to anyone that this is one of my favourite works    My little cup brims with tiddles I sort of feel sorry for this book s reputation  Both controversial and considered a classic  it has much to live up to  What a nice surprise then  that this book lives up to it s  classic  label from the very first page  I was completely engaged in the tale of that peculiar character Humbert Humbert and his peculiar little desires and his peculiar little phrases   my little cup brims with tiddles    If the author s name wasn t such a giveaway  I d have a hard time believing English isn t Nabokov s first language  I was more than impressed with his prose throughout the book  My only regret while reading this book was being almost completely ignorant of the French language  I soon tired of Googling the French phrases he used   Naysayers will denounce this novel as nothing more than a pedophile s obsession with a twelve year old girl  Try to dig deeper  Yes  at it s core it is about a pedophile  but the book gives you a sense of desire  shame and guilt  At the end  I didn t think about the pedophile  all I thought about was the influence people have on each other  and how these influences can really dictate our decisions in life  Even if you find the book disturbing  it is hard to deny how well written it is  It s an unsettling  funny and sad tale where you find yourself sympathizing with characters whom the moment before you were angry with  for me  this applies to H H   Charlotte and Dolores Haze  There is something to take away here  as much as I thought I had Monsieur Humbert s personality figured out by the end  Nabokov surprises me again with a truly poignant reflection   At times achingly delicate  at other times stark in its darkness of subject matter  Lolita although not a love story is the most convincing obsession story of the 20th century Nabokov s great mastery here is displaying Humbert Humbert as a sympathetic and all around lovable child molester  In much the same way Ted Bundy was hopelessly alluring  Humbert is charming  well educated  and manipulative  There s one scene in particular that stands out in my mind  early on in the story  before Charlotte and Humbert marry Nabokov shows Humbert writing alone in his room and spiuder like he sends out tentacles of metaphorical webbing to determine without moving where his Lo lee ta is  Is she in the bathroom  Back in her bedroom  Downstairs  Yet as the story continues on the reader can slowly see his mind crack and unravel culminating in the final outcome of the novel  Lolita herself is an even bigger enigma than Humbert  She understands sexuality almost from the beginning of the novel and she uses it to her advantage  Nabokov presents this almost as if they re twin souls in this regard  except that Humbert is an introvert and Lolita is an extravert  Every time I thought I understood her  flirting with Humbert  threatening Humbert  she would alter herself  She is the ultimate chameleonchameleon  even into Humbert rediscovering her as a heavily pregnant wife in a less than desirable neighborhood  But he still wants her  Even though she has long passed her Nymphet stage I ve heard people describe this book as the most convincing love story of the past century but this is not a love story this is a story about obsession and a persons most primal  fetishistic sexual desire  I believe that Humbert has a god complex  he wants to taste and own innocence  though not destroy it  he likens himself to a Roman with Lolita as a child sex slave  Even unto his own ultimate destruction he still needs to protect her  A masterpiece in its own phenomenal way  The start and a few reviews gave me an impression of this book being downright filthy and repulsive but I am glad I didn t desist  Humbert may be atrocious  a scoundrel but it requires a madman s imagination and steady mind to understand him  Lolita may have been a manipulative little bitch or he might have broke her  who knows  What I know for sure is that this classic is worth reading The poems  the constant Lo Lola Lolita   the word play  and I could ve missed on a lot of them   his justifications  his devouring passion  and the ineffable end  are bound to linger in my mind for a long time to come The endless debate between morality and aesthetics  between Quilty and Humbert leaves mind to outrage and though I didn t feel too much of sympathy like I would ve for any Dostoyevskyian character  the words still managed to deprive me of my normal sleep   And this is the only immortality you and I may share my Lolita   so he ends it one of the most bizarre  astounding and sensational books I have ever read I couldn t think of any other way to end this review  Lives up to the hype  A remarkable book  marked by exquisite language  The rare book where one s pace in going through in it is steady  as neither thrilling events  nor boredom would cause me to race  scan ahead  or skip passages  As to the content  marvelous  Humbert is an amazing character   narrator  Nabokov really masters his arc  you feel such sympathy early on  but it is because Humbert is in control of the telling  Nabokov nails the big moments  chapter ends especially  which shatter the self justifications and hint at the delusions Humbert operates on  His selfishness and lack of empathy for Lo shift to monstrousness  But  then  at the novel s denoument  Humbert displays the self awareness that appeared to be previously lacking in one final push for sympathy  A truly unsettlingly roller coaster   Humbert Humbert never consummated his love for Annabel Leigh as a child and is therefore obsessed by nymphets  girls 9 13   He moves from Paris to New England to write and ends up living with Charlotte Haze and her daughter Dolores  Lolita  who is 12  He s smitten  Humbert ends up marrying Charlotte  she loves him and wants him to love her or leave  who dies suddenly when she discovers Humbert secret in his diary and flees  Humbert gets Lolita from summer camp and roams the country with her  sexual affair ensues  while being pursued by someone who turns out to be Lolita s drama teacher she also is having an affair with  Lolita finally escapes with him  Clare Quilty   In the end  Clare won t commit to Lolita alone so she leaves him and winds up married and pregnant to a nice but dull fellow  HH gives them the money and property that is rightfully theres  begging Lolita to come be with him once more   she refuses  Humbert kills Quilty and dies awaiting trial Themes  tragedy  the effects of a first love  word play  taboo sexual relations  guilt of robbing childhood awayInteresting that some critics say Lolita took advantage of Humbert and not the other way around  This story is extremely engaging and haunting  Very ironic and there are almost more likable qualities in Humbert than Lolita  though that doesn t excuse his behavior  The idea that this stems from his childhood love and loss is interesting  or an excuse   HH is not exactly trustworthy   Tastefully done as far as the sex  nothing blatant  and I loved the word play  Difficult to interpret morally  The reading of this most grandiloquent piece of literary perfection brings me to a level of ebullience that Elizabeth Browning must have been feeling when she wrote How Do I Love Thee  This is the only book I have ever read that captures the ache  nay malaise that is caused by loving someone with a deepness expressed with all parts of one s soul and being  without the reciprocation by the one loved  This book accomplishes this feat with such belletristic guile  it leaves those who have had the pleasure of completing this book dumbfounded upon acknowledgement of this being Mr  Nabokov s second language  If the human heart was a combustion engine  this would be a fuel capable of running it through and on all cylinders for weeks  If H H  can be considered the antagonist of this book  it leaves us feeling at least understanding of his situation  and at most and from a more demoniacal end of the spectrum  sympathetic  He has filled the book with foreshadowing that is really indecipherable until it is too late or upon rereading to understand  It makes this a perfect book to read more than once  Anyone here that hesitates to read this is making a grave mistake  This is quite possibly the best book of the century  have at it fans  This is actually a re read for me  They had a table of give aways at my library  and there was this soiled copy of Lolita sitting there  I think I read it so long ago that it was a dim memory  jumbled up with the James Mason Sue Lyons movie This was a tough one re  the rating for me  The subject matter is so disturbing repugnant  that I almost wanted to take away a star just for that reason  But  after finishing the novel  I was so yes blown away by Nabakov s prose  that to give it any less than 5 stars just didn t feel right to me  Of course  this about Humbert Humbert  that narcissistic pedophile  that erudite monster  so fond of French phrases  so obsessed with Lolita that he justifies everrything he feels about her in the name of his grand passion lust  The reader only gleans small bits about Lolita herself as H H  rhapsodizes and ruminates throughout the novel  Only when the full force of her being only a child hits the reader is when one realizes that this is a novel of great sadness  And yet it has comical moments  Our narrator  H H  is quite a raconteur  The prose  as I ve said  is exquisite  the novel quite disturbing  Not for every taste  This is probably one of the oddest books I have ever read Frankly  this book scared me a little at times  The climax for me probably being when Humbert was terrified that Lolita would cease to be a nymphet in a couple of years and wanted to have a child with her  so that he would have another nymphet after ten or eleven years  His fascination with such a young person was not something I was used to  But God it was beautiful  Are you quite  quite sure that   well not tomorrow  of course  and not after tomorrow  but well   someday  any day  you will not come to live with me  I will create a brand new God and thank him with piercing cries  if you give me that microscopic hope  As the story unraveled  I realized that Lolita was just another love story  a more passionate and well written love story  but a love story nonetheless  Nabokov s literary eloquence aside  he has delivered a beautiful story with constant surprises  A must read  I loved you  I was a pentapod monster  but I loved you  I was despicable and brutal  and turpid  and everything  And there were times when I knew how you felt  and it was hell to know it  my little one   There are three things shouldn t be hiden  cough  poverty and love  The more you want to hide the obviouser they are  There are three things shouldn t be dissipated  the body  money and love  You want to splurge on but the loss outweights the gain  There are three things people is impossible to keep  the time  life and love  You want to keep but tapering off  There are three things can t be recalled  disaster  death and love  You want to recall but suffer unspeakably   Where to begin  Well  Nabokov is the master of the mind fuck  Being as the only other novel of his I ve read is PALE FIRE  I know how skilled he is at creating books that are also puzzles  For all that LOLITA is fairly linear  unlike PALE FIRE  which is a novel inside a novel inside a something else who knows  it is still a puzzle that leaves the reader with so many uncomfortable questions  What exactly was the nature of Lolita s and Humbert s relationship  I mean  not as far as whether it was sexual or not  that part is obvious and horrible  but I suppose the thing Humbert leaves the most ambiguous is how much Lolita hated it  Obviously enough to run away  but she is so filtered through Humbert s own twisted mind that she s basically a cipher  How smart is she  How cunning  How much does she know about Humbert  How much does she use him  Nabokov lets the reader live in that ambivalent  creepy place  exploring the madness that fuels a certain kind of sexual obsession  It is not a fun place to be  but it s somehow hard to turn away Nabokov is also an incredible prose stylist  capable of making even the most awful things sound lovely  When read by Jeremy Irons  who is a stylist in his own right  Humbert feels alive in a way that enhances the creep factor even more  I think that s the most frightening part of the book  Humbert does exist  in so many forms  many perhaps less articulate  less intelligent  less able to masquerade as  normal   but he is not a caricature  He is sardonic and witty and pathetic and sad  and Nabokov makes no excuses for him  In this way LOLITA is oddly feminist  The book reveals men like Humbert for what they are  desperate  self hating victimizers  Those who frequently ban the book clearly don t get it   how revolutionary it is  particularly as a narrative written and published at a time when attitudes towards women and women s bodies were even more terrible than they are now  A  wow  sort of book  No puedo entender como algunas personas ven este libro como una historia realmente erotica o romantica  No quiero decir mas  pero creo que pensar asi es tener falta de    pensamiento critico  Que la prosa sea fantastica y el lexico que usa el autor sean bellisimos no convierte a la trama en algo  ideal   Y no se  creo que la romantizacion de este libro va en contra de lo que Nabokov justamente intento retratar  el grado de depravacion en el que viven personas como Humbert Humbert  An enjoyable if not so easy to stomach at times read  The story left me with many questions  mostly what were Lolita s true feelings toward this man  Since it is written from his point of view and because of the nature of the story the feelings and even the speech of Lolita is called into question in my mind  For example Did she really try to seduce him or is that how his twisted mind allowed him to live with himself  I wish Nabokov would have re written this story from Lolita s POV so we could truly see just how sick and twisted the mind of this paedophile was  Nabokov is a Genius  one of the greatest authors ever  This man has grasped what literature means  namely art and aesthetics  and this book clearly showed me that  despite or because of that taboo topic  Every book fan might by now found out what this book is about  Some call it perverse  disgusting or immoral  But I think this book is a beautiful description of childhood  memories  nostalgia  and love  mixed with darkness  violence and feeling of being lost  This is the impression I got from this book  This  and way more things which I can t grasp yet  In this book  another kind of perversity is described  Humbert Humbert is not turned on by femininity  but by childishness  I  as a reader  have clearly seen his overly exaggerated and almost sick love  or rather a perverse  and later sexual obsession towards a little girl child from which Humber even tries to escape  but then blames a little girl of seducing him  I had the impression that he loved Dolores more than her mother Charlotte did  I even was happy after she died  At the beginning of the book  I even sympathetized for Humbert Humbert  because he wasn t bad at heart  intelligent and a handsome man  But more important was his past which was so sad  It had a nostalgic melancholy about his past and his childhood love Annabel which he never got over with  His feelings for a girl child were always inside him  all these years  Although he was a handsome man fancied by many women  his wife still cheated on him  I think this event showed his hatred against grown women who tend to cheat driven by sexual  or material reasons  A child is pure and innocent  However  Lolita rather seemed to be like a grown up  seducing boys and accepting gifts from H H  So she didn t really fit to the innocent picture of a little girl Humbert knew from his childhood and from Annabell  Of course it could be that Lolita was lying about her virginity  or Humbert exaggerating it  But I had this picture of Lolita being like that innocently impure  H H  however chose to revive Annabel in Dolores  and lived his childhood love as an adult  For me  this sounds so sad and bizarre  yet beautiful at the same time  And right this is the reason why this book is a work of literary aesthetic  This work doesn t teach you not to rape a child  A pedophile wouldn t be convinced by a book  even if it is from Nabokov  He himself wrote in the afterword of this book that it is nonsense to try to analyze literature  At least for his piece of work  he states  that the author has no purpose  nor is trying to say something with that  I think many pupils and students would love Nabokov  He also says that he himself is not a didactic writer and didn t intend Lolita to teach something   For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tendernesy  kindnesy  ecstasy  is the norm   I could write pages and pages about this book  but these are the main things I wanted to write  I can understand that many people didn t like this movie  but somehow I also feel sorry for them because they did  t grasp this wonderfully written book  which is more than a story about a pedophile  Dolores  Lo  Dolly  Lolita  a special caliber of literature  Listen to these descriptive interludes   sun shot moment    some hunk of movieland manhood    through prismatic layers of light   a cinematographic still    warm dusk had deepened into amorous darkness   Vladimir Nabokov transcends his language barriers of the idiomatic differences between his comfort zone of the Russian language and into the new world fully American vocabulary of our English language  Through Lolita  the reader understands a different kind of romance  one usually deemed controversial at the least and disgustingly illegal at the most   my lungs are raw from the inhalation of the turpentine and orange blossom that perfume the words on these pages After reading and thoroughly enjoying Nabokov s comic novel Pnin  I decided to read Lolita  I m glad I did  There is nothing more interesting than an unreliable narrator and certainly Humbert Humbert is one of those  After reading the original paperback version I borrowed a copy of the Annotated Lolita to understand some of Nabokov s more obscure references to both high and popular culture  I then watched the dvd starring Jeremy Irons as our  hero   While Irons is a bit too handsome and charming for the character he is portraying  this film adaptation was a well acted and handsomely set and photographed  Anyone looking for pornography will be disappointed because the novel is full of literary references and the sex scenes are not explicit  it s also very witty  Humbert being interviewed by the headmistress of Lolita s progressive school is one among many hilarious scenes   Agree with you on this one David In fact    Our book club has considered reading this book  again      Its come up  for the vote  a couple of times If it ever wins   I ll let you know    so you can join our discussion   great group of people to discuss this book  I need a copy of this to immerse myself in whenever I m having small psychological crises  It s impossible to put down  and Nabokov s starkly rich  flowing Russian style facilitates this addiction  Forget whatever  glorified pedophilia  press promotions you ve seen on the Internet  this book is an oddly light step into the dark mind of a deeply disturbed  gentleman  whose preferred indulgence is socially condemned  It appeals to  among other things  the late adolescence early twenties youthful mind in its entertainment of the idea of spontaneous travel as the key to temporary happiness  The fact that there are no innocent victims doesn t make anyone a less of a victim  thought  This book is not about who seduced who  it s rather about different kinds of unhappiness that people have to struggle with in their lives   I choose him because he only broke my heart  You broke my entire life   Probably the most disgusting  uncomfortable  and beautiful book that I ve ever read  A masterpiece   The other day  a little boy I know saw me reading this book and asked me what it was about  I didn t know what to say  He just answered his own question by saying  Surely it s about Mrs  Lolita s love story    Well  kind of   I said     Though Lolita is no Mrs    I thought I wanted to write a review about this book  but since I started to read it I got speechless  and so I remained till  sadly  I finished reading it  And  oh  I almost cry with chapter 29 from the second volume  Is it creepy that I loved this book  I just loved the writing so much  The description of attraction as well as travel were fantastic  People like novels about killers and that doesn t make them dangerous so I feel ok about liking a creepy book  Plus you have the added bonus of having the Police song stuck in your head the whole time you read it   This is the greatest love story ever written  Better than Romeo and Juliet or A Farewell to Arms or The Great Gatsby  The language is some of the most beautiful I ve ever read and the story itself is jaw dropping yet delicate  As a reader you are left feeling satisfied but curious and a little dirty  The second half really was excellent and the ending was as conclusive as a period It s no surprise this is considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written  Immoral  depraved  criminal  mean  arrogant  but also sophisticated  erudite  charming and humorous   that is Humbert Humbert  the narrator of this tragic  love  story  Love is probably the wrong word to describe the obsession Humbert has with Lolita  the twelve year old girl whom he essentially kidnaps  The erotica in this book is never graphic  but will still make the reader cringe  The language is full and intense and the central characters are convincing  I found myself actually rooting for Humbert in the later chapters even though he is so despicable   such is the power of Nabokov s description of this unforgettable character  The disturbing subject matter and tragic consequences still haunt me several weeks after finishing this book    Old Europe molests America    This is different than the movie   the character in this book is a hardcore pedophile  a real monster    The Car and it s medium of the US Highway system  motels  and gas stations acts like a character in the book    Nabokov and his hyper literate references create an expanded dimension to the book  Those were some random thoughts I had while reading this literary classic  Nabokov wanted us to think  and he succeeded by bombarding us with complex and aggressive writting and content  I read the annotated edition and the notes and commentary page count took up almost as many pages as the novel  That created an added dimension that made Lolita pop out into three dimensions It s kind of funny that Nabokov wrote a hyper literate novel with a hyper literate character penned in a horrendous light  It made me glad that I got some of the literary references though I wouldn t brag about my literary competence In short if you read  or have read  literature   then you should not miss this book  I stayed away from this book for years but I m glad I finally read it  Jeg kunne faktisk rigtig godt lide denne bog  I starten blev jeg meget forarget over Humbert og hans tanker  men i midten af bogen sympatiserede jeg faktisk med han  noget jeg ikke havde regnet med at gore  jeg folte at det var okay det han gjorde  og heppede naermest pa ham  til sidst i bogen folte jeg igen vaemmelse og afsky til ham  Jeg synes at Martin Amis  kommentar  You read Lolita sprawling limply in your chair  ravished  overcome  nodding scandalized assent  passer utrolig godt pa hvordan jeg laeste bogen  Jeg folte det var forfaerdeligt  men ogsa forfaerdelig godt  sproget og den made man kom mere og mere ind til kernen Da moderen dode kunne jeg naesten ikke holde det ud  det var sa komisk og alligevel helt forfaerdeligt  jeg sad og grinte hojt og alligevel taenkte jeg  ah nej  hvad sker der nu med Lolita  Wow  this book is incredible  By far one of the best books I ve ever read  I love how Nabokov lets the reader experience the thoughts and feelings of somebody they normally would never get to do that with  Amazingly  the author is even able to extract some sympathy from us for the narrator  I d heard that this book has been banned a lot  so I just assumed that there were a lot of graphic sex scenes due to the nature of the theme  but I was surprised to find that there wasn t even one  I guess the subject matter was just too  inappropriate  for some people  but there truly is not really any sexual scenes in this novel  It s purely a glance into the inner workings of a deeply disturbed man  I would highly recommend this book to anybody  A classic  I read it once in high school  and certainly didn t appreciate it  Upon re reading it a couple years ago  I was blown away  Nabakov s writing skill is incomparable  The words flowed like poetry  and I absolutely loved the subtlety of innuendos and sexual connotations  Must read  Really great narrations  rich in imageries  also really hilarious at times  while also managed to be depressing  Would really help if I knew some more English though  or maybe some French for that matter  Obviously what I read is different from the one I expected  especially coming from weeaboo ish notion of  loli  which is tragically misleading and should be avoided  if not taken with grains of salt  Would really recommend to those who have genuine interest in literary works  well for some why boner lits this book is pretty okay as well  though there are myriads of alternatives should one seek the latter purpose  I read this as a college student  and I m so glad I waited  I was able to read it from an adult perspective  which is very different than my previous teenage girl perspective  Before  I might have seen it as a challenge or an ideal  to become a little Lolita  terrible reasoning  but as a teenage girl  you want to be cherished and desired and seen as perfect   As an adult  though  I was able to see this novel for the comedy that it is  and delight in the narrator s torture at the hands of such a temperamental teen  Readalikes  The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath  The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellows  To the Lighthouse by Virginia Wolf  We Were the Mulvaneys by Joyce Carol Oates I wrote about this  here  Anyone who knows about this book will recognize it isn t for everyone  not for the faint of heart  as it were   Yeah  pedophilia isn t a topic we usually seek out  But Lolita is often on the top 100 list of important American Literature  and there s a reason for that   it s absolutely brilliant  The writing is erudite  and the whole book is very consciously structured  In some ways  it s a bit like a puzzle with many hidden clues  certainly reading a second time would reveal even more of its secrets  But I probably won t do that for quite a while  It s a disturbing enough journey that I probably don t need to embark on it again anytime soon It s a fairly tragic story  and you could argue whether it s love or obsession or both  which is part of its brilliance    And what I found remarkable is that Nabokov manages to make Humbert Humbert a somewhat sympathetic character  I wanted to hate him  but somehow I couldn t help but care about him  although maybe in a  bless his heart  kind of way  There were some in book club who couldn t stomach the story at all  and I can respect that  For me  though  the story was a very clever look into the psyche of a sociopath  and one that ably illustrated some of that sociopath s humanity   which is not something easily done  But if you read it  have a good dictionary with you    Nabokov s vocabulary is nearly super human  and I looked up lots of wonderful words during the reading   I don t think I can add much to what has already been said about this book  What I really loved was how evocative this book was  It s amazing that the most intense parts of this story is where nothing is really happening in the narrative  Just loved the prose  The edition I read years before was better  less sanitised    wish I could remember which one it was  I don t care about what some people might think about this book  To me   it is beyond awesome  This book attracted me from the very first line which is pretty rare  It got me at   fire of my loins  and I have no idea why  The least I can say about it is A M A Z I N G   I don t give a damn about the character that some call it pedophile  I just know that when we read it we feel the indubitable honesty of the speaker and that s what matters   One can easily live with the character and imagine what he s going through  whether we re talking about his infantile adventures or those of his adulthood until he meets Lolita   It is a must read      I avoided reading Lolita because the name had become epithet for a young seductress  By repute it was an erotica novel  After reading Pale Fire  I decided that I had to read Lolita  I m glad I did  It is a brilliant novel  A study of deception  delusion and tyranny  There is nothing erotic about it  H H  Robs a child of her childhood  It cannot be given back  The reader sees all of this through the eyes of the tyrannical arch deceiver H H  himself  a master deceiver especially of himself  Perhaps  he is at the hight of his deception of us when he acknowledges that he has robed a child of her childhood  I know some readers fall for it  But  he would have us orphans her  You read this and you think   my God but this man was born to be a writer of words   It s hard to imagine an author having a greater facility for writing fiction than Nabokov  You re so enthralled by how learned Humbert Humbert is as a character and  more importantly  as a narrator that you forget he s a pedophile  But  maybe that s the point of the book  This is a beautifully written novel  I was absolutely overwhelmed at Nabokov s ability to put words together so well  How did he do it  This is the sort of writing that every author yearns to achieve but all fall short   Lolita  makes me want to jump with joy because it is just that amazing  It makes me believe in the existence of true  great  creative minds in literature  My favourite novel to date  It is easy to see why this is a literary masterpiece  At times disturbing  Nabokov takes the reader on a wild journey from the viewpoint of mentally unstable narrator  The florid language and detestable charm of Humbert Humbert can make even morally conscious readers unsure of themselves  Nabokov challenges conventional literary work in the same way Humbert challenges societal norms   I love how Nabokov writes  I love his wit and his sheer skill with the English language  I found the images and the progression of the  relationship  between this pedophile and his victim to be unforgettable  even as it was disturbing  As with most of Nabokov s work  the story itself seems the least important aspect of what he is doing  I suppose I could have spent more time trying to figure out the details of what really happened  versus what happened in his mind  In the end that distinction between his subjective perception of reality and the objective truth was the most interesting thing about Lolita  I guess this is called  unreliable narrator   In that sense this book is so much more than a story  it borders on being a philosophical treatise  When you read his description of what is happening it is like looking through a distorted lense  What he describes you know is not what he thinks it is  You can tell what he is looking at because it is familiar to you  but you also know that what he is looking at is an image distorted by his assumptions  his needs and his past  What he describes says more about him than it does about the reality he thinks he s seeing  By  him  of course I mean his character  not  him  the author  I admire his bravery  he took a huge risk to explore inside the mind of a pedophile in first person  A book that clearly should ve stayed in the deep web    but we re all fairly happy it surfaced  My thoughts while reading Lolita in an organized fashion 1  Suburbs are not NEARLY as interesting as Murakami or Nabokov describe them 2  Wtf is  elephantine  even a word  Did he literally just transform elephant into an adjective3  Humbert Humbert  Woody Allen or Adventure Time s Ice King  You choose  4  STOP SPEAKING IN FRENCH I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU RE SAYING 5   Shudders  cries  throws book on floor   respectively  6  Should I be reading this sober  Do most people do that 7  What is this       sic    and why is that necessary 8  Did Nabokov just use modern slang 9  Did he just use an ancient latin phrase 10  You re a sick  sick  bloody brilliant man  Nabokov Like Charlotte Haze  I once considered myself a woman of principle  at most hours  But the first one hundred or so pages of this novel really tested my morals  How could I not like the witty  sarcastic  hilarious madman that was Mr  Humbert  However  to assure you  that illusion died as the pages persisted  and I will say that I must disagree with Vanity Fair  as if it were a person itself   whose quote plagues the back cover of the 50th anniversary novel   The only convincing love story of our century   If that s love  count me out  Forever  Bye  I ll be hiding under my bed  Don t come looking for me   My all time favorite novel      It has everything    intelligence  irony  humor  sex  mystery  and commentary on 1950s America  And it s told gracefully  Make sure you have a dictionary at hand for vocabulary you have never laid eyes on    it s hard to believe that English is Nabakov s second language  After re reading this book for the first time since high school  I more fully appreciate its place in literature and Vladimir Nabokov s controversial work  Despite the disgusting nature and crimes of Nabokov s Humbert Humbert  as a reader  you repeatedly forget he is a rapist and find humor in his self deprecating narrative  Perhaps even more disturbing are the many times I found his prose describing his Lolita beautiful and eerily romantic  Nabokov creates a monster who is vile and unforgivable but wildly intelligent and oddly likable  Nabokov is a true wordsmith and Lolita is an original and thought provoking novel which continues to stand the test of time  This book is a hard read and boring at times  but when I finished it  I was glad I stuck with it  There is a very dark humor and I think Nabakov did an excellent job with his character development  Any writer that can get the reader to almost sympathize with such a despicable and disturbed character like Humbert is worth reading  This book is a masterpiece  I had never read anything by Nabokov before and I have to say that  after reading Lolita  he s become one of my favorite authors of all time  The language  the story  the characters  everything is developed with such attention to detail in a web of constant intrigue  This is a classic that should be read by anyone who appreciates the magic of literature  a timeless book written by one of the best writers of the XX century  The narrator is a monster for destroying Lolita s innocent childhood   and consequently her brief life  but at the end you cannot help but feel sorry for such a poor devil living a rotten existence in this cruel and sad world   In short  it s a book about the loss of innocence  Nabokov s style builds a story with such craftsmanship that  at the impressive ending  you stand up and applaud for such an achievement of literary genius  Enough said  5 5 stars I m really not sure I can fully explain and articulate all the things I felt when I finally put down Lolita  Obviously it is a book that is likely to elicit strong reactions from readers and divide opinions  To write something shocking in the desensitized day and age in which we live is difficult  To write something nearly sixty years ago that is perhaps more provocative now than ever shows a unique  though admittedly twisted  brilliance For me the biggest strength of the book is the layered and intricate nature of Humbert s neuroses  We see him run the spectrum of fear  jealously  doubt  paranoia  self loathing and of course self pity  while at the same time trying so hard to justify his actions to himself and to the reader  I think that is what makes Humbert feel so fully formed  his need to be understood and  he hopes  absolved  Of course  given the depths of depravity he sinks to and the levels beyond that we are privy to in the darkest of his musings and machinations  that is never going to happen  I can see people being upset with me for saying this  but I will freely admit to at times feeling pity for this man  even as much of a monster as he undoubtedly is  These fleeting moments are quickly swept aside when  once again  Humbert extols the great joy of his latest perverse interlude with poor Lolita  I will say that I have read reviews and opinions on Lolita s supposed role in leading on Humbert and I can t simply cannot give them credence  At her level of maturity  both socially and sexually  there is absolutely no way she can be expected to make adult decisions for herself While I did thoroughly enjoy this book I will say that is veers into obtuseness at times  bordering on complete impenetrability and  while I like to think I have a fairly developed vocabulary  I challenge anyone to make it through this book without diving for their dictionary app at least once or twice  The French passages in the book I quickly gave up on translating as I honestly didn t feel I was missing out anything key with them but I think they do add something to the overall makeup of our narrator  as he lords his intellect over the reader  Maybe I m just reading to much into it though While Tolkien s The Hobbit will I think forever hold it s place in my heart as my favourite book of all time  as first loves almost always to do  Lolita may very well overcome it for the place of best book I ve ever read  Complex  controversial  masterful and horrifying  I don t know another book that has ever stirred so many emotions in me   The literature of Lolita is written w  a wonderfully innovative style  especially considering its controversial subject  I absolutely enjoy the poetic narration of the protagonist Humbert Humbert who becomes sexually obsessed with the twelve year old nymph girl Dolores Haze  now famously known with the help of the 1962 Stanley Kubrick film and the 1997 version directed by Adrian Lyne This novel is a classic 20th century literature  I am partial to the settings in a small New England town as I grew up in one myself   In any event  the writing is richly illustrated and beyond anything considered pornography  Nabokov s Lolita is also a far cry from any ridiculous endorsement of pedophilia  to all those concerned due to its delicately graphic nature  It is a very important work of fiction and feels more like 20th century history in the narrative and prose I highly recommend this novel to anyone who has a love of words  Lolita  the story we all want to ignore  Living in a trance of a forgotten  but growing love for young girls  Humbert s situation can be traced to the death of a young love  a tragedy that has left him lost for the meaning of love  Lolita is the perfect prey  She is young  curious  and willing  along with easily accepting to his tricks  But it could never had lasted  and loneliness followed as it always was meant to  To me  this book spoke many things  First off  the forbidden love and desire Humbert has is something we can see everyday  heartbreak  The inability to see past a tragedy and look for something new  shows the depth of love  and it s ability to kill  save  and fool people  Another essential element of this book is the literature  The beauty of how Humbert relays his experiences  with metaphors and imagery  is easily masking the truths of his actions  Our natural awe in the beauty at the surface may suggest that truth to people doesn t go as deep as we think we see it  Symbolism such as games and butterflies show the delicate process of maturing and how love and lose can kill this innocence  as well as being a way to hide the truth   Ah  Lolita  my little Lo  my lovely  luscious  lascivious Lolita   I have just  and I mean just  finished listening to the audiobook Lolita  written by Vladimir Nabokov in 1955  and read in the most lustful  licentious voice of Jeremy Irons  I cannot imagine a more perfect way in which to be immersed in this masterful yet nasty novel  Forgive me if my words seem to flow  not from my American  middle class  prudish fingertips  but through the unfiltered  unabridged  unspeakable truths disseminated by a worldly maniacal genius  Ah  who am I kidding  I can not for a moment write as brilliantly as Nabokov no matter how powerfully I try to channel him Two thoughts overwhelm me upon the completion of twelve or so captivating hours at the proverbial knee of Jeremy Irons  storytelling best  First  in Mr  Irons  hypnotic voice  the alliterations of Nabokov sang so loudly that they nearly overtook the story  I wonder  do they jump out at a reader they way they did for me as a listener  I could give countless examples if only I had been taking notes as I listened or had this book in hand along with a pencil to underscore and scribble notes about as I read page by page  Alas  I chose the audiobook version because a   it was my free trial book from audible com  and b   I thought it was a book I would never read  mostly because of my disgusted prejudice against the storyline  Which leads me precisely to point two  My second thought  now that I ve completed the book  is why was I so afraid of this book for so many years  I imagine it s because until ebooks and audiobooks became so easily available  the mere sight of the cover would surely elicit judgement  comment  possibly sneers were I to brandish it in public  And  for those of you who don t know me  I will do just about anything to avoid conversation with strangers  But my point is that never mind the hideous imagery of a forty year old man repeatedly ravishing a twelve year old girl  this is a gorgeous story  written in the most poetic and powerful words I have ever read  I hate to admit that it took me nearly one year  start to finish  to listen to these twelve odd hours of Lolita  myriad excuses could explain  but they are not important  Last summer  I would take walks around my neighborhood and listen to Jeremy Irons recant the story of Humbert Humbert  You see  my neighborhood claims one or two playgrounds and a sculpture garden to which schools regularly take field trips  Through the powerful combination of Nabokov and Irons  it made me  a forty something mother of four  feel like a    creep  Yes  a total creep   This might be why it took me so long to get through the audiobook   Ironically  about halfway through the story  I began to let go of my disgust for H H  and listen to his story   Those of you who have read the book will know what happened at that halfway point  those of you who haven t  well  I ll just say  the book is a most remarkable story  disgusting storyline aside   If you  my reader   ah  Nabokov is speaking through me after all  do not know  dear Mr  Humbert is reciting the tale of Lolita in his own defense or at least confession of a crime to a jury  We first time readers do not know until about 2 3 through the book  what crime he has committed  and not until very near the end do we know the victim of said crime  I would not dream of spoiling that for you here  I will only say that the suspense  the glorious  cinematic climax is so enthralling that had I been a student or random employee  I would have had to call in sick today just to hear the end of the story before I did one more task  And the end of the book  the very end  is so beautiful  a trite word here  and poetic and powerful that as soon as I hit  save  on this review  I am going directly to a bookstore to purchase a hardback copy of this book so that I can reread my favorite passages if not the entire book today or one day or any day I am in need of seeing  not just hearing  a literary genius at work  Oh  by the way  in case you hadn t guessed  I give this book Five stupendous Stars  This is probably the bravest book I ve ever read  I know that I would not have had the balls to write it  Just the use of the English language in this novel is worth the read  and consider that Nabokov is not a native speaker    The most unexpected thing about this book  for me  was the empathy I felt for a selfish  unbalanced  nymphomaniac pedophile  The writing is THAT rich  I have never enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed this one  One of my top 5   10 stars if I could Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   She was Lo  plain Lo in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Honestly God Bless Nabokov for giving us this bookJust finished reading it for the second time  It s such a powerful love story  the destrution of Humbert ugh My most loved book  this time  read in English  It was wonderful  but also a bit exhausting  I was always carried by a whimsical wind  because I had a hard time understanding many words  but I knew what was written  even if I forgot it from my first read  Lolita has grown fond of me   Intriguing  scandalous  Incredible writing  check out the first page   lo   lee  tah   The reasoning  twisted logic that goes through Humbert Humbert s mind is just plain scary  Vladimir did right to tell the story from Humbert s point of view  Actually  Vlad didn t have a choice  The story would ve been completely different if the narrator were someone else    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita    Despite the topic  the book was beautifully written and poetic  Humbert Humbert  in my opinion  was definitely not a victim lol and deserved a much more horrible end  I couldn t help being drawn into the story  hoping the whole time he would be discovered and dragged away in handcuffs before Lolita s childhood was completely destroyed by the monster  But  as with so many things in life  such wasn t the case  Background checks  That s all I have to say  lol  Excellent book   I went to a high school that would never have mentioned that this book even existed    and  of course  it didn t  So when I got to college and kept hearing it mentioned  I decided that I had better read it  And good thing I did  of course  because it s hard to get through life as an intellectual without realizing when Lolita is being referenced and why  Obviously  one of those books that s so well known and radical that you have to have it under your belt  So to speak  It s also just a really really good book   This book should be very hard to like  It should be a book which you really have to try to like because you know you should and everyone else seems to  But it isn t hard  It is terrifyingly easy to like  It s an unsettling story with a main character of whom it is possible to form many different opinions  although every moral you have says you should hate him  The fluidity and beauty of the narrative almost contrasts with the horror of the story and somehow makes it something you want to carry on reading  instead of making you want to put it down and promptly forget what you have read  There are things in this book that you wouldn t want to read if you just heard about them  In fact  you wouldn t want to go near them  I think that the main reason for my enjoying this book is my interest in human behaviour and psychology because it s just about the cleverest and most detailed story of what happens when things go wrong  that I have ever read  The book is fascinating and  of course  critically acclaimed  This review was particularly difficult to write because it is a book you will have no idea of until you have read it  so read on  The subject matter of Lolita is certainly confronting but the book is exquisitely written  Nabokov s prose is especially impressive  considering English was not his native language  He is truly a gifted writer  Nabokov s prose is breathtaking and reading this book was like a blind man seeing colour for the first time  The author effortlessly pulls you into his world and to say I read Lolita is insufficient to describe what this book was to me  It is more appropriate to say I  experienced  Lolita or I  lived in a world with Lolita and Humbert   To describe reading this book as anything less would be a crime  It was a like being in a dream  where all the colours are fuzzy and warm  I saw a Youtube video of Vladimir Nabokov at a university giving a lecture and was simply mesmerised at his ability to breathe life and colour into words and sound  This man is without a doubt a literary genius and an artist of the imagination  Although the subject matter is appalling  The writing is fantastic  You can get inside the mind of the characters and begin to understand the reasons for their actions  I vacillated between giving this 4 or 5 stars  eventually selecting the latter  either way Lolita s distinguished reputation belies any superfluous stars I may award  Nabokov amply rewards the sensitive reader braving a cringe worthy tale of pre pubescent love  demonstrating masterful control of the English language in explicating a decidedly repulsive  fictitious  memoir  Indeed  the dark duplicity of Humbert Humbert s psyche is best appreciated through artistry rather than a scientific approach bound to result in some clinical pejorative  Employing a whimsical tone epitomized thorough the various nomenclatures Humbert awards his persona  Herr Doktor Humbert a personal favorite   readers are submerged into the murky unreliability of the narrator  challenged to discern whether Humbert s suspiciously coincidental universe is indeed so  SPOILER ALERT   In full cognition of these tendencies  Nabokov creates for Humbert s nemesis a playful playwright Clare Quilty  Throughout the novel I maintained a lingering feeling the drama was almost too good to be true  I mean to say I wondered whether the twists of fate and idealized romance were elements of a  true  memoir or simply the upshot of Humbert s beautifully demented mind  Supposing that Humbert died incarcerated for murder as indicated in the prologue  I submit this was not the author s intended reading  but one might construe Humbert as Quilty s schizoid fantasy  a wonderful blend of sexual deviancy  flair for the dramatic  and disenchantment with Americana  albeit pure imagination  Simply thinking out loud since reviewing the plot or critical analysis is out there for anyone who desires  I look forward to watching the Kubrick and Lyme film adaptations within the next week to see which themes they distill from the dense text  Recommended for anyone tolerable of squeamishness but would abstain if episodes of moral perversion undercut any redemptive features  Hi Mom    It s been a long time that I ve read a book so beautiful in its language Maybe you ll find it hard to get through the first chapters  but once you re past them  it s hard to put the book away I am in awe of Nabokov  his prologue is incredible and true  and this book is one of the best  best I ve ever read What an experience     This then is my story  I have reread it  It has bits of marrow sticking to it  and blood  and beautiful bright green flies     Humbert HumbertA tantalizing journey into the psyche of a pedophile  Lolita gives us unprecedented insight into the mind of a  monster   Written in the form of a manuscript it follows the life of Humbert Humbert through his pre pubescent foray into sexual matters  his  love  for young girls or nymphets and his retrogression into a complete psychopath  Though originally trying to fight his perverted nature  H H  gradually succumbs to his darker being  and Lolita is the principle victim It is a remarkable tale of how one man can so effectively ruin a girl s life  He broke her  and he never even realized it  He said he did all he did because he  loves  Lolita  But it really begs the question   is this truly love  His dark obsession  his primeval lust and his one sided dominance of a helpless orphan   view spoiler   is it any different because the young girl  out of a misguided need to feel loved initiate it  hide spoiler      the author gives the reader an opportunity to decide it  but really  the answer is very clear Told from Humbert s point of view  we see Lolita as he sees her  We know Humbert s Lolita  small  sensuous  slip of a girl  But we never get to know the Dolores Haze  the girl who lost her mother  the one who had to live with an abusive step father for over two years  Her voice is effectively silenced  It is only when she escapes that we see her spirit shining through   that maybe in some deep recess  there was a part of her left unbroken The writing of this story is  unquestionably  remarkable  For all who feel it is an erotic novel   yes it is  and no it isn t  It is not a lewd scene with unfathomable sexual acts  progressing slowly into darker and darker realms  But it is a dark novel  albeit with sensual themes  The darkness isn t thrown at you  but you feel it constantly creeping up on you  only to recede when you become aware of it  It isn t a darkness of the bedroom  it is a darkness of the mind  and Vladimir Nabokov explores it freely There is a conscious use of sexual themes  of innuendos in situations completely devoid of any sexual signs  Yet the sexual scenarios have a certain philosophical aspect to it  lending it that much of a creepier aspect  Humbert Humbert s lustful escapades are never graphically described  but it s the little details that escapes that make those all the more noteworthy  To summarize  Lolita is more than a just a book  It is an intrusion into your mind  which plays on your deepest emotions  wrenching them out  and forcing you to feel it  But what I can say is  you will not be able to resist it   All moral inclinations aside  a true work of art if there has ever been one  My overall favorite book out of anything  Nabokov is admittedly hard to read  If you do not have an expansive vocabulary you may need a dictionary every once in a while  The story itself is questionable and frightening  I feel like whatever I said about this book would not do it justice and i d leave something out  Humbert is detestable  disgusting  and has an ill earned and probably completely false sense of self  Nothing he says can be trusted  nor can he as a character  Dolores  Lolita  is a tragic character with a tragic life wrongly put in a largely tragic situation  The mother is more than likely not as bad as he made it seem  as literally every single thing he sees is twisted by his abnormal views of life  The only good thing about Humbert is his diction and the very way he conveys his messed up views  Even though he disgusts me to the core  the fact that a character could bring up so many strong emotions tells me that Nabokov has expertly written Lolita  odd premise  where a pediphile justifies his desires and also assumes custody of his widows daughter at age 12  There they canvass the country while he commits acts of incest and psychological torture while his calm insanity brews  He seaks revenge on the man who allowed her to escape his control Such a beautifully  exuberantly written work of art about such a cozening  narcissistic creature  Humbert Humbert   The century s only convincing love story  proclaims Vanity Fair upon the front cover  and this is quite true  if the love routinely crosses that feverish line between reality and fantasy  if the love is that of a fetish fixated upon with terrifying strength and created purely through the wishful longings of the lover  with scant regard for the actual thoughts and feelings of the desired object   in other words  if the love is  at heart  a deep and abiding love for oneself  Humbert loves Humbert with such a sincere devotion  such a singular passion that there really is neither room nor need for Lolita to exist save as a demoniac nymphet when his lust is surging  a difficult ward when it has been slaked  There is no way to gauge how accurately Humbert has presented his stepdaughter to the reader   one begins to question how much of the diabolic ever resided in the poor child when Humbert admits how  after his nightly caresses  she would burst into sobs when she believed her  Dad  to be finally asleep This is a cruel story  and wickedly funny  tender and moving  disturbing and debauched  one of the great American road stories  of an America that is freshly scrubbed  charmingly naive and sullenly juvenile  seductively appealing in its unbraided open space wonders   a story packed with enough brilliance to furnish several books  Nabokov is surely one of the greatest prose masters ever to put pen to paper  and Lolita is perhaps his most perfect creation   but underpinning everything is that ambuscading  needle fanged cruelty  the dark side of every lover s moon  the floating poison in every goblet of desire  Humbert s memoir is so delectably manipulative that the reader must constantly pull back from being lured into sympathy and compassion for the hebephile s anguish and conflict  but the manipulation only etches more clearly the monster that lurks within the words  I m a beginner and I just finished reading it yesterday and loved it  From the very beginning to the last word   every aspect of it   every elaborate character description   Libro indubbiamente folle  audace  spassoso  ma allo stesso tempo  profondo e concupiscibile  Leggendario il protagonista  H H  alias Humbert Humbert  che con il suo fare impacciato e con i suoi modi di pensare irriverenti  mi hanno  spesso  strappato un sorriso  ma il suo attaccamento morboso per Lolita  perno di tutta la narrazione e dell intera opera   a me e sembrato qualcosa di artificioso  di poco tangibile nella realta delle cose  Cossicome  a volte  si mastica un chewing gum e questo  rimane inevitabilmente incollato al palato  piazzandosi in posizione strategica e sedimentandosi sul posto senza che nessun mezzo di natura corporale  ex lingua  dita  o artificiale  ex stuzzicadente  possano intercedere in tuo soccorso ed alleviare l inevitabile fastidio e senso d oppressione che provi  alla stessa maniera vedo l amore del protagonista nei confronti di Lolita  un amore che ha piu il gusto di una gomma gia masticata in precedenze  che si e restii a voler buttare via  per paura di doversi fronteggiare con la dura realta della vita  Annabel e morta e nessuna Lolita  per quanto ninfetta essa sia  potra mai rimpiazzare il vuoto lasciato dal primo grande amore  Alla fine del libro infatti  Humbert Humbert realizzera che non esiste nessun calmante per anestetizzare il suo dolore  dato che  ormai la cicca  che da tanto ci opprimeva  si e volatilizzata con il trascorrere del tempo  decomponendosi e lasciandoci in ricordo  un piccolo dono  una graditissima caria marrone sul molare inferiore P S  Mi compiaccio con me con questa vena poetica  assurda  e  pazzoide   che  sicuramente  e stata influenzata dal libro   It took me three reads to really come to this novel  or allow it to come to me  in full force  And  like many others  it took a group of students to help me get there  This novel is overwhelmingly compelling and sincere  It is real in a way very few other novels are  and yes  it s about an old man and a girl  move on  The prose are so lyrical  the story seems to effortlessly roll off your tongue like Lo li ta  Brilliant  beautiful disturbing  book  I want to hate Humbert  but I can t  I empathize with his refined sensibilities  his judgement of the various characters he encounters  his appreciation of beauty  his disdain for the tragedy of normalcy  He s not perfect  His flaw is enormous  all consuming  insurmountable  But he is not blind to this  he knows it s a flaw  He is torn by a genuine love and concern for Lolita s well being and personal growth and his primal desire to devour her budding sensuality  There is a struggle within him to connect with a higher power  a God who ll deliver him from this perverse predilection  But he cannot connect  He is alone  The wrestling match with his competitor at the end of the book is great comic relief  There are so many parallels between Humbert and this other pedophlile  Humbert is essentially wrestling a darker  baser version of himself  This scene is as funny as Humbert s opponent is grotesque  The last few chapters were by far the most artful and poetic  He swept me away  Sweet beautiful stuff  This book could be studied thoroughly as a love letter to the English language    and then again as an unreliable narrator     and then again as the ambiguous levels to crime    and yet again as that classic theme of imperialism    Get past the creepy premise and read it  it s worth it  Number 4 on the Modern Libary list  Wow  I was originally turned off by the subject matter of this book  but the prose in which it is written is so poetic  even the most grusome subject matter could seem beautiful  I actually listened to this one  rather than read  I am an audiobook nerd   and the reader was Jeremy Irons  From the opening lines  which are consequently the most beautiful opening lines I have ever read  I was hypnotized by his reading  The rest of the book  while extremely creepy in content  continued to be mesmorizing in its descriptions  While most of us  hopefully  cannot empathize with the main character  you can appreciate his voice  If anyone would like to listen to this book  I can access the audio file for you  I highly recommend it  Nymphets do not uccur in polar regions No man can bring about the perfect murder  chance  however  can do it  My private tragedy  which cannot  and indeed should not  be anybody s concern  is that I had to Brandon my natural idiom  my untrammeled  rich and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second rate brand of English  devoid of any of those apparatuses   the baffling mirror  the black velvet backdrop  the implied associations and traditions   which the native illusionist  frac tails flying can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way    Vladimir Nabokov   on a book entitled Lolita  November 12  1956   This is my all time favorite book  The writing is so beautiful and eloquent  Nabokov manages to construct characters with such depth that the reader finds herself conflicted between abhorring Humbert Humbert and understanding him   Vedete io l amavo  Era amore a prima vista  a ultima vista  a eterna vista   E  davvero difficile scrivere cosa mi e piaciuto di questo libro  Ci sarebbero cosi  tanti particolari da citare che starei a scrivere per ore  ma forse andare per ordine e il modo giusto di iniziare Quando la prima volta mi sono approcciata a questo libro e come se avessi deciso di attraversare un lungo corridoio interamente al buio  Sospettavo che data la tematica trattata avrei potuto imbattermi in un gran bel dilemma morale  nonostante io non covi pregiudizi Alla fine della lettura sono rimasta cosi  sorpresa e soddisfatta  aggiungerei anche intenerita  da far diventare Lolita uno dei miei libri preferiti  che ha meritato innumerevoli riletture Mi rimane ancora difficile stabilire se quella di Humbert Humbert e la storia di un pedofilo  Nei primi capitoli il protagonista ammette di provare piacere spiando le ragazzine al parco  o nei luoghi dove giocano  che lui stesso chiama  isola delle ninfe   ma che mai oserebbe toccarne una o violarla  perche si definisce un artista in grado di carpire quella bellezza che determinate fanciulle  Ninfe  possiedono e intaccarla sarebbe un peccato  Ma la situazione viene completamente sconvolta con l arrivo di Lolita  Questa non e una semplice ragazzina  e furbetta  vispa e sa come ottenere cio che vuole  In poco tempo diventa consapevole dell influenza che esercita su Humbert  che da  carnefice  diventa una  vittima   E  infatti una perfetta vittima dell amore  Lui la ama come amerebbe una donna  le sussurra frasi che sarebbero appropriate per una donna  ma la vizia come una bambina  quasi come una figlia  Si demoralizza addirittura quando respinge i suoi tentativi di romanticismo  quando incontra il cinismo della sua piccola amante  Nella prefazione c e chiaramente scritto che mentre si leggera il libro non potremo intenerirci senza provare  disgusto  per Humbert  e sono proprio le sensazioni che provo ogni volta che rileggo questo volume  Humbert Humbert e un tenero  goffo amante che ha dato tutta la sua vita per questa ragazzina  che la rende la sua dea e il suo unico amore  Lolita invece e una ragazzina atipica  e questo la rende uno dei personaggi femminili piu erotici che io abbia mai avuto il piacere di incontrare durante una lettura  Tutto il libro e un capolavoro dell erotismo  molto sottile  velato  nascosto nei piccoli dettagli  come un romanzo erotico dovrebbe essere  Se vi aspettate scene e descrizioni volgari o  spinte  sbagliate completamente libro  Detto questo se volete avvicinarvi alla lettura di questo libro vi consiglio di abbandonare tutti i pregiudizi  e di lasciarvi coinvolgere dalle parole di Nabokov  An amazing book  A very serious situation cleverly wrote so it is somehow almost comical  You feel such sympathy for a man who you shouldn t  but that is due to the way it is written and leads the reader  Book Review  Lolita I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita I think I ve never been as interesting in dissecting a book as I did with Lolita  or at least not in a long time  Though I would have wanted to hurry my reading  there were a lot of other readings that came in between and some priorities as well  This review has been long overdue Anyway  I talked about Lolita several times already  I wrote the review of Lolita here with a comparative analysis of another book to movie story which has more or less the same theme  When I wrote the review  having seen it from the angle of moving pictures  one sided narration and limited imagination  I have expressed sympathy on the case of Professor Humbert s well rationalized sexual and romantic adventures with the 14 year old girl Dolores Haze However  having finished the book and absorbing all the contents without the influences of Hollywood s fairytale  I have seen Lolita and Humbert in a different light  I still maintain my original opinion that the young girl should also be faulted on the fate that she ended with but I now share her grief at having been pluck out of her childness at such a young age and thrown into a relationship that should only be practiced by adults  Would had it been different if Professor Humbert managed to keep his manhood inside his pants despite and in spite the nymphet s cajolery  Or would Lolita s life had had a better future if her mother raises her well enough The movie stick to the original flow of the story but shaded the part where Lolita  as per Professor Humbert s own narration  showed her reluctance and eventual dislike of their cohabitation But unlike the movie which has to concede with certain guidelines  the original story talks about a girl of 12 years old not 14 The StoryAs I have mentioned  the plot of the book is very similar to the movie  Nonetheless  if you dont have time to browse to my review  here s a summary  The book also had an alternative title of  The Confession of a White Widowed Male   according to the foreword by John Ray Jr  Ph D    a must read to understand well the message that the author wants to convey  Professor Humbert Humbert is a Frenchman who moved to New England  America  to claim the inheritance that his uncle has bestowed on him  When he found out that the perfumery will not do so well  he decided to sell it and stay a bit longer  He then met widower Charlotte Haze who owns the house that he is renting  Charlotte fell for the forlorn professor and they decided to get married  much to the reluctance of Humbert  Although he didn t show it because beneath the hoax love for the mother  he was secretly desiring the 12 year old daughter After learning the secret of her new husband s obsession with her daughter  Charlotte Haze was run over by a car and died keeping the secret with her  six feet under  It gave Humbert a window to seduce and be seduced by the 12 year old daughter who agreed to leave her hometown and travel with the middle aged professor They toured the whole United States and finally settled in Breadsley where Lolita enrolled in high school and where Humber thought they can have a normal life  Unfortunately  Lolita met another man  an old playwright by the name of Clare Quilty  whom she fell madly inlove with While on another trip  Lolita escaped with Quilty and left poor Humbert in his miseries  After three years  she found the wayward daughter in law  pregnant and living together with a younger man  She told him of her misadventures with Quilty  sparking the fire of revenge in old Humbert s heart  He managed to kill the eccentric playwright and would have gotten away with his crime until he decided to break traffic rules and was caught speeding in a highway My ThoughtsI have read a lot of reviews  critical ones about Lolita and the ideas that they are presented are too much for me to analyze  Had I been a student of literature  I would have spent more time analyzing Lolita in a more scholarly fashion but I am just a reader who enjoys a certain book which interest me up to the end Although similar with the movie in most aspects  the book Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov  a Russian writer  presents a 360 view of all the characters involved in the story  even some highlight on the antagonist  Clare Quilty  In writing the review  however  I have to remember  and the readers too  that the book was written on a first person  leaving the rest of the characters with only the impression that the author gave them However  I do agree that Lolita can be quite an unsettling book  an extreme story that can make hair shivers and eyes opens wide in shock and disgust  Humbert relates his obsession with Lolita in such an erotic  romantic manner and one would always wonder how a man can say such things about a girl of 12  barely out of puberty but young enough to have experienced her first sexual encounter in a camp site  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul     opening line Even with the opening sentence  a reader can already say how madly and obsessively inlove Humbert is with Lolita  This desire is even more encouraged during several encounter when the girl made unconscious  or consciously perhaps  as Humbert alluded  actions while they are alone These incidents which are all very much highlighted in the movie  thus my earlier impressions that the girl had it coming  due to her own flirtations  We had been everywhere  We had really seen nothing  And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely  trustful  dreamy  enormous country that by then  in retrospect  was no more to us than a collection of dog eared maps  ruined tour books  old tires  and her sobs in the night    every night  every night    the moment I feigned sleep  But Humbert also said these passages  which in the movie strike me as Lolita merely mourning the death of her mother because the next scenes will show Lolita being the gay child again  In other parts of the book  I also found that Humbert revealed how Lolita showed reluctance in some of the lovemaking  the emptiness in her eyes and her withdrawal from showing interest in sex These revelations showed that while Lolita might have enjoyed the game that she initiated on Humbert  she was trapped on her own play and is helpless at it  Humbert being the sick lover that he is  took advantage of the child s helplessness  even threatening her of a miserable life if ever she will squeal to the police or to anybody  For the first time  I feel for the young Lolita But who is to blame  Her selfish mother who never took an initiative to teach her of good morals and never keen on showing a love that is fitted for a girl who is growing up without a father  The nymphet loving Professor Humbert who took advantage of the young girl s promiscuity at the very end  Or Lolita herself  who experimented on a man s desire before the right age of rationalism and good judgment I do not know what it is in the book that made me enjoy it  When it comes to the style of writing and the heartfelt narration  Vladimir Nabokov is a winner  There was an extensive use of French phrases which I find annoying if not unnecessary  because I don t understand french of course   but over all the book was a insightful read  It made me wish that Lolita was at least 18  making all of Humbert s desire justifiable  But then again  there won t be any story To end  I would like to share with the last part of the foreword  For me  this is the core of the whole story and had the readers concentrated on this more than the story itself  or had Hollywood included this in the movie  then I think Lolita would not be as criticized as it was This foreword is written by a certain John Ray Jr   author of some book  but his identity still remains questionable  This commentator may be excused for repeating what he has stressed in his own books and lectures  namely that  offensive  is frequently but a synonym for  unusual   and a great work of art is of course always original  and thus by its very nature should come as a more or less shocking surprise  I have no intention to glorify H H   No doubt  he is horrible  he is abject  he is a shining example of moral leprosy  a mixture of ferocity and jocularity that betrays supreme misery perhaps  but is not conducive to attractiveness  He is ponderously capricious  Many of his casual opinions on the people and scenery of this country are ludicrous  A desperate honesty that throbs through his confession does not absolve him from sins of diabolical cunning  He is abnormal  He is not a gentleman  But how magically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse  a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author As a case history  Lolita will become  no doubt  a classic in psychiatric circles  As a work of art  it transcends its expiatory aspects  and still more important to us than scientific significance and literary worth  is the ethical impact the book should have on the serious reader  for in this poignant personal study there lurks a general lesson  the wayward child  the egotistic mother  the panting maniac    these are not only vivid characters in a unique story  they warn us of dangerous trends  they point out potent evils  Lolita should make all of us    parents  social workers  educators    apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world   Una historia escalofriante contada desde el punto de vista de un cultisimo psicopata  El relato es fascinante a la par que vomitivo  y lo que resulta mas inesperado  todo ello contado con bellisimas palabras e intensas descripciones  Personalmente encontre la parte intermedia del libro demasiado lenta  lo que me hizo dejarlo aparcado cierto tiempo en mi mesilla de noche  Pero el viaje infinito conduce finalmente a un desenlace genial  En general me ha parecido fantastico  I hated and loved it  I found it deeply disturbing  but also very funny  Humbert Humbert is horrible  but in the end  even though he is still horrible  he achieves some sort of strange grace Yet another book on the Modern Library Top 100 with an unlikeable cast of characters   El mundo  nuestras sociedad esta llena de tabues  estigmas y dogmas que tienen sus propias contradicciones en la realidad  la realidad que no es completamente pura  los seres humanos que no son unos ejemplos de coherencia entre lo que escriben  lo que leen  lo que piensan y en lo que creen  la religion y las costumbres son la mayor muestra de esto  Lolita enfrenta este dilema ante el lector por eso se debe ver como un todo  no es un capitulo es una historia completa e inseparable tiene que verse cuestionado ante la relacion de un hombre mayor y una ninfula el cual es un asunto escandaloso  socialmente hablando   yo alejo de este plano el asunto erotico que aunque si es una parte importante de lo que define al libro no es lo esencial  Pensar acerca de que el amor o la perversion pueden establecerse en una linea muy delgada y tratar de comprender  no de juzgar las acciones de cada uno de los personajes es un asunto como dice el mismo narrador que debe hacerse desde la amoralidad y entonces  aqui nos desconcertamos porque toda nuestra existencia esta contemplado en eso  en lo bueno y lo malo  en lo que es correcto o no y aunque en esto debemos ser imparciales es mas interesante aprender a contemplar la contrariedad de nuestras creencias en relacion con el libro Que pasa en la relacion de una  nina  y un hombre mayor  que pasa cuando anteriormente y ahora segun muchas de la leyes latinoamericanas  no vemos contemplado las relaciones desde una madurez intelectual  si no desde la madurez sexual   realmente estamos legitimado para juzgar la historia  para decir que esto esta mal  Si vamos a establecer un juicio de valor acerca de Lolita no se debe hacer desde lo escandaloso  si no desde las decisiones que se tomar por un amor o una obsesion  eso aun no lo he comprendido   desde la personalidad de Dolores  desde los sentimientos de Humbert   Lolita convinced me  a heterosexual non pedophile woman  that a 13 year old girl was amazingly attractive  The hyper educated first person narrator  Humbert Humbert  is so seductive he keeps a reader eager for more gruesome details on his tail of abuse and morbid obsession with Lolita  My way of reading and loving has been irrevocably altered by this mind blowingly beautiful story   Vladamir Nabokov is favourite authour  Este livro e um daqueles que se pega a pele de quem o le e assim segue  vida afora  Nao me esquecerei da mente conspurcada do Humbert  a ousadia da Lolita e o ambiente doentio que e proporcionado por estas duas pessoas  tao retorcidas  tao marcadas pelo pior da natureza humana  Foi a primeira vez que dei por mim dentro da cabeca do vilao e  consequentemente  surpreendi me ao desejar que os seus planos se concretizarem sem embaracos  Alguma magia o Nabokov dedicou a este  Lolita  When i started reading Lolita  I thought it would be book about a love between an old man and a little girl  a reciprocal love  but it turned out to be very different than I expected  It s a book that deals with pedophilia from the pedophile vision  The author managed to pass this sick view in the most perfect and discreetly way  As a drama book  I give five stars  but I just hope no one considers it a beautiful romantic book  which is not  I wish there was a way to give four and a half stars in the rating scale   so I ll go with a five  This novel is in my top five all time favorite books  I loved this book  Nabokov is a brilliant writer Very early on you know Humbert has been caught for his crimes  So while I was reading the book I was not wondering   what s going to happen next   but instead concentrated on   what s happening now  Brilliant   I m gonna discuss this objectively like I always doBefore all H H  was mentally ill He said that himself so you shouldn t regard him as a pedophile monster  Plus Dolores herself was no saint  she practically seduced the guy Looking at the cause of it all it is evident that his   ill orientations were triggered by a childhood trauma he once loved a girl in his youth  and she died suddenly before they could be together  He kept looking for her apparition young girls that looked like her to get his conclusion  this fella is actually pitiable  His end was so pitiable he actually loved Dolores and was so devastated when she left him was even more devastated to find out the reason for which she left him a pedophile like himself  this girl IS a nymph  But he loved her regardless and sacrificed his freedom to demonstrate his love Salutations Sir Nabokov  regardless of its daring content this one was a master piece  I m incapable of writing thoughtful and in depth reviews so if that s what you re looking for  please continue scrolling by I ve been meaning to read Lolita for a very long time  When I was in high school  a friend of mine did a presentation on it in English class and then I wanted to read it more than ever  Fast forward three years or so and I m in university  I m taking a Russian literature class with a couple of friends  for fun  and this book is on the reading list I just had to gobble it up Lolita is a beautiful and twisted book Nabokov is a genius That is all Also  I have absolutely no desire to write a quiz on this book next week please kill me  I ve never felt more disgusted in reading a book  The author effectively translates a pedophile s point of view into something with which the reader can relate  There were moments where you forget that Lolita is a child  which is one of the more disturbing elements of Nabokov s writing style  and you find yourself empathizing with the narrator  Finding myself feeling this sentiment  I became a little enraged  So much of what I had studied before in recognizing signs of sexual abuse were in this book  and hearing how easy it was for the narrator to gain trust  access  and friendship with everyone around Lolita was terrifying  While I hated what the narrator would describe himself doing  or what he described himself feeling about young girls  I cannot deny that it only reinforces the power of the written word  Bravo to Nabokov for writing so well  and in such a disturbing manner  to really submerge the reader s mind in a different perspective    An impeccably written masterpiece centering around the most revolting subject one can possibly imagine     You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style      This was the first of my 2012 project  reading some of the  classic  books I ve missed through the years  Although the subject matter of  Lolita  is  well  icky  the novel itself is wonderfully written and quite entertaining  After finishing  I understand why this novel has remained so popular  I once had an English professor claim that this is the finest book ever written in the English language  I cannot disagree  That Nabokov can make us want to stay along with the mad natterings of Humbert the Hummer is a testament to his great skill with language  and his mordant wit  Having seen the film years and years  and years and years  ago  I was never all that inclined to read the novel  Eventually  after many mentions of the novel s literary references and of Humbert Humbert as the quintessential unreliable narrator  and thanks in no small part to the entertaining analysis by Sparky Sweets  PhD  I decided to give it a go The book is nothing like the movie  The book is not the paedophile smut that its detractors  many of whom never made it past the first hundred pages  claim  This novel is good    perhaps even required    reading  and if you re worried about getting strung up by the National Legion of Decency  then read it unobtrusively on a Kindle  next up  Lady Chatterly s Lover  Many a better reviewer than I have written countless words on this novel  so I ll keep it brief  This is a novel about the dark side of the male lover  jealous  controlling  mindlessly pursuing his own pleasure at the expense of his partner  The age of Lolita makes her all the more subject to being controlled by Humbert  much as the inveterate drunkenness of older Rita likewise leaves her dependent on him  We have here  in Humbert  a tyrant and a misanthrope  a man who enjoys belittling and abusing others  and who wields what little power he can acquire as zealously as the most small minded bureaucrat  Other people and their feelings do not matter to Humbert  they exist only for his dark amusement  and when the world works against him he sobs like a newly toyless child Humbert is  of course  erudite and charming    another in a long line of literary psychopaths  In writing his memoirs  he turns his charm on the reader  a smooth tongue attesting to his good intentions and the natural simplicity of his desires  Yet his own depiction of the events betrays him  demonstrating a Bluebeardish lack of concern for others  and ultimately sabotaging the sympathy he is trying to inspire  Lolita is difficult for me  but not because of the  sensitive  subject matter   I mean  come on  You know going into it what you are getting into when you open the book  But what I find so difficult  obviously  is that nothing ever gets better  I hate that they both die  I hate that Lolita leaves  I hate that she never admits to truly feeling real love for Humbert  I hate endings that aren t happy But if it wasn t the way it is  if it DIDN T end the way it does   it would not be the manic masterpiece that I believe it to be  You would miss out on the true beauty that is Lolita   the predoratory chase  everything before their stay at the Enchanted Hunters  the twist your guts lines    with your little claws  Lolita    Humbert coming full circle and realizing that he loves Lo no matter her age   and  above all  that BEAUTIFUL poem   I cannot get out  said the starling   At 12 and 16  the ages I was during my last reads  it was very easy be scandalized by the sexuality and the idea of maybe being a  Lolita  yourself  and to let that drama overshadow what a beautifully melancholy tale this truly is  At 24  I have loved and lost  have obsessed and fretted over toxic loves   it resonates now  I felt genuinelysad for the both of them   lonely and miserable in their own ways  isolated but never alone  I was also surprised to feel such anger and resentment towards Lo   while a victim  she is very much guilty in her own right  She knew her own power  and she knew how to use it  But then again   who can truly blame a 13 year old child who is still mentally undeveloped  It is difficult  that s for sure  How truly sorry I feel for Humbert  how much I pity Lo s losses   I cant truly put into words  Both were wrong  both were to blame   how easily I forgot that we were reading about a man and a child  eventually  It is a perfect love story about two people  ships in passing  who are completely and utterly doomed  Literary perfection   l tzl lwlyt  lrwy   b d mrwr kl hdhh lsnwt  tHtfZ bTby th lSdm   lm ysbq ly  n qr tu lktbin wGd  mthl nbwkwf  Ht   n klm  wGd l

  this is NOT a review  just a few musings and scattered remarks for my own reference  because yet another interpretation   lengthy comments on this truly amazing classic are not needed What a gem of a novel   It totally lived up to its reputation  or even exceeded it at points The mere fact  however  that so many people recommended it to me  intrigues me quite a bit now that I have finally read it  See  I do know that a large fraction of those who strongly suggested they had enjoyed the novel  are normally repulsed by irony that borderlines cynicism  and witty self depreciating comments of the sort Humbert utters all the time  In addition  the description of mid 50s America is pungently critical  with a lot of the facets of society that are being torn apart still totally applicable these days  While I usually really get a kick out of such a style of writing down poignant observations  I daresay that most other people are usually rather repulsed by it  So  why all the  in my opinion totally justified  praise from corners I would least expect it  Grins  In fact  I am not sure whether most readers in fact  get it   and by that I do NOT mean the main topics themselves  but rather the nuances of description   I mean  literally  Nabokov blew me away in his laconic cynicism that shimmers through oh so often  One short sentence at the end of a paragraph can sometimes ridicule all of what had been described as  worthy  before  Speaking of humour    I am sure I did not even get half of what Nabokov put in these mere 300 pages  yet still I had to outrightly laugh loudly a dozen times  Of course  the handling of English  as I non native speaker  I appreciate Nabokov s effort even more  is   as everyone seems to agree   flawless  And lastly  but probably most importantly   THIS IS A LOVESTORY    I LOVE this book  These are my original thoughts from 2004  I just finished reading Lolita  which at the moment is leaving a stain  ack  again   upon many things  It is a beautiful piece of literature  a supreme example of what the English language can do  at the same time incorporating scads of French  even in verse   I also find it extremely unique that the author Nabokov wrote in his second and not his first language and still showed such deft skill  Another bizarrely fascinating point is how comedic  ironic  dark  romantic  dramatic  tragic  true and egotistical this work is because of its narrator  But fear not  Nabokov makes nothing appealing in the relationship between H H  and Lolita  and you certainly don t feel sympathy for him  But I think what keeps those pages turning is that you know Humbert despite his words  his actions  his feelings  his humanity  is going down  You just need to know when and why  But its not malicious  This book is offered up as a psychological analysis and so I felt a certain feeling of separation  as when reading a scientific journal  I think it made the book feel safe to read the book through totally  Just some thoughts of mine working through this thing and how well Nabokov wrote it  I thought I was going to be sick a time or two while reading this   so  well done by you Nabokov  well done indeed When the reader gets so wrapped up in the story and believes so strongly in the characters and their actions that it moves the reader to illness  that is good writing  Almost too good  I had to remind myself that it wasn t real  that Nabokov wasn t writing a memoir in which he seduces and rapes an adolescent  His style  the language he uses and the way he employs it are all of the highest ability A comparison to Thomas Mann s Death in Venice must be made  paralleling as similarly as they do  The ever declining degradation  an aging man clinging desperately to youth  a madness of possessiveness  and perhaps more  Both describe pitiable main characters  but where they differ is that while Mann s is just pathetic  Nabokov s is dangerous  It is that danger that keeps the suspense taunt  the narrative edgy  We never quite know when Humbert Humbert will totally lose his shit  which we know by his own admission must eventually happen  For all that danger and the repulsive horror  there is a surprising amount of humor  not only within the story itself  but also in the language  Certain passages gain near Wodehousian levels of hilarity   Near  I say  It s very hard to successfully marry funny material to subject matter as abhorrent as this  Still  to carry it off to any degree further shows the ability Nabokov displayed in crafting this fine  if ghastly  novel  In the field of erotic literature  this novel has probably touched the awareness of the public more than any other  to such an extent that the once innocuous name of Lolita has become another name for youthful feminine charm and sexuality  to put it mildly  Those are the historical facts  but what of the novel s merits  What is most definitely is not is pornographic  it doesn t contain a word of even mildly bad language  nor is it a trashy series of sex scenes featuring a girl of that name  In fact   surprise  surprise if you ve never read it   Lolita doesn t even contain a girl called Lolita  Writing in the first person  Nabakov does not directly tell the story of his famous heroine  but that of Humbert Humbert  a man obsessed with the memory of his dead childhood girlfriend  Annabel  to such an extent that his life is dominated by her loss  As his teens pass  and then his twenties  he fails to mature beyond his loss  When he meets a girl of twelve  Dolores Haze  who resembles his lost love  he attempts to posses her  body and soul  and in his obsessed mind he re names her  Lolita   The final result is that both he and Dolores are destroyed  along with several other characters  Is it a sad story of an unfortunately obsessed man  who should perhaps be pitied as much as condemned  No  for there is more to it than that  Is it a simple story  No  for Nabakov is not a simple writer  telling a plain story of black versus white  If he were  then Dolores would be a naive and innocent girl  and Humbert an absolute villain  But Nabokov is not a limited moraliser  wagging a solemn preacher s finger at a wrong doer seeking his evil way in a world of innocence  Instead he examines the complexities of both love and lust  for Humbert finds that his hidden  furtive desire has met its mate  as he discovers that Dolores has an open  natural tendency to depravity to match his  Moreover  most of the characters that the two are in contact with are flawed  and some are so self deceiving and tacky that the reader may be drawn into preferring Humbert s admitted lechery  and the reader  not allowed to deal easily with absolutes in a simple situation of right and wrong  is made to journey in an intriguing world of comparisons  Whereas Dolores s nature is a mixture of easily given love and defensive cynicism   she rapidly falls in love with the handsome  exotic Frenchman   Humbert is cowardly  conceited and stupid  with a talent for bungling everything he attempts  from emotional relationships to violent crime  a failing that he does not notice  Failing also to see that Dolores is attempting to seduce him  he seeks to trick here into a physical intimacy that she would have awarded him willingly  As his stupidity becomes more apparent  so does his indifference to the well being of others  as he accepts marries a woman he detests to gain control of Dolores  and later contemplates murdering her  But all his desperate  bungling manoeuvres fail  until to his surprise   Dolores casually offers herself to him  after revealing that she has already had a lover  Technically this is the climax of the novel  and here Nabokov ends the first of the two books into which it is divided  Some critics say that the latter half is too long  and I agree with them  remarking however that it may merely seem to long  due to being the record of a highly unpleasant relationship  When the death of her mother gives Humbert total control of Dolores  he has achieved his great ambition  but proves utterly incapable of living with his success  Dolores  sullen at the wandering life that they adopt  but entirely dependent on Humbert  strives not to regain her freedom  but for the two to lead some kind of stable life  But Humbert  living in a world of his own  composed of ecstasy and fear   he has gained Dolores  but is terrified of discovery   fails to listen to her  or realise that the actuality that he has gained is living Dolores  not imaginary Lolita  Trapped in his conceited self image   he is a pedantic scholar  who has produced no work of his own  but imagines himself a sophisticated artist   he fails to communicate with Dolores  or lower himself from his pretensions to her simpler  healthier attitude to life    speak English   as she says at one point   and he destroys what remains of her love for him  As Dolores grows older she is able to gain more control over her affairs  and she tortures him as he has tortured her  and eventually escapes him  After several years of agonised search Humbert finds her again  Dolores  prematurely aged by hardship  is no longer the cute nymphet that he lusted for  but Humbert still loves her  He has finally achieved a maturity of sorts  He gives her a needed gift of cash  and the two part forever  Later both are destroyed by exterior forces  However  Nabokov is not such a sentimentalist as to make Humbert s redemption complete  and it is by a further lunatic act that he causes his own end  Erotizm kasali  harikulade usluplu bir psikolojik sosyolojik cozumleme denemesi  Tum romani  icindeki su cumleyle ozetlemek mumkun  Uzun kollu bacakli  bir seksenlik  adem elmasi hizli hizli inip cikan bir oglan  Lo nun turuncu   kumral gobegini gozleriyle yiyip duruyor  O gobegi bes dakika sonra optum aslanim  Her sey sahip olma duygusu ustune  Yasaklara karsi gelmek  yapilmamasi gerekeni yapmak yapabilmek ustune  Dolores e sahip olmakla ilgili  O istemedikce ustune gidip elde etmeye cabalamakla ilgili  Insanin kendisinin olmayan her seyi istemesiyle ilgili  This was the second time I had read Lolita  and I think I appreciated it more the second time around  There is  however  one central issue  and that is that the two movie interpretations of the novel I ve seen keep interfering with my visualisation of Nabokov s words  The characters  scenes  and images from the movies   i e  the directors and the actors  interpretation of the book  overwrite  my own imaginative interpretation of the novel  However  moving on   What all people who read Nabokov say is that his English is imaginatively and flawlessly descriptive   a veritable treasure trove of English words from a novelist who thought his mastery of the English language was second rate  I must admit I couldn t help but be drawn in by the beautifully flawed  self indulgent  cruel  selfish  deluded  pathetic  desperate  tragic  self centred  would be tragic hero of his own eulogy   Humbert Humbert  The character of Lolita is both tragic yet immortal   she is a character that  once read  can never be forgotten  It sometimes maddens me with jealousy to think about the ease with which Nabakov just seems to toy with the English language  even more so when I think about the fact that it is his third language  Lolita is one of the most tragic and brilliant tales I have ever read  and though I know it would never soon happen  this book would be perfect for any dedicated English class  as the wordplay  structure  and meticulousness in this book is breath taking This story details the exploits of the suave  sophisticated  but dubious and predatory Humbert Humbert as he travels the United States with the orphaned  and now his adopted daughter  Delores Haze  The reader is taken through parks  sights  and hotel rooms  the latter about which the most eye catching sentences are to be read  Martin Amis was most on the point when he said that apart from being too pornographic  the book manages to be not pornographic enough  which leads to some of the most antagonizing paragraphs I have ever encountered  where I can t quite place my finger on which sentence I m supposed to be horrified by and why  yet the feeling is so gut wrenchingly present  The closest the author comes to being graphic is when the infamous Lolita uses the euphemism  souffle  to describe a naughty activity with which every Western teenager is familiar  yet with only a few brief descriptions of either Dolores  tender form or the lumbering tower of sweat and hair that is Humbert  the more sensitive reader can be brought to tears of fear and disgust And yet the story manages to be so goddamn sad  The clever reader soon realizes that our Lolita is dead from the get go  and that one is reading the final testament of apology to her rested soul  from a narrator who is racked to the brim with guilt and pain and only desires redemption  which he tries and in his mind fails to achieve  One is easily made to sympathize with this pathetic creature in the later chapters  as he seems to be defeated at every turn by his rival  the cunning Thespian Quilty  and more easily defeated therefore by himself  I felt the near attempt by my eyes to stream tears down my face when the fateful reunion of our two main characters finally takes place  and Humbert is faced with the result of his lust and impulsive desire  a complete robbery of innocence  the loss of a childhood  Broken and battered  he takes us to the climax of his vengeance  which is far too great an ending to spoil  as it displays the epitome of Nabakov s fantastic  elusive wordplay and diversion This story earned its place as a classic  in my opinion  with quality to spare  No literary collection could be so rightly called without this tale  I can t even try to be clever about this  read this book   Lolita  brilho da minha vida  fogo dos meus flancos  Minha alma  minha lama  Lo lii  ta  a ponta da lingua enrola no palato e desliza  tres socalcos  ate que estaca  Ao terceiro  nos dentes  Lo Li Ta Assim comeca o livro sobre Lolita   as memorias sinistras  o destino  desatino de um maniaco mais velho   Humbert Humbert  e a sua perversa paixao por uma menina de 12 anos  Lolita   Uma paixao incomum referida eufemisticamente pelo narrador de Lolita como  amor ninfico  Muita agua correu e continua a correr sobre este livro publicado em 1955   foi considerado pornografico  rejeitado por quatro editoras   proibido nuns paises   autorizado noutros com cortes e finalmente considerado como um dos melhores romances do seculo XX  Primeiras impressoes todos nos temos e perdemos  Foi o meu caso A obsessao de Humbert por  raparigas puberes  nao me chocou pelo facto de a escrita de Nabokov ser magistral  meticulosa  cheia de jogos de palavras referencias literarias e sentimentalismo disfarcado de cinismo com o fim de justificar uma paixao proibida Uma historia de amor tristemente bela e melancolica   Bem veem  eu amava a  Foi amor a primeira e a ultima vista  a vista para todo o sempre  Um tragico final  Humbert  ebrio de um passado impossivel e de um presente inexistente  so podera partilhar Lolita na imortalidade literaria Aos treze anos Humbert apaixonou se por Anabela  da mesma idade  mas constantemente vigiados por adultos  os dois jovens nunca conseguiram consumar a sua relacao  Penso ter sido esse o facto que levou H H  a situar o seu ideal de mulher menina numa figura do passado Condeno veemente a pedofilia  mas e a minha opiniao sobre  Lolita  Para acabar so mais uma palavra  one last word  para elogiar a primorosa traducao de Margarida Vale de Gato  A truly jaw dropping book  For those who have not experienced this work or have hesitated to take it on due to time or to subject matter  here is a suggestion for the curious to consider I recently had to take a solo road trip and decided to find a classic novel on CD for the journey   I d previously had excellent luck with this idea  I listened to a wonderful reading of Mary Shelley s Frankenstein on the road and it offered a whole new dimension to the story  Our public library had several to pick from and I ended up with the Vladimir Nabokov novel  unedited on CD  I must stress that listening to  Lolita  read aloud is certainly NOT for everyone  But the incredible  virtuoso performance by classically trained British actor  and spine chillingly convincing  Jeremy Irons as the infamous H  H  is simply unforgettable  OMG  Enough said  Este es mi libro favorito  hasta ahora al menos  El personaje principal  Humbert  se termino convirtiendo en uno de mis muchos amores platonicos  Su fijacion con Dolores es algo increible  y la manera en la que Nabokov la describe es cautivante  Me parecio que es un libro un poco dificil de leer  me demore mas de lo usual en terminarlo  pero me encanto   This book is one of my all time favorites  I enjoy extremes  and this book uses the most beautiful  ecstatic language to tell the story of one of the ugliest  most detestable narrators of all time  Yet through the highly decorated words of an unreliable narrator  very clear truths about America  childhood  and human nature are revealed to the careful reader  Obviously  the story is not to be taken at face value  This book changed the way I think about storytelling and the use of language  I have to admit  I never thought I would like a book about a forty something year old guy being obsessed with a twelve year old as much as I do Lolita  Nabokov is such a wonderful writer  I sometimes completely forget about the impropriety of the narrator s motives  he could probably write about anything and I d enjoy it  The whole novel is backed by such passion that pushes the narrator  Humbert Humbert  as a writer to express himself and his unnatural desire to be with Dolores  He references a lot of things throughout the book  some of which I had to look up  He also sometimes creates his own words  There are a lot of embellishments in his writing and a lot of it effectively and gracefully augments and adds to his ideas  Besides his beautiful writing style  I find this book to be pretty darn funny  surreal and very clever  Humbert Humbert  Dr  Blanche Schwartzmann   Blanche being white in French  Schwartzmann meaning black man in German   Doctor Black White Man  expressing the idea that Nabokov thinks many doctors oversimplify things   are a couple examples of this  A lot of people have expressed some disappointment in Part Two of the book  which I admit I was a bit bored with the first time I read it  Compared to Part One  not much happens in terms of plot changes in Part Two but the great writing is still there and it really picks of towards the end  It s such a joy to read  I recommend this to any fan of the written word  I d also like to recommend The Annotated Lolita  reading it has given me a deeper appreciation of this book  Yeah okay I ll just be metaphorically throwing up for the next five years or so  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita  OMG Okay so I completely liked this book a lot  I took a pause in the middle because it got slightly less interesting  I realise I didn t understand it fully pay full attention NEED TO READ AGAIN IN NEAR FUTURE  with a french translator   I absolutely loved the idea of it and it really was so beautifully and cleverly written  I can t even    I m so surprised how this book made me feel  Maybe more on this review when I reread it  The best book  Ever    Lolita  mijn levenslicht  mijn lendenvuur  Mijn zonde  mijn ziel  Lo lie ta  de tongpunt daalt drie treden het gehemelte af en tikt bij drie tegen de tanden  Lo  Lie  Ta Ze was Lo  gewoon Lo  als ze met haar een meter vijftig  s ochtends met een sok aan stond  Ze was Lola in een lange broek  Ze was Dolly op school  Ze was Dolores als ze ergens haar naam onder zette  Maar in mijn armen was ze altijd Lolita  Ik kon mijn nieuwsgierigheid niet meer bedwingen  eens ik dit boek gekocht had  ik wilde zo snel mogelijk weten waarom het in de jaren  50 zoveel stof heeft doen opwaaien en waarom verschillende uitgeverijen geweigerd hadden het uit te geven  En ewel  dat wordt de lezer algauw duidelijk Humbert Humbert is ergens in de 40 en een pedofiel  Nee zo noemt hij zichzelf niet  hij is btw een uiterst onbetrouwbare verteller want hij geeft alles weer zoals hij het ziet zonder rekening te houden met wat de rest er echt van vindt  daarmee doel ik vooral op Lolita zelf  het 12 jarige dochtertje van de huisbazin op wie zijn begerige oog valt  Sinds hij op z n 12de verliefd werd op een meisje van zijn eigen leeftijd  wil hij enkel nog die  nimfijnen  zoals hij ze noemt  kindmeisjes met een speciale aantrekkingskracht enzovoorts Om dichter bij Lolita te komen  trouwt hij met haar moeder  die  nadat ze ontdekt heeft dat de brave Humbert achter haar dochter zit  verongelukt zodat Humbert rustig zijn gang kan gaan met Lolita   wat hij dan ook doet  Het arme kind verzet zich niet  ik bedoel  ze is 12  ze weet niet beter  en ze reizen heel Amerika door  tot ze zich ergens vestigen zodat Lolita naar school kan  Ze maakt nieuwe vrienden  beseft dat het gras aan de overkant groener is  en als ze opnieuw op reis vertrekken  laat ze zich  ontvoeren  en ontsnapt zo uit Humberts klauwen  die er kapot van is en zint op wraak want eigenlijk hield hij gewoon heel veel van Lolita Het was een gruwelijk  huiveringwekkend levensecht  meeslepend verhaal  Ik heb het vaak vol afschuw efkes aan de kant moeten leggen  op adem komen  eens slikken  moed verzamelen om verder te gaan Wat een onderwerp ook  het is en blijft taboe  maar vandaag de dag gebeurt het nog met ontelbaar veel onschuldige kinderen Lolita is een literair pareltje  Nabokov is een meester in het vertellen  in het inleven in zijn personage  je ziet alles zoals hij het beschrijft  Tijdens de lange reis zie je gewoon die nevelige bergen voor je  die weidse landschappen  de sappige weides  de versleten motels met sigarettengaatjes in de gordijnen  de verlaten  routes   de eenzame benzinestations    Het is een aanrader   als je tegen het onderwerp kunt Het boek is 2keer verfilmd  eerst in 1962 door Stanley Kubrick en in 1997 door Adrian Lyne  De onbetrouwbaarheid van Humberts vertelling kun je op het doek niet zo goed weergeven en vooral Kubrick heeft wat veranderd aan de plot om het aannemelijker te kunnen maken  Bought this for my Nook so now I have it in both physical and virtual formats  On this second go round  I m finding a lot of things I missed before  even with an annotated version    which is not the same as the one in my Nook   Looking at it through a law enforcement lens  when I read it last time  I d earned my CJ degree but had not started working in the police biz   I think Nabokov must have conducted interviews or read case studies  The  relationship  between HH and Lolita actually follows a very realistic path  leaving a wake of destruction in the lives of everyone  including HH  I can see myself re reading this again and again  it will always be one of my favorites  I almost feel like focusing on a different thing each time I read it  the surface storyline  the Poe references  the  tour  of the US  etc   From October 2008  I m not even halfway done with this book but I am completely in love with it  It is so refreshing to read a book that was written to be read  not turned into a movie  Yes  I love movies  but this novel is essentially a love letter to the English language  The subject matter is almost irrelevant  yet not  because the topic is as seductively repulsive as the voice in which it comes to life  I ll definitely be buying my own copy  One of the best books I ve ever read  I ve actually read many of Nabokov s previous books  I believe there were about 20  and while they are certainly interesting  and he is a consistent artist   most aren t to my taste But Lolita blew me away  This is a nearly perfectly structured narrative  both effective and affecting  and it works on multiple levels  And the writing is phenomenally witty  For once  the description of the book is totally true to its content  This is an amazing portrait of mid 20th century America and the best book about love that I ve read  love in all its monstrous and possessive forms Just goes to show that a writer should continuously build a body of work  even if it takes decades for that true masterpiece to come  How Nabokov so intricately  artistically and phantasmically pried open a mind of a narcissistic pedophile and presented it to the world  I have no idea  Lolita  I found  was hard to read not because of the author s writing style but because of the themes it encompasses  Nabokov has written H H  so poetically  that a character so vile glossed over by delusions of romance and tragic love has managed to lure the  unsuspecting   unwilling  readers into his fanaticism and voyeurism which makes me all the more hateful towards him   Lolita is a courageous and truly unbelievable novel  Though clearly by or about a foreigner  Nabokov s descriptions of 1940s America are as timeless and perfect as his better known odes to twisted passion  For example  Nabokov s take on traffic signs     We climbed long grades and rolled downhill again  and heeded speed limits  and spared slow children  and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields  and no matter how and where we drove the enchanted interspace slid on intact       and on New England forests  more specifically  sex therein       in the Wilds of America the open air lover will not find it easy to indulge in the most ancient of all crimes and pastimes  Poisonous plants burn his sweetheart s buttocks  nameless insets sting his  sharp items of the forest floor prick his knees  insects hers  and all around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes   of semi extinct dragons    while the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling  in a hideous green crust  to a gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike   His ability to elaborate on minute details in his highly alliterative  allusive  and hypersexed prose alternates pleasingly with dense sentences that propel the novel s action forward in single bounds  For example  Nabokov on a skirmish between Humbert and his grown up beau     one day she proposed playing Russian roulette with my sacred automatic  I said you couldn t  it was not a revolver  and we struggled for it  until at last it went off  touching off a very thin and very comical spurt of hot water from the hole it made in the wall of the cabin room  I remember her shrieks of laughter  Like Moby Dick  Lolita is ostensibly about one  notorious  thing  but somehow touches on just about every theme  topic  and temperament while seeming to encapsulate just about everything work of literature that preceded it  That it was written in Nabokov s adopted language and set in his adopted country puts the very idea of a translated novel to shame   Lolita e uma obra prima  Escrever uma historia assente num tema destes e como fazer uma operacao cirurgica delicada  Felizmente  Nabokov tem uma mao firme e consegue  atraves da primorosa linguagem que utiliza e do seu genio satirico  que eu esteja a escrever uma review de um livro que julguei que ia odiar  Mas  como nao tenho a eloquencia do Sr  Nabokov  deixo aqui as palavras dele       ofensivo   regra geral  e apenas um sinonimo de   invulgar    e uma grande obra de arte e evidentemente sempre original  pelo que sera da sua propria natureza apresentar se nos como uma supresa mais ou menos escandalosa   Prefacio de Dr  Ray John Jr   personagem de um sociologista criada por Nabokov  some of the most gorgeously clever prose ever penned  whereas Humbert fumbles  Nobokov fondles his own Lolita  ie  Language  like the double entendre Don Juan  did you know that  Lolita  was originally written in English  Nabokov did not translate it into his native Russian until three years later  mind blowing to watch as he navigates the literary nuances of our language like Vasco da Gama with a Garmin   I don t have fancy vocabulary and a scenic way of writing reviews  I m only 15 and reading millions of books from boredom and desire for more knowledge  I have a liking for books that are very descriptive in the scenery  the smells  etc  That s why I prefer the French  only they can describe as they do   This book exceeded my expectations of a somewhat popular book  I knew that the term  Lolita  is used a lot these days concerning girls with a sugar daddy or whatever  and one of my favorite singers said this was her novel of choice  So I decided to pick it up and read it  I certainly wouldn t say that every 15 year old should read this book  I mean I m assuming my mom didn t know the plot or else she would not allow me to read it  If the book wasn t written in prose  I wouldn t have been able to make it through to be honest  Like if I were to tell the whole story to my friends  they would just look at me thinking I was sick  The only way to learn the story of Lolita and poor Humbert Humbert is to read it yourself  There s always the alternative of watching the movie  but make sure you watch the movie with Dominique Swain  That s the best version   This book was extremely well written and perfect to read in the Summer sitting by the pool  It is certainly not a rainy day book until you get to the end  I have a newfound liking for tennis and French literature now  Not to mention I enjoyed how Humbert described his dear Lolita whenever he was infatuated by her beauty  I would say this book is the only convincing love story   Just terrific  Plan on going back and rereading some this weekend to grab a few sentences I liked and try to catch a few of the anagrams  allusions  etc    Velikolepno Some of the most gorgeous   memorable prose I ve read in a long while  Very few writers have played as imaginatively with the English language as Nabokov has  A subject that would ve been revulsion evoking in someone else s hands  except may be Marquez  becomes literature in Nabokov s  After a reread  I spotted references I had entirely overlooked the first time round  For all his disgusting thoughts and activities  I couldn t help but be enchanted with the way it s written  WOW  There just isn t a dull paragraph  I felt uncomfortable at many different points in the book  but I completely understand the acclaim this book has received  It was so very well written Jeremy Irons was  of course  a fabulous performer  and I still wish he would narrate my life  http   xkcd com 93   But I was so impressed that I think I would like to go back and read this on paper  if life proves long enough I loved the clever alliteration and word games that Humbert Humbert sprinkled into his storytelling  I loved the characterizations and illustration of landscapes that appear elegantly as a sort of secondary effect of Humbert s emotional introspection Humbert s  ruining  of Lolita is obvious and powerful  but it was striking to me that Humbert is likewise scarred by Lolita  I also liked that  even as he remains the same in apparent essentials  Humbert Humbert somehow redeems himself by acknowledging his truths  and loving the adult Lolita  My favorite book  This is about language  and about post war America  It s a sort of detective story  It s a sort of love story  the disturbing  obsessive kind   I love having the annotations  because I freely admit that I do not know every author Nabokov references  nor do I know about the cultural tastes of dashing European gentlemen of the time period  butterfly species  or the French language  This is a book I reccomend to everyone  It s not a comfortable book  but it is a beautiful  beautiful  beautiful one   There are    No wordsNo other book could make me feel like this    angry and satisfied    resentful and hopeful    wanting to close the book and burn it and in the same time re read certain paragraphs with such pleasure    How strange the lines you set for yourself can disappear under such well said words    I m the biggest feminist yet i found this    too good    too real    too beautiful    No more words can be said  Nabokov is a master  Really powerful  feels like getting run over by a really dirty truck  No wonder this book is in all the  best books ever  lists   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Truly a modren masterpeice  the oldest book I have thusfar reviewed  but also one of the very  very best  Nabakov seems to have originated  can he say that   in literature  which may very well have given birth  at least in part  to the awesome genres of today that so frequently bring this question out of prudish mouths  and with style What can I say  The book s about a pervert  But it s a love story  and a truly beautiful one  even if the lover is a forty year old man and the beloved is a twelve year old girl  The story revolves around Humbert Humbert  a quiet pedophile writer that lives out his fantasies with  nymphets  only in his mind  until he moves into a house with his perfect one  Humbert falls for her not in a sick  disgusting way  but in a puppy love  head over heels  butterflies in your stomach kind of way   shudder  The only trouble is  Lolita isn t the angel that Humbert sees her as  she s conniving  vain  and very manipulative  Worst of all  at least for a good chunk of the story  she knows how helpless he is  how madly in love with her  and she knows how to use it against him  Herein lies Nabakov s genius  he pulls a brilliant fast one on us  This is how the dialogue goes Nabakov  I m going to tell you a love story Us  Cool Nabakov  It s about a pedophile in love with a little girl Us  Not cool Nabakov  But I m going to convince you  By the end  you re gonna feel sorry for the pedophile  not the victim Us  Yeah right Nabakov  Just you wait And he s the one grinning at the final page  Instead of making Humbert the attacker  the deceiver  the manipulator  the predator  he makes LOLITA those things  Humbert is made to be the victim  he is so  so devoted to her  he will do anything to make her happy  and she knows it  and uses him endlessly to her own ends  This is only a small portion of the book s charm  Nabakov  a writer in English  French  and Russian  uses this second language to elitist level excess  He spices the prose up to such a super flowery degree  we know he s being over the top on purpose  But it s so riveting  so witty and well crafted  and for god s sake  so FUNNY  it becomes impossible to put down  By the final chapter  Nabakov has you  hook  line  and sinker  I dare you not to weep for Humbert  and marvel at the tears  and wonder where they could have possibly come from  Lolita is basically the best thing to come out of my college education  Just kidding  It s up there  though Yes  Humbert does consumate his love  among other sinful activities  So as per usual  not for kids  not for the jittery  and not for you if I ve truly offended with this review     IMPORTANT    Make sure to get the annotated version  as I ve indicated  The book is full of untranslated French  and you won t be lost without the translating notes  but you ll be missing out on the book s full potential  Lolita was such a great book  it was nice to switch from the Scarlett Letter to Lolita because of how driftnet the two books are  I loved the style it was written in as well as the whole plot  I was hesitant to read it at first because of what I had heard the content had but it made me realize a lot about our society   This is a classic and a wonder  How did the author manage to make Humbert such a sympathetic SOB  Not easy to do  This book starts out with my most favorite intro  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  Lolita is one of the best fiction books I ve read so far  I don t like people who classified it as pornography  The key to the book is STYLE  It s well written as it took Nabokov a lot of time rewriting it again and again  as I ve read somewhere   Regardless of its plot  talking of fiction  I think  Lolita is a perfect example  I think the idea Nabokov wanted us to perceive is that there are many Humberts in our society today  We actually need to know they exist to prevent our girls from them In the mean time  Humbert Humbert with his eloquence and master of language and courtesy he might be synonymous to nowadays media that succeeds to grab little girls  as well as little boys  innocence   Though I m well aware of Lolita s premise and plot  the writing and narrative is so refreshing  especially in ESL  I m not wowed or anything  since it s a popular item for literary discourse  Five stars  but it s not heading to my favourites  To paraphrase the beginning A ma zing  This time the tip of the tongue takes no trip down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Instead your tongue is reluctant to move as your mouth drops open in the A  to gradually recover by touching the lips and part them again  exhaling with a slight gulp in the last syllable  A  Ma  Zing  That is often the case when you read parts of this book It was A  plain A  in the beginning  from Awkwardness when you realize the plot  Older guy attracted to a really young girl  standing four feet ten in one sock  It was Ma  Magnetic  the use of language making it irresistible  Pure pleasure to read as the story unfolds  And finally  Ing  from ingenious  it goes beyond me the talent it takes for someone to write so skillfully in a foreign language  She was Lola in slacks  Lolita in underwear  Our hero is obsessed and knows it  every sight  every movement of hers is provoking his lust  And although there are no explicit scenes one will find the book disturbing at times  But in my arms it was always Amazing  Replace Lolita with your loved one and you can see in the same scenes the idealization of love  Forget about her age and you can see a love story and a road trip across the US  all described with such linguistic artistry unlike any other book you ve come across  To quote Nabokov  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  this book is aesthetic bliss  bh myd ryshh khn shdn snswr w khwndn trjmh frsy yn khtb Lolita was a great book  despite the implications of its morally questionable content and its even more morally questionable protagonist  who goes by the pseudonym of Humbert Humbert   What s fascinating is the fact that the book is told from the point of view of a person would be seen as a pedophile  and that we are able to know exactly what he is thinking and how his mind works  Nabokov uses vivid and descriptive in depth language about practically everything Humbert thinks  and sometimes the things he writes can be comedic to me even though I have no idea what he s talking about  There s also a sense that perhaps the protagonist isn t telling us the complete truth  that he is hiding some things from the reader  which makes us want to know more about what happens The first part of the book centers around Humbert s life and his failed love affairs  He explains his fascination with young girls  who he calls  nymphets   and how this fascination is perhaps rooted in his childhood experiences and love of this one young girl he knew as a child  The book then takes a more narrative style  where he writes in a journal about his experiences living at a mansion with a woman and her daughter  and his elaborate plans to be alone with the daughter  Eventually  a dramatic turn of events allows him to finally obtain his original goal  a girl named Lolita  the  nymphet  for whom the book is titled  and goes around the country with her while she has no idea where her mother is The first half of the book describes his experiences with the girl and their travels around the country  Eventually  a mysterious character begins to follow them  and Humbert becomes paranoid that someone is trying to take Lolita away from him  Eventually Lolita vanishes  and the readers are left without a clue of where she has gone  The book then goes into a sort of  well  after she disappeared  I did some things  and I will tell you what these things are  mode  where Humbert explains his life after her disappearance  My personal opinion is that the first half of the book is the better half  Perhaps only because it lacks the presence of Lolita  a character whom we have come to known for so many pages  and for whom the book is titled   Her absence makes it seem like something has changed dramatically  which is perhaps what Humbert felt  Anyhow  the book does change after this midpoint  and we no longer get to see Lolita as a little girl  Eventually  he does find her years later  married and pregnant  and it just feels a bit unusual  but intriguing to see how her life turned out  I didn t exactly understand most of the last half of the book for some reason  There are parts where I had no idea what Humbert was doing or describing  but this may be due to the fact that I sort of lost interest halfway through  He does a bunch of other things and I don t exactly know why  but they seem to me to be just as entertaining  if not more  because of my lack of knowledge of what is actually going on  than the first half of the book Throughout the book  we develop a sympathy for Humbert and in a way wish for him to succeed  because perhaps we realize that he isn t really that bad of a person  or perhaps he is  it depends on the individual s point of view   despite his intricate plans to do things which we may deem as immoral  When Lolita leaves  we feel sympathetic for his loss of the thing he has tried for so long to obtain  and when we finally see Lolita again  we feel sympathetic to his desire to have her back again  It s a bit sad at points  and if I had been told at the beginning that I would become sympathetic with a pedophile by the end of the book  I would have been doubtful  But Nabokov is successful in bringing about a connection with the characters  we get to know their personalities  speech habits  their thoughts  etc enough for us to sympathize with them In the end  I thought Lolita was a very good read  despite a few personal flaws I found in the book  If pressed to name the best American novel of the second half of the 20th century  I would place Lolita on a very short list that also includes Invisible Man  my choice  The Adventures of Augie March  Goodbye Columbus  and one or two others  Even within that select company  Lolita stands out for the sheer beauty of its prose  I know of no finer writing anywhere than the penultimate paragraphs in which Humbert comes to the realization that his lust has stolen her childlood from Lolita  Not only does this belated insight humanize Humbert  it sets the moral scales back in balance  reminding us  in irresistible language  that Humbert is indeed a monster  albeit a monster with a golden tongue Our need to read Lolita as an allegory of this or that was not lost on Nabokov who emphatically denied any such intention  And I believe him  If anything  Lolita is a demonstration that gold can be spun out of dross if the weaver is skillful enough  Nabokov says to us  in effect   Look  I can create an amoral child molester  a murderer by proxy  and make you like him   And he does  And then at the very end  through the vehicle of Humbert s remorse  he makes us wonder how we could have been so easily seduced   Current obsession  Not one of my all time favorite books  but holy shit  I mean  HOLY SHIT  The prose is just dripping with poetry  with feeling  I read it through once  sadly having to abandon a majority of the French included  I m just terrible at that language   and already I m listening to the audio book  read by Jeremy Irons omg   This is truly a masterpiece  if only for the expertise Nabokov exhibits in bending the reader s sensibility toward and away from again his despicable narrator  unforgettable Humbert Humbert  I put this off for too many years  It was hard  but it was worth every bead of sweat  Seriously  if you haven t  read it  This book was so hard for me to get through  It was excellent  horrifying  beautiful  and awful  Nabokov s prose is second to none  and a pleasure to read  But I m not sure the book  the story  was a pleasure  exactly  I believe this warrants a second reading to properly evaluate   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongye taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta I don t think I have ever been so aware of the beauty of language as when I was reading the first chapter of Lolita  From the opening to the end I was enchanted  I ve never called a book lyrical before  but that is the word that comes to mind  This is another one of those books for which the ratings system seems absurd  I thought this book was fantastic  of course  as have many before me  I am a bit concerned about the back cover and some of the blurbs  though  They claim it is some kind of fantastic love story    but it is not a love story at all  It is a madness story  And while madness and love overlap  they don t do it here  changed me  the most beautiful use of language    even if intentionally hammy it made the perfect tenderness of some phrases all the more lovely  and also the saccharine moments of real unsettlement       it really rattled me  i thought about it for months after reading it  i most definitely fell into its trap but it was very much worth it   Despite the very disturbing way Nabokov writes about sexual fantasies with young girls in this novel  you cannot find fault with his prose  It s a bit disheartening to find a writer with better mastery of English as his second language  than you have as your first  Every line is beautifully written  I highly recommend reading anything by this author  I chose to give Lolita five stars not particularly because it left me enthralled  reading it became a chore towards the middle   but because Humbert s savage and destructive love towards Lolita is just so heartrending that I couldn t give it anything but  Destructive love is my forte  and let me tell you  the heartbreak Humbert endures at the end of the novel was enough to put me in tears This is a book I could read over and over again just to analyze the fuck out of it  And I would be analyzing about Humbert s love  and what is love  etc   etc  There was a snippet of a review on the back and it said something about how Lolita is the only convincing love story of our time    and I think that s pretty succinct  Love is possessive these days  Aw  who am I kidding  love has always been possessive  True love  that is  Damn  I could write a treatise on this  Maybe one day I will  But one read isn t enough to do that  A masterpiece  if I ever did read any  i m not sure of being worthy of reviewing this Ps  For all you stupid people  yes  I refuse to show mercy  who dare to say that the story at time  drags  or anything along those lines  don t you understand that the narrator is INSANE  Every word adds something to the story  every passage is essential to understand a part of something bigger PPs  If you wanna hate back on me for calling you impatient  then I ll help out  I agreed with the review on the back of my book that said that this was a  true love story   Because it was  For me  at least  often misunderstood   a real work of self destruction and childhood lost obsession amongst many other themes   I was speaking to my tutor this morning about Lolita  and one phrase in particular stuck with me   this novel opens your eyes to how manipulative academic knowledge can be   Humbert Humbert is a white  middle class academic male who commits terrible atrocities  but escapes detection because of his charm  appearance and social status  No  it s not going to be a novel everyone will love  Nabokov has a distinctive writing style that I love but which  if you don t  will become very wearing very fast  He laces black humour through the plot in a way that makes a distasteful subject farcical without losing its impact  and at times laugh out loud funny  Particular farcical treatment is given to the deaths  for instance I ve given Lolita five stars because it s a book that readers will love or hate  there s no middle ground to it  It divides readers and critics who side with either Lolita or Humbert  and side so fiercely that they develop a fierce hatred or dislike for the other  It certainly provokes interesting discussions that make it perfect to read in a book club  and it s a fascinating text to study and explore the different sides of  Of all the books I ve read multiple times  it s the only one which has provoked a completely different reaction depending on the stage of life I m in  Whatever your opinion  you re guaranteed to take away something from this book  credo che si debba essere uomini oltre i quarant anni  per capirlo  bisogna essere uomini oltre quarant anni ed essere stati innamorati di una donna piu giovane  e molto piu illuminata  e averla persa  e odiare la causa della sua perdita  aver provato la sensazione di infantile impotenza davanti a una donna che ti concede l accesso al suo corpo  ma ti guarda con indifferenza  e non ti ama  VIEWTIFUL Lolita e uma obra que e incapaz de deixar qualquer leitor indiferente  Desde a narrativa ao tema abordado  Nabokov deixou nos um legado magico  lirico e poetico limitado apenas pelo seu proprio esplendor enquanto ser humano com um enorme talento Adonis Durado   Behance com O livro conta nos de maneira muito terna  delicada e apaixonada a historia de Dolores Haze  uma menina de 12 anos que o que tem em falta em inocencia  compensa em concupiscencia  seduzindo fatalmente H  Humbert  um professor de 37 anos contratado pela sua mae para lhe dar aulas em casa Depois de alguns solavancos na vida de Humbert  ele e Lolita partem numa viagem pelos Estados Unidos  partilhando o mesmo carro  a mesma cama  a mesma vida A historia segue uma linha simples  e o relato de H  Humbert aos leitores da sua historia  recorrendo a figuras de estilo apropriadas e muito bem aplicadas  assim como palavras cujo proposito e embelezar qualquer narrativa Apaixonei me pelo estilo de Nabokov a partir do momento em que li Contos Completos  1  infelizmente ainda nao pude comprar o segundo volume  e soube que Lolita viria a ser uma leitura obrigatoria Quanto ao tema escolhido  ainda que nos repulse  Nabokov levou nos a repensar nas nossas opinioes sobre onde se encontra o limite entre a seducao de uma menor e a patologia mental do adulto  Percebemos que este e mais um daqueles casos que nao e tudo preto no branco  como costumamos dizer de forma corriqueira  e que cada caso e um caso  O amor era puro  verdadeiro  sofrido e agustiante  por vezes  Mas nao e so isso  Um paragrafo   que talvez nem todos tenham lido   explica bastante bem a intencao de Nabokov com este livro e outros da sua bibliografia Passo a citar  Existem almas gentis que pronunciariam Lolita sem sentido porque a obra nao lhes ensina coisa alguma  Eu nao sou um leitor nem um escritor de ficcao didactica    para mim uma obra de ficcao existe apenas na medida em que me da o que eu chamarei  sem rodeios  extase estetico  que e a sensacao de estar de alguma forma  em algum lugar  conectado com outros estados  sendo que a arte  curiosidade  ternura  bondade  extase  e a norma  Portanto  sim  podemos avaliar as suas obras pela narrativa  mas  se eu tivesse que aplicar uma percentagem  diria que apenas entre 10  a 30  e o espaco de importancia que a narrativa tem nas suas obras O segredo e  como todos no fundo sabem  a sua pericia na producao de uma experiencia literaria esteticamente aprazivel que nos leva a pensar que ler as suas obras e tempo mais do que bem gasto  The best novel I ve read in great  long while  Absolutely brilliant  Much to learn from Nabby s expertise and gems littered throughout the novel  It should be read over and over and over and over again   Now in perusing what follows       our tour was a hard  twisted  teleological growth  whose soles rasion d etre       was to keep my companion in passable humor from kiss to kiss   Part II  Ch  2  p  163  There is nothing more atrociously cruel than a adored child   Part II  Ch  3  p  175 And I thought to myself how those fast little articles forget everything while we  old lovers  treasure every inch of their nymphancy   Part II  Ch  18  p  235 after having read this book three times  i think i can accurately say that i have read lolita my copy of this book is quite possibly my most prized posession  i received it as a birthday present and the spring of that year i was lucky enough to take a class with Aleksandr Dolinin  one of the foremost scholars in the world on nabokov  we read this book in class and i have never marked a book up as much as this one  almost every page has insights into his wordplay  the subtle hints to other works  and brilliant puzzles that nabokov incorporated into this book  there are actual pieces of paper stuck into this book where the page margins didn t leave me room to write everything i wanted to say if i was stranded on a desert island with one book for the rest of my life  this would be it   Although this book made me grab the dictionary every two minutes  I still had a chance to admire how well it was written  Morals  laws  social codes  ethics  human decency aside  it is a masterpiece  This is an exquisite book on a repulsive subject  and I have so much to say about it  I felt a bit dirty reading it  because at times I found myself sympathising with Humbert  I began to question why I didn t hate this character  and hated myself for not hating him  After having a long think about it  I realised that I found his plight to be heartbreaking  Wanting something that you know you re not meant to have is quite a torturous experience  This book conveys a real sense of Humbert s self loathing  he hates himself enough as it is  which is perhaps why I was able to feel sorry for him  I felt myself questioning Humbert at times  though  Strangely enough  it feels as if you  the reader  are also being seduced by Humbert  It s hard to judge whether his recollection of events is truthful  and whether he loves Lolita or just lusts after her  There is nothing particularly graphic in Humbert s depictions  which makes me feel as though he did love her  and considered these acts to be quite sacred  For me  it comes down to the age old nature nurture debate  Are paedophiles born that way  Can you really have any control over your desires  If you desire something immoral  is it your fault  Can we choose who we love  or are we bound by our emotions  These are the questions I found myself asking whilst reading this book  which  despite the subject matter  was a pleasurable experience due to the mind blowingly eloquent prose used to describe his obsession  Nabokov is a truly brilliant author  one of the best ever  Lolita is a masterpiece   I feel like the book Lolita was written very well  The diction and verbiage makes you want to side with Humbert  He uses language to seduce the readers of his memoir  and he almost succeeds in making himself a sympathetic pedophile  He criticizes the vulgarity of American culture  establishing himself as a hard working intellectual individual  His ironic  self mocking tone and his complicated word games avert the readers  attention from the horrific situations he describes  It is also one of the funniest serious novels I have ever read  and the vision of its abominable hero  who never deludes or excuses himself  brings into grotesque relief the can t and the hypocritical conventions that pervade the human comedy  this was such an amazing book  one of the best love stories ever written  the way that the author builds the character of a man who you should hate  into one you have sympathy for is phenomenal the book reads like a long poem    it is so descriptive and lush  i loved reading about his travels across the united states and reading the descriptions of the land and towns and scenery  i felt like i was there    i could feel the sunsets and woods  good stuff  Totally love this perverse dark comedy and the elusive character it stalks    the young and tantalizing Lolita  The narrator  a bookish drifter with a penchant for girls on the cusp of womanhood  meets the nymphette of his dreams in the daughter of his landlady  He sets about seducing her as she leads him on an adventure around the country  While this might be a novel about victimization and rape fantasy in the hands of a less skilled writer  Nabokov really nails the fantasy of girlhood innocence contrasted with reality  the physical and mental development of a rebellious teen ager and her inevitable  heart wrenching womanhood  This story hits home for me in a very strange way  and certainly not in the surface way   I think we ve all been Humbert Humbert  the man who obsesses and caters to the only thing he really wants and finds pleasure in  The unfortunate truth is that what he wants is most unattainable  Unattainable by society  and by non reciprocation  And just to be even a little closer to what he finds most beautiful and precious in this world  Humbert settles  if only for a time  with what he cannot stand  That pain and endurance is nothing compared to just having little Lolita nearby  He ll do anything to keep her close  to make her his  and to keep her innocent  This is  hands down  one of my all time favorite reads  Even if it hurts  Lolita is a book that would not function in the hands of a more staid or conservative prose stylist  Nabokov s language  filtered through his self justifying monster of a narrator  is florid  sensual  and synaesthetic  all the better to add visceral horror to what the language is used to describe  The reader is given a feast of deliberately beautiful language that  in a different context  would be used to lend an immersive empathy to a conventional romance  Here  though  when the language of romance and sensuality is applied to a child  the beauty takes on an amoral brutality  and the reader can never be drawn in by the beauty of the language without also realizing what they are complicit in enjoying  A key theme of Lolita could be said to be the disconnect between aesthetics and ethics  in light of this  Nabokov s hyper visual  aggressively exquisite writing style is not only complementary  but essential to the novel s effect In both its mannered  meticulous grace and the sense of creeping alarm that accompanies it  Lolita is the textual cousin of a Balthus painting  That much of Balthus s imagery might have appealed to Humbert is largely incidental to the resemblance  but still highlights the sharp divide between disturbing images and the delicate aesthetic techniques that an artist or author may use to convey them  For God s sake  what are you doing on this site

part of me is hesitant to give it 5 stars  to say that I enjoyed something so morally repugnant  As Nabokov himself has stated  however  this is not a didactic novel  There is no moral in tow  His writing is about  aesthetic bliss   and that is what Lolita affords its reader  The prose is eloquent  witty  charming and captivating  and in a strange way  so are it s characters This is the real magic of Nabokov and his fiction  to romanticise the repugnant  and turn the abhorrent into something enchanting  Even if it is disturbing  From its own fictional foreword  which describes it just perfectly  Many of his casual opinions on the people and scenery of this country are ludicrous  A desperate honesty that throbs through his confession does not absolve him from sins of diabolical cunning  He is abnormal  He is not a gentleman  But how magically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse  a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author   A classic for all the right reasons  Though slow towards the end  Lolita is an intense read that throws moral reasoning into the foreground  Believable  with a well spun story  I couldn t put it down   When starting this book  I thought that I would not be able to read past 20 pages  This book was very easy to read and the word play and wit that Vladimir Nabokov uses makes you really get into the book  While I had a hard time with the concept of this book  his writing style and the way he describes the characters really does pull you into the story   view spoiler   The whole time  I was hoping for Lolita to be able to get away from Humbert  I was happy that she finally was able to escape during her stay in the hospital  The only part of the story that upset me was when Lolita wrote to Humbert for money  When Humbert went to her home  she acted like he did nothing wrong and even went so far as to say he was a good father    hide spoiler   Overall  this was a fantastic novel and the author was able bring Humbert to life with the apologies  the sobs  and justification of his behavior that it draws you into the story   Read again February 2008  One of my students is writing an interesting paper on the confessional and romantic modes of narrative  dividing the confessional by how HH addresses the reader  gentlemen of the jury  gentlewomen of the jury  etc  She argues HH presents a distinct Lolita to each of these audiences  Neat  Obsession  transcendence  passion and despair  among many other conflictions of ecstatic romanticism made all the more delirious by inescapable remorse  I am neon green with envy at the vocabulary at this man s disposal  Just a gushing torrent of rich  lucid  mind boggling prose  K  This book is in my All time Top Five  Period  I do have a  but   however  I think the tone near the end shifts in a way which makes me feel like it s fuckered up a pinch  I don t wanna hear about how this book doesn t belong in my Top Five from Ben Fowlkes or anyone else   Stunning  I don t know if I ve ever read such an incredible writer   his prose is really poetry  I thought reading about a pedophile romance wouldn t be my walk in the park  but the fact that I found the book interesting fascinating enough to finish should tell you something    really an incredible book  I d really recommend it  if you have the patience to get past the first 30 pages or so  Everything about Lolita is beautiful  This was fantastically terrible  and my use of terrible is not one of poor quality but of horror  This is an absurd and ironic love story  Absurd in a Camus sense and ironic based on values we hold as a society of maturity and innocence  I will be thinking of this book for a long time to come I know  so all I can give you is my recommendation and the above vague blanket analysis   Khumuus ene nomyg LOLITA g ooroosoo akhmad nastai zaluud ashigluulchikhsan   barag khuchinduulsen gezh ikheer shuumzhildeg ium bainaleeKhARIN BI

sentence of it was beautiful  I thought it would be a little hard to get into  or the writing would be a little too dense or flowery for me  but this wasn t the case  His writing is amazing  This is a great  albeit perverse  and convincing love story  Vladimir Nabokov is a wordsmith in the truest sense of the term  he crafts with words  shapes them  subverts them  toys with them  In LOLITA  his notorious 1952 bestseller  he uses them to skip dangerously back and forth across the lines of morality  dropping the reader into the derelict but brilliant mind of a confessed pedophile  Nabokov employs language to pore lasciviously over every inch of twelve year old nymphet Lolita in such a way that the reader feels intensely uncomfortable yet hypnotized  It s a remarkable  challenging  rewarding novel   Hamburger Humbert  hahaha Nabokov is amazing  His diction is so silky smooth  so poetic  it s almost depressing  In Lolita  the narrator  although a pedophile  has a great sense of humor  you end up liking him anyways  Well  I did  There s also an amazing rebuttal to the philosophical question of the  problem of evil   Without choosing sides  he turns the entire argument into a strange loop  If you accept that Humbert Humbert s work of art  the novel is presented as if it is written by him  is as beautiful as it is  then you admit that evil is worth having around  and maybe God knew what he was doing after all  The person most likely to appreciate the beauty of the novel is the aesthete  who may find himself uncomfortable arguing on behalf of the theist  And the theists  well  they had Lolita book burning parties  which takes all the wind out of the  greater good  sail  The irony is superb  Everything about this novel works  and it s one of my all time favorite books  Highly recommended  A true classic  It made me uncomfortable at first but it slowly turned into clinical depression  Nabokov s prose is one of the most beautiful I ve ever read  I cannot believe this is not his language  It s one of those reads that makes you reread a sentence just because of how poetic it is  Why has a book about a dirty old pedophile become so widely recognized as a great and important novel  I don t know  but it has  And it should  I don t understand these things and can t explain them  This book is a work of art that stimulates the wordy pleasure part of the brain that  if I remember correctly  is buried somewhere in the parietal lobe   best road novel ever  Of course  the main characters  relationship in this book is really sickening to me but  all the perversion aside  I loved this book and it kept me thinking about the characters even months after reading it  I WAS SURPRISED seeing that the book DIDN T HAVE overly SEXUAL LANGUAGE  The actions and events were described mildly so nobody get s thoroughly aroused but understands what is going on  Although there were parts in French that I didn t understand and English isn t my native language so there were some words that I didn t understand  I loved it and enjoyed it to bits  I admire the author for his realistic point of view  interesting characters and heart breaking events  plot twists This book talks about 3 kind of loves  The parent offspring kind  the sexual lust kind of love  the childish crush kind of love and love that lasts a lifetime  It s a good book to read if you want to get out of your comfort zone or to change your perspective of love according to age  Mesmerizing  Such eloquent prose  the tale of a horrific tragedy perpetrated by an absolute monster  va gio day  toi dau kho vi nhung an nan va hoa dai   There are no spoilers in this review  At first I was quite sceptical about reading this  The topic is after all taboo  a forty year old man who falls in love with a twelve year old girl    BUT after my boyfriend sent me a page of the novel I had to admit  it is brilliantly written  I didn t feel mad  I understood the narrator s point of view and read as though it is a love story  The narrator  of course  is the forty something Humbert Humbert who  falls in love  with the girl child  Dolores Haze  I ve never been more manipulated in my life When I finally got my hands on this novel I thought of just having a glimpse of the first page    It eventually turned to 13 pages  There are so many things I can say about Lolita  It is hard to put down  it is full of drama  comedy and passion  it is one of the most tragic novels I ve ever read  it is the best written novel I have ever read and it is undoubtedly a masterpiece  I would recommend it to anyone  above the age of 15  who enjoys  fine literature  romance  drama and classics  Or just someone who wants to read a beautifully written masterpiece One last thing  if you are considering to read Lolita PLEASE DO NOT read the forward  You can read it after you finished the book  It gives insight to what happened after the ending and it does contain spoilers  Okay  I really did not think I was going to enjoy this one   classic or no   but I actually did  It is so fantastically written and structured  that one is drawn in almost despite oneself and one s best desires on the subject The book s only flaw is really a certain tendency to slow down as one goes along  and to keep slowing down  so that in the second half one has an inclination to skim some of the longer  or some of the more pointless  moaning chapters  where Humbert Humbert does nothing but describe  moan  describe    Ah senin yuzunden kana batacakLo li ta  Siyah guller  ak guller  The five stars I give this book are not based on the content  but on the literary brilliance that Vladimir Nabokov has created in this novel  This book played mind games with me  the reader the entire time  and just when I though I had it figured out    well  it slapped me in the face with it s brilliant verse  voice  and secret messages  I would not say that I enjoyed this book  This book quickly became one of the most sinister and grim experiences I have ever had reading a work of literature  The way in which it became clear that the protagonist was repeatedly raping Daloris was painful to read  The gradual baring of brutal nature of their relationship is a exquisite work of terrible fiction  This book is a penetrating portrait of childish America  seen through the demented eyes of decadent Europe  Also a masterpiece of prose   It is a misnomer to call Lolita an  erotic novel  as some have done  instead  the book is a psychological masterpiece  The narrator s pedophilia is indeed rampant throughout  but what some people ignore is how Nabokov completely immerses the reader inside the mind of a psychopath  and he does it without once eliciting sympathy or pity for the character  Unable to empathize with another human being  Humbert Humbert remains always focused on himself  on his own feelings and reactions to the exclusion of all the others around him  especially the object of his very creepy desire  Unusually for most literature  what this narrator does not say is every bit important as what he does tell you  but these very careful omissions in the narrative are crucial to the character s nature  For example  while the rest of Europe  where part of the book takes place  is gearing up for World War II  something that every single person would have noticed in some way  this gathering storm barely appears on Humbert s radar  he sees neither the politics nor the reactions that people around him must have been having to current political atmosphere  Humbert also misses completely how much torture he puts himself through  that is to say  he experiences plenty of emotional distress but never once stops to examine where it comes from or ask himself why he feels as he does   The scary thing  of course  is that most people who are not psychopaths or pedophiles do the same thing  A major part of what makes the book so compelling is how its author plays with language just as facilely as its narrator plays with reality  Nabokov  who was born and raised Russian but wrote Lolita in English  clearly absorbed not only the English language but also European and American culture more deeply than most native English speakers  One has to admire Nabokov for two things at the very least  The first is his mastery of English despite not being born in an English speaking country  To be fair  he was raised speaking English alongside Russian and French  but it s never quite the same learning a language in a country where it s not commonly used The other  and this is more particular to  Lolita   is his ability to express the inner mind of his characters so deftly even when one is as repugnant as the protagonist of this story In fact  that he did this with Humbert is kind of disturbing  Not being a pedophile I cannot say if his exposition of Humbert s mind was accurate  but it was believable  I never once paused and thought to myself that something Nabokov had written seemed out of place or character I considered knocking off a star simply because of the themes  but then I came to my senses  The choice of theme was a disturbing one  not a bad one   and it is certain that this book is notorious enough that I need not worry that someone might read it based on its rating and not be aware of said themes As you can see from the edition  I listened  not read  this  The reader performer was Jeremy Irons and he gave a masterful performance  It was his creepy reading of the initial chapters  where Humbert explains the qualities of nymphettes as well as why he is so drawn to them  that nearly made my put it aside Irons was as in character   smug  arrogant  suave  sophisticated to a tee   as one would expect from a great actor  Five stars to you too  sir   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  This level of brilliance from the very first page  Here we have that rare sort of novel that is so astoundingly perfect that you know from just a few pages in that it s going to be one of the best books you ve ever read  Disgusting  confused Humbert traps the reader just as he does poor Dolores Haze  but  unlike his tragic nymphet  the reader has no desire to get away  At least I didn t  I found myself fascinated and repulsed by his obsessive enslavement  I wondered for many pages how such an unsavory  unstable character could survive as the protagonist of a novel  The answer lies in the surprising  disturbing statements Nabokov makes about love  Thanks  Vlad  I knew I would enjoy Lolita  but the writing language was just so great  I understand why this is considered  a classic   Humbert s obsession with Lolita is of course disgusting  but I couldn t help feeling sorry for him at times  To me  Lolita is a bit of a femme fatale  I loved reading this   Perhaps this says something odd about me  though I m not sure what it is   but this book and  A Clockwork Orange  are my two favorite books of all time  I have read Lolita many times  both for myself and for school  Every single time I read it I learn more and notice more  Nabakov s brilliant word play makes every sentence a pleasure to read and tease apart  I particularly adore his anagrams with the names  I found the plot of the novel to be bold and honest  He took on a very taboo subject and did it in a humanizing way  I actually felt for all of the characters and frankly had difficulty placing blame square on anyone s shoulder  The book was terrifying yet illuminating  Wow  Totally forgot to post this book  Given the sad circumstances of the time I read it  dear  sweet Ignatz succumbing to FIP   I suppose I m not surprised Terrible painful memories aside  a brilliant and beautiful book  And horrifying  of course  But brilliant  I read it because I hadn t read it and I really knew that I should have  especially after discussing it with my honey and reading the Nafisi book  And normally when you read something that other people have raved on and on about  it disappoints  Not Nabakov  Not little Lo And later after that  I saw the original movie  Again brilliant  Perhaps one of the best adaptations ever  God Bless You  Shelly Winters   But not as good as the book  Classic novel narrated by the ultimate   unreliable narrator   Would have been a completely different novel if the narrator was Dolly  Glad I read this book  Very challenging subject matter but absolutely brilliant book  Nabokov s prose is dense  layered  magnificent  I wanted to highlight almost every passage  I could not skim a word  Hands down the best writing I ve had the pleasure to read  On top of his masterful use of language  Nabokov is impressively adept at manipulating readers  emotions  He subtly eases us into colluding with that devil Humbert  has us accidentally sympathizing with him  I found my conflicting emotions about the book mirroring Humbert s about underage girls  loving the book when I knew I shouldn t seemed an echo of Humbert desiring girls when he knew it was wrong   My sympathy peaked when Humbert s diary is discovered and I felt a kind of breathless panic for him momentarily until I realized  Oh of course I WANT him to be caught  to be stopped  That Nabokov could have me so emotionally invested in a disgusting pedophile was masterful  And  how easy it was to be lulled into believing Humbert s account as the truth  when certainly he s an unreliable narrator  I d find myself actually believing that Lo seduced Humbert  loved and desired Humbert  before startling to the reality that of course Humbert  like many pedophiles  was deluding himself that his victim was a willing participant when that was almost certainly a lie  as evidenced whenever Lo is quoted in her own voice  calling it Rape  saying  No  No  leave me alone  etc   But that it would have been easy to blame  demonize  judge Lo as anything other than a poor victimized child is further evidence of Nabokov s brilliance  I honestly feel  as a writer  having read this book motivated me to explore better ways to use my words  The story is scandalous  but the writing style is phenomenal  I marvel at his mastery of the English language    and wasn t it his third language  An amazing  horrifying novel Bruce Stone has a magisterial commentary on the novel here  which considers the reaches of the nearly perfect literary question   if books can be salutary  can they not also be toxic   High level literary conversation about the novel between two major critics in Slate  here  I really need to do a re read  Then I ll write a review  For probably my favourite novel of all time  I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book  I knew very little about the subject matter besides that the gist of this book is that he is a pedophile  and so I had my own reservations  I thought that perhaps the author was going to try and justify the protagonist s love for the 12 year old girl in some way  which from the get go I knew I would never be able to accept  and couldn t fathom how it would be possible  given that so many people love this book  I was happy to find that while the protagonist is convinced of his love for Lolita  the reader is not  I wasn t  and don t believe others would be either   His  love  is basically an obsession with her physical appearance and her demeanor  but nothing more  In one of his more upsetting descriptions of his love  he talks about Lolita one day having a daughter  and vaguely suggesting that he would be sexually attracted to this  nymphet  as well  Humbert Humbert describes moments where he tried to have real conversation with Lolita  only to find that they have nothing in common and the discussion would awkwardly fall flat  which confirms that his love is very one sided  and that any attention that Lolita has given him is confused and misguided due to her youth  Humbert Humber is delusional  egotistical  and quite frankly a sociopath in my opinion  he is charismatic  intelligent  and has very little if any genuine empathy for others  not even Lolita  He may  think  that he does  but really his  love  for her is only obsessive lust  and it ultimately aims to serve himself  Perhaps one could argue that he cared for her  but he admits that their relationship basically screwed up her life  and that he destroyed her childhood with their incestuous relationship  I actually think this book probably excels in its description of a sociopath and how they operate  The prose is incredibly engaging  and on top of the excellent writing I happened to listen to the audiobook version read by Jeremy Irons  whose performance is exceptionally memorable and HIGHLY recommended  honestly  probably the best narrator I have every listened to   I m rambling quite a bit  but overall it was an excellent read listen and highly recommended  The ever throbbing obsession of H H  towards Lolita is undeniable  in which the revolving life of an imagined  young and open America is presented throughout their coupled life  The abrupt separation kidnapping  the later discovery of Lolita s new  no longer a nymphet life in the future after years of disappearance  and the lustful revenge of Nabokov who finally found the culprit of a fiend that took Lolita away in the first place  all of which are spellbinding developments  I particularly in love with the long prose that Nabokov masters so in Lolita has given me a pleasant refuge out of it  What strikes me is the tone of the almost lightly dipped sexual scenes where everything it was narrated felt very docile and nonchalant  contradicted my expectation at the beginning  But nonetheless  as Nabokov puts it in the end  his method is to not bring up a raunchy nature of an erotica and let the simplistic matters of life take over  While people are worried about the nature of this book which is indeed controversial  I think the point of the book  of disclosing the mind of a demented  obsessed  ostracised child loving soul  certainly gives us the necessary outlet of people from all walks of life  No one is normal  In writing  Lolita   Vladimir Nabokov has chosen a very difficult topic to demonstrate his writing prowess  Why  Because many   if not most   readers have formed views about the subject matter and the characters before they have read the book  My review is not of the content but of the writing and the ambiguity of language Words are used to both summarise facts and to create fiction  Differentiating the two is not always easy  especially if the subject matter is distasteful  Our own views colour our relationship with the book  but should they also influence our assessment of literary worth Much of the journey with  Lolita  is undertaken from within the mind of Humbert Humbert  a paedophile  and his fixation on the eponymous Lolita  This is a book which  in my view  cannot be effectively translated into a movie  It is a book where the power of language and the images and reactions created at an individual level have the most impact  We are usually in Humbert s mind and  for me  that is not a comfortable space to occupy  And yet amidst Humbert s scattered  fixated thoughts and cunning but ultimately doomed plans are glimpses of beauty  The butterfly references can be read on a number of different levels  I choose to see the symbolism of transient but elusive beauty So what is it about  Lolita  that makes it worth reading  Simply  the power and beauty of Nabokov s writing  But that particular beauty depends upon which book you choose to read I have read this book twice in 40 years  Each time  I have formed different views  This book is not a paean to paedophilia  it is an illumination of the labyrinths of the human mind  So I ve just finished reading this again  for a class this time  and I just love this book so much   You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style    yes you can  Throughout Narbokov plays with the reader who never loses interest  I defiantly think a second reading was also needed to pick up little clues left in the text that can not be deciphered until its end  And to be honest a second reading is not hard  Have to say  definitely picked up more on H H  s manipulative ways the second time round two  making it hard to trust anything we read while at moments I still feel an almost sympathy for him  that is how amazing this book is  Truly fabulous  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo Lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Delores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita   A masterpiece  Lighthearted book  so well written with lots of observations on life and desire   Absolutely astonishing mastery of the English language  Jaja  schaam op mij  ik had dit nog niet gelezen Um  Wat kan ik zeggen dat nog geen duizend keer voor mij gezegd is  en beter  door mensen die er meer van weten dan ik Een meesterwerk  Bijna niet te bevatten dat Engels niet Nabokov s moedertaal is  Een heel boek over een pedofiel en een twaalfjarig meisje  en hun uitdrukkelijk zeer seksuele relatie  zonder ook maar een vuil woord  Bij momenten hardoplachend grappig  bij momenten schrijnend triest  bij momenten verstillend pakkend  Volledig geschreven vanuit het standpunt van Humbert Humbert  een Europese emigre in de VS  sinds zijn jeugd geobsedeerd door  nymphets   een bepaald soort prepuberale meisjes De man had een kleine erfenis opgedaan van een ver familielid  had zich gevestigd in een slaperig dorpje en was er op slag verliefd geworden op Dolores Haze  Lolita  Hij trouwt met haar moeder om er toch maar dicht bij te zijn  beschrijft minutieus wat hij doet om ze toch maar te kunnen aanraken  wat er van seconde tot tot seconde gebeurt als ze op zijn schoot kruipt  hoe onmogelijk zijn liefde wel is    en dan komt de moeder in een ongeluk om het leven De eerste avond dat hij alleen is met Lolita  geeft hij ze een slaapmiddel en denkt hij ze te kunnen bepotelen in haar slaap  blijkt dat ze nog wakker is  en verleidt zij hem  Waarna ze twee jaar lang de hele Verenigde Staten rondzwerven  van motel tot motel  van de ene naar de andere attractie Hij controleert al wat ze doet    geen contact met vreemden     en geeft ze enkel zaken in ruil voor seksuele diensten  neen  geen gezonde relatie  Maar omdat alles vanuit een standpunt geschreven is  van een toegegeven zieke mens  niet alleen die pedofilie  ook allerlei depressies en achtervolgingswaanzin   is het absoluut niet duidelijk is wat de realiteit is  En is Lolita voor ons even mysterieus is als voor Humbert  in hoeverre is zij slachtoffer en prooi  in hoeverre controleert zij eigenlijk Humbert en heeft ze haar lot in eigen handen Had ik al gezegd dat het ongelooflijk mooi geschreven is  Het is sensueel mooi van taal  met woordspelingen en allusies en alliteraties en over en weer tussen Frans en Engels  het speelt met de vorm van het boek  dat als een dagboek begint en dan een soort biografie wordt en dan een huis clos achtig ding  en dan een road movie en dan een actiefilm  en dat allemaal in een raamvertelling met een voorwoord van een fictief personage en een nawoord van de echte auteur  maar dat daarom niet noodzakelijk minder fictief zou zijn Al wie dit nog niet zou gelezen hebben  niet twijfelen Oh ja  ik ga graag eens kijken naar de een ster reviews op Amazon  voor de boeken die ik lees  Dit stuk uit een review van ene J  Cooper was voor hem een hoofdreden om het boek slecht te vinden  Ik kan begrijpen waarom  zelfs al ben ik het er 100  mee oneens  Voor de volledigheid en bij wijze van waarschuwing dus I was also irritated by the use of language  There s a difference between writing with a large vocabulary and beating the reader over the head with it  I felt as though I was watching Nabokov doing verbal gymnastics when I had merely asked him to tell me a story  Though I was able to understand the English  despite the use of more complicated words than are needed  I cannot speak French and it is ridiculous to intersperse an English language book with French phrases  It s a prime example of Nabokov s arrogance  All of this hampers the flow of the book   Prior to reading  Lolita   every time I heard its name I thought of the time I was chosen to attend an English Literature taster course at Oxford University and one of the boys in the group I was put in said he listens to  Lolita  on audio tape    Before I read  Lolita  I couldn t help but think how creepy that was  After reading  Lolita  I m pretty sure he was a psychopath  This is one of the best things I ve ever read ever  Humbert speaks with such beautiful and seductive language that you start to forget the horror at the heart of it  I think it was the details that really got me  he describes what would be nasty images in a way that turns them on their head and makes them appear nice   scratches like tiny dotted lines of coagulated rubies   which reflects the whole tone of the story  I have had a copy of this book in my to read pile for years but for some reason I was reluctant to actually read it  I guess I just assumed a book about pedophilia could only be intensely uncomfortable to read  And this book is a little awkward and squirm inducing at times  but that does not stop it from being magnificent  The writing is just outstanding  and it is definitely worth your time  LOLITA covers a horrendous topic  and yet I could not stop reading  Nabokov writes with such delectable beauty that it became so easy to forget what was happening  A simultaneously monstrous and beautiful and darkly funny work  I think everyone should read it at least once in their lives  Mmmmmmm    que dizer sobre este livro  depois de tudo o que ja foi dito  Em poucas palavras  acho que posso dizer que e um livro perversamente genial  O humor  a ironia e o sarcasmo de Humbert Humbert fazem nos simpatizar com um personagem que  ao mesmo tempo  condenamos e desprezamos  Desde o inicio que fiquei a oscilar entre sentimentos de repugnancia e divertimento a medida que as paginas se iam sucedendo  Ora dava comigo a nao querer ler mais  porque nao tinha vontade de ler o que sabia que ia acontecer a seguir  ora dava comigo a ler desenfreadamente  sem o conseguir pousar  Enfim  acho que e isto  um bom livro  Lolita  Lottelita  Lolitchen     Haunting and brilliant  It has certainly earned its place among the classics   I know it is sinful to give five stars to Harry Potter and only four to Lolita  but it has nothing to do with the quality of the book in  that  way  The prose was entrancing as I was told   and told   and told  Everyone was right  I think I just wish I d read it without expectations  First time reading the annotated version  The lack of a modern perspective in the analysis is quite strange to read for someone that first read the novel during the 90s  but it was a valuable experience for its insight into many allusions that I had only partially understood or glossed over during past readings   whoa  Que libro taaan intenso  A veces si da un poco de asco y repugnancia  pero tambien da pena y lastima  Y tampoco creo que sea un libro pornografico  es mas bien sensual y con muchisima tension sexual  Humbert  pobre Humbert  enfermo Humbert  Nabokov describe muy bien la miseria humana  la soledad y la perversidad del alma que hay en el mundo  Y Dolores  No me parece que sea del todo inocente  pero a medida que avanzaba en la novela  me pregunte que hubiese sido de ella sino hubiese conocido a su  papa   En fin  super intenso y bien escrito  Sin dejar de ser reprobable aquello que cuenta  creo que es un libro redondo  con mucho trasfondo psicologico y que sin duda recomiendo para quienes busquen un libro que hable de relaciones complicadas y mucho sufrimiento personal  What a daring masterpiece  Simply one of the greatest novels I will ever read  Genuine in it s wretchedness  I loved every paragraph   There cannnot be anything new I bring in terms of a review to this widely read book  This is one of those books that you love or just hate   I am not sure if the haters hate the theme or the book itself This is the most original book that I have read in a really long time and that is saying a lot  I cannot help but admire the author s style and the way he was able to comically and self derisively portray a madman s obsession that makes you want to laugh  but at the same time grosses you out  The fact that this book is written solely from Humbert s point and his absolute distaste and mockery of every other human being except Lolita in this book goes on to show what a self absorbed man he was  It was about his suffering  how he felt  how Lolita  by escaping cheated him and so on  There is very little to tell the reader what the other main character in the book felt at all  except what Humbert thought she felt  As I see it  this book is not about one madman s desire  but about how every man can become self absorbed when overcome with his desire for money or power or whatever else it may be  but to depict it    What could evoke more disgust than incest and pedophilia Lolita is not the chronicles of a pedophile   it is the story of a girl who managed to make a life for herself in spite of all that she has to endure  a dead family and a lost childhood without losing her essence and a man who landed where he rightfully belonged because of his obsession  This book was absolutely enthralling  I wasn t sure about it when I started it  but I enjoyed diving into the mind of Humbert Humbert and exploring the literary qualities and wordplay this book had to offer  This is a book that I think would get better with each reading  One of the most enjoyable books I have read and discussed in a long time   Oh Humbert Humbert you dirty perv  I cannot understate the disturbing hilarity of this work  His deep obsession with nymphets and his destruction of Lolita s childhood are conveyed by a voice so convincing  arrogant  intelligent  and humorous  that it is almost impossible to dislike him until your mind reminds you that he is a monster who preys on young girls  Perhaps that is what is most disturbing about this work  Nabokov s ability to create the inner world of a pedophile and give him dimension that makes him  well  likable  Perhaps likable isn t really the word I m looking for    I think that his vast denial and rationalizations about his sick predilections are so elaborate and artfully written that one almost feels what Humbert feels  one is almost seduced in the way that Humbert has seduced himself   I ve read critiques of the book that argue that it is Lolita who is corrupt and seduces Humbert  but as we get the whole work as a first person point of view  i think that it is safe to say that the narrator might be slightly unreliable as to the accounts of who is abusing who   this book is why i want to write  this book is why i want to know the darkness  sin  moths  knees  and places i should not know  i have reread the first passage  drunk  sober  in the light of day  under sheets  in the bath  to lovers  to abandoners  to cynical feminists  more times than i can account for  when you get this book  down off your shelf  out of the store  read that first passage out loud  read it again  faster  this is the transformation that i look for in a book  it s immediate  and it s fucking beautiful  IMO  some of Nabokov s best writing is featured in Lolita    as disgusting as its premise may be  we DO feel some sort of sick empathy for Humbert  which I do not think necessarily demonstrates how messed up we ourselves are  but how CONVINCING Nabokov s writing is b c it is just THAT good  It has taken me many yrs  to finish  and I am not the same person I was then  but this story  it s end half  still boasts one of the the very best Narrators in ALL of fiction literature  Humberdinger       LOLITA  light of my fire  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the little dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita    Questo libro e un capolavoro  ed a renderlo tale non e l inglese assolutamente delizioso di Nabokov o il tema scabroso  quanto piu il modo dolcissimo e assolutamente impensabile che ti porta  alla fine del racconto  a chiudere il libro e provare un senso di tiepida tristezza ed empatia nei confronti di Humbert  cosa che si poteva presumere impossibile  cominciando a leggere  Meraviglioso  It s an intriguing book that reminds me a bit of The Collector by John Fowles  the way you sympathise with the main character even though in the back of your mind you re well aware that what he s doing is deeply and utterly wrong  Even though it got a little weaker toward the end as far as I m concerned  I really loved this book  and I d recommend it to anyone  It has definitely become part of my top list  nan  An American critic suggested that Lolita was the record of my love affair with the romantic novel  The substitution  English language  for  romantic novel  would make this elegant formula more correct     NabokovFor the record  hand on heart  c  c  c  I  Nathan  N R   Gaddis  do solemnly affirm   c  c  c  that I swallow this line    I swallow the hook  I swallow the sinker  A love affair with a language  not a romp with an underage _________   Oh God  where to start  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  Was I disgusted  Yes  Was I intrigued  Yes  Did I yell at the book  Yes  Nabokov takes the English language and wrings it out   completely bends and twists it to his liking as no other author I ve had the pleasure of reading has done before  I could write a novel on Lolita  Jesus  It was so  so good  I recently got into an argument with a friend about Lolita  I contend that it s one of the most beautiful books ever written  and that it s twice as amazing because Nabakov wrote it in English  which is his second or third language   She contended that it was about a child molestor and was inexcusable I argued that it was more about chronicling a slightly off kilter man s descent into wretched madness and total loathsomeness  A portrait of a child molestor  not necessarily a sanctioning of one She held that whatever it was  it was still about a child molestor  and disgusting  To me  this is the same argument that Huck Finn is a racist book because it depicts racism  I don t think that portraying something is the same as condoning it Plus  the way Nabakov manipulates language is chillingly beautiful  Chilling  So what if half of those chills come from the creep factor of Lolita being a kid  You find yourself seduced by his words and his worldview   and then you remember that he s talking about a kid  and you feel a little queasy Hey  if it makes you feel  it s art  right  O ha ho ho  Martin Amis s description of reading this novel does it all for me  Not only because it describes the experience of reading this novel perfectly  but also because  like the novel  you can t help laughing at it   You read Lolita sprawling limply in your chair  ravished  overcome  nodding scandalized assent   as with many of the books in my list  I am adding this one many years after reading it  so my stars are based on remembering the reaction I had to reading it  Lolita was both horrifying and completely intriguing  But what I remember most about this book was the rhythm of the writing  I don t think a word was wasted in this book  it all flowed and connected and carried me along as if in a trance   Spending 300 pages inside the head of Humbert Humbert is  to say the least  a disturbing experience  Amusing and linguistically and culturally rich  the book is the more riveting for the pederastic horror that underlies the whole enterprise  It s not particularly erotic  And it s no doubt far outside the mainstream portrait of your typical child molester  It does become clear at the end that Humbert really loves his Lolita  but one is happy to see him clapped behind bars  Lolita was re read for me with a decade between the two  Re reading a book is a rare thing for me  as is watching a movie for a second time or going on vacation to the same spot twice   However  after my book club read Madam Bovary  and the opinion espoused by all was that it  just wasn t as scandalous as I d hoped for   I had one word for them    Lolita  ladies  What I remember from my first read at the ripe age of 22  was thinking that Delores  Lolita  must have been the most popular in her class if she attracted the attention of such a handsome man and therefore the complete opposite of me at age 12  though in my head I remember her starting out as 14 more on that later   Now  seen through the eyes of our narrator she is indeed  cool  if you are a young girl listening to H H  s story Fast forward to age 34  and it was apparent to me that I only remembered the first third of the book  and was somewhat ashamed of myself for having such a  sexy  memory of this book  But  isn t our own internal battle we wage while reading it one of the great things about this book The subject matter abhorrent  and the narrator is unreliable  but not so much so that we do not have insight into what is really going on  Subject matter aside  it is a great illustration of how we can all lie to ourselves to justify our behavior  Heck  I convinced my memory that Lolita was 14 at the beginning to justify my love of the book  We all have that friend that calls us  or that we call regularly to justify WHY we are completely justified in calling in sick today  We all have selective memories when we want to  and I certainly did when I remembered my impressions of the book I point out nothing new by stating the language is in its own class  and that those that love this book revel in  hearing  the opening lines in their head while reading it  In fact  I d like to HEAR this book as that would be a new experience  like hearing Edgar Allen Poe s  Raven  versus reading it  Finally  it would more than pale in comparison  but I have often wanted to read this story from Lolita s point of view  as painful as it would be  Even the Jeremy Irons movie is from H H  s perspective  and presents Lolita as  sexy    PROS  absolutely brilliant writing  engaging from cover to cover  makes you question  and rightfully so  your understanding of morality  love  desire  and how you view sexual  predators CONS  sometimes lost in beautiful prose  though never shocking  sometimes uncomfortable and disturbing  may cause strange looks if reading in the park near a playground I consider Lolita to be a masterpiece  Humbert Humbert is a beast  a pedophile  but the novel is written so well  you can t stop reading it  at least I didn t The movie with James Mason as Humbert and Shelley Winter as Lolita s hapless mother is a faithful adaptation of the book   There are certain books in life that ground you in place and make you sit and pay attention  For me  Lolita was one of those books  It s gorgeous  witty  dark humored  complex writing affected me in a way that I didn t expect  The subject matter was superficially difficult and at times horrifying  but the layers of meaning and readings could leave you with material to discuss and dissect for years  I highly recommend this book  Otro clasico que lei hace un tiempo  Te vuela la cabeza  primero por el tema que trata  Un psicopata que se enamora de una nena de apenas doce anos  Ya de por si el argumento asusta un poco y provoca un poco de pudor  pero lo interesante de la novela es que va mucho mas alla de algo meramente controvertido  Y aca entra lo segundo que transforma la novela en algo interesantisimo  mas alla de lo controvertido  y es el fiel retrato de la decadencia norteamericana  Mientras el personaje va de un lado al otro con su estem   pareja   nos adentramos en lo que parece el puro infierno de los suburbios yankis  Quizas nunca parecio tan decadente hospedarse en un motel como en esta novela  y esto hace mucho hincapie en la propia decadencia del narrador  Un tipo insoportable  enfermizo  egocentrico y que se hace querer muy poco  lo cual no quita que tenga momentos de pura lucidez en sus monologos  Asique creo que la novela se mueve entre la esa pelea constante de tratar al personaje como un enfermo sin remedio y por otro lado  sentir gran lastima por el  sin llegar a  simpatizar  demasiado  La prosa es ligera  pesada en momentos  y detallada se mezcla el frances en la traduccion espanola y esto molesta un poco  ya que al saber poco y nada de frances se puede volver tedioso en algunos pasajes  Pero son los menos  Una novela compleja  la cual demanda una segunda lectura  Quizas leer un estudio critico sobre la obra ilumine mas  After reading this book  I knew it was already one of the best I d ever read  Determining that true  best  book is very difficult because no two books are the same  In the case of Lolita  I doubt there is a better written book on the planet with regard to the English language  I won t give away much about the story because there is a lot of suspense and that s half the enjoyment  But I did feel a little creepy at the beginning of the book and that lessened with time  The young age of the girl is obviously a fire starter for some but after you read the book you will realize that there are very few  if any  intense sexual descriptions  The book is just not about that I really can t wait to see the movie because Nabakov wrote the screenplay and its Kubrick  Sounds like an unbeatable combination  After reading Nabokov s afterword  you want to read all of his novels as fast as you can  I really can t wait to pick another one up as soon as possible   Lolita starts and through most of the book comes up as bizarre  a bit disgusting  mental  It follows the first person narrative of H  Humbert  a European man who has a sexual preference for girls from age 9 14  he calls them nymphets   As a teenager  he had a close sexual encounter with a girl slightly younger than him   which was never brought to an end  and was left as some sort of fantasy and dream that fueled his later encounters His life brings him to America  to Ramsdale  to be a tenant of the widow Haze and her 12 year old daughter Dolores  Lo  Lolita   He falls in love  and obsession  with her and makes small advances and enjoys small signs of affection which she bestows upon him  all the while living under the same roof SPOILER alert Next  the widow Haze falls in love with Humbert and he takes the opportunity to marry her and become Lolita s stepfather  He fantasizes about murdering the widow  and his dreams come true   when she accidentally gets killed in a car accident  He sort of kidnaps Lolita and they spend a year travelling around the States in a car  sleeping in various motels  with Lolita serving his sexual fantasies   and him buying her presents to amuse her MY OPINION Lolita is filled with lot of references to popular literature and lot of word plays   for to understand you have to be well educated and or well read  It s not a soft pornographic novel   it s a story about a love  obsession and desire to fulfill your romantic dreams with someone   all the while being unaware of their feelings  their expectations and limits  Humbert is aware of the corruption he does to Lolita s spirit  but his love and love s blindness makes him unable to think clearly and do what s right  The biggest problem is that he wants a mind of an adult female in a body of a pre teenage girl   which makes him all the time dissatisfied with Lolita s young  playful and rebellious character The book is also a good way to enter the pedophile s mind and at least understand the motives and desires that keeps them pursuing their intentions even if they are aware that they re wrong Lolita is also nicely written  with a slightly psychotic narrative which keeps you interested to the very end  Still haunting me almost a month later  Jeremy Irons reading Nabokov s Lolita  Delicious  Written word become pure musical ecstasy  Missing the rhythm  the rolling  the frantic raw need  and too  the innocence  purity and capriciousness  Pairings I won t soon

not put this book into my simple words  Everyone has got to read this and decide for themselves whether they think it is tragically romantic or unbelievably sick  In my opinion  it was a mix of both  Lolita is my favorite novel to date  I love Nabokov s artful language  the egotistical Humbert Humbert  the culturally taboo subject matter  and how he blurs the line between reality and fiction  As I mention in one of my other reviews  I most enjoy reading fiction that reflects how I want to write  and Lolita is the best example I can think of   that end fy  m 1969  rsl rwy y tshyky mGmwr yd

BOOK  I just   Okay  Bad things first There were about ten  or so  chapters in the middle of the book  in a 60  chapter book  so not bad  that were SO BOOORING  Like a drag  Like I skimmed  Like it was so unimportant  it could ve been omitted from the novel entirely  Also  some of the references and allusions Navokov makes are SO obscure  it makes certain  really  a few small parts  parts of the book WAY to dense and hard to understand at the cost of throwing in a witty allusion to something no one s hears of  And really  readability ought to come first  unless it s REALLY worth it  which it just wasn t   But those are the only bad things I have to say about it  I have an entire world of amazing things to say  This book has it ALL  Some of the most BEAUTIFUL prose I have EVER read  Ever  It was beautiful  especially  in the fact that it was UNDERSTANDABLE  Like  this is what sets this novel apart from Ulysses  or Faulkner  It s actually very  very TRANSPARENT  and manageable of a read  Most of it  honestly  requires a lot of brain power to process  but it s not too much of a struggle to be graced with some of the most beautiful  accessible prose in the English language  And the story  Fuck  The fucking story  Deep  multi dimensional characters  A plot that SURPRISES you  and is packed with action  suspense  and  kind of     romance  Not to mention  it s narrated by a really hateful  terrible  disgrace of a human being  man  who is a criminal  child abductor  and rapist  And  honestly  it s SO interesting to get in that person s head  I hated him from beginning to end  but he never lost my interest  except those ten chapters   The story keeps you interested the whole time  It s genuinely SHOCKING  at times  some of the stuff you read  Like  you go back and reread  thinking  Wait  what the fuck  Is that what I THINK it was  And it was Intelligent  Emotionally involving  Beautiful  Horrible  ugly  wince worthy  Grotesque  This book  Five stars  I love it  It s definitely added to the short list of  Books that might be my favorite book   Warning  contains spoilers for The Murder of Roger Ackroyd  L age de raison and this bookI remember seeing an interview with Nabokov  where he was asked what long term effect he thought Lolita had had  I suppose the interviewer was looking for some comment on the liberalization of censorship laws  or something like that  Nabokov didn t want to play   as you can see in Look at the Harlequins  he was pretty tired of these questions  So he said well  as far as he could make out  there had only been one effect  Mothers of young girls named Dolores no longer affectionately called them Lolita  I loved this reply for its magnificent unhelpfulness  In a very narrow sense  Nabokov was surely right  I challenge anyone to prove  beyond any reasonable doubt  that Lolita has had any effect over and above the one he named  And in principle I also approve of Nabokov s attitude towards critics  and the way he loved teasing them  Pale Fire is another long joke at the critics  expense  how many other books are there where most of the action takes place in the footnotes    and  like John Shade  he burned his rough drafts to make sure that posterity had as little material as possible to work with  But  if one wants to go against Nabokov s stated wishes and indulge in a small amount of speculation  it does seem to me that Lolita has had a substantial effect in terms of popularizing the narrative technique where a character is initially presented in sympathetic terms  and then gradually revealed as a monster  Two examples that immediately spring to mind are Martin Amis and Ruth Rendell  In Lolita  Nabokov cunningly introduces Humbert as a rather engaging personality  and fabricates all sorts of extenuating circumstances  To start off with  there s the tragic story of his childhood romance with poor Annabel Leigh  Then Lo is far from innocent  and  as Humbert points out  she seduces him  But the fact remains that  whatever excuses you may come up with  it s just wrong for an adult male to have sex with a twelve year old girl  After a while Humbert  and the reader  is forced to admit that he has turned her into a whore who fellates him for small change  and then cries herself to sleep every night  You feel disgusted with yourself for ever being dumb enough to fall for this slick con artist Hopefully  the controversial opinions I ve just expressed won t result in some overzealous Iranian cleric putting a fatwa on me   one of the first things the Ayatollah Khomeini did on gaining power was to lower the age of consent to 9  on the grounds that the Prophet s youngest wife was that age when she married him  You see how dangerous this speculative analysis can be ____________________________________While making dinner  turkey fajitas   I thought about the question Paul raised  whether we can believe what Humbert is telling us  I was wondering what evidence I could present to support my point of view  which is that he only distorts the truth and omits things  rather than simply lying outright I would say that my basic argument is that Humbert isn t really writing for us  he s writing for himself  so any lies he tells are going to be the kind of lies one tells to oneself  rather than those one tells to other people  It s true that people do sometimes plain flat out lie to themselves  But Humbert is a smart  educated guy who thinks a lot  and he doesn t seem delusional  I find it plausible that he is more telling the story his way  and working hard to find an interpretation that makes his actions pardonable  But this involves greater and greater distortion of the facts  and in the end there are things he can no longer explain away  It hits so hard because he s previously done a good job of making the reader identify with him  the reader almost feels that he has been lying to himself I came up with a couple more books to which I d had similar reactions  One is Agatha Christie s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd  where it turns out that the murderer is the person narrating the story  I remember a friend saying that nothing had ever creeped him out quite as badly  he felt for a second that he  himself  was the murderer  Less obviously  there s Sartre s L age de raison  Mathieu doesn t seem like such a bad guy  even though he s a bit of a dope  and nothing he does really comes across as particularly evil  Yet  somewhere near the end  you re forced to admit that he is in fact a person who will steal a substantial amount of money from a friend in order to pay for his mistress s abortion  You wonder why you previously felt sympathetic A final thought I had while preparing dinner  One of the very scariest things about Lolita is that Humbert  in a real sense  loves Lo  However  this results in him raping her and turning her into a child prostitute  A couple of years ago  I watched the movie Mysterious Skin  which takes the same theme even further  it s one of the most disquieting films I ve ever seen  Has anyone else come across it  Would be interested to get reactions  Martin Amis says it all  In a sense Lolita is too great for its own good  It rushes up on the reader like a recreational drug more powerful than any yet discovered or devised  In common with its narrator  it is both irresistible and unforgivable  And yet it all works out  I shall point the way to what I take to be its livid and juddering heart   which is itself in prethrombotic turmoil  all heaves and lifts and thrills  vii     There is so very little one can say about Lolita that does justice to its brilliance  This is a tale not just of forbidden love but of America and the ensuing complications that come from claiming it and naming it home  It is also a story of taking and unabashedly loving the things we hold dearest  the people capable of destroying us  No novel I have read compares   What can I say about LOLITA that hasn t been said  The very name invokes strong feelings  Nabokov s hero  Humbert Humbert  is of European descent  very well educated  with one fatal flaw  He is attracted to young girls  In his thirties  he meets and falls hopelessly in love with Lolita  a nymphet and not yet a teenager  He goes so far as to marry her mother  so as to be close to her  and when her mother dies after being struck by a car  he conveniently becomes her parent guardian and her lover  Controversial  Disgusting  To this day  society regards pedophiles as among the lowest  even among the prison population  The relationship is doomed from the start  as time stops for no one  and as time robs Lolita of that youthful beauty  the attraction is diminished  What makes LOLITA a classic  The writing itself is on a level seldom found  expressive  beautiful  heartbreaking and tragic  with an obvious love for language  Nabokov wrote the book in English  perhaps his second or third language  not in his native Russian  He further embraces the America of the 50 s  as the couple crisscross the country  staying in motels and motor lodges for the most part  eating in diners and roadside cafes  Finally  there are so many discussion points  Is M  Humbert to be pitied  Despised  Is Lolita herself guilty of anything or a tragic victim  I really liked this book  It s such a prominent piece of our culture  but I had no idea the prose was so wonderful  I was hooked after the first sentence  It s just wonderful writing  Smart  fun  descriptive  and unafraid  The story was very much secondary to the writing  for me  Nabokov s descriptions of lust and its satisfaction are something else  though  Wow  Now go read some other reviews of this  there are some good ones  If you want to see what I particularly like  you ll have to go read my Blogger post  If you re thinking about reading Lolita  follow through  Don t quit during the first 16 chapters like I tried to do  Post chapter 16  the story turns beautiful  If you don t pay attention to the meaning of H H  s words  you probably wouldn t know that what he is talking about is inhumane and disgusting  A truly beautiful book  Humbert is the quintessential unreliable narrator   his actions are despicable  yet he does not view the world the way the reader does  Humbert urges us to see things his way  to slip into his lyrical dreamlike musings   but Nabokov constantly jerks the story out of this by depicting the tragic effects on Lolita  even though Lolita doesn t realise the full extent herself  The reader is not immune to being charmed by Humbert s melodic language and bittersweet imagery  We have entered Humbert s world  and it is a difficult one   without signposts or things that we can relate to  Humbert asks us to see what he sees  yet throws the spotlight on himself   because what he sees horrifies us Lolita is also without signposts   she s a child without the maturity or life experience to understand what s happening to her  She accepts Humbert s care   and doesn t see through his lies  Nabokov plainly shows that she is lost   a child helpless to navigate around the trap Humbert has set Nabokov makes clear in this novel that Lolita s life has been irrevocably damaged by the actions of Humbert  It is clear that Humbert is a paedophile   Humbert is at times remorseful  but never fully accepting what he is It is not a love story  Lolita does not return his love  and moreover cannot love him in the way he wants  Nabokov shows with cutting realism the girl trying to have a normal teenage life  Thwarted by Humbert  she ends up jumping from the frying pan into the fire On another level  the European Humbert is contrasted with the crass consumerism of America   represented by Lolita and her mother  Lolita is pretty and beguiling but without substance  It is an interesting contrast  and shows  I think  that Humbert feels he was seduced by Lolita  even though he admits to himself she played no part in this  It is a difficult subject matter  but instead of being titillating  it depicts the mind of someone who is self centred to the extent that he does not see the horror he is inflicting on another human being  This one is on my English novel reading list  No surprise  With a most unreliable and manipulative narrator  abundant literary allusions  problematic prototypes  or sources  of characters  the book could easily demands its own lecture series  Nabokov s command of English language is admirable  and the reading experience could be enchanting  challenging  provocative  etc  depending how far you want to go  This is probably the best written book I have ever read  Definitely on my must re read list  I am deeply conflicted over Nabokov s Lolita  On one side it has some brilliant writing  but on the other the subject matter is very disturbing  The book makes me want to hide my daughter and keep her away from any dirty old men out there  The crazy thing is that the book is so well written that it makes me question the author s personal experience and motives in writing the book  Makes me wonder if there wasn t a little bit of a dirty old man in Nabokov  I am really impressed with his writing style and the fact that English was not first language originally being from Russia and then learning French and finally English  His writing is phenomenal and seriously Lollita is one of the best books of the last century  This should be a book read by adults and definitely not by children  Lo Lee Ta Let that nickname sink deep into you  feel it become a part of you  Actually pronounce it That s my vision of the great novel by Nabokov  I was postponing that marvelous read  but once I opened that book   I knew that it is truly going to change me  I wish there were more books like Lolita  Marvelous  I tell ya    though a little difficult to read due to the french phrases here and there  It was engagingly well written  Ive never thought writing about raping a 12 year old girl would have such rationality  and romanticism  you could even say its poetic   like for a psychopath s point of view  I mean  Vladimir Nabokov made me want to study the Russian language just so I can read Russian novels in its original form  The ending was a little heartbreaking  you know in a sick and demented sort of way  The whole story was well executed  it was raw  it was sensual  it was brutal  it was beautiful in the way forest fires and sunken ships are beautiful  Very difficult book to recommend  but it is definitely a  Love or Hate  one I loved the way the words were played with  I liked seeing the story through the eyes and mind of a very distorted man  to which it is impossible  for me at least  to identify with or even like  I liked the overall structure of the story  and the increasing pace At each reading  I read it twice  with a good ten year interval   I was really compelled into the story and had more and more difficulty to put it down as I was approaching the closure It s probably one of the most memorable and outstanding book I read  but I can definitely understand why some people may not appreciate it as such  After reading this book in a couple of days  reaching its end left me with a feeling of almost orphan hood  Lolita might just be the best book ever written in the English language  because it is in its purest form  a declaration of love to it  Nabokov said it himself and the reader can witness it in the first paragraph of the book  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  If that prose doesn t make you feel drunk I have no hopes for you  But putting aside Nabokov s prose  I want to focus on his characters  Humbert Humbert  the filthy  decrepit  desperate pedophile is somehow perceived by a lot of readers as a sophisticated and well intentioned man trapped in the net of a cunning child spider  and we owe that both to his unreliable first person narration and to the default victim blaming mindset that most people have internalized  This interpretation also relies on the fact that Humbert constantly attenuates his crimes with every possible excuse on the book  We have the Freudian childhood love story  the lack of a mother figure  the cheating first wife and of course  the willing Lolita  After all  she was the one who seduced him on that hotel room  She was the one who explicitly called him her lover  who yelled  incest  and giggled  She was the one who could have run away and who eventually did But how much do we really know about Dolores  She isn t as much of a character in this book as she is a figment of Humbert s imagination Lolita is his ideal girl  the ultimate nymphet  the female who sublimes every other of her species  But Dolores doesn t have any agency as a character not until the very end of the book  She isn t even responsible for her own escape  She doesn t run away  she is  rescued   We don t know how she feels  what she thinks her true reactions to Humbert s actions  We see her trough a lens of Humbert s feelings  and to him there isn t a Dolores  only a Lolita She is completely dehumanized and transformed into a sex object that only exists with the purpose of enticing the male narrator  He may repeat again and again that he loves her but in the end Humbert doesn t love the person Dolores Haze  He loves the nymphet Lolita That  to me  is what makes  Lolita  such a relevant read  Despite Nabokov s hatred for metaphors and parallel interpretations of his work  Lolita is in my opinion  a great feminist read  The Dolores Haze Lolita character disassociation is a perfect metaphor for the objectification of women in nowadays society  Dolores  lack of agency as a character draws extremelly relevant parallels to the negative consequences of the misogynistic views of how women should think and behave and more importantly  how they should hide their feelings and thoughts in order to be appealing to men  I could go on and on about it  and that s what makes this book so great If you haven t read it it yet  you really really should Nabokov is a self proclaimed enchanter  And Lolita does enchant Lolita is tightly structured around basically a three note theme or motif similar to Beethoven s 5th  The theme can be summed up as  Humbert craves nymphets  This theme or motive is reflected in practically every paragraph This structure allows Nabokov to enchant us  to transport us  with his wordplay  double entendres  and mysteries  It bears frequent rereadings for the gorgeous language  A recent review of a book on Nabokov in the New York Review of Books pointed out that Nabokov in his later fiction was less subtle about his liking for nymphets and more graphic about his sex scenes  This shouldn t detract from the enchantment of Lolita  This was my favorite book in the 70 s  In the 00 s  it is difficult to overlook the underlying defect of child molestation  however  Nabokov s depiction of the complexities of  old depraved Europe debauching young  depraved America  was irresistible  His enthralled lover s view of postwar America through the  young raucous voice   in her cage had indelible endearing qualities and a connection can be made to Eco s  Queen Loana   in the plumbing of the depths of memory  the tracing of lost mental paths  At one time there seemed to be a lot in this little book  but Nabokov ends up with only one thing to offer the last aristocratic mocking of the lilliputian moralities of the middle class with his scintillating depravities  Sorry  can t go there anymore  not after having children of my own to nurture and protect  Same can be said of  Ada   read the first 40 pages then managed to forget about for about five months  it helps though that my book is this old edition published back in the 60s  and the smell of the old paper within the spine gives me a huge reading boner   will review more when i finish   this book is a fun topsy turvy time  forcing you to put aside what you would deem  immoral  you puritanical american  you  and find yourself lost in the pure eloquence of nabokov s delightful protagonist humbert humbert  you re sitting here reading about this guy basically raping this young girl  and you re lost in just how beautiful it all is  very fucking weird  but  in his section to the reader after finishing   vladimir nabokov on a book entitled  lolita   he explains it as   There are gentle souls who who would pronounce Lolita as meaningless because it does not teach them anything  I am neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction  and  despite John Ray s assertion  Lolita has no moral in tow  For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tnderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm  Rightly so   read this  La traduzione di Giulia Arborio Mella e piuttosto vicina al rendere giustizia ad un opera che  grazie al suo minuzioso lavoro  puo essere profondamente apprezzata anche senza ricorrere al testo originale Peccato per l assoluta mancanza di un corpus di note adeguato a disvelare la sterminata landa di allusioni  riferimenti e sottotesti su cui e costruito il libro Se volete dire di aver letto  Lolita   rivolgetevi a questa traduzione e soltanto questa    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul   Humbert Humbert begins as he relates his memoirs  Those lines will forever be burned into my memory  The sickness  the debauchery  and yet    How can I find him even remotely likeable  Yet I did and do  to some extent He s the classic example of the unreliable narrator in all his repulsive glory  The character Nabokov has fooled many into sympathizing with for over fifty years  How fascinating it was to read from his perspective  yet try to piece together what s truly happening with Lolita and her mental state  Even ignoring the beauty of Nabokov s writing  just delving into the mind of our perverse main character  while an utterly sickening experience  is absolutely fascinating from a psychological perspective  How he legitimizes his behavior  how he characterizes the people and places around him    It gives us so much insight into Humbert Humbert himself  And while we all do realize that ultimately he took advantage of his situation for his physical needs  we are pleaded with to try and understand him  And so many of us fall for it In fact  I can t seem to completely demonize him  and it makes my skin crawl realizing it Maybe it was Nabokov s absolutely stunning writing that helps  I highlighted so many passages just to be able to reread them later to truly appreciate his weaving of the English language  And English isn t even his native tongue  It may have been  too  the childhood drawbacks to my own travels  But ultimately  it had to be his twinges of remorse that come late in the novel  the realizations of the harm he inflicted  From that  I can t see him as a complete sociopath I suppose one can understand from my above statements that I felt the novel deserves its status as a work of art I felt Nabokov in some places went a little farther than I liked in describing the places they traveled to  I recall one chapter early in the second part of the novel that lingered for what seemed like forever on many different travel destinations and the trivial events that occurred at each  Wonderful prose can only sustain me so long in such affairs  I felt as if I had to trudge through a few parts that followed that sort of vein  which did bother me some  I think this may be my favorite book of all time  but I don t know  that seems like a very weighty thing to declare  All I know is that because of this book  I started writing notes in the margins  And because of this book  I decided to study creative writing as an undergrad  Nabokov was a masterful writer  The way he played with words and sounds and evoked emotion is truly spectacular   This is one of my favorite books  The book Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov was about a middle aged man Humbert Humbert and a 12 year old nymphet named Dolores Haze or in Humbert s eyes  Lolita  It all started when Humbert s first love Annabel dies from Corfu  Ever since then  Humbert has been obssessed with nymphets or young girls  I honestly think this book  despite all this pedophilia from Humbert  was amazing  I love how the author  Vladimir Nabokov  managed to pair up a bratty and snobby little pre teen with a man who had a history of mental issues  I think this book was powerful because reading this book and having Humbert Humbert as a narrator  I got to get into his mind  In chapter 20   can t find specific page of quote  Humbert started making plans on how to kill Charlotte Haze without anyone knowing so Lolita and him could be together  Some paragraphs were also a little difficult to understand  The strengths of this book was when there were two antagonists  Charlotte Haze and Clare Quilty  They made the book more interesting and mysterious because you ll never what happened  For example  Humbert has been planning Charlotte s death and all of a sudden she got ran over and dies  The weakness for me was the very long backstory  His past with Annabel was the only thing important  The others with his happy life and his cheating ex wife Valechka was kind of irrelevant  If this was part of a series I would definitely read it because I really enjoyed this book except the inappropriate parts  I like how Humbert calls people bad words in his head and that when this book decides to curb the story like with Charlotte dying  it really makes a steep curbs   A compelling and disquieting read  Nabokov allows the reader to sympathize with a monstrous protagonist and you are left feeling titillated  ashamed  and humbled  Read it  Let it challenge you  The book is beautiful and I m glad to have read it  Now I know why Lolita is a classic  It s definitely heartbreakingly tragic but sometimes you find yourself feeling sorry for Lolita while at other times the sympathy is for Humbert Humbert   All in all I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read    August  2015This is my second time reading this novel and I am amazed and absolutely floored at how much I enjoyed it  how much more I noticed  how much more I appreciated and how much more completely engrossing the novel as a whole seemed to me   And I LOVED it the first time around  Originally  I fell in love with Nabokov s breathtaking prose and vivid imagery  I was so overtaken by the beautiful descriptions that it was hard to concentrate on the story itself  Reading it again gave me an opportunity to really appreciate the more literary elements   and Nabokov is quite the literary genius  One pleasant surprise was that I did not remember this novel being so downright hilarious  This quote is from when Humbert is paying Dolores off in order to  essentially  perform sexual favors for him   O Reader  Laugh not  as you imagine me  on the very rack of joy noisily emitting dimes and quarters  and great big silver dollars like some sonorous  jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches    There are so many layers to this story  Its deepest  innermost layer of course is that Dolores is being manipulated and ultimately kidnapped by her stepfather  which goes even deeper when we remember that the only reason Humbert married Charlotte was to be close to her daughter  At its very core  this is a twisted  dark  horrendous story  This is not  however  what is presented to the reader through the perspective of guilty Humbert  as you can see by the  joke  above  No  instead Humbert gleefully recounts his experiences  very carefully lingering on any sexual experiences shared with Dolores  and of course lingering on any opportunity to see any so called  nymphets  throughout his travels  even just crossing the street on the way home from school  or seeing them perform in a play  These small reminders  I believe  Nabokov carefully places to remind the reader that Humbert s  feelings   more aptly his pathological obsession  toward Lolita is not special or singular  although he plays it up to appear that way  At the very core of his being  Humbert is a pedophile  It is easy to  maybe not forget  but  overlook this because of the way he endlessly rationalizes his compulsion Not only does Humbert rationalize his compulsion  but he begins mentioning it so casually that it becomes just another part of his life  the act of having sex with a pre teen girl  Not only does he violate her in these ways  but he actively kidnaps her and takes her across the country  It seems so natural the way this occurs  as if it is the only natural course of events On several occasions  Dolores objects to this   and I believe Nabokov strategically places these objections because while Humbert is obviously hearing these objections  he really declines to comment on them or acknowledge them altogether  It s as if he exists in his own private sphere  admiring and idolizing Dolores while at the same time he degrades and manipulates her  The real  actual Dolores does not at all exist to him  The break between parts one and two especially gave me chills  The final sentence   You see  she had absolutely nowhere else to go   Perhaps this was acknowledged by Humbert as a moment of success  she must stay with me  I finally have what I want  hurray   but really  to the reader  it is a dark utterance that shows  at its purest perhaps  the true dynamic between the relationship of Lolita and Humbert Part two is where it really and truly darkens though  The reader really begins to get a feel for what is actually happening  Lolita is being held hostage  essentially  she s been kidnapped  Humbert is charming as he can be  as is in his nature  but it s not enough  This is where he comes transparent  It becomes more and more obvious that he is a terrible person  that he is taking childhood away from a young girl  that he is incredibly twisted and sick to believe that what he is doing is  in any capacity  okay I could go on and on and on about this novel  It is certainly my favorite one  If only I had the chance to write a detailed analysis for some English class  but unfortunately none of my professors ever assigned this novel  I want to keep re reading it throughout my life and expanding my opinion and analysis of it  It s so  so well written  If you re considering reading it and you have reservations because of its subject matter  PLEASE just read it  It s amazing     08 30 12I am a sucker for beautiful  intoxicating  heart wrenching  poetic prose  and this is what initially drew me in    But that mimosa grove  the gaze of stars  the tingle  the flame  the honeydew  and the ache remained with me  and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever since  until at last  twenty four years later  I broke her spell by incarnating her in another   One of the most fascinating things about this novel  I think  is the main character  It s no secret that this is a tale of pedophilia  a tale of forbidden longing a middle aged man feels for a pre teen  but because the story is told from the perspective of this twisted individual  it doesn t play out how you think  The key word is perspective  though  Naturally half of the things he describes don t sound as horrible as they actually are because he is narrating the story  This novel grants the reader a firsthand look through the eyes of a very dark and twisted individual After I finished this novel for the first time  I remember arguing with friends over whether or not this was an enchanting love story  I stand by my verdict  it is so far from a love story  It s a story about many things  but love is not one of them  Many people believe in order for a book to be good  the main character s  need to be likeable  I strongly disagree  Whether I love or hate the character  the fact that a character has moved me to such extreme feelings  is a success in my eyes  This book is in no way a love story  It s a story of a deranged and twisted man  told from the perspective of said man in as pleasurable a way as one can address such topics as Humbert does As far as prose goes  this book is my bible  The way it s written is so beautiful and inspiring  I plan to one day study each and every one of Nabokov s heart wrenching metaphors and allow them to make their way into my own writing  Every creative writer striving for poetic prose should read this for this reason alone  What makes this book great  I don t want to focus on the ingenious  complex  and often very funny prose packed with meaning and nuance in every sentence  Nor do I want to focus on the way it explores the new type of childhood and popular culture that developed in the U S in the late 1940s and 50s  Nor do I want to focus on how gripping this book is  how tense and suspenseful it gets toward the end  It s above all the main character Humbert Humbert that makes this book so good One thing the book shows is that it s not evil or a crime for Humbert to love Lolita  indeed  it probably can never be evil for anyone to love anyone else per se  Rather  the original unpardonable crime Humbert commits is basically extreme selfishness  pursuing his own desires and passions when they directly result in depriving an innocent girl of normal parenting and a normal childhood  socially  physically  emotionally  and inflict psychological trauma with effects that are difficult to adequately gauge  Humbert in fact recognizes this  but the remorse and despair he feels aren t enough to stop himself from doing it  Neither  of course  is the intensity of his love enough to excuse what he does  He rapes a child repeatedly  period  But the point is not whether or not Humbert s actions are justified or excusable  Nabokov tries to make them understandable on an astonishingly deep level in terms of Humbert s psyche  And I think that s part of what makes this novel so great  the depth and complexity of the emotions and the psyche we see  These are made particularly powerful by the fact that Humbert is so intelligent  so ridiculously well educated  and most of all so reflective and self critical  constantly analyzing himself  cleverly trying at the same time to justify and condemn himself  so that there is a dazzlingly intricate structure where you are analyzing his feelings and actions  his self analysis  and even his own analysis of yourself  the reader   To me  this is an outstanding novel because of the way it exposes and probes the most raw emotions and vulnerabilities of a man  however despicable  who is so well defended by layers and layers of worldliness and culture  someone who is acutely aware of his position relative to the ideas and cultural norms expressed by an entire civilization s worth of philosophy and art  and makes those emotions move us and enlighten us  It can take your breath away to see the tenderness this man is capable of feeling and expressing  and to recognize that this coexists with pure obsessive lust and cruel intense selfishness  all of which are heightened by his own self awareness and cynical tongue in cheek outlook  The book is frequently disturbing  and challenging in so many ways  but it s also moving  beautiful  insightful  extremely complex  and somehow  surprisingly  satisfying  Pretty much everyone is likely to have their own interpretation of this book  but read it   This was written in such a way it nearly makes one feel sympathetic with Humbert  I love that it is a very possible scenario  not because I m one of those creeps who romanticises the book  but because the plausibility engages me all the more  In the  nymphet  age  a young girl is experiencing hormones and sexual feelings for the first time  It is very likely a real life Delores would try her hand at flirting with Humbert  and that she would feel conflicted once he advanced upon her  both knowing he is sick and perhaps feeling like she brought it upon herself for her  very natural  behavior  Even after she gets away and Humbert comes to see her  it seems she harbors no hate for him  another thing that likely conflicts her   why don t I hate him  He s a pedophile  he ruined my childhood   One can see Humbert knows his actions are wrong  as he even states so even while justifying his actions  While in our society today  women under 18 are seen as off limits  it wasn t always so  For the greater part of our existence we have had to mate as early as possible in order to bear as many offspring as possible  We are closer on the timeline to men pairing with  underage  girls than we are to the point where we finally drew a line  Admittedly  and biologically speaking  men experience an attraction to young women  of course   women  including any girl who has had her first moon cycle and can bear children   In our society  though  any sane man would instantly feel disgusted with himself for thinking  dirty  thoughts about a young girl and put his thoughts on a different track  It s an all too real fact that not all men are sane  and not all men refuse to let them self think it act further upon their base desires  Humberts are a very real type of person  male or female But the beautiful way Nabokov writes   I read the spider simile several times  it was so beautiful  And I have pages of new words after reading this  This is my first Navokov book and will not be my last  All around it is a very good book  exceptionally written  There is much discourse one can have over this  I hope to meet somebody someday with whom I can discuss books with  especially this one  Light of my life  fire of my loins  my sin  my soul   Lolita  Book lovers know there is no better wordplay in the English language  and no more perfect wit than Nabokov s  But this is a love story  and no matter how many readers are shocked and disgruntled  the fact remains its commentary on intimacy  passion  obsession  and the games people play can t be matched  That said  at times Lolita reads as a character study for Ada  a far more epic and upbeat family dramedy  Comparing the two may be entirely specious   Ada is a continental sophisticate  Lolita a crass American  and Van is no Humbert  The reason Lolita is the more popular and celebrated of the two novels is that while it s establishing a fatefully inappropriate and abusive love affair  it strikes some painful blows at youth  pop culture  parenthood  suburbia  and other sacred cows  In these successful efforts it s also his most modern work   Lolita is the smartest book I ve ever read  and Nabakov is the smartest author I ve ever read  who was still totally accessible to me  personally  There have been other authors  for example Kipling  who was totally  undeniably brilliant  such that much of what he wrote went right over my head  But Nabakov is different   he s both brilliant and accessible  The language is so pithy  and it never hits a lull  sentence after sentence  page after page  It s a joy to read  I felt I had to take notes while reading the book  Not wanted to  to make writing this summary easier  I had to  It was a challenge that could be won with perseverance  and the necessary perseverance didn t seem like work  because it was so well done   so well crafted and so humorous  It s always manageable  and it pushes you to want to conquer it  I m grateful to have read this book  because it pushed me to limits   stylistically  in vocabulary  in imagery  metaphorically  and thematically To the characters  Humbert s genius is evident in the way he views the world  Reference his observation of  the panting pine   He sees the world as a macroorganism  of sorts  He sees the interconnectedness of things  He sees the world slowly  The character Lolita is an object of desire  Tacit or illicit  it doesn t matter  Her sexuality is important  but only tangentially  as an existential characteristic  once it s already been established that she s an object of desire  It s not about sex  it s about  knowing the mystery   Humbert says   Sex is the ancilla of art  Epistemologically  Humbert is saying that there is needle in the haystack somewhere  but he honestly likes the hay better than to be bothered looking for the needle  Humbert understands what a principled person is  and as much as admits he is not  And somehow  that moral relativism is his principle  What an interesting specimen At the end of the day  it s an existential novel set in an existential time   Where do we go from here    ask Nabakov and Humbert  Humbert strives and wants and conquers  and then struggles with not striving anymore  You always want what you can t have  of course  Humbert is on an existential quest to extend himself and he s doing it while traveling  driving  searching   There is no point in staying anywhere   said Lolita  As much as I wanted to hate this character Vladimir made him so human that I had to keep beating down my compassionate side  Amazing piece of literature that tugs your insides back and forth  So good  Creepy  playful  and seductive  It constantly challenges its readers  perspectives  alternately contructing them as judges and voyeurs  and  for me  raises the question of how to ethically read such a novel  It s pretty troubling  when you re reading a book  and you find yourself identifying with the hero  who is also a pedophile  if you are a fan of 15548 shades of gray  this is not a book for you  if you are fan of pure literature  grab a book and read  nabokov is classic  even if there is controversial stuff  you know 12y o  Dolores molested by stepfather  not really regular topic  whole book is more about psychopath psyche rather than sex  scenes  I don t care what people say  I m glad I read this book  It was so well written and you just can t help sympathizing with Humbert Humbert  You felt his struggle and pain and the demons he struggled with  Once you finish  you will appreciate this novel as a literary masterpiece  like a well written piece of artwork  mqzz      mqrf     mstfz     lknh fy nfs lwqt tshdk l  lnhy wbyn kl fSl wfSl tjd nfsk bl w y tSrkh  ll n      wl

true to its story  Never breaking character  never flinching from plot  Nabokov s challenge for the reader is inspirational  Lolita sent a chill down my spin accompanied with a guilty conscience for enjoying a devastating story  It was beautiful  The references and wittiness of the language and puns is unparalleled next to anything I ve ever read  Nabokov dances with words  he is really an artist  However  the weakness and pandering of Humbert and the irritating aspects of Lolita grated on me in a way was weirdly distressing  I was in a mild state of anxiety the whole time I was reading  Maybe that was Nabokov s goal though  I m not sure   i swear to God this book is terrible  It made me be on the villan s side  I know everything Humbert Humbert did was wrong  I know he ruined Lolita s life but with all this i can t help myself to dislike her  this book very challenging  i m sure that if the book was written from Lolita s point of view the things would be the other way around   Why do women take everything literally  Remember  this is a work of fiction  To talk about the vulgarity of pedaphilia is really missing the work  The story is just a framework that allows Nabokov to work his lyrical magic  He explains  to those who will listen  what desire is  what beauty is  All from a strictly male  and moreso  this particular male  point if view  If I were an instructor I would not ask females to read this  I m afraid that the ladies are not privy to the reality that male desire commonly dips down to pubescence  And I for one do not fault the nature of man  Rules and laws and  common descency  allow society at large to imagine that HH is a rarity  He isn t  If a twelve year old boy infinitely lusts a twelve year old girl  will he not lust that saidsame at fifteen  At twenty one  At thirty or forty one  Yes  judge HH on his actions as crippling  but not to Lo  she was finally happy in her nuclear family   and not to you  but to him  All I can say is that the writing is just gorgeous and I d recommend it to anyone  Doesn t matter if you don t like classics or not  Even though the story does sound taboo  it s a guilty pleasure read and too good to pass up   No writer in a free country should be expected to bother about the exact demarcation between the sensuous and the sensual  this is preposterous  I can only admire but cannot emulate the accuracy of judgment of those who pose the fair young mammals photographed in magazines where the general neckline is just low enough to provoke a past master s chuckle and just high enough not to make a postmaster frown  Lolita by Nabokov is a literary delicacy  Yes  I mean it  A delicacy which might offend quite a few conservative intellectuals but serves as a delight for one who is not untainted by the pleasures of diversity in taste  Nabokov presents the deep down  dark desires of a grown up who had his childhood share of love and romance stifled by an unnatural incident  The yearning for completing that incomplete emotional part inside him continues to fester and grow until it manifests in the form of his love for his landlady s twelve year old daughter  His Lolita The beauty with which Humbert Humbert  a foreigner  making his place in America details his life and its relevant incidents keeps the reader engaged  The detailing although a bit cut off at parts is worth the read  His failed marriage  supposed fetish for the nymphets  coming across his Lolita  the emotional conflict and the following unfortunate tragedy that pursues  Each adds a flavor to this exotic mixture of deranged philosophical conflict that would interest a psychoanalyst any day He took my Lolita away from me  I can t just let that be The manner in which Humbert lets his perverted desires show upon his step child  albeit it might sound inhuman and ludicrous  accompanies a beauty and a nonsensical sense of care that is shown to take over whenever he felt that his Lolita was being taken away from him  To think that the urge to own a child s affection leads him to murder a person who took her away from him  He is bent upon gratifying his screwed up sense of longing for a child  whose point of view is completely ignored until the latter half  makes the character all the more intriguing In general  it is one book that let me see a perspective that is normally abhorred by the morals of the goody goody people  And I would love to re read it again  Spoilers I could go on and on analyzing this book and talking about Nabokov s great writing style and how hilarious Humbert really is and how uncomfortable the story is at times  I think we all agree there s something horrible about this book  But I also found it very tragic and ironic and unfortunate that Lo was molested by Clare Quilty before Humbert ever came into the picture  and it was Clare she happened to fall in love with  He  Clare  cared nothing about her  but I get the feeling it was her experience with him that made her pursue Humbert and she was disappointed when their affair didn t turn out to be the Hollywood love story she had imagined and hoped for   the one she surely thought would pan out between her and Clare  Though nothing can stop a teen from being a teen and wanting teen things  a 12 yr old can t truly  romantically love a 40 yr old   it s hard not to think  if she had afforded Humbert  who  actually  loved her  the affection she harbored for Clare  would things have panned out differently  Would she have still regarded herself as  trapped  and  taken advantage of   Yes  Humbert s accounts make it clear that he WAS  indeed  trapping her and taking advantage of her  but only because that s how she made him feel he was treating her  And she still acts seductive towards him when he visits her at the end  And she still purposefully messes with his head  I think it was Clare who ruined her  Humbert wouldn t have even gotten the chance if it weren t for him  because Lo wouldn t have gotten the feel for an older man otherwise Only very early on did Lo strike me as innocent  But I soon came to believe she was kinda conniving  Of course I felt horrible that she would cry afterwards    But Humbert sometimes felt bad and guilty about what was going on  too  Pretty natural emotions in that predicament  Maybe I forget she was 12  It s just that the last scene with Lo has my mind boggled  I don t think she ll stay with Dick  and I am worried about the well being of her child  And what does Dick truly know about her  Not to mention  it seems she s having an affair with his one armed friend   or is on the brink of having one  And Clare only wanted her to be one of his many orgy participants  Only Humbert could accept her for who she truly is and what she s been through  This book was just heart wrenching  Lolita would be one of literature s great stories of love lost    if it weren t also the memoir of a sociopath  The novel is a study in opposition  The prose itself is virtuosic  yet the behavior  Humbert  uses it to relay is unconscionable  The story and the language keep attempting to lull the reader into both sympathy and empathy for the narrator    this erudite  poetic man who casts himself as a victim of circumstance and a seeker of redemption    yet they never hide his sickness  or much worse  his willingness to act on it again and again   Even a goblin dressed in couture is still a goblin   Humbert tells the reader that he is laying bare his soul  with no concern for how it will make him look    and yet we suspect it would be foolish to completely trust his account  too  The last idea  to me  is the most haunting  The events of Lolita are already damning for Humbert as they stand  And we recognize that if they were recorded in plainer language  through a less clever source  they would be even more difficult to confront  But the unreliable narrator element also forces us to ask  Were things even worse than Humbert is letting on  Either way  is he Machiavellian enough to think his memoir may be able to win him support or forgiveness for the unforgivable  Or is he simply just ill enough to believe his affair with an orphaned pre teen truly deserves to be elevated to the level of an epic  tragic romance  Each option  in its own way  is equally terrifying  And it s just one of many reasons that Nabokov s most controversial novel deserves its status as a modern classic    SPOILERS  n  ndy hws Hly blwlyt qr t lktb wshwft lfylm  ktr mn mr  wshwft ryfywz   ljwdrydz  hwsy wSl ldrj  ny ftHt ywtywb  shn shwf klm nbwkwf nfsh  n lrwy  w ftHt

my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita   I looked and looked at her  and I knew  as clearly as I know that I will die  that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth  She was only the dead leaf echo of the nymphet from long ago   but I loved her  this Lolita  pale and polluted and big with another man s child  She could fade and wither   I didn t care  I would still go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of her face    Don t touch me  I ll die if you touch me   It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight   Intoxicating  decadent novel   saturated with corruption and oozing purple language  Beautiful and tragic  yet dark  Nabokov paints a psychological portrait of what most would consider a monster  yet comes across as wholly sympathetic  Absolutely gorgeous and elegantly written   Very often we encounter a fictional work whose story holds promising potentials that are unfortunately vandalized and mutilated by subpar writing  I am looking at you  The Hunger Games   Lolita is the direct opposite  The story  to most people  would seem inappropriate   a sentiment that I actually found myself disagreeing with  especially as I was coming towards the end of the book  I will elaborate on this later   But no one could deny the sheer beauty and power of Nabokov s writing  This is a completely word driven book in which the plot plays only a secondary and servicing role   a form of literary art at its purest form  Like a Color Field painting  Lolita is a masterpiece whose brilliance shines through the wonder of the language itself  Nabokov himself called this book his love affair with the English language  and through Lolita he demonstrated how magnificent that love affair could be This is not to say that the story of the Lolita is bland  It is not  But neither is it  inappropriate  or  pornographic  as most people claim  The sense of inappropriate ness and pornographic ness only comes about if one were to examine this book in light of social conventions and conclude that the theme exemplified by the story or the idea advocated by the author somehow violates and does violence to such conventions  But to do so is to  pre read  the book or to cage the book within one s own mental world before even opening the first page  Instead  this book should be examined as a self contained and standalone world in and of itself  with no attached social or moral implications  Doing so will allow one to realize that the story  far from being inappropriate or pornographic  is in fact very banal  that it is nothing more than the heartaches of the beloving and the beloved as well as the journey of the aging and the aged  that it talks simply about one person s or maybe two people s or however many people s love leeching life and desire driven death  Because of that  Lolita is a tragic tale  but tragic in the everyday and everybody sense  Because of that  we all start to see ourselves in Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze   or more scary still  we start to see Humbert and Dolores in ourselves  I ve never been any good at writing book reviews  I think the last time I had fun with them was in second grade with Nate the Great  In any event  here it goes  A review   or rather my response to one of the most controversial modern books  and unequivocally the most well written and romantic books I have ever read  Lolita When I tell people I ve read and loved Lolita  I m often met with silence  Then questions  Well  one question  why  The answer is simple  I knew going in what the novel entailed  An older gentlemen with a perversion for little girls  A young girl who falls victim to the lusting of the old man boarding in her mother s house  I knew this  yet still  somehow I forgot everything I deemed reprehensible about Humbert Humbert  and Lolita started to read as a romance I was engrossed  I couldn t put it down  I was in love with Humbert s love and lust for Dee  He was obsessed with her in the way every woman wants to be obsessed over  His chase was exciting and throughout their  run   I so desperately wanted her to fall in love with him as he had with her According to Humbert s narration   Lolita  had what every woman wanted  She was beautiful  smart  confident  and she had this man wrapped around her finger  She had a power over him that even he could not understand  I wanted to be that kind of woman And then  tragedy struck  Towards the end  on no particular page and during no particularly momentous event  I realized what was happening  and I closed the book  Here is where I admit that I never picked it up again I was appalled with myself  He s been molesting her   She s twelve  Why am I enjoying this    What s wrong with me    IS there something wrong with me  For weeks I questioned my moral code   shook my moral compass  but I could not deny how I d felt while reading  Vladimir Nabokov had turned Dee  a child  a victim of sexual abuse  into a woman I wanted to be  She was a real femme fatale This was genius literary work  My respect for Nabokov only grew when I learned he  whose mother tongue was Russian  wrote Lolita in English first It has only been since Lolita that I ve learned of the unreliable narrator in literature  and to be conscious of them while reading   looking for clues in the narration to keep me grounded It s been a few years since I put down Lolita  and although I have immense respect for the novel and its author  I m still a bit scarred from the whole experience  I ll re read and finish it some day  Even if I don t  it will always be the best book I ve ever read   maybe not my favorite  but the best  i love it     Well written and well presented story of a madman who is not mad in customary sense  His madness for a crime which he plans and executes cleverly is a sign of genius  He did love dolores but he didn t care what she loved  Some parts of the book are really disturbing while at some parts the author succeeds in making us sympathise the criminal  A must read Nabokov is a genius and the way he writes is amazing every word is placed perfectly one after the other Other than that this book is one of the creepiest i ve ever read It makes you love a pedophile  as a charachter  and sometimes also think he is just a poor man whose life changed because of a little girl named Dolores Haze but then you realize that she is just 12 Fucking 12 I probably didn t like the second part as much as the first but it still kept me excited page after page And the ending monologue just wow i had chills all over my body a perfect way to end a perfect book  nabokovi udavod meoc e saukunis ert  ert i udidesi mt xrobelia  personazht a xasiat t a

a shek mna Frightening and tantalizing don t begin to cover it  Nabokov s Humbert Humbert is a pathetic  idiosyncratic oddity  with his relish at picking his teeth not to mention his other more sinister habits  Completely believable  especially as he lapses into psychosis near the end  he shows a knack for humor and intellectual pomposity that I didn t expect from the character before picking up the book  And what an amazing ability to be completely and utterly lewd without ever being crass  In his notes about his book  Nabokov says  My private tragedy  which cannot  and indeed should not  be anybody s concern  is that I had to abandon my natural idiom  my untrammeled  rich  and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second rate brand of English  devoid of any of those apparatuses   the baffling mirror  the black velvet backdrop  the implied associations and traditions   which the native illusionist  frac tails flying  can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way    p317 If the descriptive language in Lolita were to truly be considered  second rate  English  then we should all go home and never write another word  Nabokov is a marvel I know the impossibility of wishing this  but it would have been intriguing to hear Nabokov write a second book from the perspective of Little Dolly  As HH confesses  he as the self indulgent narrator never gives much thought to Lolita s needs  emotions  and thoughts This struck me as a particularly funny line  Rita is not a minor   She was so kind  was Rita  such a good sport  that I daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature or fallacy  an old broken tree or a bereaved porcupine  out of sheer chumminess and compassion    p258  I have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader s mind  No matter how many times we reopen  King Lear   never shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry  all woes forgotten  at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs   Whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers  his fate is fixed in our minds  and  similarly  we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them  Thus X will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the second rate symphonies he has accustomed us to  Y will never commit murder  Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us  We have it all arranged in our minds  and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him  Any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical  We would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor  the retired hot dog stand operator  if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen    p265 The most absurd death scene I have read yet     he slowed down  rolled his eyes half closing them and made a feminine  ah   and he shivered every time a bullet hit him as if I were tickling him  and every time I got him with those slow  clumsy  blind bullets of mine  he would say under his breath  with a phoney British accent   all the while dreadfully twitching  shivering  smirking  but withal talking in a curiously detached and even amiable manner   Ah  that hurts  sir  enough  Ah  that hurts atrociously  my dear fellow  I pray you  desist  Ah   very painful  very painful  indeed    God  Hah  This is abominable  you should really not     His voice trailed off as he reached the landing  but he steadily walked on despite all the lead I had lodged in his bloated body   and in distress  in dismay  I understood that far from killing him I was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fellow  as if the bullets had been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced    p303  For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere  connected with other states of being where art  curiosity  tenderness  kindness  ecstasy  is the norm  There are not many such books    p 315  Vladmir Nabokov  Nov 12 1956 Kinkily erotic  yes  but funny and precise  too  Nabokov supposedly wrote this on 3X5 index cards as he wandered through middle age  Quite an achievement from such a fractured approach  Joseph Heller reputedly did the same thing with  Catch 22   writing while riding public transportation to and from his job as an advertising man  Maybe I should stock up on index cards  Nabokov is such an amazing writer  Creepy story  great book  O livro mais bem escrito que nao tenciono reler  For once it s easy to choose Goodreads  5 star rating for a book  given that the rollover reminds us this means  it was amazing  rather than the 4 star  I really liked it   Lolita was amazing  I m not sure I really liked it  I m very glad I read it  I doubt I ll ever read it again  I suppose the most astonishing  and uncomfortable  single aspect of a generally astonishing and uncomfortable book is that for 350  pages it locates us squarely inside the mind  the emotions  the urges and the actions of what must surely be one of the most venal  vainglorious  pathetically evil characters in all of literature  Humbert Humbert is intelligent  educated  witty and eloquent  and as such his confession memoir  delivered through the veil of his own justifications and excuses  is shockingly seductive  In the course of our time with him we find ourselves laughing at his jokes  agreeing with his assessments  recognising his dilemmas  When his true nature shines through   and this is a negative shine  as it were  chinks of purest black in the light  bright armour of his self aggrandisement   the pure horror of it is so overwhelming that it is  paradoxically  easier to ignore than to focus on  We don t want to go there  We don t want to comprehend what those flashes of unvarnished truth tell us is really happening to Lolita  His endless expositions of undying love and amused observations on the idiosyncrasies of early adolescence are so much easier to bear  And because he is unable even at the end  when the horror he has wrought can finally no longer be concealed even from himself  to acknowledge that his Lolita was never more than an innocent victim  and he never less than the most guilty of predators  he remains  for me at least  irredeemable Because in some ways his greatest crime is this  Lolita is never a person to him  never an entity in her own right  never a being entitled to any rights  She exists only in relation to him  He defines her nature  implicitly  in terms of his own reactions to her  The notion that he might be  indeed should be  completely incidental is not one he can countenance  And the greatest tragedy of the book is that because he never challenges  never wants to challenge  his own duplicitous perception  he makes of it a reality  Lolita is  in the end  what he has made her  and no more  We are unable to know her except as he has known her  Her life is truncated by his understanding of it It is easy to see why Lolita is on virtually every best book list since the middle of the 20th century  It deserves to be there  It s a book that should be read  and talked about  and thought about  Should it be enjoyed  Well yes  for its mastery if not its subject matter  Nabokov s achievement is superlative  The style and structure of the thing  the framing devices and concatenation of tales  the pearls of prose  the characterisations  the sheer thrust and power of the narrative  are literally breathtaking  Readers talk about being transported  and it is a book that is deeply moving in every sense  For a writer it is an awe inspiring work  an intensely difficult story to pull off in the purely technical sense made to look easy by the sheer lyrical bravura of the author  There is much to learn here   and be intimidated by   great and magical  I ll bet that I m not the first person to say this  but Lolita was totally weird  messed up  but engrossing  Humbert Humbert is such a great character and villain  Nabokov paints him in such a convincing light that you can practically see his straining  aroused face as he ogles Lolita  Ew  ew  but you can t look away  The writing is also incredibly beautiful and unique  with a vocabulary that sent me scrambling to my phone about every other page  Lolita was definitely one of the most well written books I ve ever read  His description of what a nymphet is  while disturbing  is so fine grained that you know exactly what he s talking about Just listen to this line from the first page   Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Two additional notes  1  To movies and publishers everywhere  Stop portraying Lolita as a blonde  She s clearly a brunette in the story  2  The cover of my edition of Lolita features a Vanity Fair quote saying that this book is  The only convincing love story of our century   In what universe could Humbert Humbert s relationship with this adolescent girl be characterized as love  Not a universe I want to live in  HH doesn t love Lolita  he covets  tricks  cajoles  worships  bribes  threatens  and abuses her  I m not trying to get mushy here  but actual love requires that you love the person his or herself and care about their happiness and development independent of your own  You have to treat the person as an end in herself  not as a means to your ends  Clearly Lolita is a means to the end of HH s perverted pleasure and control  HH is not in love with Lolita  but with HH  His windbag style of writing  his incessant and unnecessary use of French  and his quoting of various European intellectuals show that he enjoys boasting and demonstrating his superior intelligence and genteel breeding to anyone who will listen  Let s hope that there s a big mirror in HH s cell  so he can be with his true love until his dying day  309 pages  I had been meaning to read this book for a long time but somehow never got around to it until a couple of years ago  Since then  I ve reread it at least four times and it never seems to lose its beauty for me  The language is compelling but also challenging   while most of the book flows beautifully  some of its best parts are the ones which command you to slow down and take your time  People easily put off by difficult topics  pedophilia  kidnapping  or florid   literary  language will probably not fall into this one but it s still worth a try  Humbert Humbert s narrative is one of the most real  well crafted and brilliant narratives of probably any book of the 20th Century and it s so much fun to watch how Nabokov makes a fully dimensional  often sympathetic character out of an unsympathetic situation  Read it  It s dirty and ambitious and perfectly pulled together   2011  Bij eerste lezing is dit boek in mijn ogen al geniaal  de opbouw van de spanning  het wat verfomfaaide Engels  doch de prachtige beschrijvingen  de taalspelletjes die Nabokov speelt  die ook nog eens relevant zijn voor het plot   allemaal waren ze een genot om te lezen  Maar het gevoel blijft dat er nog teveel dingen ongezien langs me heen zijn gekropen  en dat dit boek meer  literaire  kennis en bovenal meerdere lezingen vereist om op waarde geschat te worden April 2013  Inmiddels herlezen en er nog meer van genoten  Still reeling under the tour de force that was Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov   I find this 1958 NYT review of the book to be quite the best one could write  Mrs  Janeway  who is both a critic of fiction and  in such books as  The Walsh Girls  and  Leaving Home   a writer of it  says   The author  that is  is writing about all lust   But neither  I hope  will obscure the purpose of the device  namely  to underline the essential  inefficient  painstaking and pain giving selfishness of all passion  all greed  of all urges  whatever they may be  that insist on being satisfied without regard to the effect their satisfaction has upon the outside world  Humbert is all of us   This book is creepy  period  But it s also brilliantly written  The very first page is some of the best writing  aesthetically and otherwise  that I have ever seen  I started reading this book four times  but the content continuously stymied my motivation to finish reading it  It s hard to read  I finally finished it  I love it  Great book  I was transported to a whole new world  into the mind of a perverted old man  lusting for a young  vulnerable girl  I was surprised to see that instead of feeling repulsed  in the course of the book  I felt empathy and pity for the old man  who is merely yearning for affection   which made me realise that there is some good in everyone and that there is no such thing as a bad person  What intrigued me the most was how vividly Lolita was described in the eyes of the man  showing his incessant  somewhat obsessive desire for her   Lolita  una pasion prohibida Honestamente  es la mejor historia de amor que he leido Mejor que Rose y Jack  que Romeo y Julieta Mejor que todas Es la mejor historia de amor  la mas dolorosa y caotica historia de amor Sin palabras  Wonderfully written  Nabokov s words are like liquid  Should be noted  however  that my mother borrowed it from my bookshelf to have something to read at the doctor s office  She had to close it because she was embarrassed to be reading it in public  If you blush easily  might wanna read it in private   Oscar Wilde once said   There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book  Books are well written  or badly written  That is all  I can think of no book that sums this statement up better than Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita  I confess  I was not drawn to this book because of its controversial subject matter  or its established  classic  status  It was in fact its famous opening lines I found quoted somewhere on the internet that grabbed my attention and refused to let go until I had wandered down to the bookshop and purchased my own copy  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  The prose reads like poetry  every single word carefully selected  never coming across as pretentious or overly flowery  always clear and most certainly engaging  I do not believe I have ever read a book that reads so beautifully as  Lolita   What makes this feat even more astonishing is that English was not even Nabokov s first language  or even his second So  what of the story and its controversial subject matter  Well  there is no doubt about it  Humbert Humbert  the name itself carefully chosen to instill a sense of dislike in the reader   the extremely fallible narrative voice of  Lolita   is a monster  A tortured poet he may be  and explain himself he does  but when one takes a step back from his beautifully sensual words and convincing proclamations of love  all one is confronted with is an utterly vile repulsive creature who systematically destroys the childhood  innocence  and even the life  of an unfortunately reckless twelve year old girl  Such documentation of systematic destruction  combined with such a sniping  hateful relationship and the constant threat of discovery hanging over Humbert s head meant that I was never bored  and found the book very hard to put down One of the saddest things I think to have come out of  Lolita   and certainly something  I think  that Nabokov never intended  is the use of this name to describe a sexually precocious young girl  when it is Humbert Humbert   the frequently sympathised with frustrated somnophiliac and romantic paedophilie   who  quite frankly  should have known better  It smacks of rape culture  As I said  I do not think Nabokov is at fault for this  to quote Oscar Wilde again   It is the spectator  and not life  that art really mirrors   I actually think the most challenging thing about this book is that you constantly need to bear in mind the narrator s fallibility  something that I think many readers actually miss A wonderful  wonderful book  I really enjoyed  Lolita   Out of the countless words written about Lolita  could I possibly add anything worthwhile  Probably not  but I can at least say this  avoid the tedious introduction  and only rely on the endnotes  which should have been footnotes  but I digress  if you REALLY don t understand something  Nabokov certainly makes plenty of allusions in his work  but  from my perspective  revealing them is little more than a magic trick that adds little to the actual reading So  the book itself  It s definitely listed as one of the best English novels of all time for a reason  Despite the despicable main character and his equally despicable actions  Lolita paints a picture of a miserable man trapped in a private hell by his predilections  and somehow makes this situation  mostly the interplay between Humbert and the titular Lolita  absolutely hilarious  Nabokov also does a great job of showing different values  especially between Americans and Europeans  in a world just coming out of WWII  Americans are depicted as loud and tacky  with Lolita being a member of the generation that defined the teenage lifestyle  and Europeans overly fussy and formal  Ultimately  it s a great novel  but you didn t need me to tell you that  The only downside is my sadness over putting off reading it for so long  Nabokov is the single best writer I ve ever read   No se como empezar a hablar de este libro  Solo puedo decir que me ha parecido una absoluta maravilla  he disfrutado de la lectura de una forma impresionante y se ha convertido sin lugar a dudas en la mejor novela que haya leido nunca   La prosa de Nabokov es absolutamente fantastica e inteligente  con cientos de referencias a obras literarias y de teatro que enriquecen la lectura  Ademas  volviendo a la narrativa  el autor escribe tan sumamente bien que hace te olvides completamente de que la persona que esta contando la historia es el propio Nabokov  y no Humbert Humbert desde prision  Sin duda  lo mejor de esta novela es su gran calidad literaria  He disfrutado leyendo como con ningun otro libro  Ya no por la historia en si  que tambien  aunque en otras formas de diversion  dado que es un tema bastante duro   sino por la pluma de Vladimir  Algo que tambien me ha gustado mucho es la cantidad de apelaciones que hay al lector  haciendolo en gran parte participe de la historia   De un modo u otro  se me ha hecho dificil odiar al protagonista a pesar de tratarse de un ser enfermo y repugnante  Por otra lado  Lolita me ha parecido un personaje absolutamente genial  he reido y sentido carino por ella  por su inocencia  descaro u ocurrencias  En cuanto al tema de la obra  debo decir algo  Estoy viendo algunas resenas del libro y de verdad que no entiendo a los que lo han entendido como un romance cuando la intencion de Nabokov es justo lo contrario  Lolita es una simple nina secuestrada por un pedofilo que sexualiza cada minimo gesto de la chiquilla  Es un hombre enfermo   Eso demuestra el dano que han hecho las adaptaciones al cine del libro  que aunque ambas sean muy buenas  han intentado dar un aire romantico y de una Lolita perversa a una historia que no es romantica y a un personaje que no es perverso  Lolita  luz de mi vida  fuego de mis entranas  Pecado mio  alma mia  Lo lita la punta de la lengua emprende un viaje de tres pasos desde el borde delpaladar para apoyarse  en el tercero  en el borde de los dientes  Lo Li Ta   Este fragmento vivira para siempre conmigo  Una joya de lectura obligada  Much better than most of the stories one hears about it  Sure it about a child molester  but mostly it is about his tortured existence and insanity and the girl is very mercenary Amazing  I don t know why I put off reading this book for as long as I did  The sensitive subject matter pales in comparison to the way its narrative entrances you  I was literally left speechless by the end of it  yet all the same  I felt the story was complete where it had finished   The temptation to try to shock after reading this audacious novel is quite extreme  Played straight face  with moments of jaw dropping candour  this is one giant laugh at the expense of people s sensibilities  The tale of a predatory paedophile and his obsession with a 12 year old  nymphette   the absolute refusal to moralise is at once both shocking and exhilarating  Nabokov does allow the occasional touchstone of feeling and remorse into the novel but essentially this is probably the biggest sustained piss take since Jonathan Swift laud down his quill Be warned thou  this is not a book for skimmers  The density of the prose and imagination of the insights mean that rapt attention  whether you like it or not  is the only way to approach this meisterwerk  Escrito con una prosa ingeniosa y con mucho humor  Humbert Humbert es uno de los personajes mas cinicos que he leido y aun asi muy bueno  Definitivamente recomendado  Absolutely my favourite book with all my heart  It is such a well written book it is an absolute gem  The delivery of this review has been delayed by some rather bitter complications with the internet  ahem  thanks for that Bigpond  but I felt it necessary to struggle through the tedious rate of download and write my belated review for this gem of a novel Spoilers ahead  Lolita  Light of my life  Fire of my loins      No  not the girl  The book  That isn t to say that Miss Dolores Haze was not an intriguing character to observe  but I must begin this review by stating that I will forever hold this narrative in my heart  The plot twists and turns in the most unpredictable ways  the story is captivating thanks to the help of our devilish narrator  Where would the story be without the pathetic delusions of poor old Humbert Humbert  the pitiful pervert  the misapprehended poet  Everything he narrates is described with so much beauty  that his criminal mind becomes brilliant  Too bad nothing he says is ever reliable  this does  of course  refer to the shameful misconception of the general public that Lolita was the first to make a move in the abomination that was Lo and Humbert s relationship  Before I continue  I have to admit that I have been simultaneously obsessed and avoiding this book for the past two years  Reading a short synopsis of the story at the time had me intrigued by the vulgarity of the plot line  but also afraid that Humbert s perverted mind would be too corrupt to handle  I have to admit I began this book expecting unscrupulous rape scenes  murders and all that kind of junk our parents would want us to avoid exploitation to  I was pleasantly surprised to find nothing of the sorts  to an extent  I suppose   and was able to immerse myself in the artistic writing style of Vladimir Nabokov  If a book has been written with more vividness than this one  I have not found it yet   This is the kind of book that will have you thinking about it well after you ve finished reading it  and those are the best kind of books  Firstly  I must talk about our dear frienemy  Humbert Humbert  Humbert the horrible  Humbert the horrific  And yet  Humbert the loveable  How does Vladimir Nabokov make us sympathise with a monster  Maybe it s the pathetic nature of the man that makes him pitiful  most evident in his pursuit of a twelve year old girl  Naturally  the reader will sympathise with the victim  Lo  Lola  Dolly  but there is something about his delusional mind that makes one want to pat him on the back and exert a great big   awwwwwww   I am not  of course  saying that I approve of Humbert or his mischievous ways  He is a monster of a man and will always be a monster of a man  and it is clear that left a mark on Lolita that can never be erased  However  there is something about his undying love for Lolita  something he saw in her that made her stand apart from every other  nymphet   that makes the reader feel sorry for him  Of course  due to the unreliability of Humbert s recount  it is uncertain whether he really loved Lolita  or thought he did  There is  of course  another aspect of Humbert that one cannot help but like  In the first part of the book  where Humbert has not made his move on Lolita  he details his pathetic longing for her  needless to say that old pervert can be quite funny sometimes  There is one scene I recall explicitly where Humbert thinks about dressing up as a girl to board at the camp where Lolita is staying that had me in stitches  In scenes like that  Humbert is not so much Humbert the Horrible but Humbert the Humorous  and his constant reassurance to the reader that he is  attractive  shows that he is not Humbert the Humble  In my opinion  humour can make a dark themed book seem light  and this was definitely the case with Lolita Now for the girl herself  Lolita  Lola  Lo  Dolores  Dolly  Whatever you want to call her  To Humbert  she was the light of his world  the love of his life  the nymphet to outshine all nymphets  To everyone else  she was a normal young girl  on the verge of adolescence  If you look up Lolita in the dictionary  you will find a description of a sexual young girl  and I have to say that this makes me upset  This would insinuate that Lolita was more promiscuous than other girls her age  and in one way she was  but it can t be forgotten that she was a victim of rape  Lolita had her life stripped from her  both her mother and her childhood were dead  so it would be fair to say that she had a hard life  Undoubtedly  Humbert s obsession with her would have had an effect on her mentality  so I can t help but feel for her a lot  Lolita was a broken young girl  It is ironic how much light she brought to Humbert s life when she was consumed by so much darkness  needless to say  this light diminished the more depressed she became   Lolita symbolised the common girl  she was adventurous and spontaneous  but she was emotional  In some instances  Humbert must have forgotten this  and used her for his own advantages  to her own dismay   This is particularly evident at the end of part one  when Lo ran into Humbert s rooms in tears  not because she felt guilty for barking at the man  but because her mother was dead  Although it is not explicitly expressed  back to my second paragraph   Lolita was then  and always had been  a victim to a peculiar man who defeated her  Lolita s growing annoyance of Humbert and her subsequent depression  in my view  it was a depression  make her more normal and human than any other girl her age  and that is why it upsets me to see people label her as a tease or a harlot  I sometimes wonder whether Lolita fleeing from Humbert was necessary or an act of stupidity  I don t deny it could be both  but I don t really feel like going into that To love Humbert or to loathe him  To sympathise with Lolita or to denounce her  Whatever the reader may choose  it is certain that this is a great novel  Lolita is a rare jewel of a story because it can be both touching and appalling  profound and confusing  but above all intriguing  The story of Humbert and Dolores makes the reader want to turn page after page  and when it is over  you want to learn more  This is the type of book that can never be challenged  it is the one and only  Nabakov is one of the best writers of the 20th century and this is his masterpiece  It is a story of obsession and the main character is dispicable  but the reader does not hate him  This was intentional  I m sure as was the characterization of Lolita who is much older than her tender years would grant  This is a remrkable book with an ending that is very satisfying  Everyone who has an IQ over 120 should read this story  Read it twice  Honestly  though  unless you are writing a paper or are really nerdy  only use the annotations to get the translations for French words  Since I was writing a paper the first time I can vouch that the scholarship is quite good  but also pulls away from the book far too often and breaks the narrative flow  Where to start  I suppose with the prose itself  It s lovely  smooth  delicious stuff  always easy and yet deceptively rich  sometimes to the point of being challenging  If you aspire to be a writer  and especially if you dislike sparse prose  this is a must read As for the sexual content  certainly it is there  but those looking for a hot n heavy read should probably look elsewhere  Lolita is much less about sex and much more about obsession  it s simply that the two intertwine at many points  as they tend to for many of us  though hopefully without the same destructive results  Then again  I wonder if the difference is purely a manner of scale     Spoiler alert  Personally  given the first few pages  I can t imagine how much of a spoiler one can give this book  it s simply not that sort of work  But I warn you  nonetheless  and truly  you might wish to form your own impressions before becoming imprinted by mine  A friend of mine said  when I was praising Nabokov s prose after reading the first twenty or so pages  that he was too smooth by half  causing one to almost feel sorry for that monster  M  Humbert Humbert  So  once I had finished the book  I asked myself  do I pity old Hum I find that I do  Oh  I don t pity Hum for his obsessions that lead him to his end  and I certainly don t pity him for succumbing to them  But I do pity him for knowing what he wrought  for being acutely aware of the horrible  unforgivable damage he causes to Dolores Haze  and  worse  for being aware that  all things being equal  he d probably do much the same if given another chance  Someone once wrote  I forget who  that the villain rarely seriously thinks of himself as such  Humbert does To me  if one knows one wreaks evil  is aware of no redeeming qualities of one s actions  and is sure that one s nature would not allow one to do otherwise  the sticky point  I m aware  but Humbert seems convinced of it   then I can find pity for him  Enough to spare him  Certainly not  But the pity is there  nonetheless Of course  if and when I read Lolita again  I may well come to a different conclusion  It s definitely that sort of book  But for now  that s where I stand with it One last note  I am rarely fond of a book that kills off all the main characters before it s done  but  as it is in other ways  Lolita is an exception  I understand very well why Dolores Haze could not survive childbirth  By his actions  Humbert has trapped her in the  nymphet stage  in such a way that she can never escape  Indeed  it s the worst of his crimes  by far  or the cumulative result  have it as you will  She has become in too many ways Hum s creation  and so it is not surprising she cannot survive his death by more than a month  I really loved this love story  This was my favorite part   my only grudge against nature was that I could not turn my Lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix  her unknown heart  her nacreous liver  the sea grapes of her lungs  her comely twin kidneys   Pg 165  I adore this book  It s gripping  mind bending  beautiful  It throws conventional ideas of morality out the window as it pulls you into the love story  which is a disaster like so many real love stories are  It makes you question all of your assumptions and I love it for that   This is a truly astounding piece of art  Nabakov effectively managed to make me empathize with a pedophile even while knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that all of this character s actions are self serving and certainly are evil and perverse in nature  Despite this knowledge I find myself liking sarcastically charming Humbert Humbert with his manically obsessive love for Lolita  There were even times where I caught myself hoping that he wouldn t get caught or that Lolita might love him back with the same capacity that he demonstrates  The only disclaimer I have is that it was fairly long and slow paced so it is certainly a time investment  Not something one should pick up as a  summer read  by any means  However  Nabokov s beautiful uses of imagery and metaphor alone make it worth the time  without even considering the moral implications of this work  AMAZING  This is a couple of hundred pages of the most beautiful poetry ever written  The language is mind blowingly beautiful  and of course the irony is that the subject is as base as you can get  I loved exploring HH s sick mind using language so melodic that you get goose bumps just reading it  One of my very favorite books  There are certain travelers who know what its like to exist in that mad dream world where horror is hidden in plain sight  Dearest Nabokov had an uncanny understanding of how somethings are all the darker in the light  Lolita s story  like so many other little girls   happened  not on a stained mattress in a basement with a bare light bulb hanging but with supporting casts of so many good families gathered in the lobby to play wholesome games  Wave goodbye with a smile  the prettily dressed  child and her kind  handsome father  Did she seem just a tad reluctant  Well just you ignore the feeling that s crawling all over you  It s only reality  Hush now  Roll the dice and carry on  I will never review this book  I will simply offer up a prayer of thanks to dear Nabokov for this gift to every little girl who knows what it s like to be trapped in plain sight  forced to be convincing lest the good folk discover that all is not as it seems  Humbert is despicable monster  no doubt  but it was  good people  that kept Lolita safely captive  She knew what happened if you stepped outside that golden light and she was right  Only Nabokov could write a book about a man s lust for a 12 year old girl and make it a masterpiece   The artistry behind his writing  the alliterations  the wordplay  everything really  is absolutely astounding and beautiful  This is art  My favorite part of this book is the line when HH describes squirming bratty children as  instars   Good thing I work with fruit flies  because I got the joke  Instar is the term for squirming  slimy  ravenous fruit fly larvae  They look like tiny maggots that do nothing but eat  I came upon this book while biking with a friend around Cuba  camping mostly in cane fields  isolated beaches  abandoned buildings or precarious mountain perches  For a few days we stayed in Sancti Spiritus  a crumbling old town ten miles south of the railroad spine of the island  at the house of a friend I had met on a previous trip  The day before we left I was perusing his bookshelf and noticed a book written in English  Lolita  He gave it to me as a parting gift At that time I knew next to nothing about Nabokov  but from the first chapter I was hooked on his use of language  I think that in the same way my body began to crave American food after long days of exertion in the summer sun  so too did my mind crave the English language after translating Cuban Spanish without rest My friend started reading the book too  and so we had to take turns reading whenever we stopped  Though really I got the short end since his Spanish ended at hola  adios  estados unidos  and tengo hambre  It would have been easier to share a pair of socks or a single water bottle After a couple days we made a high stakes bet  with the winner claiming ownership of the book for the remainder of the trip  I lost  With few moments to read in the day as it was  that meant two more weeks of privation Our return took us through Bogota  Colombia  and it was there that I read the final chapters It may be no surprise then that  for me  Lolita is most of all about language  Much has been said about the themes of the book  the taboo of pedophilia  allegorical comparisons to America  the nature of love and all the psychological ugliness unearthed by Humbert Humbert  But the best part for me is Nabokov s way of telling the story  with a great love of words and at the same time great wordplay  The sentences often capture profound nuance in a turn of phrase  or have an unusual quality to them that makes me double back for a second look This is the first book I remember reading that struck me as poetry in novel form  And because Nabokov knows more English than most native speakers  it was a welcome challenge too  to be immersed in an internal monologue that was  at some points  as Hazy as his Dolores  Lolita is a classic It can be disturbing in many ways  but it can also be amazing in more ways that it is disturbing  Let s just say that this book is disturbingly good  Reading this book is like going into a coma  but a good kind of book coma not the I nearly died of  a car crash kind Personally it was more of the way it was written then than story  Nabokov could write an encyclopedia about Binomial Theorems and you would be reading it word for word  Yes  that is how good Lolita was written  Usually this sort of book will bore me to death but Nabokov proved me wrong  Wonderful author  wonderful book  I did not want to use cliche words like beautiful or phenomenal but I have to for this book is exactly that  beautiful and phenomenal    If you have not read this classic  you are definitely missing out  This edition wins for most disturbing cover  which I have by way of collecting vintage covers and editions  There are several good GR reviews of Lolita that I d link to if I knew how  My favorite so far is by Chris of Vancouver  B C  I may one day work up the gumption to write my own  Superlativa su prosa  enternecedora su empatia  Nabokov se pasa en esta novela  Para los avidos lectores de novelas de hoy dia  puede que noten  por momentos  una prosa sin ritmo y superflua  en ese caso  no estan disfrutando de la belleza adjetivadora de Humbert   I never expected to enjoy this book as much as I did  considering what it s about  but the truth is I did and I m not even ashamed anymore The writing style is just beautiful and seductive  It draws you in and you can t help getting involved with these characters and what goes on in their messed up minds Also  the characters are simply fascinating  They re all perverted in some way and you are both repulsed and intrigued with them Humbert Humbert and Lolita  the focus of the story  are especially perverse and I loved every minute of this disturbing relationship  I still can t say who was the prey and who was the predator  They weaved a strange web around each other and everything is so tangled I couldn t figure out who took the first step  I guess there s no prey here  They re both predators  Anyway  that big question mark is part of the mystery of the book  so go read it if you haven t done it yet  This book is a masterpiece  It is the first I read by Nabokov  but it won t be the last  Mil opiniones  comentarios  prejuicios y alabanzas se han proclamado ante la obra de Vladimir Nabokov  asi que realmente no hay gran cosa que yo pueda agregar al respecto  no sere original ni traere nueva luz sobre la forma de apreciar Lolita  Asi que  como una simple aficionada  solo puedo dar una humilde opinion sobre este libro  que es mas y va mas alla de las convenciones y de todo lo que he leido  es una magistral obra maestra que  sin duda alguna  sera alabada y aborrecida por mas generaciones futuras de las que puedo imaginar  como el mismo Humbert Humbert dijo  Lolita sera inmortalizada  Y  sin embargo  a pesar de cuanto me pudo gustar obra y a pesar de el miedo a mi propia redundancia y a decir algo que ha sido  seguramente  tema de discusion por millones de expertos  debo expresar el conflicto que me causa la obra en si  Por una parte yo se que Lolita y Humbert Humbert no existieron  reconozco la estetica y la belleza con que esta historia fue escrita  pero la forma en que los argumentos de H  H  describen la pederastia como la cosa mas natural del mundo  la explicacion sobre las ninfulas y la insinuacion de que estas sobrellevarian mejor una interaccion sexual a una corta edad realmente me perturba  no porque de la noche a la manana yo dire   Ah  mira  una chica de 12 anos y su novio padrastro de 40   que encantadora pareja    porque NO  nunca podria pensar algo semejante  pero temo por alguien que tenga la tendencia dentro de su ser  con esto no digo que sera culpa de Nabokov si se decide a actuar  pero sin duda leer sobre cuanta  belleza  encierra una pequena ninfula entre sus piernas y el extasis que la delicadeza de su piel puede provocar  podrias desarrollar reacciones que temo siquiera imaginar  sobre todo al saber que H  H  jamas pago realmente por lo que pudo haber o no hecho a Lolita  quien  a pesar de su forma de actuar  no debemos olvidar que solo era una nina huerfana de 12 anos  Nabokov himself said that this novel was his best  I still have to read the others but I agree when critics say that this is one of the best English novels ever  For me  the reason is the irony of having a very sick theme   pedophilia   but told brilliantly that you would fall in love with the book and you don t readily really know why From the famous opening statement   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta      up to his closing statements   I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigment  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita   Nabokov filled up the 300  pps of this book with his captivating narrative  His choice of words is precise and never boring  The rhythm and cadence of his sentences are invigorating which I think is distinctively Nabokov  This as opposed to let s say the short and concise yet picturesque narrative of Ernest Hemingway in The Old Man and The Sea  When you read a page of a book by Hemingway or Gabriel Garcia Marquez  even without looking at the book s cover  you would right away know who the author is  This is true for Nabokov  I think  I am a father of a 14 year old girl and I just could not imagine having a man  especially a middle age one  lusting and going after her when she was still 12 years old  Just that for a plot and it is enough for me to immediately drop the book  According to Wikipedia  at the time of its writing  Nabokov was trying to make a name for himself as a writer in the US  He was born in Russia  stayed and wrote in Germany and France before finally moving to the US  He wrote Lolita very carefully and it took him two years writing and re writing the book  It is the only one of the few novels that is included almost in all Best Novels Lists  1001  501  Time Magazine 100  Newsweek 100  Modern Library 100  etc So  I spent the last 4 days reading and appreciating this novel  It is one of the old classics  first published in 1955  that could hardly put me to sleep  It is very stimulating to the brain and engaging    Gentlemen of the jury     says Humbert Humbert which is very appropriate since from page 1  you know that you hate him for being a sex maniac and sick  sick pedophile  But along the way  because of Nabokov s eloquence on words  you would understand his point of view  he used to love a young girl who died before they were able to consummate their affair  Thus  though the theme is about a sick in the head man  it is a love story that is told in a brilliant one of a kind prose Sana Nabokov brought his PC in heaven and continue writing good novels there   So many misinterpretations of this book  it s driving me CRAZY  There is no way you can read this and believe that Nabokov is in any way endorsing what HH is doing  it is apparent he can barely stomach it  every  romantic  scene or moment in which HH glorifies  nymphets  with beautiful imagery is followed by a horrific instance of reality  Lolita acting like a non consenting child who has been abused her whole life  and HH acting like an insane pedophile  Nabokov wrote this in English  his second language  in my edition there is an extremely sad author s note in which he discusses this choice  He felt that he didn t write Lolita as well as he could have in Russian because he didn t understand the nuances of the languages  This is hard to believe  Lolita is part American road trip novel  it explores the cross roads of middle class American and intellectual Europe  HH uses his classical training to justify raping Lolita  comparing himself to the  greats  of European history who had young prostitutes  I think the most beautiful part of the book is the last paragraph  not the first   Although I believe my review  and rating of five stars  will be widely unpopular  I feel justified writing it knowing I have read this book over and over and never once finished it feeling the same way as the time before  Nabokov is a witty  scary  brilliant writer  As he takes on the form of Humbert  he manages to seduce the reader  The few people I have spoken to that have read this masterpiece have told me that Humbert is a  disgusting  character but as disgusting and revolting as he is  somehow he manages to make the reader feel sorry for him  No matter your views on Nabokovs characters  I believe this novel is one that should be respected and read more than once   It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight   L indefinibile leggerezza di un libro pesante Un capolavoro di Nabokov  dalle tinte rubino A volte mi chiedo se  non sapendo che un libro e ritenuto un pilastro  lo riconoscerei come tale Lolita e come un culturista che gira per strada  pero  impossibile non vederne le spalle  Ragazzi sono sbalordita e compiaciuta  Primo perche Humbert e quindi di rimando Mr Nabokov sono dei patiti di letteratura francese   i monologhi interiori di H H sono tutta una citazione meditazione riflessione speculazione elucubrazione su Moliere de Sade Voltaire Baudelaire Verlaine e Rimbaud   e cio mi manda letteralmente in brodo di giuggiole   3Secondo questo libro e la prova che lo stile di un bravo autore rende tollerabile e a tratti addirittura piacevole un personaggio balordo come H H  Poi si dica quello che si vuole sono perfettamente d accordo sul fatto che  non si fa non e bello non e giusto    ma   cavoli signori   Un amore piu appassionato di cosi io non l ho mai letto da nessuna parte  Macabro di cattivo gusto impossibile indecente ma profondo  Patetico quanto tenero il tentativo di costruire attorno alla ragazzina un finto mondo di normalita un goffo tentativo di partenita un brandello fasullo di prospettiva d vita futura serena Un capitolo a parte lo dedico a Lolita sinceramente odiosa come d altronde tutte le adolescenti letterarie  chi si ricorda Briony di  Espiazione    Al di la del binomio pruriginoso  incesto  pedofilia il libro e ben scritto Bello stile ricco descrittivo pscicologico appassionato mai retorico nonostante le numerossissime citazioni di letteratura francese che costellano tutto il libro  La storia si fa lenta e macchinosa quando Lolita esce di scena e si perde un po  nel finale ma non toglie niente alla sua complessa e morbosa bellezza  Era amore a prina vista a ultima vista a eterna vista  Applausi  Era difficilissimo scrivere qualcosa cosi  True literary genius  There are so many layers to the rich word play  I eagerly look forward to reading more by Nabokov  Full review to come later  once I have recovered unpicked the vast array of literary allusions and analysed these  with the help of the brilliantly illuminating  The Annotated Lolita  I found at home  halfway through reading an unannotated copy  So although I have officially finished reading  I am going to be returning to many scenes  This  I think  is a novel which demands to be re read   Nabakov s portrayal of a pedophile is somehow both sensitive and creepy  and brilliantly told from the perspective of the offender himself in jail  Humbert Humbert s first person story of how his love for the child Lolita turns to disgust as she grows into a young woman is riveting and shocking  and a brilliant portrayal of how obsession justifies itself  no matter how horrifying the outcome   Fantastic  Nabokov s language is incredibly thoughtful and clever   full of sly wit and layers of meaning  The subject is notoriously controversial of course  but he succeeds in the seemingly impossible task of creating a sympathetic character in a pedophile  If you re not sold on that  you can look past the subject matter and just appreciate the prose  What a dodgy character  But what a well written book  Lolita is Nabokov s greatest and most popular novel  Originally published in France as it was considered obscene and pornographic back in 1955  It still is a challenging read today as the idea of a love story between a 40 year old man and a 12 year old girl is not a settling topic for most  Needless to say it was an instant classic and was soon published in the States and later considered one of the greatest love stories ever written  I myself love this book to no end  just reading passages at times is like reading poetry   Wow  what a book  The whole book feels so honest  its as if the narrator is confessing to an omniscient God  It took me through so many different emotions  Nabokov fills the pages with incredible lines that I had to stop and reread them a dozen times  When I try to analyze my own cravings  motives  actions and so forth  I surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination    which causes each visualized route to fork and re fork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past  Why do we do what we do  A lot of the time I don t know  I have to trust that my past self was making a well informed decision   otherwise the second guessing will drive me crazy  German review  english review further down  Humpert  der padophile Ich Erzahler befriedigt seine Triebe  indem er aus der Ferne junge Madchen  Nymphets  oder im deutschen Nymphchen genannt  beobachtet und gelegentlich junge Prostituierte aufsucht  Nachdem seine Ehe gescheitert ist  wird er Untermieter einer alleinerziehenden Mutter  allein auf Grund der Tochter Lolita  die genau seinem Ideal entspricht  Schliesslich heiratet er die Mutter sogar  um in der Nahe der Tochter zu bleiben  Als die Mutter jedoch plant  Lolita auf ein Internat zu schicken  beginnt er finstere Plane zu schmieden   Mindfuck  Der englische Ausdruck trifft die Wirkung des Romans auf mich perfekt Ich habe mich allzu oft von den wunderbaren Formulierungen  Wortspielen  Euphemismen des Erzahlers einlullen lassen und bin dann immer wieder hoch geschreckt  wenn auf diese Weise  oft zwischen den Zeilen  abartige  perverse Momente beschrieben wurden  Sex mit der 12 jahrigen Stieftochter  das ist jenseits jeder Grauzone  sich von ihr befummeln lassen  wahrend er Schulkinder beim Verlassen der Schule beobachtet  ist nur krank  Und trotzdem war mir Humbert bei weitem nicht so unsympathisch  wie er hatte sein sollen  Wenn er mit Selbstironie und Wortwitz seine Eskapaden beschreibt  musste ich oft schmunzeln und die sprachliche Eleganz uberdeckt nur allzu oft den widerlichen Inhalt  So wie er Lolita manipuliert  ihr Geschenke macht  ihr Zuneigung schenkt  wenn sie bei seinen perversen Spielen mitmacht  fuhle ich mich in gewisser Weise auch als Leser manipuliert  Selbstironie  Charme und poetische Sprache brachten mich immer wieder dazu  seine Perversionen  oder vielmehr die Umsetzung derselben in die Tat  ETWAS milder zu beurteilen Bis zum Ende gibt es Wendungen  die erschrecken und traurig machen Humpert ist ein grandioser  Anti  Held  seine Sicht auf die Geschehnisse ist alles andere als objektiv und es wird immer wieder deutlich  wie wenig sein Verhalten mit   Liebe  zu tun hat und doch fuhlt man mit seiner Verzweiflung mit Lolita war ebenfalls ein wunderbarer Charakter  auf ihre Weise arrangiert sie sich mit der Situation und zieht aus ihr Starke  Sie lernt  die Machtbalance zu ihren Gunsten zu verschieben und verfolgt ihre eigenen Ziele Die Lekture des Romans ist eine Achterbahnfahrt  Atemberaubende Sprache  die einen oft innehalten lasst  herrliche Seitenhiebe auf die amerikanische Kultur  Charaktere  die man zugleich liebt und hasst  eine Geschichte  die einem oft den Magen umdreht  die Selbstironie  mit der sich der Erzahler zuweilen selbst betrachtet    Absolute Leseempfehlung English review Humpert  the pedophile narrator satisfies his urges by watching young girls  which he calls nymphets and occassionally visits young prostitutes  After his marriage falls apart  he becomes the lodger of a single mother solely because of her daughter Lolita  who represents his ideal of a nymphet  Finally he even marries the mother to stay close to the daughter  But when the mother plans to send Lolita to a boarding school  he starts to cook up sinister plans   Mindfuck  This expression fits the effect the novel had on me perfectly Way to often I let the wonderful phrases  play of words  euphemisms of the narrator charm me  only to be startled again  when in this beautiful way  often enough between the lines  perverted and sick moments were being described  Sex with the 12 year old stepdaughter is beyond any greyzone  letting himself be sexually touched by her while watching school girls leave school  is simply sick  And yet Humbert wasn t as dislikeable  as he should have been  When he describes his escapades with self mockery and wordplay  I often had to smile and the elegance of the language often covers the disgusting content Just like he manipulates Lolita  makes her presents  grants her affection if she plays along with his sick games  I felt manipulated as well in a way  Self mockery  charme and peotical language brought me again and again to the point of judging his perversions  or rather putting them into practice  a LITTLE bit more forgivingly Up to the end there are twists and turns that shock and sadden Humbert is a great  anti  hero  his point of view on the events is anything but neutral and it gets clear again and again how little his behaviour has to do with   love  and yet I felt sympathetic to his torment and desperation Lolita was a wonderful character as well  she comes to terms with the situation in her own way and draws strength from it  She learns to shift the power balance in her favour and has her own agenda Reading this novel was a rollercoaster ride  breathtaking language  which often made me pause for a moment  great side blows on the american culture from an European point of view  characters I loved and hated at once  a story which turned my stomach a couple of times  the self mockery with which the narrator look upon himself at times    definetely a recommendation   I feel that Humbert Humbert is in denial trying to pass paedophila as moral because the little girls are  nymphets that have something speical about them that he can t resist because he is self depricating in order to distract the reader  It is a creepy book but I love Nabokov s style and the way in which he makes the reader feel as though they truely understand the inner pschology that will not the truth to be accepted by him  I still have a way to read interested how it will end   Loved this  Great language  style was beautiful  Story line was captivating  So many new vocabulary words learned  One of my favorites of all time  Lolita  Lolita   You are the first book in a long time to give me heartache and make me feel so immersed in your world that I never wanted to stop reading  but at the same time  I never wanted to look at you again  Nabokov is a master of prose  Each word he writes dwells in my mind the day after  making me wonder if I missed some subtlety or if it was all an illusion  I was reading another book at the same time as this  That was a dumb idea  After taking a few breaths of Lolita and turning to any other book  the words seemed dry and stale  Lolita is a sea  and every time I dip my feet in I come out feeling refreshed  I was so enraptured that sometimes I found myself mistakenly sympathizing with and  in a way  cheering for Humbert Humbert  to find happiness in some other place than the abuse of Dolores   Sometimes I wish that Dolores had loved him and was older  other times I wish Humbert had never moved away from France  This book makes me really wonder about the paths that we take in life  it has changed me as a thinker  a reader  and a writer  I don t think the pedophilia was as shocking as it intended to be  but perhaps it was just because of the hype I had heard prior to reading it  I wish that I could see from Dolores  point of view  but I know that hearing it would have shattered the distortions of beauty that Humbert Humbert had given me I only hope that I can return to this book when I am older  and more mature  and feel the same kind of thought provoking comfort I find in this book now  One of the few books I return to again and again  and always find more in it  Magnificent  beautiful  sad  tormented  and depraved   I think I ve read this 4 or 5 times  Each additional time I m reminded of why it s my favorite book  Sometimes I drift away and think I ll grow to love another ore  but it hasn t happened yet  Each word is written on the page with thick sugar ink  If Nabokov had written about another subject I don t know if it would have come out as well  we ll never know  My favorite quotes from this one could  and have  fill half a notebook  The one part I don t like is the long sentenced paragraphs during the road trips  Lolita has nothing to do with the pedophilia or the murder or any of the pop out details There are so many things up for interpretation with this bookUndertones  undertones  Beautifully written about the ugliest of subjects  Nabokov dares where few have  and makes us think while our emotions are churning  Even as we see Lolita s unhappiness and Humbert s coercion  Nabokov charms us while breaking taboos and forcing us outside our comfortable and cultural confines  Humbert regrets his actions even while exulting in them  and rarely thinks of Lolita s needs  until the end when he finally puts her life above his own  In this book  one is pushed into holding two conflicting ideas simultaneously  let the cognitive dissonance begin  Although the writing is beautiful  the vocabulary is periodically challenging  learned some new words with nowhere to use them  and there are numerous lines in French    for those who don t read French the choice is to stop and Google or ignore them and keep on reading  And is there some level at which Lolita is gauche  immature new world America  being molested by erudite  decadent old world Europe personified by Humbert  See  Nabokov in America  by Robert Roper for Nabokov s impressions of America while traveling the country   this is the most beautifully written book if you like metaphors  similes and verbal arabesques astrewn in your literature nabokov has a writing virtuosity like no other  you forgive him for his showing off because what he shows off is so freakin brilliant subject matter  more or less pedophilia  plotline  reaches a climax and then just goes on forever it seems in boredom  though I guess that s part of the character development or rather  it is intentional  Lolita  while not being an erotic novel  is perhaps the greatest novel ever written  at least my favorite to this point  The erotic motifs in the novel help to explain the dreamlike state of mind Humbert finds himself in  While his greatest wish  even while it happens  is to be pleased sexually by Dolores  However the lack of explicit sexual details in lieu of vivid physical descriptions and desires and the mental plight of a deranged man  this is what this explores  An involved reader  knowing Lolita s fate  almost looks for the sexual acts to be described with any lick of detail  whether for the purpose of further persecution of Humbert or whatever it may be  However this is not what the novel is about  the extreme detail used in the book coupled with the fact that Humbert chooses not to graphically explore sex  The book is about the mental persecution felt by one man  And representative of many men  the horrible act of pedophilia stands as the greatest terror man can commit  And based on this  Nabokov wants by no means to excuse Humbert s acts  but to explain the mind and fear of the man who feels guilty despite his vice  Given the fact that we as human feel guilt and doubt  Nabokov explores the fear and our sicknesses  Humbert represents the human condition of needing to justify what one does  he does so by attracting sympathy and writing with a style of an intelligent man  and shows the humanity behind a beastly action   Strange  perverse  challenging  narratively innovative  humorous and tragic all at the same time   Most humane book about cruelty  My personal favorite  When I first read this I thought it was the best use of the English language I had ever read  I thought it was genius  On reflection I can t decide if it is more brilliant or less brilliant than my original impression  But  I m sticking with  best use of the English language I ve ever read   trying to read it through kindle on my droid x  methinks i would like a paper copy Finished in eight days  Quite frankily I loved it and the last sent ence made my heart ache  I will put this away to let my mind settle  Then  later  onto that special annotated edition I ve had my eye on    Amazing novel  read it for the second time and loved it again Nabokov s language is amazing  I really love his style and his choice of words  it really is a pleasure to read Though the subject of the novel is in fact rather unpleasant  I can t help but appreciate the skill of the author  The story itself is built up very well and is really gripping  The interaction between Humbert and Lolita is very lifelike and realistic  painting a harsh picture of a very sick relationship  where dependence turns into something aweful and diseased One thing that makes the book interesting for me is the fact that it is entirely written as a diary  from Humbert s perspective  It leaves you very much in doubt as to what really happened  Humbert s view is subjective and might not be entirely reliable  It s intriguing to think of how the other characters really would have felt  what they were thinking and why they acted the way they did A novel that really makes you think and keeps your thoughts occupied  even after you ve finished it  My  1 favorite classic  banned  book  I could read it again and again  Don t ask me why  but maybe because they re both to blame for the unhappy downward spiral of chaos they end up in  Just because someone is young doesn t mean they can t be toxic and volatile  And just because someone s old doesn t mean they can t be naively innocent and vulnerable   pretty much my most favoritest ever book ever ever  i got lost in nabokov s luscious use of language  i read this at a pivotal time where i needed to know that humans were capable of creating such breathtaking pieces of art  it worked for me  despite all the hoopla about man girl obsession  it was this very depth of humbert humbert s obsession that i found so honest and compelling   A spectacular book  Nabokov outshines himself with his use of language and writing style for Lolita and creating a book that captivates the reader  I was astonished at how I would be agreeing with Humbert Humbert  even though he is a pedophile  It s amazing what Nabokov has done  This is a great book to question the way you think  I think this a book you need to read at least once  It s a very beautiful book  Nabokov writes in a way that allows you to sympathize with both Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze  His descriptions are so vivid  the accounting of every event so detailed  that it was almost as if you were actually with the duo during their adventures together Lolita was  all in all  such an amazing work  one of the best I ve ever read really  I will definitely read more from Nabokov  One of my favorite books  I read it again and again and again  Nao sao muitos os livros que me deixam saudosa no virar da ultima pagina  e ainda menos os que me dao vontade de voltar ao inicio e ler tudo outra vez  Lolita  apanhou me desprevenida  Pouco impressionada com as adaptacoes cinematograficas  fui seduzida logo na primeira frase  nao e a toa que figura numa lista das melhores frases iniciais de romances Nesta leitura tudo nos remete para a palavra seducao  nao e so a seducao de Humbert sobre Lolita  ou da ninfeta sobre o seu papa  e sobretudo a seducao da escrita  paginas de poesia  de escrita exuberante e bela  rica em jogos de palavras  quebra cabecas  duplos sentidos  recursos estilisticos e inumeras referencias que vale a pena pesquisar  Eu  confesso  deixei escapar muitas  eram tantas que acabei por focar me nas que diziam respeito ao meu poema de culto Annabelle Lee de Poe ou a mi preciosa Carmencita   porque ambos me fascinam  e pelas circunstancias tragicas que envolvem estas tres historias Para mim o grande trunfo desta obra e a audacia de desafiar o leitor a entrar num tema tabu sem tecer consideracoes morais  Humbert narra a sua historia com tamanha emocao e sensualidade  demonstra tal amor e ternura   ou sera apenas desejo e depravacao    por Lolita  que nos poe a oscilar entre sentimentos antagonicos  Ficamos divididos entre um deslumbrante manipulador que subtrai a infancia de uma miuda  e uma miuda que a sua maneira  tambem e um pouco manipuladora  embora esteja subjugada e controlada  tambem ela seduz  provoca  e aproveita se da fraqueza dele para negociar abracos ou caricias em troca dos seus caprichos  Um jogo de enganos  promessas  concessoes onde fica dificil saber quem e o maior culpado e o mais enganado  Por todos os motivos era uma relacao fadada ao fracasso  por mais doces que sejam as palavras de Humbert  e ainda que fosse correspondido  o seu amor era um amor social e moralmente condenavel  nunca sairiam desse ciclo vicioso de culpa  perseguicao  fuga e mutuo sofrimento   E mantenho serias duvidas perante o uso e respectivo sentido da palavra  amor neste contexto   Amava te  Era um monstro  mas amava te  Era desprezivel e brutal  era torpe  era tudo  mais je t aimes  je t aimes  5 estrelas e pouco para este livro  o Goodreas devia ter uma mencao honrosa para atribuir aos livros extraordinariamente bem escritos  After hearing much dismay and controversy over this book  I instantly knew I had to read it  On Saturdays as a 9th grader  I d steal away to my local Barnes and Noble to pore over its pages  putting it nonchalantly back on the shelf every time someone would pass  I love books that others think I shouldn t or can t read  whether it be due to dryness  Yes  I do enjoy Faulkner   or graphic content  I got in huge trouble in fourth grade for reading The Catcher in the Rye   Eventually  I knew I had to read it in full  Finally I discovered it merely sitting amongst my mom s Joyce Carol Oates and my dad s Bruce Mau and stole it away to read fervently  Though I was entirely enthralled in its pages  I felt very conscious reading it  In Chemistry class  I was almost busted  Yet  something about it completely sucked me in  Perhaps it was knowing that it was taboo  but I d probably hedge a bet that it was more about Nabokov s skillful word craft  I was utterly amazed by his language   it was at once flowery and beautiful and repulsive and violent  The use of language in this book is lauded as remarkable  and I was certainly experiencing that firsthand  Some books use language to obstruct their point  the endless adjectives and cluttered prose seems clunky and distracting  But this was NOT the case with Lolita  The language seemed to make Humbert s obsession and psychological oddity startlingly clear  As a fan of literature that accomplishes multiple things  I must mention that it painted a hauntingly fascinating picture of Eisenhower America  motels  picket fences  ivy covered brick schools and  of course  fawn like 12 year old objects of lust  And as with all controversial books  I found myself addicted to this read  I tend to be a big fan of works like this  not everyone enjoys the starkness of the content that they present  or some literary snobs may find them too  sensational  in a way  in other words  too interesting to be truly a work of literary merit   From a psychological aspect  I was transfixed by Humbert s character   the lack of guilt  but the careful obsession and deliberation  The scenes that he recounted all seemed very surreal to me  as if I was imagining the book through a foggy  dreamlike lens  Indeed  I was hypnotized by the way this book presented its world  I would write that I d recommend this  but in reality  I do not recommend it  because it would be pretty embarrassing to admit I enjoyed it and be ridiculed by someone who hated it  there are plenty of those   I revisit its pages occasionally  attempting to relive the excited rush of catching a paragraph or two in the bookstore aisles  If I could I would rate Lolita an infinite amount of stars  I LOVED this book  I couldn t put it down  and when i did all I could think about was opening it again  In the beginning of the book when Humbert is describing what a nymphet is and how he spent his years in Europe  I initially fell in love with Nabokov s writing style  It is complex when it means to get a simple point across  which I sadistically enjoyed  Because Lolita was written in the viewpoint of Humbert  I think this is what contributed to my identifying with him  Even though he is plainly a child molester  when he describes how he is attracted to only a certain kind of girl I find myself believing him  I was distraught at the ending because Humbert was crushed  As I said earlier I knew what went on in his mind and the book was written to make the reader feel what Humbert feels  so the ending nearly had me in tears  Overall I enjoyed Lolita tremendously and I recommend it to whoever can get past thinking  this guy touches children  during the whole book  because if you can then you can appreciate it for how it is written and how beautiful the story is   Truly an amazing book  Before reading it  I had a narrow minded view simply based on snippets of the plot I d heard over the years  I m glad I actually swallowed my pride and read it  Lolita is truly an amazing story  showing a mastery of the English language I ve never seen before and am not sure I ll ever see again  Nabokov crafted what I can only call a masterpiece  Seriously  give it a read  you won t regret it  If books were drinks  Lolita would be a fine red wine  If I hadn t known any better  I would have said that certainly English is Nabokov s first language because his writing is so beautiful  He paints pictures with his words with deft skill and perfect details  The story and characters easily pull you into Nabokov s world of Lolita  This is definitely a book that everyone should read at least once in their lives  The Audible version of this  read by Jeremy Irons  is terrific  I think this is the first Audible book I have listened to at normal speed  Typically I listen to Audible books at 1 25x  1 5x  and in the case of easy  fun histories  2 0x speed  This is one to be savored  A grotesque  hilarious masterpiece  I giggled and snorted my way through every delicious  horrifying sentence of it  Such dazzling language and wit  Such expertly rendered self delusion  I can t wait to read it again  I never want to read it again  Exquisite  Vladimir Nabokov combines perfectly vulgarity with elegance  he s ironic and satiric and has a lot of important messages to give to society  not precisely about morality  but about the femenine role in society  are we  women  only objects of desire and our lives have to be dedicated to home and children  It s completely unfair and he tries to emphasize this  He s a strong and explicit author  but not in a bad way these characteristics help him express better  with a lot of freedom that other authors lack because they believe in morality  Brilliant book  The most thought provoking book I have ever read  As disturbing as this book is for its content I found the wordplay  language and flow to be incredible  Through this the truth trickles out in Humbert s deceitful narration and his attempts to justify what he has done  I d give this ten stars if I could  Thanks Jared for the recommendation  Guy knows his literature  I feel I will never again read a novel so complex and full of delightful literary surprises as the one Mr  Nabokov nearly burned on numerous occasions  I have never in my life made so many margin notes as I did while reading a novel  Between his elegantly ideal prose style and mind warping word games  this book is so much more than letters on a page  If you intend to read it  having placed it on your  to read  list  I strongly suggest you pick it up right away because its  delights could easily improve your life  Whether or not this is a moral book seems irrelevant to me  as it is so many other glorious things instead  I will be reading it again I am sure   This book is written so beautifully  It s a challenging read but I loved it  When Humbert was describing all the scenery and his travels with Lolita in part two it was pretty long but it didn t take away from the enjoyment of the story  The ending was perfect  The language is sophisticated and it s easy to overlook the disturbing aspects of Humbert at certain times in the books  Did not regret reading this  Loved  Absolutely loved  Author again proves that anything  absolutely anything is fodder for a novel  All that is needed is the correct or appropriate treatment  Perspective  the  ladies and gents of the jury  point of view  helps to fling aside much judgment on the part of the reader  Also  the fidelity Humbert has for his nymphet  Yet he never lets himself off the hook  He knows it s wrong to let a child corrupt him  as he tells it   but he does allow it to happen  Encourages it  Plans it  Laughed the hardest when Humbert approaches Lolita for one of the last times  The perspective is between her legs  and she says   Pulease leave me alone  will you       for Christ s sake leave me alone   192 3   Sent me into hysterics for five minutes only because       I ve been there       and not as Humbert  Laughed until I cried  It s funny  not funny but surprising  how people react to the mere mention of the word  Lolita   I told a friend I was reading it and the first thing she mentioned was  You know Lolita was a prostitute  right   She hadn t read the book  but that was the concept she had from it  And then she went on to tell me how disgusted she was that he was a pedophile and so on and so on  But I believe we forget that there are all sorts of humans in this world  and we forget that our mind is a whole wide universe living inside ourselves  and we ll never fully comprehend it s abilities and decisions  and that  to tell those stories  is the sole reason why there are writers and why we read  By no means do I want to justify or defend H H  s actions  just say that I understand the reasons why Vlad wrote this book  The thing is the book is not only about Humbert it s about Lolita and that is exemplified in the last chapters of the book  How Lolita behaved and in the end  how she ended up living  It s about roads and their inevitable end  About mental diseases  about life   I always marvel at the stylistic way writers create their masterpieces and I marveled even more with Vladimir s writing  Poetic and delicious   Vladimir  wherever you are  would you consider me selling some part of my soul for a little bit of your writing abilities  If so  contact me  I m available 24 7       In so many ways  this book is perfect  The writing is distinct and beautiful  it s complex but never overwhelming  it s consistent and emotionally resonant  Be careful when you read this book  The subject matter is incredibly disturbing  and yet the writing draws you in  It ll leave you shaken and a little sick  You ll spend a lot more time than you had planned to thinking about it later  I didn t want anyone reading over my shoulder as I was reading Lolita on the New York subway thinking the looker would be shocked and think I was a sinful guy as I screamed down the tracks that it was a fictional experience of a genius  I even thought on reaching my apartment that I had to rush to its finish in my clothes closet away from all judgments of my love filled find of outstanding writing that could excite my senses so and lead me by the nose like it did  I was totally captivated by the story line and at the finish I reread it again  then I started to read Nabokov s short stories each one a tiny jewel specially one called  The Dragon  showing the author s comedy side  to be read to children  For some days now I ve been listening to this incredible audio version of Lolita in my car And   as strange as it sounds with this kind of a book   it is an incredible indulgence  Someone wrote that Jeremy Irons here is Humbert Humbert  reading this even more  than in the movie  his voice is just   The book itself was described as being disgustingly brilliant and that I second wholeheartedly  But what else to expect from Vladimir Nabokov  There s not much else I can say that hasn t been said about this book  All of the wonderful things readers have said about the language  the sentences  the wordplay   it s all true  On that level   Lolita  probably can t be topped What I rarely see when readers talk write about this book  however  is an account of how utterly depressing and sad the thing is   Some squeamish readers note that it s disturbing   they re right  of course   but I m talking about something separate from that   Nabokov is very clever to seduce us with his gorgeous language and droll narrator  but the humor of the novel   and it is funny  very funny   is so crisp only because the bright lights of the jokes are pitted against such a very dark background  that s not a complaint  mind you   Humbert  and certain readers  frequently suggest that it was Lo who seduced him  a common enough victim blaming tactic that I m sure we re all familiar with  but even our pederast narrator comes to understand the wreckage his putrid desire has caused  Lo s life is terrible  through and through   her mother hates her  her stepfather rapes her  and just as she has escaped an adolescence made entirely of sexual abuse  well  read John Ray s introduction carefully   and even as we readers swoon over Humbert s  fancy prose style   Nabokov never lets us forget the drudgery that her life has become  I don t mean to generalize  but some readers seem to miss this   Alfred Appel  in his annotations   notes that the book was a best seller primarily because people assumed it would be erotic   and I think it s an enormously important aspect of the book  Humbert s language is powerful enough to distract readers from the execrable things he does   but the truth of the matter  the pain he causes  is certainly there to be found There s far more going on in this novel than a sad book about a raped adolescent  but again   it s well trod ground  There is a reason this book is so well respected and revered  because it s great  I read  The Annotated Lolita   which includes a  very high  number of endnotes  as well as a lengthy introduction and various other marginalia  I cannot recommend this  The introduction is essentially a longish biography of Nabokov s life and work  which is fine  but seems primarily concerned with establishing that the annotator and author were friends   Hey  hey   I knew this guy  He was my teacher   But fine  I m really here for the notes  And while I was happy to have a handful of two dollar and made up words glossed  and very much appreciated having all of the French translated  most of the notes are entirely superfluous and intrusive on the appreciation of the book  Appel uses his notes to lend authority to his specific reading of the novel  which includes blurting out scenes to come that might have added to a reader s enjoyment of the book had she not known they were coming  Now  sure  this is meant for the student of  Lolita   not the casual reader   I understand that  But even so  the notes are cloying and self obsessed  and create links among scenes that are interpretive  not strictly factual  Appel also seems to miss the boat as far as the  Pale Fire  quote that he excerpts  because his obsession with and annotations of Nabokov s work is strikingly similar to the disturbing and hilarious mockery of academia that Nabokov performed in his other masterwork  While useful  I wouldn t recommend starting with this version of the novel  and be very sparing in your use of the endnotes if you do  The most beautifully written book I ve ever read  Grim  Very  very grim  this is not a love story   if we believe there is an ideal person  we might want to decide that is someone who has mature relationship to his desires  his self  his others  his place in the world  his religious or philosophical positions  we might believe that an ideal person grows from an ideal childhood  we might decide that is one in which children are not viewed as objects of adult sexual desire  but rather subject to their own and peer desires which may not be sexual  we might assert that creating such safe environment for children is an adult responsibility now  as far as the book lolita  i do not advocate censorship but willingly champion moral critique  to be moral  to be good  is perhaps accepting and creating such responsible and safe environment  and this need not be entirely physical but also by openly claiming what is and what is not the ideal way in which ideal people interact of course  we are not ideal  we are human  as humans we will often disagree with each other but  ideally  we are able to understand each other and agree what is and what is not the good  i do not advocate censorship  i do not agree with relativism  but i will not say i know better than anyone else  i do not believe lolita the book is a love story  no matter whose blurb claims that i think we need to remember some real world distinctions when reading this book remember this  pedophiles typically groom  that is  seduce  his  or  rarely  her  prey from a position of trust  as adults who are in some way responsible for and trusted by  the child  this trust is betrayed remember this  a pedophile knows what he does is wrong  and will try to lessen culpability in many ways  including but not limited to  acts  talk  appearance  of the victim  hh is simply the intellectual who finds or misinterprets as many arguments as he can  to cast his acts in relativistic clothing remember this  this is rape  this is not seduction  this is not love  this is not a game played by children with children  this is a pedophile who plans and commits and continues through kidnapping  the rape of a child remember this  lolita is a child  lolita is a sexualized child  whose tastes  desires  mind are all severely unattractive to hh  she is  however  a child  any child should have trust  caring  responsible adults who protect and do no harm to them  instead  hh encourages her to become a private prostitute  lolita is a child remember this  this is not love  in ideal love  each partner has only the best hopes for the other  in usual love  this fluctuates as one then the other take turns at being giver and given  in this case  love is a mistaken term hh uses as final excuse for his acts  but love is not words but acts  in no way does he act for her  hope for her  love her remember this  hh is the adult  it does not matter if lolita is already sexualized  already active  as hh claims  lolita does not seduce  lolita is a child  hh is required to be an adult and refuse any suggestions remember this  hh is a pedophile  hh is not nabokov  lolita the book is not a piece of child love propaganda  lolita the book is what he will be most remembered for  first suggestion of how sexualized little girls can be  this is now tamed term used entirely without irony in many cases where there is a great gap in ages between man and woman  this is not a problem if both are adults  this is not love if that is not so remember this  pedophiles typically groom  a pedophile knows what he does is wrong  this is rape  lolita is a child  this is not love  hh is the adult  hh is a pedophile remember  every critique must remember this is a novel  and this is a novel about human  too human  abuse of trust  and if the word seems moralizing  i am unable to find another  evil nabokov is definitely a skilled stylist  beautiful writer  but the key is how he deploys these skills to distract and in attempt to ally the reader to a pedophile  i disagree that the fact hh is a pedophile is merely accidental to the meaning  the power  the nature of this portrayal of misnamed  love   i suggest readers are particularly affected by the representation through the plot  of a sympathetic  educated  charming  first person narrator  who is a pedophile  this is not an abstract painting  which has no immediate relationship to a given human situation  nor is this a work of music without political content  this is effective work because there is depiction of a reality of too many sexually abused children and there is no escape from the voice of the perpetrator claiming extenuating circumstance  claiming excuses  claiming  love   intellect is no guarantee of moral stance  though we might like to imagine this hh is a pedophile  hh is only ever acting for his own desires  hh is inexcusable  hh is an effective narrator  lolita the book is not less but more a masterpiece that nabokov can create this voice which seems to attract the readers  which is so human  and human so evil so I up the rating  mostly in response to how others on GR read it  am not now worried that five stars somehow validates hh  recognize instead the satire  the Unreliability of hh  even as it was read many years ago  is not now reread  but the arguments for me have only immediate emotional resonance  do not want to watch murder happening  no matter that I eat meat  have been thinking my appreciation of any work of art is more How than What  that is How the story is told is What the story is told  this is an awkward review  I hate the What intensely  can I really separate it from the How    I will try http   www michaelkamakana com uncate    The style of writing that Nabokov employs is both fantastic and frightening  now and then you are almost swayed by his characters manipulative voice  You are torn between utter revulsion on disgusted sympathy for the character despite his horrific world view and acts  Of course  in the end  it is Dolores that we feel for  as we should  because even the simplest of parental acts  bonds are ruined for her This book is a testament to Nabokovs skill and a monument to the frightening intelligence and viciousness of the human monsters in the world  This is one of the great books ever written in any language  Speaking of language  a major element of this novel is Nabokov s ability to use language in order to manipulate  Humbert Humbert is not a monster despite the fact that he is a pedophile  Manipulation of language was something Nabokov was thinking about  especially after the fascist movements in Europe wreaked their havoc   One of the most beautifully written novels I have ever read  An incredibly thought provoking and disturbingly insightful novel that I feel inferior to review as it is such a treasured classic with so much depth and ambiguity  I ll keep this review short and simple   very moving and changing  I look forward to re reading it in the near future  hopefully next time understanding more references and tackling all that french   His narrator is a monster  and Nabokov makes you laugh with him  A masterwork of humor  allusion  storytelling and style  goodreads does not seem to differentiate between just the novel  which I read in 2001  and the annotated version  which we used in a class I took in 2004  This bothers me  I am neurotic about these things   Por muy creepy que pudo llegar a ser este libro la narracion fue genial y los plot twists mejores aun  Es muy facil meterte en la historia  y ya cuando te das cuenta vas terminando el libro   I was very young when I read it  About the age of hers  I remember feeling awful for him  The way he wanted her so bad and didn t have her  Even when he did  He would never have her the way he wanted to  Weird feeling  I remember turning the light back on at night to keep reading  It can t be nothing else but a classic if the thirteen year old girl I was could so perfectly identify with the old perv  of a character he was  I m only halfway through this book and it s not difficult to imagine why this book was banned  It is a dangerously well written book that takes its reader into the mind of a criminal  much like Dostoyevsky s Crime and Punishment  except on a much more deplorable level  The sensuous narrative is so beautifully presented that a careless reader may be seduced  lulled into Humbert s fantastically romantic pursuit of his Lolita   but never for long   before waking up and realizing that the object of his affections is indeed a 12 year old girl  Privy to the  relentless   lustful consciousness of a pedophile  reality  seduction  and fantasy join together such that the reader is ensconced in the dark recesses of Humbert s moral depravity  As Pf  Amy Hungerford notes  Humbert appeals to us  the readers  to not judge him morally  He does so by presenting facets of his past  first young  unrequited love and later marriage where his wife left him for another man   using tortuously slow pursuit to mask his dark desires and establish that he is not a rapist  cad  or animal  and historical contexts to illustrate bygone  erstwhile socially accepted relationships between adult and child  Humbert continually rationalizes his amorality and the reader who believes him is seduced in the same way Lolita is   away from moral righteousness and self preservation This book will evoke strong emotions from its reader  It is a completely compelling yet horrific read  I do think I ve lost a bit of my innocence after reading this  but it is a worthwhile read  Not difficult to understand why this novel stands the test of time    Era Lo  sencillamente Lo  por la manana  cuando estaba derecha  con su metro cuarenta y ocho de estatura  sobre un pie enfundado en un calcetin  Era Lola cuando llevaba puestos los pantalones  Era Dolly en la escuela  Era Dolores cuando firmaba  Pero en mis brazos fue siempre Lolita  http   media tumblr com tumblr_mbp2lm   Le daria 100 estrellas pero no se puede   This writer seduces the reader like Humbert seduces Lolita  I found my head questioning my feelings as I read this book  Why am I sympathetic towards this pedophile  Then my feelings would shift to contempt towards him  The next moment I would be angry with Lolita forgetting she is the victim and a youth  Rmotionally manipulative  this a novel all readers should experience  You do not read this book  you experience it    Here s your well earned five stars  Nabokov  Lolita really has the right blend of style and story and was very much worth the second read  I kind of wish I had the annotated version now though  Humbert Humbert likes his French  There probably isn t anything left to say about this book  But it s  undoubtedly reiterated  beautiful and funny and twisted and perfect  Lo  Lee  Ta  One of my favorites  if not all time favorite  Sexy  racy  and profane without profanity  explicit sex  or violence  Love   really a true love story  And unbearably sad when you let it be  It s my second reading of the novel  When I first read it  I was about 13  At the time  I didn t really pay attention to the words in front of me  I didn t care about the message  I read it like one reads a shampoo label while taking a shower  This time  though  it was different  We all know what this book is about  We all know how powerful the story is  We all know how beautiful Nabokov s prose and words are  Vladimir was brilliant  spectacular  marvelous  We all know that  With that being said  I can t bear the man who narrates Lolita  I hate Humbert  I don t care if he s handsome  sophisticated  highly amusing and blah blah blah  I don t care if he  loved  Lolita  I hate him  I highly recommend the novel  but please  don t be fooled   I was going to rate this 4 stars  and then one sentence toward the end made me cry uncontrollably  Just one sentence  5 stars for that one sentence    I ll be re reading someday   Horrible and beautiful i m not sure what to say about it  I put of reading this for years because I thought I knew what it was all about  And I did know  I suppose  but I hadn t realized the way in which Nabokov could play with language in a way that should leave most native speakers sick with envy  Kicking myself now for waiting so long   Lolita  is one of the most interesting  unusual  and oddly disturbing books I ve ever read  The plot is uncomfortable  and narrator is disgusting  and the entire tone makes you squirm  Anyone with a moral compass could read this and feel a strange itch all over them because of the subject matter  and especially a few scenes  remember that one on the couch with the apple    So  why would I ever rate it five stars Because it s a gorgeous piece of literature  Nabokov is a master  Simply one of the best  He makes this horrible set up and slimy protagonist seem strangely human  and dare I say sympathetic  However  he does it so ingeniously that we never side with Humbert  ever  He s still a pedophile  and we still hate him  but Nabokov makes him so realistic and so driven that the reader becomes torn  The character of Quilty is even more despicable  in my opinion  At least Humbert had some regret at the end  but Quilty  None whatsoever  Even the character of Lolita gives you love hate feelings  On one hand  she s spoiled and somewhat obnoxious  but then again  she s a pre teen who is being abused by her stepfather  so that s a very valid reason for being that way  There are actually very few other main characters  save Charlotte  who s not likable either  In fact  I ve never read a book where I disliked the characters this much  but loved the final product  Another note is that it s not graphically sexual  It leaves a lot up to the imagination  and thank goodness  because I would not want to read about Humbert and Lolita s relationship in detail Final verdict is that despite the subject matter  plot  and even some of the characters   Lolita  is true art  and is worth reading for any literature fan  I just wouldn t recommend reading it on the subway during your commute  It wouldn t get you kind glances  Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov So gymnastically lyrical  So damningly heartfelt  So horribly dirty  So  so good  I happen to agree one hundred percent Nabokov is such a skilled and wonderful writer  There s no confusion whatsoever about pedophilia being wrong  Not just wrong but bad  illegal  immoral  unethical and so on and so forth  So if you were to look at the book from that POV only then yes  it s a horribly dirty story about a 37 year old man taking advantage of a 12 year old girl However  if you can accept this for what it is  a literary work and not an incentive to pedophilia  then you can sit back and enjoy Nabokov s amazing talent as an author and wordsmith There s never a descriptive scene of what happens between Humbert and Lolita  yet filling in the blanks yourself makes it that much dirtier  And no matter how terrible the subject of this book is  there s a constant question you ll ask yourself through it all  is it love or an obsession  You ll even end up questioning Lolitas  part in everything  especially once she manages to  view spoiler  leave Humbert  hide spoiler   I m sure there are more eloquent reviews out there that you can read for a better understanding or incentive to read this book  but don t pass it up just because the subject might make you uncomfortable  It is indeed a literary masterpiece  What a brilliant book  Nabokov effortlessly flits from English to French  German  Spanish  Latin  and others as he weaves a delightfully deadly game of cat s cradle made papery flesh  From the book s reputation  I expected it to be a lot more explicit than it actually was  The periphrastic nature of everything  with allusions thick and honey languid  was even more unsettling  Every page is permeated with equal wonder and dread I don t remember when I started this  but it took me forever since I dove into the extremely helpful annotations with great gusto  I loved this book  Don t know if I will or can read it again  but I m honored to have it on my shelf  I get the feeling that if I were to possess the patience and vigor to read several of the reviews for Lolita on this page  and then compare them to others written by the same subjects  I would observe that these have a markedly different writing style  If this is indeed the rule  mine is certainly no exception  this book was so damn good  i read it in a month because I took my time   to understend it   to feel it  vladimir makes art   sparkles   love happen  magic happens sometimes  i guess  this book is magic  those words  those thoughts  humbert humber is a hero  is a sick man but madness is the way   you know  he is mad   but at least he s different  he s a genie  loved this book  hard but good  LIGHT OF MY LUMBS FIRE OF MY LOINS   MY SIN   MY SOUL   LOLITA  Most well written story of all time  Loved it  Nga la dat nuoc cua nhung cay dai thu  Mot ban dich xuat sac cho mot tac pham khien moi nguoi dich phai e so  Listened to it on tape while driving cross country  Um    How would you feel if I told you I thought it was incredibly hot And  of course  distressing  And very well written  Beautiful descriptive passages The more I think about Lolita the more I am convinced of its importance to Western literature  I read this for the first time freshman year  At the time  I was caught up in the curious habit of compulsively looking up and writing the definitions of words I didn t know  Nabokov s vocabulary was so rich and intense that I was put into a panic from the first few pages of Lolita   the word  midges   I remember  gave me particular trouble Nonetheless  I loved it  Before rereading it  I don t know how much I d be able to talk about the book   I feel like I spent most of the time explaining my love for it by describing the plot and saying   But it s not like that  No  it s not like an ode to pedophilia  I swear the writing s beautiful  And it really is  Reading it now is so much better  because I know more of the words and the literary references and understand the French  Nabokov s wordplay is divine  his writing rolls and glides in the most graceful way I ve ever encountered  and gives me hope for writing in a non native language   and makes me deeply curious about the glory that his Russian language prose must be It s true  I find the end less enthralling than the beginning  but then  how could anything match those hot immortal first lines   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  My favorite   My next bullet caught him somewhere in the side  and he rose from his chair higher and higher  like old  gray  mad Nijinski  like Old Faithful  like some old nightmare of mine  to a phenomenal altitude  or so it seemed  as he rent the air still shaking with the rich black music head thrown back in a howl  hand pressed to his brow  and with his other hand clutching his armpit as if stung by a hornet  down he came on his heels and  again a normal robed man  scurried out into the hall   It rushes up on the reader like a recreational drug more powerful than any yet discovered or devised  In common with its narrator  it is both irresistible and unforgivable   Martin Amis As the parent of a teen age daughter  my initial knee jerk reaction was to find  Lolita  creepy but as I kept reading I found it at turns  funny  sad  insightful  illuminating and perplexing   I also found that I need to brush up on my French  Ultimately   Lolita  was like nothing I ve read before   I ve never enountered that voice  that way of seeing the world  that erudite and witty brand of madness  Not long into the novel  I knew the protagonist was crazy   who in his right mind would take a cross country road trip  twice   with a teenage girl   Been there  done that   But what took me by surprise was my growing awareness of the poignancy of this pedophile s predicament and my growing sympathy for him  Poor besotted Humbert  getting the inevitable cold shoulder from his nymphet  Poor twisted HH  watching his Lo s inevitable transformation from glorious  or glorified  nymphet to ordinary woman  Best of luck to his psychiatrist  And her s  I will start by saying that this is one of my favourite books ever  Nabokov s writing style is absolutely beautiful  innovative  poetic and a true masterpiece by itself  Then it is combined with a beautifully crafted story  This creates something that you can only really understand if you read it  The characters are incredibly well developed  we truly feel like we re getting to know someone  all the nuances of their personality  This is done in such a way that their reactions create in the reader visceral reactions  for example  with Humbert there were moments when I felt truly disgusted by his attitudes  the way he looked at what was a child but also the source of his desires and compulsion at other times you feel like Humbert is so completely disposed of his dignity  self respect that you feel bad for him until you remember what he does  what he wants to do  This covers the extremely complex spectrum of human emotions  all of us have layers  good and bad things and this is exactly what Nabokov makes you feel  Lolita herself  a young girl can make you feel sorry for the situation she was put in by someone who should take care of her but she can also be very irritating and get under your skin  Lolita  is almost like divided in three acts  first when Humbert tells us his story  how he feels he developed his obsession with  nymphetes  and then he meets Lolita and how soon after he becomes completely obsessed  then he fulfills his fantasies with the young girl and this obviously leads to an aftermath  Humbert is convinced he fell in love with Dolores  Lolita  Haze but the way I see it he is simply obsessed with her  the closest he comes to loving Lolita only happens when he realises all he has deprived her off by taking her childhood  forcing her to play his games  Lolita  on the other hand  was put in a situation no child should ever be put in  this lead to the way her life developed  Truly a masterpiece  would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a literary work by itself  without prejudice    Lolita had me lost and confused and angry and agitated  I felt ambivalent  It made me question what I thought was love and whether his love was really love or Lolita s love for him really love and basically my head was swimming  The book itself was beautifully written and it was hard to get through some of the really cringe worthy material which was written from the POV of a pedophile  But that was that  I really enjoyed the experience  the completely unfiltered complex view through the eyes of someone so unlike myself  Because you took advantge of a sinner because you took advantagebecasue you tookbecause you took advantagewhen I stood adam nakedbefore a federal law and all its stinging stars      Sigh    this is what great literature is about  Although the above poem is actually a poem from the novel I felt like Vladimir wrote Lolita like a poem   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  My Soul  Lo Lee Ta the tip of a toungue taking a trip of three steps down the palate tap  at three on the teeth  Lo Lee Ta   This said from a pedophile about his child nympo  Only a talented writer could write about pedophilia in such a way that the reader sees Humbert Humbert as the victim and sympathizes for him even though he is a pedohile  We the readers almost want to root for him and scream that  its not his fault he is this way   and yet see him as someone who is decieving himself  as someone who needed to make the true victim the victimizer  as someone who is truly disturbed and as someone who still causes unease  I pitied him  he had unwaranted sexual desires for a child who reminds him if his first young unconsumated love   I hated him  he didnt feel remorse and didnt resist  he brided a child for sexaul favors   And the pendulum swang  Oh Vladimir belissimo  This novel is recommended to anyone who wants to experience literary deception The little things  the book begins and ends with the name lolita Humbert literally dies of coronary thrombosis which in essence suppose to mean he literally dies of a broken heart Lolita is beautiful  charming  lyrical  It pirouettes and gambols across the United States    a road trip of ennui infused with the perverse desire of Humbert Humbert for his 13 year old love  The book is magical in expressing his self loathing and his powerful lust  at once disturbing and intoxicating  I started this book years ago for a contemporary American Lit course at university  but I didn t finish it  This time  I could not help but finish it  At various points  I felt dirty just for continuing  but compelled like the narrator  to carry on  It amounts to an awesome literary achievement  I have always enjoyed a good pun  but it s becoming increasingly difficult to come across intelligent ones these days  in lieu of the mediocre and insular  I only mention this because Lolita is riddled with them  right down to the titular nymphet s dolorous haze  One could say that Nabokov was a pundit in the most honest sense of the word The story made me quite uncomfortable throughout  but that should really be no surprise if you are aware of the subject matter  I think that the protagonist is largely to be blamed for this  Not only did Nabokov paint a believable picture of a pedophile   leading me to the conclusion that he either held astute insights in psychology or that this portrait came from personal thoughts   but he also made him likeable  Well  let s just say that he was likeable for the first half of the novel anyway I most definitely will recommend Lolita to anyone who can get past the ugliness in premise and plot  What awaits them is a touchstone of modern literature  I only hope I can produce something at least half as good in my lifetime  One of the best written books I have ever read  Should I feel weird or demented to say that I understood the man s love for a 12 year old  Exactly  I really liked this book  even though this was an example of pedophilia  it wasn t written in a sick manner  It really was written to highlight the mental instability of the main character rather than digging into sexual details  He was truly in love  but in a way that is typical of someone whose boundaries have blurred   Interesting and funny I m doing a rhetorical   narrative analysis on this novel  However upsetting the subject this novel is  it is one of the most well written I ve ever read  Simply amazing  The unreliability of the implied author and the steady stream of arguments and incoherent opinions make it a maze of ethic shallows to navigate  If you re reading this I would also recommend having a look at Amit Marcus article  The Self deceptive and the Other deceptive Narrating Character  The case of Lolita   it helped me understand and put the novel in perspective  I read this over the summer  2009  after prompting from a friend  the writing is beautiful and startling  No one writes like that anymore  in an epic manner  spanning Humbert Humbert s existence up until and throughout his life with Lolita  But as the mother of a young girl  I found it incredibly disturbing and really needed to get to the end of it  I wish I had read it before I had my daughter  The experience probably would have been better  So many layers    two weeks after finishing Lolita  I m still thinking through some of its themes  For context  I read  Lolita  to prepare myself to read  Reading Lolita in Tehran   and I m glad I did  Though the latter only touches on  Lolita  itself  comparing the Iranian experience really highlighted some of the less obvious aspects in my initial reading  And Nabokov as a writer  Wow   Stunning  Nabokov is a master of the English language   and it s not even his first language  If you don t get what s so great about this book  do yourself a favor  read the annotated version and catch the brilliant wordplay and layering that you missed the first time because you were so disgusted by the narrative  The narrative is just one element  and a secondary element at that  I don t say this about many things  but Lolita is a true work of art  It lives up to the hype  I bought the annotated version of this as my French isn t good enough to understand the large chunks of French quotes  It s a very well written book which confounds people s expectations  you need to read Nabokov s essay  On a Book Called Lolita  to get more of an insight  It s not really an erotic novel  It s very funny and poetic but I also found it a gripping page turner   Besides the fact that this book is a timelessly relevant meditation on moral ambiguity  besides the fact that it exposes the wasteland of simulacra that America had already become by 1955  and besides the fact that it tells a love story whose lovers are even more star crossed and doomed than Romeo and Juliet  Lolita will stay with you because of the fact that Nabokov renders the English language with more precision and originality than most native writers of English  He takes our language and transforms it into his own beautifully frantic sign system that can be exasperating to read  but also rewarding and hilarious with enough patience  After the first few pages I realized how slowly and deliberately I would have to read if I wanted to get all that I could get out of Lolita  Even then  I ended up liking Humbert Humbert way more than I was supposed to  I m sure  but I don t care and neither should you    You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style  What a journey  This is certainly a very unconventional book   You ll probably feel hatred towards the protagonist  or antagonist   throughout the book  But you ll also be able to feel his emotions and sympathize with his actions  I don t approve of Humbert Humbert and his peculiar obsession  but if you can just crawl into his mind through Vladimir s brilliant writing  and believe me you will   you ll be able to  at least  appreciate his dilemma he faces throughout his life  A masterpiece indeed   Written and to be read simply for  artistic bliss   A mystery novel whose setting is the English language  Ever employing that  knight s move  to make sure that you are sufficiently content with each page of this novel apart from the whole  Metaphors that draw on colours  sounds and myriad literary influences  Do not omit the foreword from your reading and take pains to identify who exactly it is that is talking in this apparent autobiography  Also read the essay Good Reader and Good Writers by Nabokov for some idea of what exactly it is that he expects from himself and from you  Wow  I actually listened to the audio book with Jeremy Irons narrating  and it was amazing For the record  Jeremy Irons as a book narrator could possibly be the best thing to experience ever  His voice is well   you know   it s Jeremy Irons  Now for the book  Humbert Humbert is a disgusting  sad  vile  sick man  Just totally insane and obsessed and sinister  It was amazing how disgusting I found him to be  yet Nabokov wrote this book in such a way that I didn t want to stop listening  Delores  Dolly  Lo  Lolita   what an interesting character  Sometimes she s a petulant child  other times your heart just breaks for her because she s stuck with HH then other times   meh I didn t really like her all that much  I really liked this book  Hateful characters  disgusting subject matter and all   I rated this book at five stars simply because of how beautiful the prose is  I don t think I ve read any other piece of fiction that was written in such a beautiful way  even by a native english speaker  Nabokov can write the hell out of the english language  and reading this book is like reading drugs in word form  On top of that  the story itself is pretty great too  It s an interesting look inside the mind of a pedophile  but really you could change out the object of the protagonists love  or lust  with an adult  and it could reflect anyone s emotional excitement for their lover  I think that s part of the reason this book is so interesting  the inner workings of a pedophile are laid out in a way that almost makes it seem normal  But that s just the inner monologues and descriptions that come from Humbert  The way the relationship actually plays out is obviously messed up and full of conflict  This is a great read   One of the more accessible of Nabokov s novels  and a great introduction to the theme of the voyeuristic and sociopathic elements that undergird society  The thing that enrages readers is that Nabokov creates a mood where disturbing behavior somehow breaks the fourth wall and invades the reader s life  forcing difficult questions about the self  Read it to be changed  as a reader  and as an ethical being  This is not a book about a pedophile  it is a book about everything modern adult women fear to be true about adult men  and the book about the most terrible fears I ve ever had being true in the most terrible ways possible is also the most beautiful book I ve ever read  Everyone s a victim    I cried at the ending    beautiful prose  Una lectura un tanto pesada pero una historia como ninguna  La idea de un hombre de 40 anos intentando enamorar a un ninfula traviesa de 12 podria llevar a crearse prejuicios acerca del libro o del autor mismo pero creo que Nabokov logra escribir como es debido sobre uno de los temas mas interesante en el mundo  la muy variada naturaleza humana  Humbert es un personaje que probablemente despierte al psiquiatra interno que muchos llevamos dentro y Lolita    bueno que puedo decir de la ninfula a la que el juego se le salio de control Un libro que ya llevaba tiempo en mi lista y no me perdono por no haberlo leido antes    One of my all time favorites  so beautifully written   How different were her movements from those of my Lolita  when she used to visit me in her dear dirty blue jeans  smelling of orchards in nymphetland  awkward and fey  and dimly depraved  the lower buttons of her shirt unfastened  Poetry and insanity   This is one of those books you can t put down because it s so demented  I hated the main character so much but his strange delusions were captivating  It s beautifully written while being uncomfortable  sad and haunting  I love hate this book  I love the style it was written but I hate that people think like this and treat children like that  But that is the point of good literature  It makes you think and gives you a new perspective    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita   I ve read Lolita at least four times now and I get more out of it with every reading  Despite it s disturbing subject matter  it still manages to be compelling and funny  I do recommend that you don t take it along as your book when you re at your husband s family reunion   it s a little uncomfortable to describe it to your mother in law   Un Fortunately  I can t write a review about Lolita  It was really the best novel I have ever read  though I haven t read a lot  Its sly and intellectual style made me overlook the paedophiliac subject of the novel  A wonderful masterpiece written by a master of prose  Vladimir Nabokov  I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita  I hated that I loved this book so much  The story is absolutely disgusting  but oddly I was entertained the whole way through  I suppose the main reason why I loved this novel is because the narration was beautiful  The way events  emotions  interactions  etc were described  was amazing  I ve read Vladimir Nabokov s  Lolita  a few times  I read it again quite recently  It s still as disturbingly  quietly brilliant as ever  It will always be disturbing  it will always leave the reader shaken  it is meant to  But more than anything  it is a brave book  Nabokov doesn t just tip toe around this huge  very difficult subject  He hits you with it hard Paedophilia  It s a word to make you shudder  What can you say about it  other than it is the horror of a nightmare  Nabokov isn t defending paedophilia and he s not attempting to explain it  Through his protagonist Humbert Humbert  he explores the nature of the predatory  salacious psyche  and shows paedophilia up for the totally selfishly  depraved lifestyle that it is Some books  it has been seen  as with  Lady Chatterley  Lover  public taste has finally embraced Indeed  it is now hard to believe that Penguin books were actually put on trial for publishing it   Ulysses  was also considered depraved  People don t think that way now  Yes  times change  we grow up  we mature  But public taste will never embrace  Lolita   it will always be read with a shudder    Oh  no  not again  Please  leave me alone  will you  Lolita cries  as she sees Humbert sobbing lustfully  because he wants to fuck her  yet again  And this is a novel about a grown man fucking a twelve year old girl  let s not be shy  Humbert fucks Lolita relentlessly Humbert insists that he is not a monster  True  he may not look like one  I have the image of a tall  dark  intellectual  Distinguished  he s an academic  a bit of a bumbler  A debonair European  Lolita s mother  who is also Humbert s landlady  falls for him and they marry  When she dies  Humbert  who is now Lolita s stepfather  also has total control over her  It all worked out so well for him  didn t it But Humbert Humbert is a monster  Although he is our narrator  he tells things only from his point of view  He dissembles and Nabokov makes it clear to the reader that in his planned seduction of Lolita  this is a pervert planning to fulfil his lascivious desires  So let us get started  I have a difficult job before me   Humbert addresses the reader He describes the process   She was musical and apple sweet  Her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap  I stroked them  there she lolled on in the right hand corner  almost asprawl  Lola  the bobby soxer  devouring her immemorial fruit  singing through its juice  losing her slipper  rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet  against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofa  and every movement she made  every shuffle and ripple  helped me to conceal and improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty  between my gagged  bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock     Nabokov guides the reader  No matter how much Humbert dresses it up  what he wants to do is ejaculate without Lolita knowing  Humbert shields himself from how repulsively he has acted    Her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as she half turned away  and my moaning mouth  gentlemen of the jury  almost reached her bare neck  while I crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known   With the deep hot sweetness thus established and well on its way to its ultimate convulsion I felt I could slow down in order to prolong the glow      But the most perverse  shocking scene occurs later in the book  Humbert shows no contrition  just plain evil  salaciousness when he is confronted by Lolita s school teacher  The teacher tells him that Lolita is   antagonistic  dissatisfied  cagey  and  obsessed with sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet   Nabokov is using the schoolteacher as a mouthpiece to show the damage done to Lolita  Humbert sneers inwardly and goes to find Lolita at study  Here is the passage  Humbert Humbert finds her  with a sepia print of Reynolds   The Age of Innocence  above the chalkboard  and several rows of clumsy looking pupil desks  At one of these  my Lolita was reading     and there was another girl with a very naked  porcelain white neck and wonderful platinum hair  who sat in front reading too  absolutely lost to the world and interminably winding a soft curl around one finger  and I sat beside Dolly  Lolita  just behind that neck and that hair  and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixty five cents plus the permission to participate in the school play  had Dolly put her inky  chalky  red knuckled hand under the desk  Oh  stupid and reckless of me  no doubt  but after the torture I had been subjected to  I simply had to take advantage of a combination that I knew would never occur again   Lolita  is a shocking book  it is also brilliant in Nabokov s delineation of character  both of Humbert and Lolita  It is about 55 years since  Lolita  was published  But I m glad that it was published  The book was rejected by five American publishers  who feared they d be prosecuted on obscenity charges  It was first published in France by Olympia Press  which put out some serious books    and lots of pornography Nabokov didn t know that    he was just relieved that someone agreed to publish his book  And so Lolita was published in a plain green cover  in Paris  on Sept  15  1955  It was published in America three years later and was an immediate success A while ago I watched a television programme about paedophiles  They dragged out the usual brigade of psychologists  psychiatrists and criminologists  And a collection of paedophiles  They asked the usual questions  Can paedophilia be cured  Does one choose to be a paedophile  And they didn t really come up with any answers  They interviewed a few self confessed paedophiles  their responses were quite sickening  But for one man  This guy knew that he was a paedophile  always had been  always would be  But he chose not to act on it  I was impressed  Ugh I ve had people ask me before  what re your    like    favorite books    maaannn   and it always takes me a little time to think of the stuff that I ve read and what I liked out of that  but I would have no problem saying this is my new favorite book  ever  forever  on the list Holy cow  I can t even begin to say how ridiculous  and realistic  and entertaining  the story was  but the writing was amazing too  The descriptions  the word usage  whatever  though it may be obvious  English was not his native tongue  which really makes me impressed  much wow   his little passages  is it called  breaking the fourth wall  when applied to any form of art of is that strictly play lingo   addressing the reader  specifically  or pandering to our cache of cliches  or not so much  in a joking  funny sense  It took me a little longer to read  blah blah classes  laziness  yolo  than I d have liked  but man I loved this book so much  I m so glad that I picked it up  I like almost every book that I decide to read  but this one in particular really excited me  I ve rarely been simultanously completely creeped out and astounded by a book  Almost everyone knows the incredibly offensive plotline of this book  but even while you re squirming with disgust  you can t help but be swept away by that stunning wordsmithing  And that roadtrip across America just puts Kerouac to shame  In my opinion  this is the  great American novel   I ve yet to come by a greater one  or one that captures the American spirit more clearly   a riveting mix of contempt and compassion I ve noticed that many of my favorite writers in the English language did not grow up primarily speaking the language  Joseph Conrad  V S  Naipaul  Vladimir Nabokov  There s a sharpness and freshness to their prose  Maybe it s the linguist in them  This is not  as is commonly thought  a book about a young girl  a  Lolita   the name itself has absorbed this definition  who seduces a middle aged man  but a tragedy about a monster who steals a young girl s childhood and destroys her life  not only hers   Lolita begins with the most perfect opening paragraph I have yet had the pleasure to read  and I have read it many  many times  And there are so many passages of rhapsodically beautiful writing that my copies always end up fatally dog eared  That Lolita was famously censored for its subject matter seems an inevitable joke  given the subject matter   This is Nabokov s love letter to his adopted country  Humbert Humbert s disgust with the tourist courts and diners of America in the mid 20th century mirrors his lack of empathy for Lolita  the victim of his narcissistic desire Sly and wickedly funny  but a horror story  one that continues to shock even in these tawdry times  Its monstrous narrator is transformed by love  in the end  and comes finally to appreciate the enormity of his crime  no  not the murder  his real offense   And the book winds up with an ending so delicate and tender that it reaches the heights of that stunning opening  an ending so rich and subtle it may elude you on first  or second  readings   This book has certainly left an impression on me  I really loved the author s style of writing  it was like reading a really long  beautiful poem  I adored the story as well and the whole  idea  of a sultry lolita  All in all this has been firmly cemented as a favorite in my mind and can imagine reading and re reading this book over and over and over     I really loved it that much   This was not a book I expected to like to be honest  I knew the basic storyline going in  Lolita  aka Dolores  Lo and or Dolly  is a 13 year old girl who becomes the obsession of her stepfather  Humbert Humbert  and they have a tumultuous two year affair  The novel is told from Humbert s point of view and is basically the story of a pedophile  I read this book because I was curious and it felt like something I should read  However  I ended up becoming quite engrossed in the novel and thought the way it was written was fantastic  Definitely a book I would recommend and reread  let s make this review political one important thing that gets missed in almost every critical interpretation of Nabokov s Lolita is that it s not just an intellectual exercise in like  how willing are we to forgive the horrid sins of a man we adore  but much more a work that forces us to face the often ignored fact that many of our Western Cultural Heroes have acted out Lolita in real life  that  great  men such as Roman Polanski  Woody Allen  Michel Foucault  and others have all in reality either publicly supported pedophilia or literally sexualy abused minors  wasn t Allen Ginsberg a card carrying member of NAMBLA  yes  yes he was  and that despite this none of these men s names have tarnished in any way  that instead their sins have been forgiven by ignorance  have been denied out of polite realityLolita  by way of making this absolutely frightening abuse both  1  its main theme and plot and  2  completely unignorable  both in its existence  by having Humbert speak of it in detail  and its horribly damaging effect  from as early as the introduction  in which  view spoiler  Dolores s death is implied to be the result of her abuse  hide spoiler    forces its reader to confront this prevalent repeated action of ignoring great men s pedophilic abuse  even having Humbert use it as an excuse for his behavior near the beginning   great men are pedophhiles  therefore i am a pedophile   it is one of the few largely culturally relevant places where this specific horror is addressed  even if its success may be in large part the result of the fetishization this horrorin short  DON T FETISHIZE LOLITA  DO NOT TAKE A BOOK THAT CONFRONTS CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE HEAD ON  SPECIFICALLY HOW FORGIVING SOCIETY IS OF IT IN CERTAIN  GREAT  MEN  AND GET OFF ON IT  LINGUISTICALLY OR  GOD FORBID  SEXUALLY  goodnight How do I solve a problem like Lolita  Or better yet  how do I read a novel like Lolita   I read it in one bit  sprawled on the sofa   holding the book close to my chest   running through the heart throbs of Humbert Humbert as he confesses his crimes and sins to his readers and jurors  Lolita in fact is not a problem at all   it is a masterpiece and a representation of a mind too dangerous and serious to be left unexamined   I am utterly fascinated by this novel and will be forever wondering about and wandering among its macabre crannies and addictive lures  K K  Reading some of the comments about the movie book stating that Lolita is nothing but evil  and was taking advantage of Humbert  I am amazed Admittedly  I felt bad for Humbert when I first saw the film  and there were times during the book as well where I felt Lolita was being cruel to him That is why this book is so beautifully and intelligently written  You have to step back and remember that she is only a little girl  and her initiating any sexual encounter is no excuse for Humbert s behavior  This book  written from Humbert s point of view  makes you even question whether or not the actions of Lolita were accurately portrayed at all  How do we know that the Lolita presented to us is just the constructed version of her in Humbert s head  She is a child  and her father figure is also her lover  This is not something that anyone would accept if reading a news story about it  but after reading the book  many seem to take Humbert s side  even after he himself admits wrong doing  Lolita  seems to have become synonymous with a young temptress  but really  is what she does much different from many young teenagers  On that note  who even is Dolores  We hear so much about her beauty  charm  and nymphet features  but who is she  Humbert in telling the story  as erased her  so to say  He gives her a new name  labels her as a nymphet  and then continues on throughout the story  We rarely get to see into her mind or heart  and every action she takes is seen as something for or against our narrator So in conclusion  Humbert is wrong  Lolita is a child  However  the fact that the book causes so many to question her actions both raises amazing societal issues and proves good writing  It is interesting  from the perspective of 2015  to see what was considered  pornographic  in the early 1960s  Considering what s available today on the Internet  this book is hardly more erotic than something by Dickens or George Eliot  That being said  one is free to move on to consideration of this novel as a work of art  not a piece of smut Reading Nabokov s prose is like drinking a fine wine   one needs to savor it slowly  so that all the myriad of flavors and aromas are allowed to develop  On the other hand  one should avoid drinking too deeply  for one can get intoxicated as easily on a Premier Cru vintage as one can on the type of wine that comes in a box rather than a bottle To me  Humbert Humbert isn t Evil  but rather a man devoured by an insane passion that overwhelms his reason and his soul  he is s as much to be pitied as condemned  To me  Lolita is a girl who takes her budding sexuality and uses it  IMHO  more for fun than for anything else  on HH  only to find that he s not playing games  and that the world she s walked into by accident is so much more wicked than she thought it would be when she started to tease HH  To me  Lolita is a tragic heroine in the Aristotelian sense  brought low by by a tragic flaw in her own character I ve only read the book once  and  IMHO  Nabokov s works require multiple readings to get to the true marrow of what he s trying to say  so I ll end this review here  viewing it as a sort of work in progress  Do not be put off by the book s prurient history   Nabokov s prose is simply glorious  no matter what the subject matter  I started reading this book early yesterday morning  and it proceeded to take over my life for the next 12 hours  I literally couldn t put it down  which is extremely rare for me Conclusion  I WORSHIP THIS BOOK  The prose alone was enough to leave me squirming in delight  but the subject matter thrilled me in ways I can t even begin to describe  I m a fervent believer   a zealot  really   in bold  fearless literature that doesn t shrink from exploring even the most seedy aspects of the human condition  Not only does this book do that in spades  but it manages to take concepts that should be ugly to the point of intolerable and turn it into poetry that leaves readers  or THIS reader  anyway  hanging on to every word  Don t know what else to say about it  really  It s just    masterful I didn t have any trouble with the writing style  Flowed like water for me  That said  I m sure I ll be reading it again at some point  just to catch some of the subtler nuances i might ve missed the first time around Amazing  Couldn t recommend this one more highly  Absolutely fascinating trip into the psyche of one who is all at once pathetic  deplorable  and wretched  yet endearing  This is a very well written and intense book  and I enjoyed the extreme pleasure of listening to the audio book  read by Jeremy Irons  who brings to the voice of HH a disturbingly alluring tone   Disturbing and hilarious  While reading the same page  I would smirk then feel the sudden urge to vomit  It s truly a masterpiece  and in my limited knowledge  a psychologically accurate portrayal of a child molester  Some describe this as a  romance   but really this book is about cruelty  and how no matter how low one can sink  we somehow manage to justify or explain our actions  When you re done  shower  You ll feel better  When I think of what was controversial in the 1950s  I think of Elvis being filmed from the waist up  So  I went into  Lolita  thinking it couldn t possibly be as scandalous as advertised nearly six decades later Wrong   Lolita  makes  To Catch a Predator  seem like child s play  so to speak   As hilarious as it is disturbing  Nabakov s classic is one of the most insightful accounts of pathology  what many refer to as Humbert s unreliability  I ve ever encountered  and still has the power to make the most hardened reader  i e  me  queasy Reading this through the lens of a literary representation of mental illness  it s easy to see Humbert s source for pedophilia  his stunted sexuality from an age appropriate childhood romance left unconsummated and forever associated with death and loss  and run on sentences   More subtle  though  is Humbert s troubled conscience  which vacillates between self awareness and self fulfillment  Through carefully dropped hints  we realize that he is aware of Dolores  vulnerability and her lack of interest in their adult activities  He knows what he s doing is damaging the poor girl  but more often than not  Humbert s needs hijack his decisions The consequences fall squarely on the not so frail shoulders of 12 year old Dolores Haze  who endures his abuse into her teen years   Side note  Through Lolita  Nabokov paints a clear portrait of borderline personality disorder  which makes her story even sadder  Still  through Humbert s rationalizations  however twisted or self serving  he does try to protect his stepdaughter in his clumsy way  While his selfishness trumps all  his moments of lucid affection make him as close to sympathetic as can be  sympathetic enough that we re rooting for him in his showdown with creepy Quilty  What a tremendous book  and perhaps the greatest work of transgressive fiction  Nabakov s play with language is remarkable  especially considering English was his second tongue   and the pain and desperation sweating through the pages of this novel make it timeless  I m kicking myself for waiting so long to read this American classic  This is nabokov s homage to middle class and middle America  full of word plays and dances with the names of people and paces in Humbert Humbert s travels through middle america  the novel is a homage to love of a young nymphet  don t know if this would be published today in a politically correct era  but a worthwhile read  delightful narrative  both the characters of humbert and lolita are energetically drawn and embellished  nabokov s hows his love of language and the use of various alliterations and subterfuge in his second language  i read this one while walking across the north of england  a fantastic novel  Countless lists of Best Novels of the Twentieth Century can t be wrong  What a great and witty book  I m sorry I was deterred for half a century by having seen the movie  feeling that the popularity was based on the  at the time  shocking theme of pedophilia  which was probably true back in the day  and never realizing what a brilliant piece of writing this was  This was difficult to read because of the content  It is very sad  but exceptionally well written   So I don t think I ve ever written a legitimate review on goodreads before  but I just finished Lolita  and as soon as I put it down my first thought was   This book demands to be talked about  So instead of calling my mom or my best friend and forcing them to listen to me go on for ten minutes about the book when they literally don t care but they love me too much to make me stop  and since my mom is a mother  she  like all mothers  has this strange ability to tune out sounds  Like my sister will be screaming and I ll be like  MOM CAN YOU SHUT HER UP PLZ  and she ll just be like  huh   Okay  In other words  Mom  BFF  you re welcome Instead of talking about it  I ll just write a review about it because I have a LOT of thoughts  I mean  really I have like two thoughts  but I need to discuss them at length 1  Before you read Lolita  someone who has read it before will tell you that Humbert Humbert will manipulate you  You will read about half of the book and feel like you re above it   you have to get up PRETTY early in the morning to be a child molester and manipulate me   You ll be wrong  He manipulates you in a way that you won t quite grasp until you re reading it Humbert Humbert is a child molester  There are never any doubts  He essentially kidnaps Lolita and forces her to give him sexual favors for 60 cents and trips to the movies  Okay  He knows she s not into it  He doesn t care  He claims that she initiates their first sexual encounter  It may or may not be true  That s not how he manipulates you  You re going to think every sexual thought he has is gross  You re going to think that he s a monster  You re going to think that he has serious psychological issues You re going to be right But that s not how he ll manipulate you  Somehow  over the course of 400 pages  you re going to be on his side  It won t be that you ll think his rape of this 13 year old girl is okay  You definitely won t think that  It s not that you ll think it s justified or that she s asking for it or ANYTHING like that  But you re going to find yourself sort of rooting for him  You re going to hope he doesn t get caught and you re going to be like  Wow  Lolita  stop being such a brat  when she does anything that puts Humbert in jeopardy  The first time that thought crept into my mind I was INSTANTLY aware of it  Here s what happened Humbert Humbert mentions that Lolita was talking to a man from the car while he was in the filling station  When he confronts her  she mocks him as per usual  ME   Wow Lolita  Shut up  Stop being such a brat                Wut  Hello  she is a prisoner  He rapes her like every day  What is your problem  I KNOW YOU THINK YOU RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAVE OFF HIS MANIPULATION BUT YOU LITERALLY WON T BE ABLE TO This leads me to my second thought 2  The thing about this book is that you re constantly aware of what s going on  You re constantly aware of HH s manipulation  But there s simply nothing you can do about it When I got to Part Two  I legitimately had to remind myself about every other chapter that I wasn t supposed to feel for HH  I had to remind myself that he was a monster and that even though he portrayed  Lo  as a lusty  promiscuous brat  that Lo was a 13 year old girl whose mother died and then was subsequently basically kidnapped by her stepfather who gets off on the thought of her on a bicycle I was aware of it  and yet somehow I was powerless to stop myself from being on his side on certain occasions  I wouldn t even realize it was happening until immediately after  but  like I said before  I was instantly aware And the thing is that HUMBERT HUMBERT IS AWARE OF EVERYTHING TOO  okay  to an extent   About three quarters through the book he s like   yeah I probably screwed up Lolita for life that sux   But the strange thing about HH is his simultaneous awareness and ignorance  One minute HH is like  oh  Lolita  my love  my life  You are the wind beneath my wings     And you re like  wtf he s a freak   But the next minute he s like  Lolita is totally not into me and I rape her so  BUT WHAT DO I CARE   And I feel like that s the same thing the reader goes through  When he says goodbye to Lo for the last time you can see how utterly broken hearted he is  And I m not inside Lolita s head at all so I don t know what she s thinking so I can t really sympathize with her  the only thing I know about Lolita was that she was a child when all this went down  I don t know how she felt  I don t get her AT ALL and I wish I did  but I think that s the whole point   All I can think is  poor Hum   That doesn t make sense You know from the beginning that he gets caught for something  He mentions in like chapter 1 that he s writing from a prison cell  but when I got to it and I knew what was coming I was like  NOOOOOO     BUT WHY  How did Hamburg Humberg get me on his side when I knew the entire time that I couldn t possibly be  The point is this Nabakov is a genius  How the hell did he get me  Welcome  fellow  to this bordello  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style   once again  it s just words  how can they be so huge  one of my absolute favourite books  takes you on such a journey  It is such a touching book  and it s ending left me on the edge of tears  Perfect  My Lolita    My car is limping  Dolores Haze And the last long lap is the hardest And I shall be dumped where the weed decays And the rest is rust and stardust    No hay estrellas en Goodreads para Lolita  Q maravilla  Humbert Humbert es desde ya uno de mis heroes  Revisiting this for the first time in a long time  I was happy to move away from the scandalous disturbing dramatic narrative and lose myself in the philosophical arguments about language s obfuscating power that Nabokov proposes  As much a great novel as an interrogation about what novels are expected to do  stylistically  morally    Brilliant  This book is a paradox in itself  Lolita  the classic  it s been read by so many  yet it s also one of the most taboo books ever  The question is really what does this book give you  A headache  But it s great  If nothing else read this book for the diction  This book is one of very few books that has a direct  congruent plot  yet is written with the wit  energy and flow of poetry   Nabokov has the strongest mastery of English prose I have ever encountered  and his first language was Russian My favourite opening lines from any novel  ever  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Gorgeous      And I shall be dumped where the weed decays And the rest is rust and stardust     Il mio amato Oscar Wilde ha detto    Non esistono libri morali o immorali  come la maggioranza crede  I libri sono scritti bene o scritti male  Questo e tutto    Se siete d accordo con lui almeno in parte  leggete Lolita  Converrete con me sulla decisione di includerlo nei libri scritti bene  e questo e tutto Non c e dubbio  l argomento trattato puo scoraggiare e sicuramente anche oggi  come all epoca della pubblicazione  c e chi farebbe fatica a leggerlo senza gridare allo scandalo  A me  invece  ha tanto intristito e incantato allo stesso tempo perche  per quanto sia lontano dalla mia etica  mi ha permesso di conoscere vividamente un punto di vista contrario al mio  e l ho amato anche per questo Non sono d accordo con chi lo considera un  inno alla pedofilia   Nabokov ne parla con estrema delicatezza e  anche se non si sbilancia a favore o contro le depravazioni del suo Humbert  mai  durante la lettura  mi sono sorpresa a pensare che il comportamento del protagonista fosse accettabile o giustificabile  Oggi mi sorprendo a pensare che il nostro lungo viaggio abbia solo sfregiato con una linea di fango la magnifica  enorme terra che per noi era solo un insieme di cartine con le orecchie  guide strampalate  pneumatici consunti e i suoi singhiozzi nella notte   ogni notte   appena io fingevo il sonno  Nabokov ci trasporta nella mente di Humbert  delineando le origini della deviazione a cui non riuscira mai a sottrarsi e che lo portera alla totale rovina non solo della propria vita  ma anche dell adolescenza di Lolita  ragazzina non del tutto innocente  ma sola al mondo e derubata di qualcosa che nessuno sarebbe piu riuscito a restituirle  Avvicinandosi tristemente alla fine  anche lo stile di scrittura cambia poco a poco  perde lucidita come Humbert stesso che  nonostante sembri quasi pentito e si renda conto del male che ha fatto  non abbandona mai la cieca convinzione che la sua fosse una forma di amore  Io ti amavo  Ero un mostro pentapodo  ma ti amavo  Ero ignobile e brutale e turpido e tutto quello che vuoi  mais je t amais  je t aimais  E c erano momenti in cui sapevo come ti sentivi  e saperlo era l inferno  piccola mia  Non leggete Lolita con l intento di trovarvi scritto  la pedofilia e un male   non avete bisogno di un libro per quello  Leggetelo perche vi permette di affacciarvi sulla complessita dell animo umano nelle sue depravazioni  vi permette di vedere le cose da un altro punto di vista e  non meno importante  leggetelo perche e scritto meravigliosamente bene Nabokov ha composto un capolavoro con un linguaggio sensuale e ricercato  con passaggi di una tale bellezza da costringermi piu volte a fermarmi e rileggerli per riassaporarli  Considerando che e stato scritto in inglese  che non era nemmeno la sua prima lingua  direi che il risultato toglie il fiato  Questa  dunque  e la mia storia  L ho riletta  C e rimasto attaccato qualche brandello di midollo  e sangue  e mosche bellissime d un verde brillante  A questa o quella delle sue svolte sento che il mio essere vischioso mi sfugge  scivola in acque troppo profonde e troppo oscure perche io possa sondarle   Lolita by Vladimir NabokovYou won t be shocked by the sight of a monster  but instead by the way you understand and recognize   or even pity    him  because evil has often no culprits  Lolita is a real tragedy  where no one is saved or ever will be  Plot  A pedophile moves heaven and earth for Lolita  but she runs off with another pedophile  Rating  99 out of 100http   www rtbookreviews com rt daily    This is a very challenging book to read emotionally  as you are seeing the story from the pedophile s point of view  so you almost sympathize with him  However  it is incredibly rewarding to acknowledge and face one of society s most ruthless crimes and it s side effects  It is a page turner for sure  The last paragraph is worth all of the work you put in reading this book  but don t just skip to it   invest yourself in it   E come mi aspettavo controverso  tanto  Non sai cosa pensare  Ancora adesso  che l ho finito non riesco a farmi un idea perche alla fin fine e la storia di un uomo che spezza  metaforicamente  la vita di una bimba    Ma Nabokov te lo racconta con uno stile eccezionale  Ha una scrittura emozionante  coinvolgente  intelligente che ti vien da perdonargli tutto    Non saprei spiegarmi meglio  leggerlo e l unica soluzione  This was humorous   hahaha    and it needs a lt of decoding I mean   okay now a days we have books like  Fifty shades of grey  but back then this was it  I loved it  It was a reading requirement for one of my english courses and i am greatful that it was on the list  It s worth reading   given the fact that English was not the first language for Nabokov  It was the third or fourth language for him   but he masters it in Lolita  One of my all time favorite books by one of my all time favorite authors  The subject matter is controversial  focusing on the delusions and excuses of the protagonist  who obsesses over his landlady s daughter  who is 13 when the story begins  Nabakov s writing is almost impossible to describe  maybe vivid  A hilarious parody of love stories and of psychiatry once you accept the premise of pedophilia  Nabokov is a genius who uses your discomfort to his advantage  Every word is chosen carefully so it is hard to catch everything on the first read through  It reveals many truths about morality  however the absolute worst thing you can do while reading this book is to take it too seriously  The humor rather snuck up on me  as it increases as the book goes on  culminating in the final dramatic scene which is purely satire  Definitely a book I could read more than once  Nabokov s careful  academic tone and academic references cloak numerous puns increasing the pleasure when you discover them    Lloraba de nuevo  borracho de pasado imposible  No hay estrellas suficientes para puntuar Lolita   I am going to stay away as much as I can from the characters and subject matter for my review  There are loads of reviews across the internet discussing blame and dishonesty on the parts of Lolita and Humbert  I don t need to spark another debate Lolita is a beautifully crafted novel  The wordplay is fascinating  and additions of French and German speech added to that  The pace of the book is perfect  starting with lazy summer days  The anticipation builds  like the pressure before a storm  up to each major event  The reader can tell it is coming  but it is no less shocking when it does  Lolita is so cleverly written that it is graphic and shocking without using explicit descriptions or expletives  which I think adds to the innocent debauched theme I borrowed this from the library  but I will be buying my own copy  as I think this is the type of book where you notice more and more clever details on each reading  I also think it would be interesting to study the two central characters from a purely psychological point of view  A disturbingly brilliant look into the mind of a pedophile   The power of the Halo effect demonstrated by lavishing the prettiest prose on the ugliest being   One can never resist Nabokov s prose  The language is pure beauty  pure passion  pure love  Autorouchs and angels are transfigured into art as Humbert Humbert tries to accomplish for himself  The intricate games that Nabokov plays with his work at once enriches the fictional world he creates and reinforces the artifice of writing itself  If youre lazy read the annotated edition but if you have the patience necessary for Nabokov read the novel then immediately read it again  Another reread  There s one line that sticks out to me more than any other  even this long after I finished the book   Lolita girl  Brave Dolly Schiller  This is if you recall whom Lolita becomes  this Dolly Schiller gal  pregnant and married to a working class guy named Joe  I think   I found it hard while reading this book to worry about Humbert s creepiness  or his criminality  I found it easy while reading this book to hate Humbert all the same  or well no  not hate but I guess laugh at in ways Nabokov I think invited me to  And then chapter 29 in part 2 came along  the place from where the above quote is taken  and I found it very hard to do the latter  very easy to do the former  and I ended up caring so fully for this guy  How does this happen And wow how about all those dick jokes  huh   I loved you  I was a pentapod monster  but I loved you   What an exceptional and frightening treat it was to experience this  First things first   it s impossible to ignore that crawling sensation that comes from following a narrator whose moral and psychic character is so irrevocably flawed  Some stories feature anti heroes  with whom we can distract ourselves by imagining that we  too  are going outside the realm of reason and good taste as we read along to their mischief  Lolita has no anti hero  Instead  we are forced to follow a villain  one whose acts feel positively creepy  unhealthy  sinful  In Lolita  the reader becomes part accomplice to a sickening  entrancing scheme which even the narrator acknowledges with a foul mixture of sensible awareness and compulsive dismissal  Even the shock of a good plot twist is not enough to sugar coat the ethical gore of incest  pedophilia and murder  A reader of Lolita may then feel all varieties of helplessness  that of a child abused  of a woman diabolically cheated  of a man corrupted by his own dark nature  and all the while  also as a third party who can do nothing but allow the story to unfold as we absorb voyeuristically Humbert Humbert s educated tone only adds to this engrossing trouble  Lolita s text is rife with educated and aristocratic pomposity  the narrator s cruel but genteel mind guiding us through ingenious wordplay  The language used is precise and glorious  imploring and at the same time accusatory of fact  It is at times impossible to understand whether we are to believe all that he says  whether for misappropriation of the truth or misunderstanding of a warped mind  Humbert is a studied psychologist who at at one point scorns the science entirely  He admits openly that his obsession with young women is a festering illness  and yet relies frequently  and also obsessively  on his justification  that these young women he is drawn to are nymphets  an entirely new classification of life in his mind  with nearly magical powers and existence  We are guided through Lolita by a person who is entitled to pride in his academic background  an undeniably intelligent fellow  who is also an untrustworthy liar suffering from some belligerent cocktail of untamed mental illness To add further trouble to the reader is the fact that obsession  sexual attraction  fear of being discovered  and  truly at times  love are experiences that we all encounter  It is gut wrenchingly difficult to understand the emotions that an incestuous pedophile are emotions we  too  are capable of to some degree  The narrator tries to dig this out of the reader at times  appealing to us to understand  if not condone  his drive  Though we will recognize how we are different from Humbert Humbert  all the same he brings us to tragic depths that at times may feel discomfortingly human  To say nothing further of the plot  Lolita is one of the rare and exquisite books I have had the pleasure to enjoy  What I have written above may not seem like praise  but it is   the shocking taboo of this story  it s emotional heaviness  it s enslaving sinfulness is testament to the immense power of its prose  I No other book comes to mind which has been forced me into such a wide range of unwelcome thoughts with such insistent flare  I can understand why this book will not appeal to many  And yet the impossible chance of encountering such a beast as this feels unrepeatable again in a lifetime  I doubt I will ever be able to read this again  but I believe I will hold it in the highest regard for quite some time  I was chatting to a friend about Nabokov and realized that this novel really is one of the great and enduring modern classics and was deeply affecting to me  So  I will change my moralistic 3 rating to 5  where it belongs  Nabokov is simply a genius   a sardonic genius cackling with grim  dark delight  He writes nothing you can ignore or casually dismiss   A great look into the mind of a true monster  punctuated by some excellent prose   This has quickly become one of my all time favorite books  right up there with Harry Potter and  Pride and Prejudice  and Vladimir Nabokov s writing style has earned him a place right next to Jane Austen and Oscar Wilde on my list of awesome authors  Eccentric  Passionate  Ultimately tragic  If books were men   Lolita  would be my soulmate  Vladamir Nabokov was a ridiculously talented writer who so beautifully and seamlessly spun a tale of love and obsession  Oh  the obsession  It s the heart of the story  It s twisted and horrible  the things Humbert Humbert does  but you re drawn into his story the way you are to a train wreck  Ahh  just read it  You can t go wrong with it  Even if you don t have much stomach for pervy older men lusting after nymphets  read it for the prose  No one can write about the mad and obsessed like Nabokov  A masterpiece  Technically  this might be the best constructed book I have ever read  Nabokov s use of language is truly astounding  Whether you read it as a case study of a disturbed pederast  a star crossed love story  or a critique of mid century America bourgeois society  Lolita shimmers with poetic intensity and intellectual rigor   sa good  lyked de sexay bitz First of all  I ve got to say  I was a little prejudiced  when I started reading this book I didn t want to  get into  the pedophile s head  But only a genius could write a book with such a contradictive plot and get in the head of Humbert This book definitely became one of my favourite books of all time  though I cannot fully explain why First of all  I loved that Nabokov translated this book to russian by himself  I loved his language  loved his words and metaphores I don t want to spoil this book to those  who are going to read it  So I ll be short there is suspense  there is drama  there is fear and disgust  there is love and lust  There are secrets  there is action  there is the reality  Only a genius could write a book about such a dirty man without using dirty words This book leaves something inside Even though in the end I didn t think of Humbert as of such a lost man  I still hated him for what he was and couldn t get over it  But this book changed something  It didn t make me sympathise a maniac  but it made me think of who we really are The afterword of Lolita was really touching  It s one of the best parts in the book And even though in the russian afterword Nabokov said  that he lost his talent to write in russian  this is definitely not true  His russian is brilliant   and then I knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord  I m not sure at what point I realized this  The title of the book is not ironic  We never get to meet Dolores Haze  We only meet Lolita  a figment of Humbert s meticulously  was gonna say  scrupulously   but I m no Nabokov  layered delusions  But the voice of the victim remains unheard  and that might be the most tragic thing as far as the reader  and society  is concerned  Lolita is one of those books that have gained notoriety because of their subject matter  After getting an awkward look from the bookshop keeper when I bought it  I could also say that it is far better known for false assumptions and rumours than for its own unquestionable merits One ought to free their mind of prejudice when reading this particular book in order to fully appreciate it  and not to feel uncomfortable whilst reading it  From the first sentence to the last  respectively beginning and ending with the name of the twelve year old character  it grips the reader and does not let them go  The style is witty  with constant puns and references to other works  and at times even poetic  Nabokov shows his full narrative potential using a wide palette of means of expression The subjects the plot raises and explores  besides the obvious impossible love between a man and a  nymphet   are the ever present doppelgangers or doubles   convention  as well as the ubiquitous theme of true love Personally  I think that the part where Humbert realises he has truly fallen in love with Lolita  is one of the most cathartic moments in literature  While reading Humbert Humbert s confession you are sucked into the whirlpool of his mind  and once you finish the book  you are left with a certain sense of poetic bleakness  quite unmatched by anything I have read It is neither easy nor possible to express how amazing this novel is  and I recommend it to anyone with a free mind  Had young nymphet Anabelle not died of tifo four months after her summer with Humbert Humbert  this book would have turned out to be something different  or maybe not  who knows if H  H  was motivated on his obsession by his romance with the nymphet of his childhood or if it was just something born inside him  waiting to burst   It would have saved us some tears  some disturbing  yet  not very much explicit  I must add  details  but it would have certainly prevented us from discovering Nabokov s sublime writing  Reading Lolita and H  H s journey is travelling with them  through the mountains and the deserts and the small towns  museums If you find any of the characters described in the book as lovable  you must be an enchanting and adorable creature  because I spotted most of them as idiotic  frightening or obsessive  which is why I think this book makes such a perfect portrait of society s darkness  The most complex of all  I think  is Humbert  Nabokov is evil and writes him in a way we almost pity him  But there is nothing to be pitiful about  He consciously abuses this child  claiming he loves her with soul and heart  Is it real  I don t believe so  specially before Lolita runs away  Yes  he finds any moment featuring Lolita s body sublime  explosive  pleasuring  but he finds her a useless  unbearable brat  I am not saying she can be considered a sweet character  But I think the fact her worst traits got a lot more sharpened after she met Humbert is quite understandable  giving her current situation  I mean  what was he expecting  For her to happily crawl into the space where someone takes advantage of her and treat the same person with respect and loving affection I am not saying Lolita is this innocent girl  who was completely caught off guard with Humbert s first moves  But we must have some perspective here  she is a child  Everything involving the beginning of their relationship was similar to a child s play to her  She actually engaged activities you would consider adult like with other kids  which makes her have zero conscience of the seriousness of taking on sexual relations  exactly because she is a kid  Stopping that whole madness was his obligation at that first point  was his responsibility  his obligation  not hers  And everything after that was  of course  still completely out of her hands  thanks to Humbert s manipulation  which not only involved threatening to send her to a place she considered horrifying but also taking away her prized possessions  The fact she chooses to protect the latter  seems  I am sure  crazy to all of us  even if we consider her a child  But that is exactly one of the points Nabokov tried to make when writing this book  at the time  the American enchantment for everything material had no limits I must not forget  of course  Charlotte  To be honest I found her rather dreadful  The way she treated Dolores  even though we can easily understand it s probably related to her sharing some of the guilt for her little brother s death  I am sure  and her neediness  dependency and desperation were not delightful marks for me  as a reader  She was  I believe a negative influence in Lolita s upbringing and that only makes me think about all the things that could have been  or that should have not  One of the most crushing moments in the books is  in my opinion  the one where Humbert dedicates his attention to the small details that would unravel Dolores  despair  The story isn t exactly the stuff you want to read about  I am afraid it s a very revolting story  you can easily identify what could have gone better  what should have happened  But I think this is what makes it so important  it shakes our soul  unsettles us  it makes you think and fight with yourself to try to make a sense of it  Lolita is a girl  She is twelve years old and utterly embroiled in the complexities offered by a life of such young years Humbert is a poet  And most importantly  a pervert  who deludes gratification for himself while stealing glances at pre pubescent girls in parks  And professes himself absolutely innocent of any moral crime  After all  what harm comes to a child when the creep in the shadows relieves himself of his desire without sullying the innocence of the object of his desire in question  And then  his desire for gratification reaches a crescendo when he lays eyes on Lolita What follows is an odyssey  A confession  I had to stop midway through the book  my mind full of scoffs at the various attempts at circumnavigations of H H to reconcile me  the reader  to demonstrate his  should I say   innocence  Because I could feel a dark cloud of sympathy   Empathy   chasing me at the heels  and it only seemed to deepen as I read and read and reached that final numbing paragraph  At this  and at so many other moments  Nabokov has simply left me supremely uncomfortable  I m bound to ask myself  is it because I want to illicit a meaning  a purpose to the pages I m reading  Is it because  no matter how hardcore yes  I see the irony in that  a reader I believe myself to be  I m still searching for a saving grace in the dejected human being  I m inevitably sharing one  or three  cold afternoon s  with   I look at Mr Underwood  House of Cards   House  House  M D    Emily Thorne  Revenge      and each of them do not disappoint  They provide me with something good that warms the cockles of my heart and allows me the peace to cavort with them through the dark  winding alleyways of their black  black mind  Lolita  the book  not the girl  among many others was able to illicit two tremendous and superfluous reactions from me  Firstly  an intense love and adoration for the strangely beautiful and lyrical prose  a constant stream of consciousness that elates and drives the narrative and the subtle cue of the truth amidst the piquant stream of monologue  And secondly  the abject horror of the tale itself that makes me want to shrivel up and the entire universe into a ball  to a point and burst forth with its entrails tracing across the far reaches of the inky blackness  As I was reading the book  it was my third day of reading and I was well on my way to the end and for that purpose unable to leave it alone in my bag  an old lady  who was sitting beside me on the train  and kept glancing from the cover to my face  gave me a very admonishing look on her way out  I took that to mean something on the lines of   good girls don t read books like that  I continued reading the book  but only after nestling it in the dust jacket of another  Come on  what would you have done   This is my first Nabokov novel and I think I ve completely fallen in love with his style  I think the famous critical quote about Lolita   The only convincing love story of our century   is accurate Upon completing the novel  I realized that I pitied every single character and liked none  hands down my favorite book EVER  every page of nabokov s writing is a gift to be savored  i am inclined to make the bold and snobby statement that if you don t like this book  it means you didn t understand it  there  i said it  Over the years  when people recommended this book to me  I expected it was out of their newfound sick delight in a world of deviance  I imagined such supposed  friends   peering up at me from their piles of sensationalist gratuitous pop culture  with their shit eating grins  assumed that their favor gave them an association of coveted  edginess   I  who in my life had had enough of violence  took pleasure in being tattoo less  my refusals to watch Tarantino and  yawning in the face of  Bukowski is mostly I read if I read at all if time  statements  So  I expected to hate Lolita  because I piled it onto the dump of showy grotesque humanity that bougie trust funder 20 something s so loved to loll around in But instead  I found a perverse re affirmation in my solace of innocence by watching the true  lustful  heartbroken and confused state of a deviant human pursue and gain and finally  so very dramatically  lose  I also loved the flow of language  I kept looking up words as I read only to find the clean GRE words made the narrator more complexly disturbed   the sly  tumescent devil    black cadillac for the nonce    The writing drew me in and made me feel close to a human s real thoughts  something I think we all crave  And this aching  heartbreaking closeness I feel for both Humbert and Lolita I think is what is meant to be achieved by Nabokov  as in his afterword he is wary of analyst s asking  what s the author s purpose  Yet  in spite of his frank explanation of the lack of moral in Lolita  the cover of the book proclaims it is a  love story  and a  story of hypercyvilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America   Indeed  the taboo subject of the book seems to supercede its beauty to critics and boring hipsters alike Humbert realizes he  loved  Lolita only after she was out of his grasp  Just after being dumped  you  realize  how much you need and suddenly  love  this person  When you were together  you never let lust achieve a closeness  She was but an object to him  and this is no  love story   as Vanity Fair absurdly suggests  His realization of  love  is a mere desperate regret of breaking and using a human   Lolita remarked   You know what s so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on your own   and it struck me  as my automaton knees went up and down  that I simply did not know a thing about my darling s mind and that quite possibly behind awful juvenile cliches  there was in her a garden and a twilight and a palace gate   dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me  in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions  for I often noticed that living as we did  she and I  in a world of total evil  we would become strangely embarrassed whenever I tried to discuss something    an abstract idea  a painting  stippled Hopkins or shorn Baudelaire  God or Shakespeare  anything of a genuine kind  Good will  She would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom  whereas I  using for my desperately detached comments an artificial tone of voice that set my own last teeth on edge  provoked my audience to such outbursts of rudeness as made any further conversation impossible  oh my poor  bruised child   pg 284 To carnally know a human  to take them  and to break them  is to not know them at all  Humbert s regret is palpable and you hurt for him and Dolores and and all the shadows of them in the world we know  past present future   Romanzo complesso  stilisticamente brillante  strutturalmente perfetto  narrato in prima persona da un protagonista sull orlo della follia eppure  o proprio per questo  dotato di un fascino insidioso e malevolo  e con una trama mortalmente crudele che si fa beffe tanto del narratore quanto del pubblico  flirtando continuamente con la tragedia e la commedia  quando e insopportabilmente triste vorremmo un tocco di leggerezza  ma quando e innegabilmente divertente vorremmo proprio che non lo fosse  Ne segue per forza di cose tanto un capolavoro quanto un opera radicalmente controversa  probabilmente molto piu oggi di quando usci quasi sessant anni fa  I loved  loved  loved Lolita  Simply exquisite  Brilliant on both a sentence by sentence and a structural level  This is one of those books that I am going to think about over and over again and that I am sure I will return to as a reader  If you have any interest at all in this book  read it  Compelling  brilliant and seductive  This is a work of genius  As much as I was revolted and disturbed by Humbert Humbert s pursuit of Lola  and could entirely see through his monstrously selfish rationalisations  I sometimes found myself ON HIS SIDE   how is this possible  I loathed Humbert but as you do with good villains  I enjoyed him enormously as a character   Nabokov is one of my favorite writers of all time  I love his unexpected and surprising way with the English language  A sentence is never what you expect it to be in his work  While the subject matter is obviously unsettling  it is one of the most brilliant character studies in modern literature  Guardate questo intrico di spine Nabokov ci trasporta direttamente nella psiche di Humbert  il protagonista  e ci mostra il cuore dell ossessione umana  Non si puo far altro che lasciarsi trasportare dai pensieri e dalle emozioni di Humbert  dalle sue ossessioni senza fine  dal suo dolore straziante  dal lirismo delle pagine di questo capolavoro  What should I say about this book  Its far more than being just amazing and truly marvelous  The style of writing  descriptions of each and every events of the story in such a lucid manner made me totally spellbound The 1st impression of the book  about the protagonist  Mr  H H  being a pedophile  his desire and lust for young girls  nymphets  in his nomenclature  gave me a sick feeling  I believe any readers of this masterpiece must have got the same initial notion about the book But this feeling disappeared as I advanced in my journey through the leaflets of the book with Mr  Humbert Humbert  The writing  the plot  the events looked so real  so lively that at time I felt that I myself being a passive witness of the whole narration  I probably myself got possesive about Lolita as I imbibed myself deep into the wordings of the book  Mr  H H will be called a sick person in any civilized society  but his love  devoid of the lust  for Lolita  I ll call truly eternal  Lolita appeared to be a mysterious girl lady woman as any other women in this world  But authors portrayal of her was just more than a normal humane child  An awesome serious read and recommended to any adult who want to plunge themselves into an world of lust  love  care  melancholy  possessiveness  hope     I truly disagree with people calling  Lolita  an erotic novel  Lolita  the novel is far more than just a literary chef d oeuvre  As I finished reading the book  I wish Lolita was still well and doing good in her life post 1952 However  I would like to echo the same as in the the book s forward by Widworth  Mass  John Ray  Jr   Ph D  As a case history   Lolita  will become  no doubt  a classic in psychiatric circles  As a work of art  it transcends its expiatory aspects  and still more important to us than scientific significance and literary worth  is the ethical impact the book should have on the serious reader  for in this poignant persona1 study there lurks a general lesson  the wayward child  the egotistic mother  the panting maniac these are not only vivid characters in a unique story  they warn us of dangerous trends  they point out potent evils   Lolita  should make all of us  parents  social workers  educators apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world  Oh Lolita   vladimir nabokov is a genius  absolutely incredible  Nothing more can be said about this book other than READ IT  It is a must  The writing is unmatched  and the dark  forbidden subject matter draws you in  You feel guilty for loving it yet just can t stop    In fall  2010   when the American Library Association sponsored its annual  Banned Books Month   I told The Missus that I planned to participate by reading a banned book  Which one   I m not sure yet  But I think it s gonna be Lolita   That figures   she said  smirking A while later  I mentioned on my blog that I was well into the book  One commenter    a woman    said I don t like to admit to many that I liked  Lolita s protagonist  Humbert in that weird and terrible way  I mean  I know he s awful and everything  I know he is wrong  and I don t exactly want him to win  but   Let s pretend we ve never heard of Lolita  So then what was going on here  Why might anyone have banned Lolita in the first place  Why would my wife say that it  figured  I d select it  from among all the banned books which I hadn t read  Why would my correspondent hate to admit that she liked a fictional character  even an awful one  and why the  weird and terrible  disclaimer  and especially  what  oh what could she have meant by that  exactly  Enough pretending  Even if we haven t read it ourselves  and don t know the details  I think many    most     reasonably well read readers will know of Vladimir Nabokov s notorious novel  In brief  and please skip the following paragraph if you want no spoilers at all  Late 1940s  Middle aged Englishman who calls himself  Humbert Humbert  narrates the story  Humbert has a thing for young girls  between the ages of 9 and 14 and of a certain type  slightly built  most often blonde  flirtatious    perhaps without knowing it    but virginal  not necessarily in fact   He calls them  nymphets   a term which Nabokov apparently invented himself  just for this book   Humbert moves to a suburb in the northeastern United States  taking a room with a young widow  Charlotte Haze  He discovers that Charlotte has an unconsciously seductive 12 year old blonde daughter  Dolores     Dolly  to her mother  but dubbed by Humbert  Lolita   Humbert eventually marries Charlotte  expressly for the opportunities it may provide him to be alone with his stepdaughter  Charlotte is struck by a car and killed  Humbert takes off in his battered car  with Lolita  on a cross continental odyssey during which he gets what he thinks he wants  Things turn out to be not so rosy  especially  although not exclusively  for the person whom Humbert ends up killing  The end Right off the bat  then  we have the ingredients to answer all those  why  questions    the principal ingredient being  Humbert Humbert is a manipulative pedophile  In the mid 1950s  when Lolita was published  just saying the word  pedophile  in a non clinical context was probably enough to make people recoil  placing one at the center of a first person narrative back then probably guaranteed opposition to the book Nowadays  while we live in a nominally more  liberal  culture   Think of the children   may be a phrase which invites satire but pedophilia remains maybe even more firmly on the list of taboo subjects for conversation and even private reading  The Ick Factor is off the charts for everyone but its disturbed practitioners  regardless of our positions on the yardsticks of morality or politics  we simply know too much about the long term consequences of the sexual abuse of innocents to find thinking about it at all  entertaining  So how on earth could my friend claim that she    she     liked such a monster  even in a weird and terrible way  Was it really necessary for her to qualify I don t want him to win with that exactly Um  well    yeah Because the thing about Lolita  especially because of its  theoretically more disturbing  first person point of view  is the extent to which it summons empathy for the narrator  Almost none of us will share his particular lust  nearly all of us will know the experience of lusting  unhealthily  for something which is unhealthy in the first place  Humbert can no more resist his obsession for nymphets in general  or  of course  for Lolita in specific  than he can resist the urge to show off  verbally  bursting pretentiously and reflexively  for example  into weird esoteric words or untranslated passages of French whenever he feels the normal range of English doesn t suffice  In that range of yielding to uncontrollable impulse    whether trivial or monstrous    lie the rest of us And I think that s why we respond to Humbert  We don t want him to  win   to commit the sin or to get away with it  but we recognize the tug of the forbidden something  We don t him to win    but   A note on the language  Nabokov  a native Russian speaker  sometimes complained about the relative clumsiness of English  But ye gods  could the man construct some beautiful sentences  I can t remember reading a book recently in which I highlighted so much  Here s one brief passage  chosen at random from midway through the book  it wasn t even one of my highlights  She had entered my world  umber and black Humberland  with rash curiosity  she surveyed it with a shrug of amused distaste  and it seemed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with something akin to plain repulsion The wordplay  the rhythms  the progression of meaning and tension from start to finish  if I could regularly construct sentences which so perfectly balanced all those elements  I think I could go to my grave a happy man   As I said  we all have our unreasoning lusts  So do I recommend Lolita I never insist that people should read a book just because it s regarded  by critics or the public or  well  by me  as a  classic   With Lolita  maybe more than with most books  I d think carefully before diving in  What s the threshold of behavior which you ll accept in your characters  Can you get past the nominal subject of a novel like Lolita  Are you after a quick read  or a book which will equally compel reading for a half hour burst and then being put aside for an hours long inner Hmmmm    Depend on how you d answer those questions  that s the best advice I can give  I didn t find Lolita an easy book to read  and I ll probably never read it cover to cover again  But I m very very happy  yes  happy that I have read it  And I can easily imagine dipping from time to time back into its  weirdly  terribly  bracing waters  NOTE  this review originally appeared  in slightly different form  at The Book Book   Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov  is a novel from 1955  which stands out for its bold theme The story of Humbert Humbert  told in the first person  straight from prison  begins with his wealthy childhood in Europe  and in his teens  there is a love trauma  the fact that he uses to justify his atypical behavior HH turns out to marry  after many adventures with prostitutes  but does not succeed  and his wife go away from home  By this fact  decides to move to the US  where just staying in Lolita s mother s house  a nickname for Dolores Haze   and that s where the excitement begins as HH falls in love with Lolita  Detail  it s a forty  while she has only 12 years Besides the forbidden romance  Nabokov also shocked by another fact  HH is handled by Lolita  Thus  we are not facing a story about a molester  but about a man obsessed with a nymphet  super sexually evolved child  What attracted me initially was the striking title  Once I started reading it  I realized that not only the title  but the whole plot is striking  Okay  I admit that  at certain points  the author goes on too in the details  but that s not enough to draw an interest in history                                                                       If it was an easy book  Of course not  Lolita asks for commitment  because besides the heavy theme  has a very difficult to grasp the vocabulary  This was a challenge  It took me some time to stick to it  but it was worth it because it does not compare to anything I ve read before  And that s why I indicate  The greatest value of this book is how much it makes you address it s message and it is full of conflicting messages  The book is written in the first person narrated by the protagonist and through the authors eloquent use of the English language trys to make a case for sympathy by intimating that his murders  incest  and sexual behaviors were a helpless result  The man is a beast  a deviate  a pervert  a hedonist and another fifty vile adjectives would be appropriate  The story is  however  told in such a manner that makes you sympathize at least on a scale of how sick he is and how wonderfully it is told  It reminds you of the conflict in politics and religion where someone can make an elequent case for any position  no matter how bizzarre  A review of this book should probably be attempted a month after it is read in order to come to terms with one s feelings  Somehow I think that the main puposes of literature is to be entertained  informed or challenged to think  If that is the case  this book which was written over fifty years ago deals successfully with issues that are still often concealed or avoided today  Reading this book is entirely a different experience altogether  All I can say is I have never been so dragged by the character into the emotional world of his her  but this book made me to feel that feeling  Words are woven together to form the prose style which I never experienced in any of my previous readings  There are times when I smiled and laughed and even wondered with the insights of Mr  HH throughout the book But yes  it also has its downsides  The term  Nymphet  is not gonna leave my head for sure  The way I look at those age group girls changed with this book  But his love must be love  i think  stands tall above all  And I have no regrets of reading this book  In fact the language used overtakes the plot  But still it would be better reading for matured readers  I think  Finally  It is One of the Greatest Books of my time  I am glad that I have read it    Thematically unsettling  even after over 50 years  but the prose is perfect  and its legacy is justifiably due to the artistry of the novel as well as its subject matter  Leafing through the chaotic layers of Humbert Humbert s twisted psyche is as intriguing  chilly  and rewarding as a treasure hunt in my great great aunt s haunted house   This poetic testement from a paedophile leaves me baffled and confused  I was in an obsesive frenzy to reach the next page  and then another  and then realized how crazy I am once I pulled my eyes away from the page  away from the meretricious words  I would say to myself  It s fine though  because we re all reading it  continue   But once the novel was finished I didn t know if I understood the meaning  what was vehement Vladimir attempting to say  Here s what I think  Humbert Humbert s obsession with Lolita is manic  haha  we all see this   Lolita is given the world  all the citys and towns of America  and material goods that Humbert gives her  She s a frail child that could never fight Humbert away physically  and humbert is big  he dominates her with size  These characters serve as the perfect metaphors for the role women and men play in this world  the roles they have allways played in love  at its worst  and the metaphors work because  within the drama  the stakes are high  a paedophile s obsession makes us cringe and read on   In the worst case very common   romantic  secenarios we fall into  man is obsessed with  his  womans body  with her features  and he allways gets his way because what can a woman do  And for women  the worst situation has her struggling to leave  and taking advantage of his obsession  and taking advantage of his power  but still  she is trapped  It ends the way he thinks it should  The woman learns to say no  and the man looks at himself  withdrawn  exhausted  and sick  and takes his sh  Y y position  He accepts the concequences  His obsessive lust dies   and she is set free  Originally published on my blog here in March 2004 Lolita is probably the most famously scandalous novel of the twentieth century  and still packs a punch as its subject is one of the remaining sexual taboos   the seduction of a twelve year old girl by a paedophile   Lolita s age was raised slightly in the famous film made of the novel   The novel  supposedly memoirs written in an asylum  concentrate on three years or so in the life of Humbert Humbert  a wonderful  but assumed name  together with some background to explain how he came to be attracted to young girls of the type he calls  nymphets   In a small Eastern US town  Humbert falls for the his landlady s daughter  Dolores Haze  also known as Lolita  But the girl s mother has at the same time fallen for Humbert  and eventually he marries Charlotte Haze as part of a scheme to seduce Lolita  She finally finds out about his passion for her daughter  Humbert keeps a secret journal  rather recklessly   After confronting him  Charlotte runs from the house  only to be run over by a passing car and killed  This event catalyses Humbert s seduction of Lolita  and the two of them set off on a mammoth car journey across America There are three very clever contrasting pairs which basically make Lolita work in the way that it does  First  Nabokov makes all three main characters thoroughly dislikeable  to the extent that Humbert s story sometimes seems to be describing a competition where the aim is to be as unpleasant as possible  This is  of course  about the only way to make Humbert not come over as a complete monster   It should also be remembered  of course  that Humbert is the narrator   so that even if we believe his claims that he is telling things exactly as they happened without excusing himself  we have to remain aware that we are only seeing things from his point of view   At the same time  all three are victims  Lolita most obviously  but her mother is trapped by her infatuation for Humbert into a situation which leads to her death  and Humbert  also trapped in an infatuation for someone not very nice  describes himself as a sick man whose actions are driven by his illness His infatuated reconstruction of Lolita and her true nature form a contrast which is the second of Nabokov s clever touches  She is clearly shown to be a not very bright  selfish and vulgar adolescent  and yet even while he realises this  Humbert is helplessly captivated by everything about her   even her faults  The dual nature of the idealised and real Lolita is brilliantly conveyed by Nabokov  If Lolita could be said to have a wider application than its sensational subject matter suggests  it is in Nabokov s delineation of the nature of infatuation   The author  however  denied that the novel has any kind of moral  The third contrast is between the sordid activities of the three main characters and the beautiful  poetic writing style  Two of the most masterly writers of English prose in the twentieth century  Nabokov and Conrad  did not have it as their first language  Nabokov goes so far in the afterword to Lolita  his first English novel  to deplore his writing as second rate by comparison with the  untrammelled  rich and infinitely docile Russian tongue   This is surely too self deprecating to be a true comment on how he felt about his English writing  however  my Russian isn t good enough to check out whether his novels in that language are as good or better  When one thinks about influential prose styles from the fifties  the obvious names that come to mind are  beat  writers like Kerouac or Burroughs  but I think that Nabokov s writing has had more impact on the mainstream English novel Although widely attacked as pornographic  there is nothing titillating about Lolita  The novel is not a pleasant read  but it is certainly like a journey which requires frequent stops to admire a particularly beautiful view  It is entirely deserving of its position as one of the twentieth century s most admired novels    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Le  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at achool  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Humbert the Horrible  Yes he was horrible  Horrible for the pain and theft of life he visited on Lolita  horrible to himself for the destruction of his own life  Horrible to his first wife  and Charlotte  Ah Charlotte  without whom none of the story could have happened  Selfish Charlotte  Curious Lolita  Innocent Lolita  And in the end     well  that would be telling The first time I read  Lolita  I did have a difficult time getting through the book  I was so outraged at         everything and everybody in the story  Then upon dissection the reader is able to begin seeing underneath the layers of the story  There is a quote on the front cover of my copy from Vanity Fair  it says  The only convincing love story of our century   I am still not sure if I agree with that or not  but I do know this  it is a love story  and a story that will rip your heart right out  and ultimately a story of freedom  The pursuit of freedom at any cost I cannot recommend this book highly enough  Kirjan aihe on kammottava ja onkin hammentavaa  kuinka nain runollisen lopputuloksen saa moisista aineksista  Parhaimmillaan siina  etta tuo lapinakyvasti julki kertojan eparehellisyyden  viiltaa huumorilla tai kyynisesti juuri silla hetkella kun lukija on solahtamassa osoitetulle vaaralle polulle  kun naita polkuja on kaksi lapi tarinan  totuus sellaisenaan ja Humbertin maalaamana  Well written and made me feel a deep response to the entire journey of Dolores and H  Humbert  I did enjoy the first half more than the second  Very humorous as well and delightfully enjoyable  A very comfortable read that brought about feelings of love  regret and humor  This was my third time reading Lolita and I wholeheartedly fall in love with it each time  Knowing that Nabokov wrote this in English  despite English being his second  third  or fourth language  is so preposterous  as each page is filled with harmonious and phenomenally poetic sentences and descriptions  Humbert Humbert s affinity with young Lolita and the buoyancy of his concupiscent nature call for a compelling  and nonetheless contentious  story of love and tragedy  My favorite novel   No need to write a review for this classic  Just wonder why I didn t read this horribly beautiful book sooner   After watching the film which stars Jeremy Irons a number of years ago  I was very keen to read the book that the film was based on  The book is narrated by the character  Humbert Humbert  a middle aged man who is obsessed by the 12 year old  nymphet  Lolita  Nabokov successul walks the the fine line of covering such disturbing subject matter and creating a brilliant  funny and literary story  Every sentence paragraph is poetic  Nabokov is a beautiful writer Humbert Humbert is a fascinating character  As a reader  I was simultaneously horrified and repelled by his thoughts and actions but also charmed by his wit and language  He is a unreliable narrator and I found at times myself sympathising with him  about the way Lolita was treating him  only to come back to reality to see that I was reading this book through a twisted lens  that being  the eyes of Humbert  If you are a lover of language and words  this is a book for you  Listened to the audio book read by Jeremy Irons  Very well done  Definitely creepy Wow This story is not for everyone  IF you can get passed the gruesome subject matter  the book is beautifully written and disgustingly comedic Dopo averlo sentito lodare da chiunque  e arrivato anche il mio momento di dedicarmi a Lolita  La storia penso la conosciate ormai tutti  ma sicuramente chi non ha letto il romanzo non puo comprendere quanto la scrittura di Nabokov renda la vicenda ammaliante  Magnetica  Ipnotica  Ho divorato Lolita in due giorni  combattuta tra la voglia di sapere come finiva e la paura di arrivare all ultima pagina  Mi sono emozionata  ho persino provato compassione per Humbert Humbert  il protagonista  Lolita e un romanzo magnifico  e amore  e disperazione  e disgusto  e ammirazione  e malinconia  Nabokov e un genio Leggetelo   This book blew me away  I m a bit embarrassed to admit I hadn t read it before now  but better late than never  I m doing a whole blog post on this  but wanted to say I m in awe of Nabokov s ability to make HH even remotely sympathetic and to give us a picture of Lolita s distress in the margins  with a word or a phrase that HH passes over  Writers are often urged to eschew adverbs and limit adjectives  but Nabokov makes me want to pile them on  He can load a noun with three or four adjectives and create beautiful  evocative prose  A masterpiece  I heard once  read once   that Nabokov totally wrote this in another language and scrapped the whole project to rewrite in English since this kind of story was an American one   no arguing there  Lolita and Humbert come across  dark  flawed  crazed  and lovely  And N writes some of the best sentences I ve ever read  I read this on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles around Christmas 2002   This book is incredible  Nabokov takes something so ugly  so taboo and downright horrendous and transforms it into something beautiful  almost ethereal  His writing is pithy and at times elevated to a poetic prose that is inventive and completely awe inspiring  The subject matter is not something anyone WANTS to like  but that is the power of Nabokov  I couldn t put this book down   There will never be another book like Lolita  Within a couple of pages of the opening  the reader becomes aware that Nobokov is indeed among the cadre of the English language s most treasured writers  and Lolita is still at the vanguard of the cannon of great books  Gilding the lily aside  Lolita has to be a great book if one finds oneself sympathizing with the protagonist  a child molester  named Humbert Humbert  Nabokov s vocabulary certainly exceeds my own  I found myself consulting a dictionary more than once  In and of itself  such verbosity could seem pompous or bombastic  Such is not the case in this book however  Nabokov s words are chosen quite carefully to maximize the detail of the world he conjures  I ll conlude this review with the opening paragraph  which I believe illustrates my point beautifully  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita    Only a genius could craft a novel about a pedophile into a classic AND do it with dozens of instances of linguistic play that demonstrate a profound love of his adoptive language  Nabokov is one of my favorite Russians and the only novelist lepidopterist the world will ever know  GUYS I FINISHED IT   it was so worth it  I just  Wow I was wondering whether I should give this four or five stars but I went with five because I think the reason why I struggled to get through the book was due to my circumstances of working 30 hours in a week and being a bit down and not motivated rather than the book being bad as I flew through the beginning and the end I feel as if this book gets an undeserved bad rep due to it s content  yes it s horrible  yes it s unnerving and terrible and horrifying and demoralising but if you end up sympathising with the culprit  feeling for him and wishing the best for him   doesn t that just show how amazing the writing is I loved the writing style and once I got used to how poetic it was  it became accessible quite quickly  I m glad I powered through and didn t give up  Read it  It might just surprise you  I listened to Jeremy Iron s version of the audiobook  He is super  Whenever people talk about this book  they talk about a man has sex with a little girl  and how sinful it is  Yet  rarely I hear the true theme of the book   the pain of falling out of love  It starts with a very sexual and fun  Lion catching the Lamb  game  Then 1 3 down the road  the heart of the lion starts falling into pieces  And his whole life follows  The romance is gone  The sexual game becomes a bloodless slow kill  You watch a person die from inside out in the name of love  If there is sin in him  you will see it is all because he loves her  madly and deadly  LOLITA   ETSY  http   jessicaabates blogspot com 201   My book club chose to read this after my suggestion  and although I was worried people might be offended  or even disgusted  by the child lovin  going on here  they weren t  After the first few pages  I knew I was going to love this book  The tone and style are hypnotic  Most people actually finished this book in the book club and we had a hearty discussion  Definitely a great read  A tremendous prose gives us an insight into Humbert Humbert  the strangely likable  French gentleman  While the nature of the book is nefarious  Nabokov makes it so appealing   Such beautiful  eloquent  almost lyrical prose  combined with this dark and disturbing subject  Genius  It draws you in  seduces you  like any good predator  which is what H H  is  should  And English was Nabokov s   what   4th language  Having just finished reading  I can t even articulate a real review  I said before that I was both repulsed and intrigued by H H  and that did not change  You know he s despicable  but seeing inside his head  questioning his account of everything  watching him descend more into madness   I could not put the book down  I even felt sorry for him  It became almost a murder mystery thriller  made more so b c I read the Foreward after  I kept wondering what s going to happen next  What is Lo really up to  Is  Trapp  real or imagine  Are his recounts of her reactions real or what he wanted them to be  Which he later reazlized where probably a bit of both  Was he going to kill her to keep her at the nymphet age  immortalized  Was she only a replacement for Annabel  yes  probably   Of course  as the narrator  you can t trust a thing he says anyway  And how innocent was Lo in all of this  Does her age automatically exonerate her And in the end  this very sick man  who knew his faults  convinced himself  if not the reader  that he really  truly loved her  And in some morbid way  maybe he did  This book does change you  Makes you question the human psyche  How far will we go for  love   And who are we to quantify  or qualify  love for others  How far can obsession push us  Is that darkness in all of us  This is now on my list of favorite books   Reread  Reminded me how much I am in love with Nabokov  Lolita is purely a masterpiece  It is quite unusual to be put inside the mind of someone as sick as Humbert Humbert  a man who  while twisted in his logic  is able to articulate his reasoning  I believe that the reader is supposed to sympathize with Humbert despite his nymphomania and delusions  The reader is constantly torn between this desire and his sick behavior  The prose is outstandingly beautiful and to the point  There is not a wasted word or scene in the novel    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   E que tal li te ra tu ra  Um livro digno do nome  Lolita is one of those books which regularly gets a bad rap among non literary types   It s about a pedophile   they say   Child molestation   it s a depraved  terrible book   They re right  Lolita IS about a pedophile  It IS about child molestation  it is about a man taking advantage of a girl too young to know better  But it does not deserve the bad rap  and that is because this book overflows with literary exceptionalism  Each word of the prose has been handled with the utmost care   every phrase in Lolita flows with the smoothness and perfection of silk  Each metaphor and simile is carefully thought out and beautifully implemented  Nabokov s writing in this book is just superior  and there s no doubting it  Besides the prose  Lolita s emotional depth is stunning  Humbert Humbert s love for his young Lolita  however disturbing  cannot be denied in terms of pure raw emotion  The love he feels for her   and the love he felt for his Annabel so long before  It is a powerful sort of love  and it is definitely moving In short  GIVE LOLITA A CHANCE  Don t listen to those paranoid sheltering people  This is a wonderful book  however disturbing  And Humbert s thought processes and his powerful love may just be moving  There s little I can say about this book that hasn t been said  So instead  a question  is it just me  or was Humbert s friend neighbor Gustave Gaston also a pedophile  His love of young boys was mentioned numerous times  he knew all the names of the neighborhood boys  had an album full of pictures of them  and would ply them with candy and pocket money  a clear mirror of Humbert Lolita   Humbert obviously would not have considered himself even in the same league as Gaston  comparing young boys to his precious nymphets      so I could see him totally missing all these obvious signs while Gaston knew exactly what was going on  Understanding that this book has received quite a bit of backlash due to it s controversial nature  Nabokov is truly a gifted writer  The book transforms your surroundings and makes you feel like you are right there in the story  This is one of my favorite books and although the storyline is a bit bizarre  you must understand that it is art  This is a truly unique story and I ve enjoyed reading this book many  many times  This book is horrifying  Contrary to what you might think  the book is NOT pornography  You have probably heard the ideas in the story  12 year old girl lives with 40 year old man and they have a sexual relationship  While the topic of the novel is repulsive to most  that shouldn t keep you from the book  You are not meant to like the characters  especially Humbert Humbert   It is to drive you to be reflective about real life  Did you realize that one in three females has been sexually abused  That means the attitude of Humbert is a very common one among men  Here are some reflections on my reading of this amazing novel 1  Mankind is prone to some kind of service  The Christian will tell you that this is no surprise  since we are by nature religious creatures  We were made to serve the Living God of the Bible  and if we reject His authority over us and refuse to serve Him  we will invariably serve someone or something else  The problem is  only in serving God can you truly be free  Anything else is slavery  Humbert is a slave to his lust after little girls  Lolita is a slave to the whims of the abusive adults in her life  Her mother abused her first by neglect and contempt  and it goes downhill from there 2  Family matters  Through the book there is never any mention of a family in which there is true nurture of its members  unless you think of Lolita s marriage at the end as a happy one   Everyone is driven by selfishness  If you are focused on getting the things that you want  you will destroy yourself and everyone around you  In a family  however  love requires us to be oriented toward the good of other people  In fact  true love is self giving  of which Jesus is the supreme example   Humbert  along with all the other major characters in the book  is self seeking  A healthy view of the family is a powerful tool in fighting the rottenness of this story 3  Morality and beauty are not mutually exclusive  The opposite idea  that they ARE mutually exclusive  drives the narrative of the story  Humbert faces this idea head on at one poignant point toward the end of the story  His guilt over his lifestyle drives him to seek out a priest  for whom he has great respect   After all the priest does for him  he ends up rejecting the possibility of redemption on account of the incompatibility of morality and beauty  He d rather destroy himself and others seeking beauty than submit to some ugly morality  Compare this to what David wrote in Psalm 19  the rules of the Lord are more to be desired than gold  are sweeter than the honeycomb  and in keeping them is great reward  In the Bible wisdom is a beautiful thing  consider the queen of Sheba s reaction to Solomon s wisdom in 1 Kings 10   and the only way to be wise is to revel in the law of God  Only a fool would turn away from that fact  a fool like Humbert 4  Your children are in danger  After reading this book  it is hard to bring yourself to trust any male  or any little girl for that matter  How can you raise a child in this world with the rampant sexual longings of so many horrible men in the world  It could make you turn into a recluse  sheltering your children so that they never interact with anyone unknown  the problem there is that most sexual abuse is perpetrated by the closest people to the victim    The only thing you can do is trust the Lord  that He will watch over your family  Pray tons  Check your own motives  Keep short accounts of your sin  Have sex with your wife often As I wrote  this is a horrifying book  You should read it  Nabokov reviewed it best in his afterword  Where I m at now after having just finished it  assigning adjectives and picking precise words to summarize and entice would feel like rearranging phrases on a fridge  Too much an opposite exercise to a new favorite of mine and one that I ll look forward to reading again in the future  Despite the controversial subject matter  the author has an amazing propensity for interjecting puns at every turn of the page  Listening to the audiobook I found myself frequently hitting rewind to listen again to a subtle bit of humor amidst the tawdry action  Nabokov is wonderful at painting a scene allowing the reader  listener  to feel as if they are there feeling the emotions and seeing the surroundings  His use of humor  despite being written over 50 years ago  is still very amusing in present time I imagine the topic has kept many readers from enjoying this book  but I would tell them that there is no graffic sexual content in this book  somewhat to my disappointment  and the delicate subject is handled with the utmost taste  I found Nabokovs style of writing to be much more enjoyable than any Hemingway that I have read  Don t be afraid to read this book  you will thank yourself for enjoying a great piece of literature  What can i say   I have read it several times  Will be reading Lolita many more times again  Man rubbed two stones together and created fire  Nabokov did it again with Lolita   so brilliant it made me nauseous  Wow  It s a strange feeling to be amazed at both how good and how creepy a book can be at the same time  Add to that the AWESOME narrator of the audio book version  and it s a recipe for a GREAT read listen  Wow  I m still trying to process everything  This really was a GREAT book  and for sure in the top five of books read this year for me  It s either you think Lolita seduced Humbert  or vice versa My personal opinion  I despise Humbert  DESPISE him  His justification for his actions  his washing of hands  his self pity  are just so sickening  Think of the black widow  carefully and slyly inviting the fly to her web  He is the black widow  and she is the fly who willingly walks into the seemingly innocent web  Humbert is so self delusional  I can t even begin to describe how much I loathe him No matter how we romanticize the story  it all goes down to this   he was an adult and she was a child  The writing is brilliant and disturbing  and stands the test of time  but it s not something that I can read again  Yes  the use of language in this book was as sublime and clever as I had heard  How sympathetic we are to the story s teller  how relatable he is despite his loathsome qualities  Forget every review  scathing or promotional  that you have ever heard  and read this novel  It is a brilliant study of literature  narration  language  love  Well  already I am overdoing it  Go on  High on the list of the greatest Novels written in English  Humbert H is one of the greatest characters ever created  mordantly funny  brutally honest  gloriously corrupt  The sequence where he and Lolita travel across the country from motel to motel is stunning  Lolita is shocking  funny  sad  wise  brutally satiric of the USA inn the fifties   but most of all its gloriously beautiful language elevates it to try literature  For a special treat listen to the audio version by Jeremy Irons which is fantastic This is a novel I will never forget  In exquisitely crafted language Nabokov charts the doomed obsession of a narcissistic psychopath and his  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul   To begin with  the incandescent beauty of the author s writing has left me totally flabbergasted  Every page is larded with magical  hysterical and heartbreaking prose  The main characters in Lolita are also incredibly sophisticated  Lolita  far from being perfect or sexually advanced  is actually a typical impudent twelve year old  shallow  keen on popular culture  brazen  manipulative and a wee bit unhygienic  The character of Humbert too is intensely complex and very skillfully explored  To the outside world  he is a suave cosmopolitan intellectual with movie star good looks  Nabokov ingeniously shows us HH s dark side as a pedophile as well a violent man with an unsavory mentality  unable to form proper relationships  is perhaps delusional  and clearly believes he can be in love with a child  Moreover  what makes Lolita a novel of rare brilliance is the fact that we are reading about a pedophile from the perspective of a pedophile  Delving into the mind of our perverse main character  while an utterly sickening experience  is absolutely fascinating from a psychological perspective  As for its oh so dreadful subject  I agree that you cannot truly appreciate and value literature unless it falls into your pattern of political correctness or socially acceptable theme  Now  look at Lolita this way  if the subject displeases you to the brink of a nervous breakdown  what you re reading might actually be good enough to deserve your thorough attention and examination  Lolita is a jewel While finishing Lolita  it was strikingly obvious to me why it is considered a classic  The language used in this book is what really stood out for me  In the first half  or so  of the novel  though we know that main character is a paedophile  there is something about his narration that makes you take his side  in a way   and then in turn you feel guilty about it  which I m sure is a clever trick by Nabokov  In the second half of the book  the language turns and becomes much harsher and Humbert starts exposing himself for what he really is  The way that this is executed was brilliant and I really enjoyed this book  I can see why it is considered a masterpiece by many   Most books that I read are disgusting  but know they are so and don t show any shame  The books aren t dressed up or cloaked in some sort of other genre  instead the relish in the disgusting messes that they are  Unapologetic  they are what they are and do not deny it Lolita  is something else  It doesn t try to be anything different  all the while not admitting how disgusting it is  The actions  the scenes  every bit that is just revolting is   well it isn t revolting  The prose is so beautiful  it is romanticized that the moment you realize what he is really saying  makes one double take the entire passage  I read that many people see this book as a romance  and some even lower their rating because how unlike a romance it is  I went in with no expectations of such  Merely a brief understanding of a pedophile and his love  and that was that  The only romance is one sided and for the vast majority of the book  is acknowledged less in love and more in lust  Even in these  romance  portions  the love is won by blackmail  by bribes  by any means necessary  The most cruel portions is that he sees every detail  and yet never sees her pain that he is causing  Actually that is a lie  there are brief one sentence passages in which he does mention her suffering  but throws it over his shoulder in favor of his own emotions  It isn t until later on that such things come to light  and I won t go so far into the book to spoil such things  Amazing work of genius   I m tempted to say it s been overwhelmed by its subject  but I suppose one can t separate the book from its reputation  Still  the book is much more about language and writing than it is about sex or pedophilia  Yet there it is again  that controversial material interfering with a book about playing with words  The audio version is a treat because Jeremy Irons makes an uncomfortably urbane Humbert  a man in perfect control of everything but one young girl  Of course it s outrageous and offensive  but it should be read  Not being a French speaker  and being 19 at the time I read it  I found this book immensely difficult  That s not to say it wasn t satisfying  From the very beginning  indeed  the first paragraph  the language is enticing  I plan on rereading this book when I m old enough to really get it   E ora voglio rivolgere un monito al lettore  affinche non si prenda gioco di me e della mia nebbia mentale  E facile per lui e per me decifrare adesso un destino ormai compiuto  ma un destino in fieri non e  credetemi  uno di quegli onesti gialli in cui basta tener d occhio gli indizi  In gioventu lessi una volta un romanzo poliziesco francese in cui gli indizi erano addirittura in corsivo  ma non e questo il sistema di McFatum   per quanto si possa imparare a riconoscere certi segni oscuri  Ammetto di aver iniziato Lolita con un po  di titubanza  Non sapevo cosa aspettarmi  mi inoltravo in un territorio straniero senza alcuna nozione reale ma con tanti  ho sentito dire   e in generale non mi piacciono le sorprese  a meno che non siano piacevoli  ma gia ho detto una banalita e considerando che sono solo alla quinta riga o giu di li questo non e quello che chiamerei un inizio promettente Mi sforzero di fare un po  d ordine  Non voglio perdermi in ovvieta come la trama  notissima  o la definizione di ninfetta o altre cose del genere  In questa recensione  il mio unico scopo sara semplicemente quello di parlarvi della mia  Lolita   delle mie impressioni  dei miei pensieri  che e poi  data la mia detestabile mancanza di obiettivita  quello che faccio in ogni recensione  Percio  cominciamo Per me Lolita e stato all inizio scetticismo  poi divertimento  in un certo senso  ma solo per i primi capitoli  dall entrata in scena della ninfetta per eccellenza ad averla vinta e stata la tristezza  Sebbene la piccola Lolita sia una scapestrata  maleducata  imberbe dodicenne e ispiri a primo acchito non poca antipatia  e una figura compiangere  Compiangere  e un verbo che  con tutta la gamma dei suoi sinonimi  ho sempre odiato  Cerco di non usarli mai  Stavolta e necessario A Lolita e stata sottratta l adolescenza  la sua vita e irrimediabilmente segnata da quell anno di viaggio con il suo patrigno in giro per l America  Quando si stabiliscono in una cittadina perbene e lei ricomincia ad andare a scuola  mentre e costretta a subire la sempre piu pressante gelosia di Humbert  il suo sguardo si posa sulle altre ragazzine della sua eta  che vivono serene con padri  madri  fratelli e sorelle  quando lei  la ribelle Dolly che litigava sempre con la mamma    non ha nulla    Eppure non ci si sente autorizzati a condannare lui  Humbert Humbert  il pedofilo  Perche Ed ecco  signore e signori  la magia Io sono e resto convinta che il merito sia della penna di Nabokov  una penna di una raffinatezza e ricercatezza rare  le parole si adattano perfettamente alla forma e al significato del periodo  uniformandoglisi  il verbo inglese  to fit  mi sembra che renda meglio l idea  sia per suono che per significato  Con una naturalezza sconcertante questi vocaboli eleganti danzano sulla pagina a formare non semplici frasi ma idee  e il lettore non puo far altro che immergersi in questo lago di lettere e annegare  La ragione ottenebrata  Ogni criterio di giudizio inibito  Le colpe di tutti sono assolte  L unico merito e suo  di Nabokov  Non ci puo essere giustificazione per la pedofilia  in nessun modo  eppure Humbert fa tenerezza  Egli ha semplicemente bisogno di Lolita al fine di soddisfare le sue voglie  ma ne e innamorato  follemente  tanto che quando dopo tre anni di separazione la ritrova  sposata e ormai diciassettenne  arriva a dirle   Lolita  forse questo non sta ne in cielo ne in terra  ma devo dirlo  La vita e molto breve  Da qui a quella vecchia macchina che conosci cosi bene ci saranno venti  venticinque passi  E  un tragitto brevissimo  Falli  quei venticinque passi  Subito  Immediatamente  Vieni cosi come sei  E vivremo per sempre felici e contenti        Voglio che tu lasci il tuo occasionale Dick  e questa topaia orrenda  e che venga a vivere con me  e a morire con me  e tutto con me   Per questa ragione  per la forza annichilente di questo stile fluido e perfetto  io credo che alla fin fine Lolita non voglia approdare a nessuna morale  E  una cosa un tantino azzardata da dire  forse  ma non arrivo ad altra conclusione  Nabokov era troppo intelligente per essere all oscuro del suo potere ammaliatore Perche per me Lolita e un capolavoro  Per l introspezione  per l intera rosa dei personaggi  piu di tutti H H   Dolores Haze e la madre di lei  Charlotte  per la struttura del romanzo in se  che nelle sue incalzanti anacronie mostra un ordine maniacale  e per lo stile inconfondibile che ho gia imparato ad amare  CLASSIC   Honestly  I loved this book and I don t care  It s fascinating getting into the mind of someone so abnormal  humans generally are fascinated by the strange  People will happily watch Dexter and enjoy hating a villain  and I feel the same can be said for Humbert Humbert  It is in many parts disturbing  and I found myself repeatedly putting the book down at times  However Nabokov is an amazing writer and managed to get me caught up in the whole of it  lovely  the subject matter of course is controversial  vying with the traditional  collective view of the relationship shared by lolita and humbert  and the other sided existence of the lonely  maddened narrator  take it for its content  or take it for its prose  often breathtaking  often shocking  always beautiful  I don t know what to think lmao   Vedete  io l amavo  Era amore a prima vista  a ultima vista  a eterna vista E un libro pazzesco  Meraviglioso  E  allo stesso tempo  un libro che ti lascia spiazzata nel momento in cui ti ritrovi a dover dare un tuo giudizio personale  Ti ritrovi a pensare  che assurda malattia ho per trovare spettacolare la storia di un pedofilo che si innamora perdutamente di Lolita  a cui ruba tutta la sua adolescenza    Eppure  lettore malato o sano di mente  non puoi fare a meno di amare questo libro  Non puoi fare a meno di divorarlo  Di lasciarti divorare dall amore  dalla passione  dalla gelosia  dalla disperazione di Humbert  Non ne puoi fare a meno  Tanto da ritrovarti a finire questo libro in soli quattro giorni  Nabokov ti cattura  ti parla continuamente con i suoi  lettore capiscimi  presta attenzione  etc  Ti fa sentire parte di quella giuria che arrivera a giudicare il folle pedofilo  o  guaritore  come lui stesso si definisce  e ti senti come una pecora nera  come fuori dal coro perche non riesci ad essere imparziale  Non riesci a vedere a pieno la sua follia  Ti leghi  soffri  lo compatisci  ti incazzi  provi un senso di tenerezza nell epilogo delle sue memorie  Provi anche odio nei suoi confronti  Ma un odio non abbastanza forte da farti chiudere il libro e farti smettere di leggere  An uncomfortable book to read but a masterpiece and the writing was absolutely brilliant An amazing book for anyone who isn t afraid to read about the deviant and darker side of human nature  The subject matter of this novel may make some uncomfortable  but when one can look into Lolita  then it is easy to appreciate the storyline and the rich character depth and development  The psychology in Lolita will be able to peek any person s interest and will also force the reader to confront questions of immorality  love  and obsession   Below  all the text between         is by Bonnie Cherry  A friend of mine who wrote these words and quoted from Nobokov after having read Lolita a few weeks ago  It was after reading these words from Bonnie that prompted me to read Lolita and I am so glad I did  Thanks for the unintentional recommendation Bonnie     It was  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms  she was always Lolita        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns    Vladimir Nabokov   Lolita I finished  Lolita  this weekend  sitting on the floor of my hallway  I leaned my forehead against the wall and cried  and cried  and whimpered  and cried I promptly left my apartment to get roaringly drunk downtown  my mind couldn t process what my guts were feeling  The book was done  I felt that I d lost a lover  father    and I needed immediate distraction  Solitude was corrupting me  I needed company and care  My heart was a hysterical  unreliable organ    vnI tried to talk about Lo all weekend long  I wanted to know why the experience felt so personal  Why I felt so empty but so overwhelmed  Between rolling their eyes and discreetly texting under cupped hands and cafe tables  I don t think my audiences had much sympathy or patience for my troubles Even now  I feel as if I can t make my words work for me  I feel as if all of my clothes have stopped fitting  I feel bored by food  I feel melancholy and impatient when other people speak   Yes  that is very nice  but you see I am desolate   I just want to sleep  I can t read anything new  how can I  Everything else feels like a rebound  It s being knocked back down to the minors after playing for the Yankees  A consolation prize  A day old bagel  The younger dudes you use and discard after the dissolution of your marriage  She groped for words  I supplied them mentally   He broke my heart  You merely broke my life    vnWas I so thoroughly seduced by his words that I was able to forget what a monster Humbert Humbert really was  Was I weeping for Lolita s destroyed childhood  Mine  For huge  tender  anguished longing  Did I want to be loved like that  Had I been loved like that  Was that love  What is love  anyway  And is love always  good   Is love always  right   Will I ever feel it for someone  The kind of love I would follow into exile  It was love at first sight  and last sight  at ever and ever sight   vnSometimes we are so desperate for love that we are willing to abuse or take abuse in order to feel loved  Sometimes we need so badly that the abuse starts to feel like love  Sometimes we need so badly that we forget why we love in the first place  Have you ever looked across the table at the object of your frustrated  obsessive longings and realized you had no idea who they were  Who they voted for  Whether they want babies  or enjoy the taste of cilantro  or fear death  Have you kept on longing  anyway  So selfish  We  I  are  am  so selfish   I don t care if it hurts you  I need  We don t choose who we fall in love with  It feels so silly to have just realized this  when I did  I laughed and cried and was nauseous  You don t decide who to love  how terrifying  This realization feels like a threat  It feels ominous  But it is ominous like an asteroid  or 2012  or a brain tumor  so why worry  I can t help it  If it happens  it happens  This is how I would be destroyed  I am thinking of aurochs and angels  the secret of durable pigments  prophetic sonnets  the refuge of art  And this is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita    vnWhen it comes down to it  I think that I am overwhelmed and aroused and frightened by the beauty and power of words  I have read  aloud  the opening paragraphs to this book over eighty times this week  And I give myself goosebumps every time  It feels like obsessive lust  I can t think of anything else now but the words words words I want to wallow in  I want to devour every part of them until they become a part of me  I want to cancel obligations and forsake other lovers in order to indulge this one  I m so grateful for this feeling  it is a feeling I ve had once  maybe twice ever  And there s so much to read  While the blood still throbs through my writing hand  you are still as much a part of blessed matter as I am  and I can still talk to you     vnI may be taking one step back into the fishbowl  and it may be my own mind spinning a cocoon around itself again  I haven t decided yet whether carrying on passionate love affairs with the turgid words of very dead dudes is healthy  But it is dark and exciting  Life is so rich  mysterious  and complicated    At this or that twist of it I feel my slippery self eluding me  gliding into deeper and darker waters than I care to probe   vn       Bonnie Cherry 8 5 08   Nabokov is incredible  This book is incredible 7 20 08   I started this last night and am incredibly excited about getting into it  A very cool guy named Jacob is lending it to me  which is very nice  Also  he turns 30 a few days before I turn 21  so that adds to it for me at least a teeny tiny bit  Also  he s very cute and smart and likes books  I guess it would make sense at this point to also mention for those of you who don t know that I broke up with my boyfriend  Yeah  The Tautology of NamesVictor Hugo s Jean Valjean s name is almost a tautology  Valjean is everyman  the anonymous  the ignored  the unknown other amidst us  like Nabokov s criminal hero in his novel Despair  Hermann Hermann  or  approximately  Mr Man Mr Man  What of Humbert Humbert  Wikipedia tells me  Humbert is a Germanic given name  from hun  warrior   It can be extended to  beautiful warrior       Or  bright  warrior as in Al bert  etc  So Hum bert Hum bert is the doubled tautological barbarian warrior bringing end of days to the nauseating world of the normal  Or is he the quintessential warrior against all values  Is he the barbarian at the gates of civilization  Is he that barbarian warrior finally past Europe  now decadent and beautiful  and about to devour and corrupt young beautiful America  the one interpretative political equation for the novel s symbolism of young and old   What is he  The very opposite of the everyman in any case  The bright scar and not the normal graze  The publicly prosecuted  the un ignorable  the known Other  I feel like my best endorsement of this book comes from the fact that I am willing to rate it highly despite what my friends may think Nabakov s language is distractingly beautiful  It is so caprivating that it can cause you to occasionally believe that this is a story of two people whose love transcends the world  You plummet from that glorious height with your stomach turning in nauseating loops when you recall that this is the story of a man who takes advantage of a pre teen girl I have never been so simultaneously transported and appalled by a book  Lolita is a truly amazing work because of its capacity to spark such a wide range of emotions and reactions  I wasn t expecting a lot from this book and just wanted to expand my reading horizons  I ended up really enjoying Lolita and loved the writing style and quirks along the way  It revolves around some controversial societal ideas but I love how it addresses them and opens the reader up to new perspectives   I can remember attempting to read Lolita when I was in my mid teens  It was too young  I became creeped out by Humbert s overwhelming sense of possessiveness  and gave up for a few years  When I went back  I was 18 or so and far too old for him  I m glad I did  but I see how the fiction of his experience could have warped a few young minds   I think I recall using Laughter in the Dark as a gateway back  where at least everyone was a consenting adult  The book itself shows what is essentially a failed relationship  Humbert s philosophy is the only one we are shown  but Lolita s is easily parsed when you re read between his lines  She hates every minute of it  aside from the brief moments of stolen freedom and a few wistful  Daddy daughter  roleplays  The love Humbert supposes he is feeling is lust coupled with an inability to progress emotionally  He is smart  intellectual and able to make his way in the world  but is not capable of coping in adult ways  Delores is a pawn to his inability to live as an adult with adult interactions  There is a concrete co dependence that develops  forced on her side and cherished on Humbert s  She is trapped in a very adult situation with a man who downplays her every attempt to seek help  Her age and the shell of cool disaffectation she has grown bars her from being taken seriously  The audacity of Humbert s plan  Nabokov s thrilling extended hostage situation  would sound unbelievable except in a novel  The sexual demands Humbert pressed on her created a change in her attitude and personality  somewhat transforming her into the imagined Lolita he wanted  Delores Haze was a girl with a single mother and innocence disguised by imitations of sexy actresses  Lolita was a broken young woman without the ability to trust anyone  and willing to escape with yet another abuser I think the level of enjoyment that can be taken from this strangely slow but very tense road trip is where many people grow most uncomfortable  We see the setup  the kidnapping and the rape of a young girl presented in a way that emphasizes the satisfaction Humbert feels in getting what he wants  The thrills that would normally be spent seeing the victim s efforts to get away are focused on Humbert s efforts to keep Lolita  The coiled tension is the moment when Lolita may report she is being kidnapped  but the accompanying relief is that Humbert has convinced her to remain silent  From his perspective  in that moment  it probably would have felt like a kind of permission from the universe to carry on The confessional writing is an admission of bias in the story  and Humbert makes no secret he is baffled by Lolita s inner thoughts when he recognizes they exist  Her intelligence is maligned  but really it would suit her to play stupid for Humbert  He might be able to take from her sexually  but she can deny him satisfying companionship  She is  unsurprisingly  treated like an object  The fine language and poignant anecdotes Humbert discloses don t counteract his crimes  Previous tragedy in formative years is not an excuse for creating other tragedies  The modern trend toward anti heroes comes to mind  but Humbert is no hero  We know from the first pages that he is writing from jail and expects to die in prison  More than that  he is finally sorry for what he has done to Delores  I can see how readers might be fooled by Humbert in some passages  because the definition of love is ultimately sincere in whoever feels it  Humbert is not likeable  but he is witty  He is entirely human  which moves the reader to hate what he does  who he is  but most of all question why he couldn t turn his self awareness to rehabilitation  He has genuine moments of remorse and caring about her  but only under the most extreme circumstances  There is a lot of flashy scandal to be found in Lolita  but I think I relate to it on the level of acknowledging that every person has a life story that builds to their rise or fall  Humbert is ultimately given a mighty fall  and more than that  he is finally able to recognize he earned his end  As a morality tale it has a lot of unreliable narration  but Humbert s weaknesses catch up and devour him  Redemption doesn t quite arrive  but it definitely might have with a little more time and work from HH The metaphorical relationship between old world and new is a little more personal from the author  As such  I think I ve likely missed some of it  I did enjoy that aspect  and the pre fab splendor and trashy joy of the American landscape  The hidden picture of an older academic moving to the U S  and looking at all the overblown brightness is echoed in Humbert s spotting the nymphette Delores  Amusingly  I can see the humour for Nabokov in making his metaphorical player a brilliant but sissy pedophile  The book reviews of the time must have made him chuckle  I can see why some people could never read this book  and others feel badly about enjoying it  For me  I think it contains a very nuanced character study of a man too weak and despoiled to be called a monster  Delores  and her story  is ruined in the process but that is a good deal of the point Humbert is skewered upon   There s a beetle browed  manipulative  and allegedly irresistible elephant in the room one must deal with when discussing Lolita  but you know what  I don t care  Literally  I could not care less about this awful man  not for his lies  his excuses  his clever wordplay  not even for the way he spends an entire novel making excuses and begging forgiveness after he kidnaps  blackmails  and sexually abuses his adolescent stepdaughter The adolescent stepdaughter is who I want to talk about  We only get to see Dolores as a concept  as an arc as she is eclipsed by Humbert s desires and visions of a compliant  even seductive   car pet   Dolores s private life  her inner machinations and clever escape of Humbert  only to run into the arms of a mirror image monster  are ignored in favor of the witty portrayal of vacuous teenyboppers Now  every time I read Lolita  I get something else out of it  the wordplay  the metaphors    but never do I see a tragedy  a love story  a guilt ridden conscience  The teenage cult that follows Lolita almost exclusively on tumblr blogs has a penchant for romanticizing the age gap and the brutality and the aforementioned irresistible Old World educator  Lolita is brilliant  it s sharp  with beautiful writing and a heroine who goes through a reverse metamorphosis so quietly you d almost miss it  but the second you fall for Humbert or blame Dolores or find yourself flipping pages of a romance novel  you re pretty much reading the wrong book   Nabokov  Vladimir  Lolita  1955      A masterpiece on several levelsVladimir Nabokov s Lolita is one of those rare books that is both a commercial and an artistic masterpiece  Like Joyce s Ulysses it is a tour de force of language seldom encountered in English outside the works of Shakespeare  It is a carefully crafted novel rich in irony and atmosphere  a novel of great psychological insight and poignancy  a novel to rival the masters of the nineteenth century and those of the twenty first  Some have called it  The Great American Novel   that mythical tome of authorial genius that everybody was trying to write after the Second World War  and the best novel about America ever penned  Certainly Lolita can feel comfortable alongside The Scarlet Letter  Huck Finn  Moby Dick and a few others as a top drawer classic of American literature Of course what sets Lolita apart from other novels  at least at the time of its publication in the fifties  is its theme  A grown man making love to a pre adolescent girl was quite a shock for a prudish America weaned on Ozzie and Harriet and Dwight Eisenhower  As such it was a courageous novel and a bit of a derring do  It was the novel of a man ravenous for the fame and fortune he thought his talent so richly deserved  and so he took a chance  Originally Nabokov had intended to withhold his name from the title page while dispersing throughout the narrative cryptic evidences of his presence  should he later want to claim authorship  but somehow  even before the novel s first publication in France  he was persuaded to admit paternity  Even so he remained uneasy about Lolita throughout most of his life  maintaining that other  less appreciated works of his were superior  especially Ada and Pnin  while insisting that Humbert Humbert  his nymphet enchanted antihero  was no part of himself  merely a puppet on the master s string  After the rush of fame had subsided and he was comfortably ensconced en chateau with his fortune  Nabokov even grew weary of the attention Lolita commanded from critics and public alike  attention he saw as detrimental to his scholarly work  his autobiography  the splendid Speak  Memory  and his other works of fiction  I wouldn t be at all surprised to learn that more than once he spoke aloud the ancient warning and lamentation   Beware of what you wish for  You may get it  Still  one can survive such annoyances  and nowhere in Nabokov s life was he seen as more than slightly troubled by the very real belief that such a penetrating revelation of character  Humbert s  could only be achieved by having part of that character as one s own  This he denied to his dying day  as well he might and should  The  biographical fallacy  has a place in literary criticism  perhaps  but not here  His denial  while politically correct  was unnecessary since girls are desirable  and one can feel that desire without being a lecher  What is needed is the understanding  as with avocados and the rising of the sun  that there is a time appropriate to every purpose While reading Lolita for the first time  as with any rich piece of literature  do yourself a favor and don t try to catch all the subtleties  Just read it through  Those familiar with Nabokov know full well that he plays games with the reader just as he does with his characters  He likes to show off  and besides few of us are as erudite as the very learned professor himself  You might want to take a note or two to record how you feel about Humbert and his little charge  and then compare those notes to how you feel after a second reading  Like others  I found myself moved from the amusement and tolerance of a first reading to a fully sober appreciation  after a second reading  of what a  brute   Lo s fair description  Humbert Humbert really is  It is a curious coincidence perhaps  but this is exactly what happened with the cinematic interpretations of the novel  The first  by Kubrick from the sixties  is a brilliant comedy that has us identifying with the tragedy of Hum s obsession  while the second  Adrian Lyne s more graphic recent production  makes it clear how violated and used and ultimately destroyed Lolita really was If you re writing a paper  buy the annotated Lolita with notes by Alfred Appel Jr  Although the annotations add only a little to an enjoyment of the novel  and in some cases seem a bit of a pedantic stretch  they will satisfy a scholastic urge    a review by Dennis Littrell Hail Nabokov for his amazing vocabulary  But the important thing that makes this book is so famous  remember the term Lolita Complex   and critically acclaimed is his taboo subject  an old man who passionately falls in love with a little girl  Humbert Humbert is nuts  yes he is  you can sense it from his first line  He marries Lolita s mother in order to get closer to Lolita  Crazy  insane  you name it  This is not a horror novel  yet reading Lolita gave me this bizarre feeling in my spine  It s amazing how a made up story could influence someone like that  Until the end  there is one question left unanswered  at least for me   is it really love or is it just passion  Sometimes you cannot differentiate it though      This one is a winner  but you already knew that   At some point  my father told me that his mother would not allow him to read Lolita  I cannot remember if it was before or after I chanced upon the Jeremy Irons rendition of the film  Either way  that started my love affair of Lolita  Something that could grab my father s attention  bring my grandmother s disapproval  and capture Jeremy Irons had to be worthwhile  However  for some reason or the other  I never got around to reading the book  A few weeks ago  after reading an article on my phone  Lolita was brought back to my mind  Spending a few minutes on my local library s website  I was happy to learn that they had a copy of the book  And thus began my adventure with Lolita and the lovelorn Humbert Humbert Lolita is a hard book to discuss  The subject matter alone is enough to cause one to curl their toes in disgust  The idea of a 37 year old man falling in love with a 12 year old girl is rather startling  More so was his devious way of getting close to the young girl  becoming her stepfather  and taking her on a cross country road trip after her mother died  However  for all of the fault people can and will find with this book  I found myself enjoying it  Vladimir has a way with words  The prose in this book is simply remarkable  Even though  at some level  I wanted to despise Humbert  I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for him at the end  To me  that is the mark of a master storyteller Reading a lot of reviews  people are torn between the true villain in the story  Some believe that Humbert was just Lolita s victim and not at fault for his actions  While some view him as the ultimate sexual predator  While I read this book  I kept both view points in mind  and I think both parties fall short  Even though his actions were deplorable  I place a lot of the blame with Lolita s mother  Charlotte  I am not sure where it started  but  by the time Humbert enters the picture  Charlotte seems to be fostering severe feelings of hate for her daughter  She is constantly picking on Lo  she fills out surveys to describe the girl as horrid  she makes of a point of calling Lo  plain   and so on  When it is obvious that something might be brewing between Humbert and Lo  she quickly sends the girl away to summer camp because she does not want competition for the affections of a handsome European  Further  she seeks to send Lo away to a boarding school until she graduates  Even Humbert himself remarks on these actions towards the girl  When Charlotte discovers incriminating evidence in Humbert s desk  she still seeks to blame the child Coming from a family life where she lost her father at a young age and living with a mother who hates her  it is easy to see why Lo grabs onto Humbert  He is a dashingly good looking European male  He seems charming and gives her attention  He does not scold her for normal childlike behavior  It makes sense to me that she would flirt with him and so forth  However  at some level  I think she knew full well what game she was playing  That being said  at 12 years old  she had not way to understand the ramifications of the game  And  as the story progresses  I was left to wonder whether the child was horribly damaged by other past occurrences  things that would make a young girl think the only way to get attention from a male was through sex None of this is to say that Humbert was in the right  From the onset of the book  he makes it clear that he knew he was in the wrong  Knowing and continuing to act on something is disgusting  Further  his constant justifications disturbed me  Just because a love affair with a 12 year old was common in the Middle Ages doesn t mean it is acceptable now   Also  the comment about Sade s Justine made my skin crawl   At many points during the book  I found myself wishing that Lo would tell one of her friends or someone would find out  It was not fair to rob Lo of a childhood  because Humbert was in love with her  That being said  I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for Hum at the end of the book The beginning and ending of this book will stay with me  I am not sure how to describe the ending without giving anything away  Let s just say  when all was said and done  in his own way  Hum truly loved his Lolita I truly loved this book  It is hard to read and not for the faint of heart  I would not suggest this book to most people  however  if you can get by the subject matter  I think it is well worth the read   Might be the most gorgeous prose I ve ever read  Actually quite funny too  in a dark way   A hard read  Strange to say that  Yet I can see why this is considered a classic  Nabokov writes masterfully on a subject as controversial when this book came out as it is today   Let me say that the ending was rather disappointing  but everything else was exquisitely expressed  This is one of Nabokov s most lyrical works  Humbert Humbert is too pathetic to hate  yet he is despicable  He is one of literature s more complex anti heroes  Lolita is intriguing as well  the reader can t really tell who she is because H H  is an unreliable narrator  He alternately shows us a vulnerable young girl  a rebellious teen  and a sexually curious nymphet  Recommended to those who love words  complex characters of dubious character  and controversial literature   Lolita     Ahhh the infamous  Lolita   Just got done reading this amazing book  Tbh words cannot explain how truely amazing this book is and how unbelieving talented writer Vladimir Nabokov is  Instead of praising this masterpiece it ll be easier for me to praise the author  Nabokov is so talented that I actually shed a few tears in that chapter where  my beloved  H H asks Lolita to leave her husband for him and she says no  And no matter how weird it sounds I have to let it out  I have a little crush on Prof Humbert Humbert  Yes there i said it  I know he is wrong but the passion with which he loved  HIS  lolita is truely amazing  Isn t that what every girl wants from their man   He ALWAYS used terms of endearment while talking about his nymphet and his love was pure and true  I think it only proves how talented Nabokov is    he is making me crush on a pedophile and sympathise with him  The character is so passionate and romantic in its own twisted way  I don t think I can say anything else about this book except that it s one of the best books I ve read ever  and I m glad I didn t miss this one out My only complaint is that some of the language were too    um  gorgeous or  fancy  for me haha  I actually had to see a chapterwise summary online to understand what the hell was happening  This made me want to stop reading the book at times  but thank god I didn t  It was totally worth my time  Lolita  My favorite of all time  A tremendously beautifully written novel  I don t really understand people who give this anything but five stars  What are they looking for from literature  Can they do better  Review Nabokov s Lolita  I am not worthy  A seasoned marathon reader  I can only read this book in small increments  Nabokov s viceral  passionate voice guts me  and it will gut you  too  Make no mistake  nothing about this book is for the faint of heart  That said  I can t recommend Lolita highly enough   I abstained from this book for a long time because I somehow carelessly gathered opinions that it was not the kind of book I d want to read  These opinions were false and I feel it has something to do with the cultural implementation of the word  Lolita  placed on anyone who is young  female  and promiscuous In reality  the book is barely about that kind of girl and written so beautifully that I didn t realize it until I tried to read something else and was extremely disappointed I still wasn t reading Lolita  This is one of my all time favourite books     I ve always been drawn to books that cause debate and get people riled up  so when I stumbled across  Lolita  I had to buy it straight away   The first thing I noticed was how beautifully it was written the words seemed to flow unlike some classic books which are frustrating and seem to start and stop quite bluntly   Humbert Humbert is one of the strangest characters I ve ever come across   I went into the book determined to hate him and found that I really liked him I had to stop and remind myself frequently what type of person he was   Lolita was a complex character   she could be spoilt and bratty and manipulative   if we believe Humbert is telling the truth   and it s only occasional things that bring you back down to earth and remind you how young and vunerable she is   It s towards the end of the book that Humbert   and me too  saw the tradgedy of it all   there s a haunting poem   I won t go into detail as I don t want to spoil anything  that really hit home   This book makes you think about things differently and question things   you come out of it with a new view point  I would recommend it to anyone   your missing

HH s real crime  as he comes to realize too late  is robbing young Delores of the very youth which he prizes so much in her  Plenty of literary tricks and plenty more  I m sure  that I missed  Will have to check out the annotated version some time  First novel where I thought a masterful author created a dreamscape in a second language that a native writer simply could not  Also tells you a whole lot about it s time   how even such an odd and controversial protagonist could be portrayed in a way that could get published  Even so  in some ways epitomizes creepy  creepy men  possibly the author included   Okay  so this was definitely an interesting read   Humbert Humbert is a Frenchman that falls in love with a  nymphet  a term he uses to describe beautiful little girls  12 years of age or younger  by the name of Dolly Haze  But he never calls her by her name  only Lolita  It s a weird romance  I wouldn t really call it a romance  but he takes his Lolita all over America for 2 years and has nighttime sexcapades with his Lolita in different motor inns all over the country  Obviously she gets tired of it and wants to leave Humbert so she runs away with another man Humbert is away from Lolita for 3 years  He goes through depression and through a phase where he can no longer love any other nymphet because Lolita is forever ingrained in his mind as the perfect nymphet  He finds her again when she is seventeen  She is married  pregnant and is asking for money   you can see how the  romance  effected Dolly    This is as much as I m going to say because if I go any further I m going to spoil the entire story    but if this sounds like a kind of book you d like to read I really do recommend it It s really creepy  because it s a 40 year old man and a 12 year old girl  but once you get past that  it s beautifully written and very poetic  I feel like Humbert really does love Lolita  albeit it is not healthy  and the ending is really sad   This book was a long overdue read for me  It s hard to believe that Nabokov is not a native English speaker  his grasp of the language is so thorough  This narrator is charming and creepy and so fully realized in this novel  The writing is flawless  as is the character development  I love Lolita  the novel  because it is so provocative in both premise and execution  You can read Lolita as a novel with moralistic intentions  as does the writer in the novel s  introduction   You can read it as a novel with artistic intentions  as does the writer of the afterword   Vladimir Nabokov   You can read it as a novel with critical intentions  Lolita presents you with the  moral interpretation of Lolita  and the  artistic interpretation of Lolita  and is therefore aware that you  the reader  are interpreting the novel and is concerned with how you will do so  But my favorite way to look at Lolita is as a novel obsessed with language  its beauty  its unreliability  and its ability to delight  to amuse  to irritate  to mask cruelty  Essentially  its ability to provoke  And  when it comes to language  Nabokov is really a master  He puns  he anagrams  he conjures whole scenes with the toss of a few words  He has so much control  and can seemingly make English do whatever he wants it to  That s pretty cool  What do I think about  Lolita   That s an interesting question considering Vladimir Nabokov s own comments on his novel  This definite is not a book I would have picked up on my own  It was  in fact  recommended to me by a certain fan of Nabokov s work  After reading it  I m glad I took her up on her recommendation  The novel portrays the maddening love of Humbert for his nymphete Lolita  While that theme holds the story together  the meandering twists and turns are the real substance of this work  Or is it  This is definitely a book that must be read and experienced at it s many levels  Be sure to read the author s note before drawing your own conclusions about  Lolita   I hope you enjoy it as much as I did  Roused by ideals as theoretically disturbing and instinctively repelled by your average reader as can be  this story is the thorough confession of an outright travesty  However  it is with much strength of heart  and even more creative conviction  that Nabokov manages to silence our morals for long enough to leave us at least a fraction as heartbroken as his ardent prose alleged him to be  His tragically twisted endeavors are illuminated by passages as innocently lyrical as they are sharp  raw  and forceful  The pace or flow of the story never catches you off guard  simply because his having experienced with all five senses each and every captured scene gives the tale as a whole an incomparable natural flow  The story sticks with you because it is real in every capacity  the words themselves might as well be stained by their architect s own blood  tears  and gin  Self victimization meets a peculiar self righteousness  precise imagery blends with surreal self reflection  and love is portrayed as the quiet perpetrator of chaos that it truly is  This book  above all else  is powerful because it shouldn t be  and beautiful because it would only be presumed that it should be anything but  It took me ages to read this book  I was too sick to read for the first week   but it was well worth it  and it s one that I think will get better and better with repeated readings  Although next time I think I ll keep a dictionary and a French translator at hand I love to read books that make beautiful use of the English language  and this is one of the best I ve read yet  It s so well written  it s astounding This was my first Nabokov and certainly not my last   what a brilliant writer  I don t know what else to say   this a superb book and highly recommended  Sometimes this book made me so uncomfortable  but the writing kept me hanging on with my fingers mostly over my eyes  It was intense  to say the least  The narrator was delusional and amazing in his insanity  the wordplay was divine  It is incredible to think that this is a translation  Anyway  Nabokov  you are a creepy genius and I bow to your powers of the word  but also   byefelipe I didn t know if I would like this book as the story of an older mans fascination with a younger girl made me think it would be weird or repellant  However I think it is one of the best books I have ever read  it is so beautifully written  I couldn t put it down and I will read more nabokov Alfred Appel s notes are an absolutely enchanting addition to the already great Nabokovian masterpiece that is  Lolita   I found it particularly interesting that Nabokov used to deliberately sit behind little girls on buses to hear the types of words they would use like   Wow  Looks swank   What can one say  which hasn t already been said about such an ingenious novel  From the very opening   I need you  the reader  to imagine us  for we won t really exist if you don t   Until the very end  when an ingenious reader wonders was it Humbert who seduced and violated Lolita or was it she who did such to him  One concept which intrigues me was the constant comparison of ideologies between European and American life  I m not certain that today we see such distinct lines in cultures between America and Europe  Other countries  yes  assuredly so  but Europe  Humbert consistently justifies his exasperations and behavior as European  Would you say there are distinct comparisons today if we replaced Humbert with Berlusconi or Sarkozy  Humbert s European mannerisms become a predilection of sorts  especially when he recalls his past and plots his future  I have one additional comment  How many people have read this novel and in some small way felt ever so slightly inclined to understand and concur with Humbert s ardent poetic passion for his nymphet  Is this because the narration is from Humbert s perspective  This trick of narration makes me think of Nabokov as a literary Impressionist  A novel painted with small slow strokes of the pen  As with all Impressionist art the image is blurred  isolated and beautiful close up  therefore  you must stand back far enough to see the whole picture  Was this a trick by Nabokov  I think so  You must stand back once you close the cover of this novel  You should wonder whether it is clear who lacks morals  Humbert or Lolita  As honest  unabashed reader  I confess the sordid manipulations of this novel internally goaded me in a very unusual manner  Nabokov always painted with his pen   Oh Nabokov  Nabokov  what you did to my mind  Written like a diary  this book of fiction reads like a memoir  Nabokov takes the unreliable narrator to entirely new level to the point where you are sympathising  understanding  relating  justifying the vile actions of the protagonist  and even now  saying the words I feel defensive of him and disgusted in my own feelings that I could possibly feel like this  Nabokov is able to achieve this by creating the most convincing voice I have ever read  an intelligent voice with the most elegant and passionate language   what a master  A master  I have not seen the film and I am afraid to see it for it may kill the language still flowing in my mind  A must read book of our times   Reviewing almost a year after my first read  I picked it up a bit randomly at the bookstore  mostly to see what the fuss was all about and wow  What a beautiful book  in spite of all the touchy subjects Nabokov includes  to put it lightly   I  sadly  do not understand French  and for that I feel as if I ve lost some meaning to the novel  but even without French  the writing was enough to blow my mind  Set the book down numerous times to breathe in deeply because it s shockingly beautiful   There are only two books to date that have rendered me utterly and exceptionally astonished by the striking impact of their first few sentences  One of which  went like this  Happy families are all alike  every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way  But of the two I refer to  the other is undoubtedly my uncontested favorite  It went exactly like so  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  I ve read and reread those lines over and over  and even as I typed them here  by memory  mind you   I savored the delicious gesticulation of the tongue while I attempted to retrace my own steps down the palate to whisper the three most beloved syllables And recalling the moment when I first read those lines  I refused to proceed with the rest of the narrative without fully comprehending  without fully immersing and overwhelming myself with the beauty  the depth  and the emotion of those fiery words  In that instant  the reader is made aware that the narrator is completely and unquestionably under the spell of this Lolita woman  whoever she may be  only to find out that the Lolita woman isn t actually a woman  but a girl  A young  prepubescent girl child of twelve during the time when the narrator first encounters her  Read the rest here  http

fann sjalva handlingen i sig speciellt intressant eller spektakular  utan det ar snarare HH s framstallning av handelseforloppet som ar fruktansvart spannande  Jag kom pa mig sjalv med att tycka att beskrivningarna och handlingarna var vackra  for att sedan minnas vem det ar som utfor dem  Detta ar en roman som satter griller i huvudet pa en  eftersom man trots allt kanner med HH som ar en sa fruktansvart olycklig och trasig person  Exempelvis denna passage  Och darefter angern  den snyftande forsoningens bitterljuva styng  den omkliga alskogen  den sinnliga aterforeningens hopploshet  I den sammetslena natten pa Miranda Motel  Miranda   kysste jag de gulaktiga sulorna pa hennes fotter med deras langa tar och offrade mig sjalv     Men det spelade ingen roll  Vi var bada domda  Och snart skulle jag hamna i en ny omgang av forfoljelser  Forutom att det ar fruktansvart vackert beskrivet  far i alla fall inte jag kanslan av att detta skulle vara en pervers person som talade  Det enda jag ser ar en olycklig manniska som offrar sig for sin omojliga karlek  Det ar just detta som gor romanen sa befangd  Karleken ar omojlig och oacceptabel  och anda kanner man med denna pedofil  Det kan ocksa ha att gora med att allt ses fran hans perspektiv  man far aldrig veta hur Dolly sjalv kanner  Det ar bara da han sjalv beskriver hennes handlingar man forstar vilken fruktansvard situation flickan befinner sig i  Det gor aven HH  men han bryr sig inte om det  Han ar beredd att gora allt for att behalla Dolly Allt eftersom blir romanen mer och mer forvirrad och otydlig  I borjan ar allt nagotsanar konkret  men i slutet far man verkligen tanka efter efter varje rad  HH s forfall syns alltsa aven i sjalva strukturen av texten och det tycker jag ar oerhort snyggt gjort  Han blir galen  texten blir forvirrad och otydlig  Texten far nastan en slags poetisk kansla over sig  Han var naken och bocklik under morgonrocken och jag kvavdes nastan da han rullade over mig  Jag rullade over honom  Vi rullade over mig  De rullade over honom  Vi rullade over oss  Detta ar en mycket tankevackande roman som paverkade mig valdigt mycket genom lasningen  Om och om igen blev jag forvirrad over att nagonting sa fruktansvart kan framsta som sa tilltalande  Fokus ligger inte pa den fruktansvarda handlingen  utan HH s trasiga sjalv  Detta perspektiv ar nog mycket ovanligt  och svart att gora pa ett overtygande satt  Detta ar dock mycket overtygande  och det ar darfor romanen ar sa intressant  HH finns overallt i romanen  texten ar HH och HH ar texten  What a literary feast  feat this book was  I am sure most people are familiar with the basic storyline  even only to ignorantly refer to it as  that pedophile book  and for a very long time I delayed reading this for several reasons  Firstly  because I was worried that as a classic it would be slow and heavy going in terms of the reading experience and secondly that the subject matter would be off putting  Normally I react so negatively to an unlikable character that it taints my enjoyment of the story and subsequently causes me to give a low rating but in this instance I was wonderfully horribly enthralled and disgusted in equal measure The superb writing was seductive only to shock me in utter disgust moments later  the same way Humbert Humbert seemed to approached his  courtship  of Lolita This book is absorbing  readable  and worthy of its status as a classic and will stay for me for a very long time  One of the best books ever written  You almost forget what you re actually reading about  and he writes about his obsession in a descriptive  delicious way that is never cloying  Also extremely funny  which is difficult  considering the topic  Vanity Fair called it  the only convincing love story of our time    Lolita  the exquisite handiwork of Vladimir Nabokov is a genuine masterpiece  It may seem to some as an inappropriate work of erotica but it is not that in any way  that would be a preposterous piece of assumption  Given Nabokov s elegant style of wordplay  one can expect this book to be more artistic than anything  A perfect comparison to Lolita would be Botticelli s The Birth Of Venus  which coincidentally is also mentioned in the novel   It is a painting depicting a nude woman goddess yet one does not feel lustful towards it  One only appreciates the beautiful artistry  the aesthetic genius that is the thing itself  Thus  the same case can be made for Lolita  Lolita  Lolita love of Humbert Humbert  a masterful story this is  Amazing  amazing  what little words can give  In considering this novel  the pace or excitement is not important as this is not a cheap thriller  An exquisitely painted piece of work can never bore a true reader  That being said  the art of reading this book is considering it s true meaning  That poor Humbert Humbert considered himself a corrupter of the youth  a madman  and a nymphomaniac yet says that his greatest loss was not losing Lolita  but rather Lolita losing her childhood  is a sinner s repentance  That it would already be too late when he would realize that he was not only lusting upon the nymphet Lolita but rather in love with her is a tragedy  But the true beauty of an analysis cannot be truer said than this paragraph I have so innocently borrowed from SparkNotes   In the final lines of Chapter 36  Humbert speaks of  the refuge of art   and we may ask ourselves whether Humbert is indeed attempting to take shelter within his beautiful  maze like creation  hiding his sinfulness within elegant prose  The novel ends with the word Lolita  which  quite famously  opens the novel as well  By bracketing the novel with such an explicit instance of symmetry  Nabokov draws attention to the novel s formal  literary qualities  Lolita doesn t represent a spontaneous outpouring of emotion  but a planned  controlled  composed account of a deeply disturbing series of events  It may seem inappropriate  then  to respond to Lolita emotionally  even though Humbert s agony often seems genuine and heartbreaking  However we react to the ending of Humbert s tale  whether we forgive Humbert because of the obvious pain he has suffered  or because he has created an exquisite work of art  or whether we continue to hold him accountable for the incredible damage he has caused  Lolita forces us to interrogate the moral aspects of art appreciation  Lolita  Lolita  how beautiful thou art  Lolita   The prose in this book is consistently beautiful  From the scorn of numerous prudes that have denounced the book  I braced for  explicit scenes    yet none exist  Nabokov s ability to capture the character of Humbert was chilling  A powerful read  edited from illicit   see below To sympathize with either Humbert Humbert or Lolita is a mistake  Why should we when the author does neither  This is a book about the American Way of Life  AWL  as delicately  meticulously and maliciously explored by an anonymous outsider  Nobody doubts that AWL condemns the sexual harvesting of young girls by their leering parent figures  Remember the Tildenesque tennis coach of these pages and his retinue of teenage ball boys  What do you think of the fate of those  If they are over 17  is it  consenting sex  with the older man  Which is more depraved  the activities of the ball boys or Humbert and Lolita  The answer is of course  neither This work is meant to provoke by stirring up deeply disturbing thoughts that the AWL normally represses or rationalizes under the politically correct attitudes  of the day  towards sex and success  In its goal it gloriously succeeds  and for many years I have celebrated its success  And  any provocations aside  can we admire the quiet  sly craftsmanship that allows Mr  Nabokov to describe diner blueberry pie as a slice of  thick purple glue   Lolita is the story of a quasi incestual relationship between a stepfather and his stepdaughter  It is told from the perspective of the pedophile  The main character is absolutely sick and yet the reader finds herself interested  excited and sympathetic towards Humbert Humbert  the  protagonist    Another impressive element of Nabokov s writing is his ability to take every flaw of a book and make it suit the character  The story is filled with obscure references that are meant for the reader not to understand  That kind of pretentiousness would bother me in any other situation but you get the feeling that the narrator is pretentious and because that is part of his character it is acceptable  Finally his prose is simply amazing  He uses creative language and syntax and is a very original writer  All in all I would say this is a fascinating piece of literature unlike anything I have ever read   I loved this book for everything  then I read Susan Bordo s essay about it  I realized I took the story WAY too literally  like the numbnuts that I am  I took the book and the Kubrick film to be the same  and they are NOT  Now  I hate the subject of the book  and love the writing  I can appreciate the writing  at least     Beautifully ugly  The novel begins and ends with  Lolita  but it is really about Humbert Humbert and his attempt to fix  in writing  the sublime effect of nymphets  Or is it  The challenge for Nabokov is to show  through an obsessive and self reflexive narrative  the moral reality of what actually happened  Can fiction reveal truth  Not in the naive realist style that takes language as some kind of glass that needs only a good scrub for the world to come into full and accurate view  But fiction  suspicious of its own artifice  its own lies  its own egotism  that sees language as a fun house of mirrors  uproarious one moment  terrifying the next  can that kind of fiction  for  after all  that is the only honest kind that can be written after Modernism and the World Wars  make the reader feel  not for the narrator  not for himself in the narrator  but for others This is the triumph of Lolita  All the cunning that Humbert  and Nabokov  poured into the construction of this ambitious work pays off in the reunion scene  when Humbert meets Lolita  married and now called Mrs  Dolly Schiller  and realizes the damage his impossible love has caused  Humbert writes of the moment after he left the Schillers At this solitary stop for refreshments between Coalmont and Ramsdale  between innocent Dolly Schiller and jovial Uncle Ivor   I reviewed my case  With the utmost simplicity and clarity I now saw myself and my love  Previous attempts seemed out of focus in comparison  A couple of years before  under the guidance of an intelligent French speaking confessor  to whom  in a moment of metaphysical curiosity  I had turned over a Protestant s drab atheism for an old fashioned popish cure  I had hoped to deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a Supreme Being  On those frosty mornings in rime laced Quebec  the good priest worked on me with the finest tenderness and understanding  I am infinitely obliged to him and the great Institution he represented  Alas  I was unable to transcend the simple human fact that whatever spiritual solace I might find  whatever lithophanic eternities might be provided for me  nothing could make my Lolita forget the foul lust that I had inflicted upon her  Unless it can be proven to me  to me as I am now  today  with my heart and my beard  and my putrefaction  that in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac  unless this can be proven  and if it can  then life is a joke   I see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art  To quote an old poet The moral sense in mortals is the dutyWe have to pay on mortal sense of beauty This passage is morally profound and deeply humane  If we truly understand the harm we have done to another  what forgiveness  To think ourselves forgiven is to render life absurd  a  joke  as Humbert puts it  He has to bear his burden of guilt  just as Lolita has to bear her burden of memory  And art  a supreme value in this artful narrative  which cannot resist making up a poetic couplet and calling it a quotation   is only palliative  Humbert can only maintain this depth of insight  for a moment  before he goes off to duel  in a comical scene  with his double  Clare Quilty And if the quoted passage is still too much about Humbert  he moves closer still to moral understanding when he stands on a hill and hears the  melody  of children playing in a town below  and knew  that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita s absence from my side  but the absence of her voice from that concord   And so the first person narrative convicts itself  for in writing itself  it has to silence Lolita  I read this years ago  but I didn t remember just how beautifully Nabokov writes  The novel almost demands to be read aloud   which is sad for those of us who do most of our reading on trains  planes  and busses  And Nabokov is beautifully crafty  with multiple layers of framing  ambiguity  concealed identities  and trickery For those whose interest in the book is merely prurient  let me just say that it is at least as much a critique of American popular culture   especially as expressed on the interstate highway system   as it is an exploration of a pedophile s psyche  No puedo creer que finalmente he terminado este libro y ya estoy resenandolo  He tardado tanto en leerlo  me ha acompanado en distintos bolsos y carteras a tantos lugares  que me parece que voy a extranarlo xD En serio  como he luchado con Humbert Humbert  Primero lo he odiado con toda mi alma  luego me he reido con algunas de sus ocurrencias  le he tenido lastima  he vuelto a odiarlo  hasta me ha perseguido en pesadillas  Para el final del libro  me habia reconciliado con la idea y pude sumergirme en la tragedia de ese amor desesperado  Que la pluma de un autor sea tan maravillosa que uno no pueda resistirse a leer las aventuras de un ser tan detestable como el protagonista es un logro que no creo que muchos puedan alcanzar  Me he enamorado de la narracion  al punto de que Nabokov tendra siempre un lugar en el podio de los mejores para mi  Y creo que es eso lo que ha permitido que esta historia trascienda y mantenga ese halo encantador que la ha convertido en parte del imaginario colectivo  Cuando compre este libro  admito que pense que me meteria en la historia de un romance truculento  en un amor intenso y prohibido entre dos seres llenos de esos sentimientos que las novelas y las peliculas nos hacen creer que son suficientes para transgredir las normas sociales  Y cai en la cuenta de que no tenia nada que ver con eso  Lolita es la muestra de que los amores enfermos son el producto de  al menos  un alma enferma  Que el hecho de transgredir el sentido comun y dejar pasar cualquier oportunidad de redencion es la muestra de que algo esta mal en los personajes  y que las consecuencias van a ser acordes  Pero de lo retorcido tambien puede salir belleza  y una mente enferma no es incapaz de transmitirnos su obsesion de una forma en que la entendamos  Porque Humbert Humbert es un monstruo con todas las letras El ritmo de la novela es bastante lento  los acontecimientos van desarrollandose con toda la tranquilidad del mundo  para luego trasladarnos por diferentes espacios en un viaje que va desde el Viejo Mundo hasta las rutas de Estados Unidos  Los nombres de muchos lugares estan modificados  muchos hoteles  rutas y ciudades son invento del propio Nabokov  pero estan tan llenos de vida que uno espera que alli afuera existan tal y como estan descritos  La narracion  como he dicho  es en primera persona por parte del mismo Humbert Humbert  Uno puede ver lo egocentrico que es este personaje desde el principio y el desden que muestra hacia casi todo lo que se cruza por su camino  excepto sus amadas ninfulas  La perversion de este personaje hace dificil de digerir la primera parte de la novela  en especial  hasta que uno se acostumbra al tono y puede avanzar  Creo que esa fue la razon de que abandonara la lectura en muchas ocasiones  pero no queria darme por vencida con algo tan bien escrito  Hay parrafos en los que se cuelan frases preciosas  metaforas y hasta poemas que dan gusto  Sera que tambien tengo adoracion por lo tragico  Otro punto interesante fueron las expresiones en frances  intercaladas sin aviso y sin traduccion  a las que termine acostumbrandome a la fuerza  Eso  sumado a las numerosas notas del traductor en las que se aclara que tal poeta o la autoria de cierto refran no son mas que inventos del propio Nabokov  le dio un tono de diversion e ironia al texto  Senti que habia un mundo creado mas alla del libro  un entorno al que estaba accediendo y que excedia las paginas impresas  Todo esto le dio un valor mucho mayor que el morbo de lo que ocurria y me animo a terminar hasta las notas posteriores en las que el autor explica todo lo que tuvo que pasar para lograr que publicaran el libro  las reacciones de los distintos editores y las interpretaciones increibles que algunos daban a la trama  Que confesara que solo habia escrito esta novela para librarse de ella es lo que me ha convencido de tenerlo entre mis autores favoritos  Voy a volver a leer algo suyo  de eso estoy segura  Well ain t this a peadophile s dream  Look  if you are going to judge art   literature by conventional morality you will have to burn quite a lot of books   art   films too  Let s just say they didn t have  Age of consent   Statutory rape  in those Nabokov days and judging by the first few paragraphs in the first chapter   they really NEEDED it   yet great literature pushes social boundaries to the limit   and beyond  this is GREAT literature   so if you are prudish I would avoid or you will end up book burning and we KNOW what kind of people book burn   this book will NEVER be an easy one to read and will be ETERNALLY Controversial  Trust me on this one when you open the first few pages  you will understand why  I think most heterosexual males will have a very difficult time with this book   on the one hand it is so seductive  its Nabokov    on the otherhand it is so taboo ed AND Nabokov sets readers up so that to even  morally object to it  leads the reader into an awareness of their own hypocritical complicity  That s why it is GREAT Literature Enjoy it  www ceciliayu com Two things 1  Nabokov was trilingual  His mastery and manipulation of the English language is incredible  It blew my mind 2  HH did not love Dolores Hayes  He was a sociopath  He loved only himself  He acknowledged Dolly s suffering only in terms of its effect on his life and how it made him feel  A coronary thrombosis was too kind   In My opinion  Lolita  is one of the greatest novels ever written in the fiction genre  Nabokov has written a story that does not set out to inform or persuade readers of the moral implications underlying Humbert s desires  it is only a story  I found it to be an incredibly challenging book at times due to the taboo subject matter  Perhaps the most challenging aspect of  Lolita  is the flawlessly eloquent narration of Humbert Humbert which appears as a total contradiction compared to his deplorable behaviour towards young Lolita  While Humbert communicates in prose that is similar to that of a true romantic  his actions and behaviour towards Lolita have far more in common with those of a savage  I found this juxtaposition to be incredibly uncomfortable as I often wanted to find some point to sympathise with the narrator about  but I found only tales of incest and selfishness  The narrator is a true monster  but a very articulate and polite one  which somehow makes this book all the more disturbing  This is perhaps the most beautiful and wonderfully written book about a paedophile and his possession of a young girl  Its midnight and its really difficult to review a book this good while your attention is distracted by slumber  However I will say that Nabokov is one of those people we all love to hate  He s the smartest guy in the room   and he knows it Definite must read  Hat    ez a konyv is eleg regota izgatta mar a

equally disturbing  I couldn t put it down and still can t stop thinking about the characters  I d give my right arm to write a novel this good   Nabokov is simply amazing  A man marries a woman for no other reason than that he fancies her daughter  The wife then dies under dubious circumstances  After a non existent grieving period  he proceeds to kidnap and rape the little girl cross country  and he eventually murders another man who ravishes her in the same way that he did     and yet we actually feel creepy little twinges of sympathy for Humbert  This is wrong  and the fact that this feeling comes across in the reading tells us just how easily our moral judgments are clouded by clever narratives and the way facts are presented to us  I feel morally guilty for liking this book  I feel guilty for enjoying this so much   Creepy book  Eerie too  Simply because HH is describing a young person  But his descriptions sound very real and that s what s creepy about this book  If HH was interested in appropriately aged lovers and described them as grown adults  they would be incredible descriptions fit for a love story  It s a disturbing book  that s for sure But  I recommend this book as awareness of perps  It seems to reflect what perps think and as caretakers of children  we need this ability so we can keep our children safer  I m only about 50 pages in and already I can feel moved  in a bad way  because of Nabokov s writing style  I heard this book also includes a neglectful mother who adds to the problem  So I m expecting this book will shed a lot of light on a taboo topic  And this social problem thrives because it s so taboo and there s a lack of education conversation or willingness to address it as an everyday problem  This version s introduction mentions that this book should be studied in psychology circles  After reading It gets a little less creepy as it goes along  The creep factor is still very high  But a little desensitized to it  Or a little more guarded to it  Overall  it s a very disturbing  difficult read  But I m glad to grit my teeth and finish reading it  I don t know how to review this book  I think it s because it s like a scary story that happens all the time on various levels in real life  This book  as literature  paints a realistic profile of these two roles   Perp and pre teen Its justified by the psychological intrigue  It s wildly interesting to see how the different minds of H H and Dolly Lolita play off each other  I can see how these two roles can happen in real life  So the book gives some understanding about that  But  i come back again to it s creepyness  And the end result  after reading it  I m disturbed  It s a book I ll not forget  kind of like watching a horror movie that really and truly scared you   Like the original Exorcist  that movie is still with me as one of the scariest  I think this book goes into that category of scary disturbing   It s definitely a tragic story  I feel terrible for her  If only there is some way to prevent these perps from going down this road  This book doesn t offer a solution  but it s definitely one to start the conversation  While reading it  I can understand why it was banned or at least carries some argument for it being banned  At times  I wanted it to be banned  Other times  I really felt like I was in the mind of HH  It s a very disturbing place to be  But it seems to give insight for why how the perps operate and get away with their crimes  After reading it  I wanted to go and argue with someone about these social problems and how to fix them  I also wanted to hide like i was watch The Exorcist all over again  But  after the writing style fades from my memory  I m sure it ll be a book to talk about years after reading it  Once the immediate creepiness calms down  The characters certainly won t be forgotten  but not for a good reason     What an extraordinary novel  Apart from the fact that as a classic there is probably nothing to be said here that hasn t been said before about this piece of writing I have no idea how to review  Lolita  or give it the justice it deserves  At the beginning Nabokov s writing reminded me of Fitzgerald   stylistically beautiful   but then the writing managed to become more and more complex and intricate without losing any of its beauty and I found myself rereading snippets of it just to be able to savor it more And it s hilariously funny  Nabokov has Tolstoy s sense of unfaltering humour  In my mind Humbert Humbert becomes more and more a ridiculous parody of man as the story unfolds and regardless of the insightful conclusions that he reaches it seems that as a main character he remains surprisingly ignorant of his own realisations  Rather it feels as if  in those moments  it is Nabokov who comments directly to the reader  Using Humbert as narrator is pure genius  Lolita  is the kind of novel that reminds us why we love reading   The first pages were so lyrical I switched to books on tape  but I was impatient to advance  so I went back to reading  Thought provoking  and disturbing  I was fascinated by this novel  The unreliable narrator is a favorite of mine  and this novel plays this theme like a fine instrument  It will take me a long time to determine how I feel about this book   but I understand why this novel is so well thought of  Have been shown the movie  I just had to pick up this book  Refreshing to see and experience the story with a character that exhibits behavior that had made him hated in the real world  It shows a glimpse of the thought processes that goes on inside the minds of such people Even though it might involve a  for some  sore subject  I liked it  Sometimes you feel the urge  or obligation  to read the classics  This isn t always for your pleasure but mainly done by a  misplaced  feeling of political correctness  Lolita in spite of this was a revelation  Written in first person  it shows us the way of thinking of its protagonist  although you reject him  you understand him  Nabokow masterly describes man s psyche  Beside this is also gives us Nabokow s feelings about America  but also the Old Country  This book will be in my personal top 5  it almost feels blasphemous to start reading another book right after this one  But I am afraid I will anyhow  Oh my  What a lovely book  I am very interested by Nabokov s way of writing  This book is not about love nor perversion  it s about talent  I truly believe that it s about Nabokov talent  He masters the language like no one else  He plays a lot of games with his readers  makign up chess problems in the core of the book   Nabokov has such an expressive powerful way of writing such mastery of a language  it amazes me  One of the books you reed because it is well written and its story is great  best book ever As much as I admire Nabokov s writing style  not to mention will to actually write a book as maddening as this   I simply could not finish  Lolita   Actually  the book was far from bad  It was well written and I found myself quickly drawn in into Humbert s tormented world  Which is why I couldn t finish it  I was soon starting to become as mad as Humbert  hating him and yet loving him at the same time  Nabokov reels you into Humbert s madness  perhaps to make him sympathetic  perhaps to give us a glimpse of his strange mind  Whatever his reasons may be  one thing was clear  I had to stop  And so  relutantly  I did   This is the best book I have ever read That said  I almost don t even know how to begin writing a review of it  Let s see about the main points  at least  This book is equally horrific and hilarious  Vladimir Nabokov s control and command of English  not his first language  is better than mine will ever be  While never explicit  the  relationship  scenes between Humbert and Lolita are erotic enough that I felt uncomfortable reading them This is the kind of book that I can t even fully appreciate after reading just once  I ve added The Annotated Lolita to my To Read list  and I bet I ll read it within a few months  After that I will post a more detailed review  I can t wait to read it again  Lolita was hard to put down from the very first page  It is incredibly well written and Nabokov masterfully pulls off telling the story of how Humbert Humbert becomes more and more obsessed with young Lolita without turning him into an easy pedophilic caricature  I highly recommend this and I will definitely pick up some of his other novels  I really enjoyed the use of wordplay doubles  french substitutions  etc   and from the philosophical albeit psychological perspective of a pedophile justifying and glorifying his ideology  Of course there are many other underlying meanings weaving through this novel  but the poetic use of words was just impeccable  Highly recommend a read if you haven t   This book is  in essence  a travelogue  it is far better than Kerouac s On the Road  Humbert Humbert sallies forth across the American state roads and back roads  pausing to rest at her myriad motels  Others will say the book is about some pedophile doing horribly nasty things to his kidnapped step daughter  However  they are missing the big picture The tale is about the lure and freedom of the open road  Unfortunately  Humbert Humbert drags along a twelve going on thirteen year old girl with him  She s a complete bore  All she cares about is chocolate sundaes  movie magazines with the latest Hollywood matinee idol and slipping off with friends her own age to a roller skating rink  Her whining and incessant nagging really put a downer on Humbert s fantasies and travel whims Finally  the book offers a cautionary reminder that teenagers are droll creatures completely devoid of intellectual curiosity  They are to be avoided at all costs  even if some flighty young wisp of a girl reminds you of a summer of your youth long ago in a kingdom by the sea  when the jealous angels blew a wicked wind to chill and kill your Annabel Lee  This book may be perfect  A tale of depravity well told  I reread this for the first time in maybe fifteen years  in response to a Rebecca Solnit piece I saw about how she had Lolita  man splained  to her  she had argued that a book that treated a young girl as disposable was problematic  whereas the defenders of Lolita and the rest of Esquire s list of 80 books men should read  79 of them by men  claimed that all is fair in love and art  I m no doubt simplifying the debate and missing some of the important points about literary canon  cross identifying with protagonists  and many other things  Her ultimate point was that she had her opinion  they had theirs  and they wanted her to knuckle under because they were right by virtue of being male and superior  Which is very interesting  given the content of the book in question I remember reading Lolita and falling in love with language  with play  with funny sounds and names and puns and all of that  In response to Nabokov s invented alter ego  Vivian Darkbloom  I invented my own anagram  Iris Grimgame  I glossed over the plot  knowing Humbert was an unreliable narrator justifying his crimes  but pardoning him because he seemed so sad and self deprecating  and  plus  he wrote well  And I think that s the point  in part  people are often willing to pardon someone s faults and crimes if they are smart  handsome  winning  charismatic  pick your adjective But I don t think I appreciated the full horror of this book  which is weird  as I was once a twelve year old girl but instead chose to cross identify with Humbert the wretch  until I read Reading Lolita in Tehran  which has much good analysis of the book along with more details about Nabokov and his wife and their reactions to the commercial responses to the book  And I really understood how gross Nabokov considered U S  society for wanting a smutty book about child rape and incest  couched in voluptuous language and a high falutin  allegory about the U S  and Europe  or the U S  and itself  and how gross I was for considering this little girl disposable in relation to someone else s desires  someone else s  art   Because Humbert really does want to immortalize himself with his work and to if not convince the judge jury executioners of the validity of nymphet love at least to portray himself as human and vulnerable and broken and therefore potentially worthy of attention  not redemption   And yet Lolita herself should be the human one  Nabokov lets her come through in her private looks in the mirror  her tears EVERY night  her attempt to bargain and to claim some part of normalcy alongside her peers  But for the most part  it s Humbert who is three dimensional  whose drives and desires and history and misery is displayed  The perpetrator gets his story  the victim is only a reflection of that  a cipher  How different would the story be if Lolita told it And THAT S the critique he makes  he leads us on this his narrator s strange  twisted journey  he dazzles us with poetry  beautiful language  French phrases  and dark humor  and we get into it  We get off on it  And these flashes of Lolita s anguish along the way  coupled with Humbert s realizations at the end  though he still can t face NOT having had her  are the point  you we enjoyed that  he says to us  what does that say about us  About the ways in which the society and culture as a whole see  some  little girls as expendable or useful only in what satisfactions they can give to adults  mothers  fathers  teachers  drama coaches  audiences in general  The book makes me sad  even though I still think it s beautiful  I m sad for all of us because a lot of humanity really does have some base instincts that we re mostly unwilling to examine or change  it s much easier to say  Oh  YOU just don t understand the novel   rather than  Wow  that book makes some damning claims about storytelling and dehumanization   but I m also sad I initially got sucked into the cross identifying mindset that made me sympathize with Humbert rather than Lolita  Incredible incredibly writing and story telling  I admit  I felt such a disgust and loathing for Humbert Humbert  and could only speculate that only a real sicko could write so perversely  but no matter   the writing is brilliant and absolutely worth reading  Nabokov  despite English being his 3rd  4th  5th  language  writes beautifully and poignantly  My edition had an afterward by Nabokov  who defends his writing  which apparently most critics  misunderstood  He speaks best on his intent and it s true   Nabokov is in love with the English language  I cannot wait to read more of his works   Unless we re talking about Danielle Steel novels  there s nothing called a bad book  no offense to the author or her readers   It s more about the readers  interpretation  But then there are certain classics which deserve to be read more than ten times and deserve a hardback copy purchased to be flaunted on your bookshelf  And for me  Lolita deserves that special treatment First of all  the subject is very bold and could not have been better written  The book haunts you page after page  While you re still trying to decide whether the protagonist Humbert is a sick bastard indulging in pedophilia and blatantly outlining his narration with humor or whether it is the promiscuous Lolita who lured him  there comes a point somewhere in the middle of the book when you relinquish all judgement and watch the book confiscate your perception and sagacity  even the characters appear in your dreams  Then one afternoon  you tell your colleagues that you re reading  Lolita  and relish their raised eyebrows  Some have deemed this book taboo  others call it passionate and erotic  Some delve deeper into Humbert s emotions and his  love   double quotes intended  and empathize with him for being manipulated by his adolescent love Lolita  while there are others who expected Humbert to be moral by not taking advantage of callow and puerile  even though presumptuous and promiscuous  Lolita  Whether or not Humbert loved his  nymphet  is a grey area and the whole book is woven around this obscurity  The judgement of who manipulated whom will always be at the discretion of the readers and that  to me  is the beauty of the book  Personally  I thoroughly enjoyed the innuendos and the blend of poetry and prose  The dark humor during certain scenes could make you chuckle if you re reading the book unprejudiced  There were times during the course of reading this book when the the perverse erotica got too much to handle  but I soothed my numbing nerves by reading a few sporadic pages of lighter books on the side   During a fight between two characters  a weapon rolls under a  chest of drawers   I flashed back to the term  chestrdrawers  heard in my Southern USA upbringing years ago  The author could have selected a desk or a bookcase or anything under which something might disappear  But as Nabokov mastered the English language  I imagine this Russian hearing this odd  incorrect term then selecting this specimen of furniture with one intention  to gleefully correct the speech of some Americans  Certainly  Lolita  is one of the most beautiful English language book ever written by an author whose first language isn t even English  But there is one huge  glaring problem with this book  it s a  page turner   a mystery  a thriller  a drama  a road trip  But like the very best road trips  one should always slow down  take a deep breath  enjoy  and only then move on   easily the finest book ever written about a pedophile  I love this book  I don t know what that says about me  I mean  I know the subject matter is atrocious  but I was super amazed by how much I got into the story  The writing style is the absolute most interesting I ve known  Especially for something written so very long ago  the words were super fresh  The imagery  metaphors and just words used in ways that haven t been used before  This is a book that will stay with me forever Normally  I would think of a child being nothing after the fact to a child molester  and in turn  the effects of what happened overshadowing the child forever  In this he s so madly in love with her  and to her he s just a blip she passed over I love how morose he is  and his crazy ridiculous love is so weird    So for whatever reason  this book just is a hit for me   toni    FangirlMoments and My Two Cents    The novel was breath taking  I fell in love with Nabokov s style   creation of the world  The best thing about Lolita is the language  Even though I read it in Polish  I absolutely loved the descriptions of characters and surroundings  In terms of the writing this book is an absolute masterpiece  Despite its controversiality  Nabokov writes about his topic with a careful delicacy  every description is incredibly subtle and implicit  People looking for direct illustrations of the incestuous relationship between Lolita and Humbert aren t going to find it in Nabokov s story  His descriptions are simply beautiful I also liked the fact that the characters were so very realistic I could easily imagine them in every situation  The story itself was engrossing and because of the rare   delicate topic it won t be easy to forget about this book  It s interesting  though  that I can t really say I despise the main character for what he did  actually  there were moments I pitied him and was irritated with Lolita at the same time  Maybe it s not my favourite book if it comes to the story but it definitely is a 5 star book in terms of the masterful language  I gave Lolita five stars simply because Nebokov pulled off the impossible  writing an exhilarating story about pedophilia that is neither smutty nor erotic  Im seriously impressed about the penmanship  What a book  I first read this book when I was a junior in college  while taking a class on autobiography  We read Nabokov s  and I was so taken with his writing that I marched over to the used bookstore  all I could afford at the time   and got a copy of Lolita  Once I started reading it  I couldn t  and didn t  put it down until I was finished  I still read it at least once a year  Now  I m sort of in love with this book It is very personal  very gentle  very subtle and I absolutely adore its style  The story is provocative  eroticism pops here and there  to spice it up a bit   but at the end  the book remains as innocent as no other book I ve ever read  At the end you feel like you ve been in a room you are not allowed to enter  you entered it anyway  but the good part is nobody caught you red handed  In other words it makes you feel like an accomplice to a crime  A sweet sweet crime I might say   It is quite melancholic  but then again I am into melancholy books  so it was alright for me Plus  the subject  sick as it may be  has been handled so delicately  with such tenderness that by the middle of the book I ended up discarding all morals  DA a and that s about it  D Your  puppy eyes  made me do it  I will use this in court if somebody sues me for causing an extraordinary amount of boredom  D  if you think this is a love story  you are wrong  this book is about rape and humbert is an unreliable narrator  recently read this book again for the second time  still fascinated by the language  but also became more interested in the psychology this time around  also subject matter became more disturbing probably because the first time around i was so mesmerized by Nabokov s writing style Amazing book  Brilliant writing  sentence by sentence  The book is a love story  of sorts  between an adult man and a not adult girl  told from the man s perspective  A great example of an unreliable narrator  as the book opens with Humbert   Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury     Nabokov explores the concept further in Pale Fire  which I would recommend to anyone who liked Lolita  Assuming that they also like the idea of a 999 line poem Nabokov also has some of the most beautiful prose I ve seen  If you take delight in turns of phrase  in well constructed sentences  then you ll love Vlad   Tatiana is so spot on in her review and I m glad that she said it and point it out  I m part of the majority who feels sympathy of Humbert and feels that Lolita was the one who was moody and unaccepting of his feelings  Through Humbert s word play and his manipulation  I actually got convinced that he was in love with a twelve year old girl and that it was just despicable that Lo didn t realize this and love him back  I felt that somehow Humbert s love was real  because he was an adult and that I believed he was old enough to be capable of a real  mature love  even if it was with a young  childish  wayward girl  But again  I was fooled Humbert doesn t admit to any of his sins or deprivations until the end of the novel where he realizes that his lustful feelings for Lo did nothing towards her benefit and more towards the corruption of her person  Lo is the object of Humbert s affection  but in the end  he realizes that he didn t fulfill his role either as a father or a lover and that more than anything  he stole from her every emotional part of a being human being and toyed with her childhood  The sick and mostly sad part is  he actually made it seem justified and in his endeavors to keep her to himself  it actually looked like he loved her  And he probably might have did too  but only for her body  He rejected her emotionally on every level  her missing her mom  observing her friend s dad  her whole fucking relationship with Dick and Quilty  I loved the book for its wordplay and how fun it was to legitimately read  Hum had a sick sense of humor and I loved his cunning personality  He embodies a very special and specific character that I emotionally got attached to in which then I felt like I really experienced the story  Everything was cleverly plotted out as well and I think I am so glad that despite Hum ending up in a prison at the end  his words and his thoughts finally got to be set free and he actually began to feel broken and hurt and guilty for his crimes against Lo in which bordered more on breaking her spiritually  In a way  he is liberated despite being where he is  both in the matter of releasing his true thoughts on the matter  the whole situation  as well as realizing his critical role in corrupting Lolita I sometimes think of what would happen if Lolita actually returned his feelings  Things got worse certainly because Lolita would flaunt over Quilty and follow him and run away  I mean  that s what made it so tragic  her repulsion and how she really isn t any better without Humbert than she is with him  But I wonder what would happen if she ended up truly loving Humbert  And if during his visit at Dick s  she did run away with him Ah  but sigh  It just wouldn t be right  Lo s personality just doesn t call for that  Even as an  adult   she is still wayward and disobedient and causes trouble for Hum beyond his capacity of toleration  And yet he doesn t see the blame of himself until too late  And I guess that s what s tragic about me  the reader  A huge part of me actually wanted Lo and Humbert to be happy together  I trusted that Humbert would take care of her properly and that Lo would experience a nice  proper love  That would have made the book enjoyable to me  But again  that wasn t the reality of the matter  despite how Humbert earnestly argued for himself  If you looked closely  it would be easily seen that there would be no way that Lo could love Humbert  But   just her relationship with Quilty pisses me off beyond belief There were scenes in this book where I sincerely cried  Hot tears flowed down my cheeks and I couldn t stop them and I couldn t fucking fathom why Lo could betray Humbert like that  The other part of me also cried for how terrible Lo is in general  and how out of shape she became from the whole matter  It was tragic  on so many levels  His giving to her the money also panged my heart and it just reminded me so much of the last scene in Dear John  I remember thinking how the DJ scene was so shitty  and then I met this Nicholas Sparks  take notes And that s just how this book is  there are so many layers to it  While it can be deemed ridiculous and silly by the pair s crazy antics and the old women  who all remind me of Mrs  Bennet from Pride and Prejudice   it can also be seen as romantic as well as tragic and then there is the shadow of Quilty and aghhh  There are also the layers of physicality and then that of emotional feelings in which Nabokov really makes a distinction of in this book  The writing in this book is just so amazing and beautiful and I can t praise it anymore  To come up with such a story is to truly possess talent  I m currently reading this and I love it  The way that Vladimir Nabokov rote this is so beautiful  It flows like poetry  i can t wait to finish it  I tend to avoid works in which the main conflict is so directly sexual  However  I make exceptions for 2 books  1 Death in Venice  2 Lolita Nabokov  a Michelangelo with the pen  is in peak form here  There is absolutely nothing I can add to this discussion form an analytical standpoint  So I choose to heap more praise on a praiseworthy work of art  Nabokov s  Lolita  is the fuse of the sacred and the profane  Ambitious in prose and with deep decadence  Lolita s plot travels against the moral compass of human consciousness  Critics constantly remind and rephrase the dense plot    a man s obsession with the twelve year old nymphet  Dolores Haze  Inevitably  its pedophiliac subject forces preconceived notions of established morality that undoubtedly blends with the corrosive nature of its moving force  Aware of the implications and complications  Nabokov s literary genius proves that language dominates the plot  from the opening line   Lolita  light of my life  fire of loins   Nabokov uses his only tool    the manipulation of rhetoric    to face the austere judgment of the reader  Following its poetic genesis  the multilayered and unreliable narrator    the pathological nauseating Humbert Humbert    forces the reader to taste the name  Lo  Lee  Ta  through the linguistic organ  H H s narrative beckons the reader to understand the sickening motives behind his actions  He sets up a chess game that parallels the narrative structure in symbol and form  In this narrative of word and flesh  the astute Humbert moves the pieces    words    in a way that attempts to conquer Lolita s innocence    flesh  Nabokov presents a complex set up that destructively decomposes the existence of Lolita s girl child stage and ostensibly pushes towards demolishing the wall that dives the right from the wrong  Nabokov crosses the fine line of storytelling when he simplifies the rotting rooted pathology of a man s luscious desire   Lolita  is most daunting due to its simplification of destruction and death    carnally and mentally    the absurd pursuit of the flesh thoughtlessly forgetting the effects of actions  Ultimately   Lolita  surpasses its disturbing roots and its enthralling language  it closes in a synesthesia that aweakens our every sense as an individual and as a community   It is a classic for a reason  This is a book that changed the language  if not the culture  You are immersed in taboo and are occasionally conflicted about the perpetrator of these heinous acts  That s what makes the book so compelling  one is occasionally sympathetic towards the protagonist only to be jarringly reminded of what he has become   Absolutely brilliantly written  The words flowed liked waves to me  Broad in description was every scene  I loved the start  middle and end  It was very interesting being put in the mind of a brilliantly  yet sick  man  Much passion and self indulgence was given to the main characters   This book is art in fiction  This is the best example of an author becoming a character  to write and describe everything through his eyes until the reader truely sees what the character sees  The story s well explained  along with Humbert s complex  without blaming pious pointing fingers and no patronizing towards any of the personal issues every character suffers A wonderful read  this book is a must to anyone who wants to read only the best and to aspiring authors who really aught to look at this book as a lesson in great writing  What is love  Love is lust  love is possession  love is jelousy  love is sick  love is corporal  love is poetry  love is art  love is insane  love is pain pain pain  The eternal  immortal subject put in a new light and observed from a twisted  sick and sickening angle and yet it still makes you cry and will change the way you read classic love poems forever after  My words can simply not explain my love for this book  Nothing has ever even come close nor ever will  The writing was simply enchanting and I felt like I was dreaming the entire time I was a part of Humbert Humbert s world  I hold this book close to my heart   literally  I want to tuck it under my arm and bring it with me everywhere I go  Oh  how I love you  Lo Lee Ta  In his afterword  Nabokov registers his regret that in writing Lolita  he was forced to abandon his natural Russian for what he describes as a  second rate brand of English   If his use of the language is only second rate  then  I must be a fourth  or fifth  class plebian  Lolita is one of the most beautifully written  enjoyably lucid novels I ve ever had the pleasure of reading  despite the subject matter  H H   our monstrous but oddly charming narrator  is a amazing work  a study in self pity  self delusion  and utter callousness that you yet can t help but feel  in some strange and perhaps sick way  sympathy for  There is a dark power to this work  and while perhaps there is   Nabokov claims   no guiding message  it is still something very much worth reading  H  Humbert s narrative becomes overwhelming and annoying in perfect tandem with the reader s developing sympathy for Lolita  The ending leaves one exhausted  as though he himself has travelled all over the US and lived each day of those years with them  Admittedly the use of French phrases annoyed me  and only served as the perfect reminder of Humbert s grand regards of himself  This is undoubtedly the funniest book I ve ever read  I think people tend to take this book a little too seriously  Either they find it too artistic or touches so much on the macabre  they find it to be some insight to the human psyche  Literary books tend to have the reputation of being altogether  serious  and having a sort of pompous aesthetic value  having no comedic merit  However  I think that way of thinking is impractical  People like that tend to think that life is not simply  fucking hilarious   which is what I label this novel   and if a novel is funny  it is because of irony and sarcasm  insightful on the human psyche  Yet life isn t always funny in an ironic way  Life can be funny  It can be simply  fucking hilarious   And that is what Lolita is The narrator  Humbert Humbert  is one the most unreliable narrators in literary history  Even more unreliable than all the narrators in The Sound and the Fury by Faulkner  One cannot help but be amused by him and his making up of excuses  his crazy attemps to eliminate any problem  Of course he is a pedophile  but it s very easy to get along with him  because there is no shame in him  Yet most people find it hard to sympathize or even tolerate him because pedophilia is so stigmatized  It s fiction  get over it  Pedophilia is wrong  we all know that  This isn t even the question the novel asks  It isn t about morality in the least bit  It s about obsession and the lengths of one s thoughts  but it is so hilarious  though Nabokov is such a brilliant writer with such beautiful language  that it is hard to take this narrator seriously  And I think that was Nabokov s intention  that our narrator s situation is laughable due to his desperation and carelessness  But I tend to find humor in apathy  Everyone is different  In that aspect  it s not hard to find why so many people view this book in so many different ways  Given my advice  don t take this book as seriously as what class tells you to  or as the media sells it   Lolita  had been on my to read shelf for quite sometime and I was elated to find a copy in my favorite used book store one fine day  I had nurtured hazy notions of a racy read  but what I failed to realize was that I would slowly fall in love with Nabokov s lyrical prose and witty humor  This book is not an easy read but absolutely worth the time and effort it takes in doing so  Lo  Lola  Lolita is a masterpiece  both beautiful and heartbreaking   hilarious  sad  partway through my friend Sam said  somehow you end up rooting for the pedophile   I found myself doing that pretty much throughout  makes you shutter a bit  Nabakov not only rocks out the english language  but also demonstrates a wealth of knowledge about america  and plants  Telling someone this is about the horror of obsession and passion will make them look at you funny  and it s not fair  Anyway  pure genius  of course  Even Dorothy Parker was respectful of its genius  Makes poetry out of prose  Lost me awhile there while they traveled in the car  but gripped me again at the end  The mountain village ending is   well  genius  I read this book when I was a high school student after seeing the Stanley Kubrick film adaptation with James Mason as Humbert Humbert and Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty  It was a  forbidden book   and like Candy  another forbidden book it was a black satire of American middle class life and European pretensions  Later on I appreciated Nabokov s brilliant prose style   For me a work of fiction only exists insofar as if affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss  that is a sense of being somehow  somewhere connected with other states of being where art is the norm  There are not many such books     On a Book Entitled Lolita   NabokovHere s one  I really can t do it justice with a review  What a wonderful work of art  What an amazing read  The prose was breathtaking  the subject was core shaking  and I couldn t put it down  But the additional aspect to this book is the time in which it was written in comparison to the time in which I read it  So much information has been exposed about sexual abuse that it is now  I think  easier to analyze the speaker as well as Lolita than it might have been for a reader when this was first published  Thoughts  I read this book expecting to be sickened  The story of a 40 year old s obsession with very young girls  or  nymphets   as said 40 year old calls them  and in particular the beautiful Dolores  Lolita  Haze  there is certainly plenty of material in this book for controversy  However  as soon as I had read the first page I know that this was no deliberately shocking novel  but instead a subtle  enchanting story of enrapture and lust  Everyone can relate to the longing Humbert feels for someone he knows will never lust after him  and the agony and ecstasy of his forced yet somehow tender affair with 12 year old Dolores is described in absolutely stunning detail  I finished the novel enchanted but also subtly disturbed  as you have to keep reminding yourself that this man is obviously a ruthless paedophile  Read this and prepare to be both symapthetic and disgusted towards your narrator  A beautiful  daring and subversive work of almost genius  wow  the language  the plotting  the narration    I m hesitant topick up another work of fiction for a while  I never thought that the true madness of desire would be laid bare  it seemed to me such a remote  guarded terrain  that only the finest and bravest poets could even glimpse it  To call it  lyrical  seems a gross understatement     This book is amazing  not overtly obscene but sensual  very attractive and confusing  I was almost dieing as I approached the end of the book  the plot was going in a very shocking ways  I think it missed the epilogue that was provided at the end of the 1997 movie which btw was way better than Nabokov s own screen play in the 1962 movie lolita  it almost had nothing to do with the novel  amazing in short  Si bien es cierto que puede disgustar el hecho de que el protagonista  el que nos cuenta su historia  es un pederasta  y pueden llegar a disgustar algunas cosas esta tan bien escrito    El autor hace de una historia tan sordida algo  inocente   cosa que es dificil tratando lo que trata  Nabokov s intricate word play is unlike anything else  Beautiful to read  It is very easy to label Lolita as  pornography  and claim outrage at what it supposedly represents  However it takes courage  open mindedness  and a fundamental strength in one s basic convictions to actually read something you may disagree with and discuss exactly what is offensive and where the line between so called pornography any great literature lies Nabokov s writing in Lolita is perhaps the best I have ever read  This fact is made all the more remarkable considering he is not a native English speaker   Lolita was written in English and then translated by him into his native Russian  The prose simply sparkles with intricate wordplay  and is absolutely beautiful to experience firsthand  Perhaps the most amazing thing about Nabokov s skill is that despite all fore warnings he is still able to seduce us  whispering into our ear through unreliable narrator Humbert Humbert  and draw us into an extremely controversial story that is impossible to put down even though we personally may be disgusted and repulsed by the content  How does Nabokov achieve this magic  It is something that you must read for yourself to fully understand Humbert  as an unreliable narrator  tells the story through his own eyes and we understand things they way he understands them  Although we may not agree with the sick twists and turns of Humbert s dark mind  we understand them and we comprehend how and why he thinks the way he does  This type of approach to storytelling is very unsettling to many because it lures you into a false sense of security and lets you identify with Humbert before his thoughts and actions turn to the unspeakable  The unreliable narrator is an amazingly effective plot device   perhaps too effective for some who might put the book down in the middle out of sheer horror I recently discovered that Nabokov had synesthesia  a condition where numbers  colors  shapes  and music often interrelate and overlap  I have had synesthesia my entire life  and it was an added bonus for me to read many of the author s especially lush  lovely  and vibrant descriptions brought about by this fascinating aspect of his personality   The afternoon drifted on and on  in ripe silence  and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know  and desire  even stronger than before  began to afflict me again   is a good quote  Silence is  ripe  and tall trees are personified as being  sappy  and  in the know   Another good example comes from Nabokov s book Bend Sinister  where Krug perceives the word  loyalty  as being like a  golden fork lying out in the sun   He hears  loyalty  and unconsciously pictures the golden fork  Nabokov uses his synesthesia to great effect  not just writing descriptions but creating entire paintings with his words  right down to the subtle textures and shifting hues in a scene You do not have to agree with a book s content to appreciate the superb skill and craft of the writing contained within  Lolita is great literature  and perhaps decades of ongoing controversy are testament to this fact  Love it or condemn it  Nabokov s Lolita is one of the finest novels ever written and it demands to be read  Very highly recommended  Lolita   setgetsiin emgegiin songodog zokhiol  Gazh donton adgiin Humbert  sadar

by the text  Nabokov s desire  if I recall correctly   Included in this assessment  the one joke throughout the entire book was so well placed as to make me read the rest of the book with alacrity  A must read as well  Possibly the most beautifully written book I have ever read  But what subject matter  It s as if Leonardo Da Vinci had decided to devote his masterwork to the most faithful and tender possible depiction of a troll doll Nabokov is the king of the closing sentence  Before things dissolve in the final quarter  each chapter s ending is a broken bone that protrudes  bloody and revolting to reveal the narrator s slant  This novel is a black hole in the fabric of our culture  It defies analysis on conventional turf  It defies opinion  Stepping back as I read  trying to assess  to make a sort of mind up  I found my thoughts separating and distending into a void  Spaghettifying in proximity to something beyond my intellect I considered forgoing rating this  But in the end  it is not amoral  It is blackly funny  And Jesus Christ it is as good as reading gets  I didn t think that I was going to like it  but I actually really did  It was rather challenging  but worth it  and had a lot of good quotes  I loved Part 2 especially  Is there a book more perfect than this   NOIf you don t appreciate this book  you are evidently STUPIDIf you don t appreciate this book  you are certainly UNCULTUREDIf you don t appreciate this book  you are undeniably  UNATTRACTIVEif you don t love this book  I damn you to hell         IF YOU THINK EVEN A PINCH OF THIS BOOK NEEDS TO BE CHANGED  I WILL CHANGE YOUR FACE I am so conflicted on this book  That s why it gets 5 stars  the internal turmoil it caused me to have  My journey through the language of this novel brilliantly paralleled the ill fated protagonist s  which I would like to think was Nabokov s intention  pure speculation   It had an almost mythic quality to it  Very rarely has a book ever unsettled me this much  Reading from the thoroughly detailed point of view of the pedophile that is Humbert was  besides revolting and disgusting  shockingly convincing  Humbert is definitely not a reliable narrator   view spoiler   The clever puns and the poetic prose that he uses to tell his story kind of deviate the reader from the fact that he is a pedophile who contemplated murdering his wife to repeatedly rape his 12 year old step daughter    hide spoiler   The hopeless romanticism that almost makes his actions sound forgivable  This was very painful to read  I am amazed at how an author could create a sick character that is so disturbingly real  My first venture into Russian literature   Now I am hooked This book takes you outside the social norm into the head of an unconventional artist with passion that grabs you If you haven t read it   you must I will add that there are two films made from the book  I watched the Adrian Lynne version and read the book again  The visuals really carry through for me The consensus seems to be that the Kubrick version is more respectable   I think the film NEEDS color  Beautiful prose  Este livro e fascinante  As palavras de Nabokov surgem com uma fluidez rara na literatura Esta muito bem construido e o tema controverso acaba por ser muito mais do que isso  Entramos no mundo obsessivo de Humbert e sentimos essa espiral infiltrar se em nos  Percebemos o nivel da sua fascinacao por Lolita  reflexo do seu passado  e o quao fora do controlo essa mesma fascinacao acaba por se tornar Nao e uma historia de amor  E uma historia nua e crua de uma obsessao por uma crianca  crianca essa que e marcada pela sua ingenuidade e posteriormente pela sua perspicacia e desespero em tentar fugir  E a historia de um homem profundamente marcado pelo passado  o que levou a que o seu presente se tornasse numa busca a alguem semelhante a sua falecida amada  Lolita e um reflexo dela  Optimo livro para estudar a mente humana e ate onde o Homem pode chegar  wah emang novel bagus sepanjang masa pas baca ini  rasanya campur aduk mulai dari kasian  nlangsa   pengen nangis  galau   jijik  waduh recommended buat yg blom baca    terutama Anak2 yg ngambil jurusan Sastra kudu harus baca niyh     buat orang yg suka novel berbau psikologi juga harus     coba tentuin si Profesor Humbert Humbert itu orang yg kayak apa    orang setia     suka ma anak kecil     apa ini salah satu contoh cowok yg cinta mati     Wow  Nabokov has an amazing ability to make the reader sympathize with his characters even if they aren t at all redeemable human beings  Humbert is a monster  but  in the end  you want to cry for him anyway  Let me start by saying that  just because you write about something  or from someone s point of view  does NOT mean that you condone their actions  or agree  or that a fictional memoir is just a real one in disguise  Writers are completely capable of writing from the point of view of monstrous characters without approving of their actions  or wanting to do those things themselves  Have we established this  Is that clear to everyone  To be explicitly clear  Vladimir Nabokov is not a pedophile just because he wrote about one  Just as someone who writes from the POV of a cat is not  in actuality  a cat  Is that settled  Good Lolita is probably one of the best books I have ever read  It is not  by any means  my favorite book  but I think it is possibly the best  The story takes on  not only the taboo subject of pedophilia  but also is written entirely from the point of view of the pedophile  I don t know if anyone has ever tried to write a story from the POV of a villain  but it is FUCKING  HARD  The fact that Nabokov is able to not only fill up and entire novel with it  but also to never let Humbert end up as a victim of circumstance  or a redeemable character  is beyond remarkable  However  I think what is terrifying about his writing is that he makes Humbert incredibly human  The man is irrevocably flawed  but Nabokov gives him several likeable characteristics  No one can write a novel from the POV of a completely vile character  It can t be done and expected that anyone will read it  This book is hard enough to read without having your character being completely unbearable  See Darkfever   There are so many  ick  moments in this book  and I read the first half of it with this expression  But the most disturbing thing about it is that the prose is so beautifully erotic  while talking about one of the most disgusting subjects  If H H  was not talking about a child  this would have been incredibly hot  but instead  we  as readers are challenged by the dark eroticism of the words  and the disgusting nature of his desire I would like to bring up one point that has been repeated enough to make me seriously concerned with the mindset of people in this world  Namely  the idea that Lolita  seducing  Humbert is a rational thing to say  and believe  While Humbert does say those words  am I honestly supposed to believe that that statement absolves him of any and all guilt  FUCK  NO  Why  Because she is a child of twelve  and she may have been exposed to sex very early in life  but she clearly didn t grasp the idea that sex is not just something with no meaning or consequence  She thought of it as a sort of game  just something that children do  Under no circumstances does this give Humbert  or any man for that matter  to take advantage of a child s naivete when he  as an adult  is in a position of power and authority  Anyone who says that Lolita is the seductress in this scenario is a rape sympathizer  clearly has never met a child  and is an actual idiot who should be made to go back to school for a special class that teaches morality  sensitivity  and overall human ness that should have been taught to you as a child but you clearly were too much of an idiot or your parents never taught you right   I m looking at you Rush Limbaugh People need to recognize Lolita as a victim of a tragic fate who was strong enough to escape from it  and to make a healthy life for herself  However  the tragedy of the book is simply the loss of a child s innocence at the hands of a truly broken man If anyone is interested  there is a sort of answer to Lolita in the movie Hard Candy with Ellen Page that is really very good  I would recommend it to anyone who isn t entirely satisfied with Humbert s fate  Citajuci knjigu   Citajuci Lolitu u Teheranu  od Azar Nafisi zainteresovala sam se za ovaj Nabokov klasik  Iako objavljen 1955  ovaj intigrantni roman ubrzo postaje

Glavna junakinja Dolores Hejz od milja zvana Lolita  postaje opsesija njenog ocuha Humberta Humberta  Iako Dolores ima samo 12 godina on u njoj vidi nekog koga zeli osvojiti Kontroverzni roman govori o necemu sto i danas predstavlja goruci problem drustva  Vrijedi procitati  My 19 20 year old self was wrong about many things but Nabokov was not one of them  Back then he jacked my aesthetic awareness into a new valence and I was ready to become an English lit major over him  But if anything he s even richer and deeper for me now than I remember him being then I reread this for the first time in 15 years after reading Kerouac s On the Road and on paper it seems surprising that I would respond so much better to detached  elusive  game playing  fancy Nabokov than desperate  sincere  soul baring Kerouac  From my favorite authors I m looking for nothing less than prophecy  exegesis  the word of God  the meaning of life  death  and the universe  I want people who can give me the thing I need before I die  Kerouac s book seems like it s loudly trying to  and Nabokov s like it s pretensions are not even in that general direction  but rather it s just there for the aesthetic joy of the wordplay or the world building  Kerouac seems like a committed seeker  Nabokov like a playful tinkerer But Nabokov s initially almost cartoonish seeming fictitious people end up becoming more and more real and important as Kerouac s semi autobiographical ones shrivel away and collapse What Nabokov detractors like Yevgeny Yevtushenko don t get  distracted by the  clatter of surgical tools  in Nabokov s prose  is that there are somehow realistic people moving around and living in there among all those shiny  gorgeous tools and harmonious prose poetic clockwork  beneath the thick but limpid layers of mirror weave hypertemporal internal reference and crossreference  beneath the immaculately chosen amplifying allusion  and the synesthetic echoes  I can t help it I get like this after reading him   My point is  it s like Nabokov World  at least in Lolita  has all the realism of a world created by a realist author  and then in addition has all his layers of special effects and sound layered on top of that  amplifying it  And the light thrown off by the spectacular Nabokovian prose apparatus occasionally strikes the real people underneath at weird angles revealing a whole domain of human detailing that you never get from other authors From what I ve read it sounds like Nabokov himself would scoff at his work being admired for its realism  He called his worlds  parodies  of reality and emphasized that the word  reality  should always appear in quotations marks  Nevertheless I insist  the characters of Lolita are real to me I can t think of any other scene in any book as tense  sad  human  and funny as H H  s final reunion with 17 year old  pregnant  married Dolores in Coalmont after his three years of frantic searching for her after she escapes  Or of any better plot climax  I think I actually stopped breathing through parts of it  First we get H  s first pathetic confession of being in love with the person rather than the child sex object  then we get his near simultaneous realization of how embarrassing  cringeworthy  and just plain beneath her notice his life defining  world defining love of her is and will always be to her  then his handing over his forty thousand dollars  in 2015 dollars anyway   and his begging her for the tiniest hope that one day she might come back  to no avail of course  then the perfectly balanced guffaw from his ridiculous joke about pulling out his gun  and back to wiping at his  and my  face as he drives off to kill Quilty  The colors are just more vivid than in anything else  I m more fully immersed Not that I m happy about sympathizing with a child rapist even for that one moment  I was happy to find most of Humbert s suffering throughout the book hilarious and satisfying  because I m rooting for Lo  and my favorite parts are where the reality of her nightmare experience and her defiance show through momentarily despite everything H H  is doing to keep the narrative controlled  filtered  and censored through his own demonic solipsism  and I take part in her joy at hurting him however she can  or deeply creepy and alienating  as when he wallows obliviously in his self pity as he destroys the people around him  There are certain aspects of Dolores  realism that I m still not sure about though  I m willing to grant a pretty twisted misapprehension of human sexuality from a sheltered 1940s 12 year old with a hostile mother  but would a 12 year old girl no matter what her experience and knowledge really initiate sex with a 37 year old guy  even one she had a crush on  Seems like there would be an almost biologically ingrained hesitance toward that sort of thing  Also it seems like with her level of self awareness and later insight into her own charisma she could have done better for herself than dish washing and Coalmont   you can t see the morons for the smog  are her words  after getting away from H  and Q  But    I can t say for sure  Maybe she s fully plausible  In every other respect she comes through in tune and in ultra high fidelity In fact  the book seems almost crypto feminist sometimes  with its arc of Dolores  successful plot against Humbert and her self actualized  although also similarly  maybe even symmetrically pathetic and disastrous  romance with her true flame Quilty  And with the fact that despite H H  s attempts to make her life all about himself  she manages to develop her own interests and values  her acting  her sense of what a decent family and a decent life should be  around this giant evil weight on her back  and we catch brief glimmers of who the real Lo might be there in between the lines of Humbert s self absorbed projections  But I m not going to give Nabokov quite that much credit  He was explicitly chauvinistic after all  disparaging female writers as a class  etc   I m uneasy with him politically  but it only serves to tinge my irresistible mancrush on him with an oblique tang of mild revulsion This edition has a stiff  annoying annotator giving a way overlong and misfocused introduction  but his annotations are necessary for his French translations if you  like me  don t know French but want to read this book  One of the most eloquent and beautiful uses of the English language  I actually began speaking different while I was reading this book  Although the subject matter may be difficult for some  there are no profane or dirty parts of this book  It is well worth the difficult subject to experience a literary work of art written by a man whose native language is Russian  The book is also laced with French  for which he provides no translation   No one needs an introduction to Lolita Suffice it say  a compelling tale of obsession and loneliness  Brilliant use of the English language  the word play is superb  has you laughing out loud even in the midst of the most uncomfortable scenes One of the finest books I have read  no more and no less because of the controversial subject matter  this book was amazing  I had no clue what I was getting into when I got this book  but I absolutely loved it  I don t understand why this  book makes people nervous  well it s very easy read  not to mention 100 percent enjoyable  I can t say much but the actual story without spoiling it  so I will not  that said  you should definitely check this one out  I may be a Nabokov fan for life  I avoided this book for a long time because of the disturbing and controversial content  but the book has popped up over and over on top 10 lists  I had to see what all of the fuss was about I didn t read much in my youth  so I haven t read a lot of classic literature  I have been doing my best to make up for this over the last 5 years or so  though  That said  this is the most well written book I have ever read  It is simply beautiful language describing horrible actions by brilliantly devised narrator in a book within a book  The narrator s unreliability combined with the excellent writing and a little bit of reflection on the reader s part  provides a deep insight into the main character and his flaws Enough can t be said about the writing  It s glorious   it  the ice machine  roared at me viciously while I removed the ice from its heart  Now I m off to go add all of Vladimir Nabokov s books to my reading list  Para un muchacho de 17 anos que se propone leer los grandes libros del siglo pasado   Lolita  no es un libro tan facil de leer  pero eso no significa que no sea un libro que se disfrute  Un libro que tenga escenas memorables y entranables  a la vez que tenga otras astutas y provocadoras  Vale la pena leer  Lolita   no solo para leer a uno de los mejores escritores de todos los tiempos  sino la obra en la que probablemente mejor se construyen dos de los personajes mas unicos  memorables y complejos de la historia de la literatura  como son Humbert Humbert y Lolita  Vale la pena leer  Lolita   para identificarnos con el relato  tan humano  de esa pasion que puede llevar a un hombre a las puertas de la tortura mas propia e intima  en la que el gran reto de todos nosotros es decidir entre no perder la cordura o no perder la locura que nace en el fuego de nuestra pasion Recomendado a todo aquel lector que busque una de las obras mejor logradas del siglo XX  Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov was definitely a hard read but was incredibly impacting  I originally picked up the book when I was eleven because my sister was reading it for her English class  I was completely confused by the plot line in the book and also stumped by the vocabulary  Seeing as this wasnt a book for an eleven year old  I picked it back up this year to take a second look at it  After seeing the film by Stanley Kubrick I was intrigued to read it again  I really loved the book  The protagonist character Humbert Humbert a man who lost the love of his life when he was very young  moves to America to become a professor at a local college  He rents the room of a widowed  deranged woman and her twelve year old daughter Lolita  who was going through puberty and learning the basics of sexual attraction  Humbert becomes increasingly infatuated with Lolita spending extra time with her writing in his journal  As the two develop a semi flirtatious relationship which develops into a fully sexual relationship and obsession from Humbert to the young girl  Complications including maturity  murder  and love play a major role as this highly disturbing love story rolls on  Lolita was overall disturbing novel that I couldn t help but love for its unconventionality  Read Lolita   Okay I definitely have mixed feelings about this novel  First of all  I just want to say that Nabokov has to be an exceptional writer to make me feel good about this book  It is written in prose  practically flawless prose  and immediately caught my interest at just the first sentence  The words are crafted so eloquently and seamlessly that I myself began to question my own judgement of people characters  Overall  the novel was all disturbing  beautiful  engaging  and even a bit cynical at the same time  I definitely recommend for readers who are capable of departing from their conscience attitudes just enough to get through this book   Really threw you where you think you d never want to be and yet Nabokov s writing is so beautiful you can t help but sympathize with Humbert Humbert s pure and grotesque emotions  The book is like reading poetry  it flows and it s romance fills you in an unexpected way you didn t think possible  I was fascinated by Hum and his Lolita  I was unfortunate to have avoided this novel for a long time as I first came across the film and thought it was beyond crude and just uncomfortable to watch and impossible to enjoy  But the book is now one of my favorites  If only I had one hundredth of his talent  this has to be one of the best books i ve ever read  go lit and sex  this man s use of a foreign language makes me feel like a mute   Nabokov is and always will be the greatest prose writer   Reviews for Lolita are a little bit pointless  A lot of people have already made up their mind about it  whether they ve read it or not  and that s fine  It has become this strange artifact in the literary world  A sort of philosophical question in and of itself   Can you separate the art from the artists   in Lolita s case becomes   Can you separate a story from the way it s told   Because  as a work that is strangely sympathetic to a pedophile  it can be a bit nauseating  but as a work in the hands of one of the most beautiful wordsmiths  it can make you feel butterflies  That is the strength of Lolita  and perhaps its purpose  more so than being a piece of provocation  or a way to showcase Nabokov s craftsmanship  but a showcase for his careful understanding and control of humans emotions battling their instincts and the ways they can be manipulated and controlled  For me  it is a work of impossible genius  To others it will be pornography  Either way  it should be read and studied by anyone who cares about serious literary works  It is also a fun little road trip  A slice of Midwestern Americana by way of Russia and France  A truly unique sensation  Two thirds of the way through I was anxious that this was going to turn out like Pale Fire  Humbert Humbert is much like PF s Kinbote in so many ways  At the end of PF I was dismayed that Kinbote was absent any redeeming features  In Lolita  there may be something to say for Humbert Humbert  at least in the end Nabokov s writing is incomparable  So clever  so beautiful  and to my dismay  so full of despair  What I ve loved about the Dickens I ve read is that the happiness comes to those who deserve it   I just hope that in reading more Nabokov  I can find a novel  written as only Nabokov can  but where good ultimately triumphs over evil  Nabokov writes with an expression I suppose only intelligent readers are able to keep up with  Satirical anecdotes and scrumptious references from various literary figures as well as writings keeps his writing alive  The expression in which he writes about Humbert and then assumes the position of him  switching from first to third person back and forth makes you feel as if a Shakespearean monologue is at play  This novel has me speechless  as it has put me in serious contemplation as to who I am  if I m sympathetic towards his main character  Is he a manipulative genius who s using psychological warfare via his expression in this novel to show the audience a mirror or am I a sociopath of sorts  I have yet to figure out  Well this novel has motivated me to write again  there s nothing else I could ask for  I thank a special friend for introducing me to the ingenious magnum opus of the great Russian spawn of graciousness  My heart goes out to her Viva la vida    I put Lolita down after the first few pages thinking I couldn t stomach it  And then after feeling guilty for a few days about neglecting a classic  I picked it back up  and I m very glad I did  In the first few pages Hummbert Humbert admits he s a killer and a pedophile  Its definitely jarring at first as pages upon pages are spent describing Humbert s passion for  nymphets   The prose is invigorating  and I found myself genuinely enjoying it  and even beginning to feel sympathy for the despised narrator Reading this novel was definitely an experience  I didn t dare read it in public  and I almost felt guilty for enjoying it  But  Nabakov pulls of writing sensually without being vulgar  except  of course  that the topic itself is as vulgar as you can get   Humbert s speech was surprisingly proper  there s not a single derogatory word in this book  In the end  I accepted that this book s themes are more about consuming love and obsession than perversion  Definitely looking forward to reading other Nabakov works  A book whose literary merits transcend its subject matter  Nabokov succeeds in showing off his mastery of prose and language  which are not his native   It s been on my  to read  list for as long as I can remember  but for obvious reasons  I ve been dreading it  What can I say except as disturbing as it is  it s equally brilliant  Stephen King can t hold a candle to the skin crawling tension of this book  Add to that the perfection of Jeremy Irons  spot on audible narration  he s no longer Scar to me    for better or worse  he s Humbert Humbert in the flesh   Not for the faint of heart and not at all enjoyable per say  though there are laugh out loud moments  particularly the pre and post murder dialogues   I still recommend this classic  And if you ve started it and put it down over and over  as I had  I really recommend the audible version  Really  Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast  I think I m the only person who thinks that Kubrick s film of this book is his best film  I had put off reading the book although books are usually much better than the movie but since I love the movie I was afraid of slight disappointment  I was not disappointed  A great book with very dark humor  a unique tale among literature  A book told from the viewpoint of a pedophile yet a man who really loves Lolita  Obsession is something that can never be satisfied and this is a great novel of obsession  I like some things the author mentioned in  I think  the Afterword where he easily explains the difference in pornography and art  although he never uses the word art  and how at first no American publisher would touch the book  I laughed when he mentioned that there were three things   at the time he wrote it  that American publishers wouldn t publish  Lolita being the example pertaining to him but the other two I d never thought about  one of which would be about an atheist who lives a long  happy and productive life and dies in his sleep at the age of 106  A great book and probably unlike anything you ve read before  AND it is NOT pornography  Just read it with an open mind and you ll be glad you did  Just closed the book  I want to cry    Trust a murderer for a fancy prose style  This book was hard to find  My classmate bought it for me in Manila and as soon as it landed on my hands  this became as one of my most adored books ever I was very young when I first read this  2nd year high school  Some of my coevals were reading YA Romance at that time  Gossip Girl was a hit  But here I am  reading Nabokov in all his glorious wordplay  I have to admit though that I couldn t turn a page without getting my dictionary to look for a new word encountered  I was so in awe of his writing that at some point I tried to imitate him through my poetry  which of course  turned out pretty badly  This book took me ages to read and digest fully  Though the plot is pretty simple to follow  devoid of complex characters or plot twists only sweeping controversy  Nabokov s diction was hard to decipher  The lines between prose and poetry are blurry in his narrative  If there s any consolation that this book has given me it was at the same year of reading this  I won champion in Spelling Contest  Quando comprei Lolita  de Vladimir Nabokov  nunca tinha ouvido falar nem do livro nem do autor   nem sequer tinha visto nenhuma das adaptacoes cinematograficas  Nem imaginava qual fosse o conteudo  Era uma edicao daquelas que se vendem com jornais e revistas  Nao tenho aqui comigo o exemplar  e nao estou certo com que jornal ou revista e que o comprei  Mas recordarei para sempre as palavras Lolita  luz da minha vida  fogo da minha virilidade  Meu pecado  minha alma  Lo li ta  a ponta da lingua faz uma viagem de tres passos pelo ceu da boca abaixo e  no terceiro  bate nos dentes  Lo  Li  Ta As palavras que  enquanto lia  me beijavam na boca  As palavras que me percorriam o corpo  o faziam estremecer  como notas de de uma musica que me tocavam  Reli  agora em voz alta  Lo li ta  a ponta da lingua faz uma viagem de tres passos pelo ceu da boca abaixo e  no terceiro  bate nos dentes  Lo  Li  Ta  Lolita podia resumir se assim  um romance que comeca com um fogo  um incendio imenso  que depois se vai apagando  que depois se extingue  depois de tudo ter consumido  depois de tudo ter devastado  E este o problema dos romances que conseguem o feito extraordinario de nos agarrar no primeiro paragrafo  Tudo o que vem a seguir tem menos luz  ainda que momentos de um brilho intenso surjam de quando em quando  O Narrador  Humbert Humbert  continua Pela manha  um metro e trinta e dois a espichar dos soquetes  era Lo  apenas Lo  De calcas praticas  era Lola  Na escola  era Dolly  Era Dolores na linha pontilhada onde assinava o nome  Mas nos meus bracos era sempre Lolita Humbert Humbert  Ha no nome do personagem e narrador  Humbert Humbert  na repeticao do nome  uma repreensao velada  resignada  uma repreensao como quando alguem fala para outra pessoa  sabendo que ja nao ha nada a fazer  que nunca houve  Humbert Humbert  lemos  Lemos   a fatalidade   e a inevitabilidade  Humbert Humbert  como uma mae que encolhe os ombros e abana a cabeca  perguntando sem perguntar  que hei de fazer contigo  E Humbert Humbert continua  A sua historia  a sua confissao  o seu depoimento  o seu pecado  Nabokov  the spine of my Penguin Modern Classics edition reads  Nabkov     is it a collector   was writing in an acquired language  which seems to be just too clever for mere mortals considering the quality of the prose  Then he sculpts a story around a taboo  but writes in a way so engrossing that you are swallowed up into the psyche and world of Humbert Humbert  the main protagonist  as he relentlessly pursues the adolescent target of his infatuation  The language is clever and poetic  and I can t help feeling that Nabokov is playing a very clever joke on the reader  Why are you reading a book that has as its main character a paedophile  Does the literary and artistic nature of the character and indeed the novel disguise the subject matter  Please don t admit that at anytime you sympathise  empathise or identify in any way whatsoever with any aspect of Humbert no matter how mundane  Read it  Its not what it seems  By the way it s a brilliant book written by this well known lepidopterist    you know what it means  you just don t want to admit it  i see that everyone else already has declared undying love for this book  so what can i add  i had never read it until just now  last week  i found that as soon as i started couldn t stop reading  i read on the subway  i walked down the street at night finishing the last chapter and postscript by the intermittent light of the streetlamps these last six blocks toward home   This is the first book I ve given 5 stars to  because I couldn t stop talking about it for days  Maybe weeks  Everyone I ran into I asked   have you read Lolita    What made it exceptional was that I kept having to pause to marvel at Nabokov s beautiful writing  Not show offy  not distracting  but just perfect  And to craft a story where we feel sympathy for this hopeless pedophile         perhaps sympathy is the wrong word  We never condone his behavior  but we are fascinated  not repelled  by his story  As I posted on Facebook when I finished it   Nabokov is a genius  This book blew me away      I just read some other reviews of Lolita  and saw things like  possibly the best book ever written in the English language   Glad to know I am not alone in my amazement     Also glad to know that I am not alone in trying to read other Nabokov books  and being quite disappointed  I harbored a secret shame for this book for years  I remember sitting in a free period  laughing uproariously at Humbert Humbert s delusions when the study hall monitor told me in no uncertain terms that I was reading filth and filth was no laughing matter  What a jerk  It wasn t until it was assigned in one of my 11th grade courses that I realized she was just a dumb old biddy and she was clearly missing out on one of the most perfect books ever to be written  So beautiful  so disturbing   bGD lnZr  n rHl   lm lnfs l Zym  lly bnrwHh fy  qwl lshkhSyt  bs  ktr Hj   jbtny fy lktb dh hw nh jh fy wqth lmnsb lktb

spoiler   I don t know where to begin reviewing this book  It is a phenomenal book  great and terrible  absolutely ingeniously crafted  and nothing I write will ever be a fraction of a fraction as good as Lolita  This is the fourth time  or fifth  I can t quite remember  I ve read Vladimir Nabokov s  great prose masterpiece   or whatever reviewers typically call it  and each subsequent time I read it  I gain more insight into Humbert s character and moral failures  I pick up on more subtle clues  and puns  so many puns and wordplay  in the text that tell me things I should have picked up on earlier  Nabokov truly was a genius  and this book is the result of it  Lolita is a detective story for the reader  an investigator  truly a member of the jury to which Humbert narrates his story Everyone knows the basic concept that is the story of Lolita  Dolores Haze  Middle aged Humbert Humbert swoops down upon her life and corrupts here  igniting what he considers to be a love affair with her while she is subjected to his immense physical and emotional will  Humbert controls Lolita with his own powerful  corrupt and deviant will and bends her to his sexual whims    until there comes a glimmer of rebellion  of escape  something that Lolita grasps onto as firmly as she can  only to subject herself more into her life of  sadness and hardship   as she writes to Humbert later I have a tattoo of a quote from Lolita on my left upper arm  and I always have difficulties explaining why I love this book so much and why I chose it for a tattoo    mostly to people who haven t even read the book  Most know the book as that pornography by that one Russian author  who probably was diddling little girls on the side the whole time he wrote the book  amirite  ha  Don t even get me started  In this edition of the book that I read    the first version I read and the one dearest to my heart    Nabokov provides his own afterward  on top of the pseudo psychological analysis he has his character John Ray do on Humbert  to explain that readers go into this book expecting a genuine pornography  get disappointed when it isn t  and then cry afoul when they realize it s still a taboo subject   Thus  in pornographic novels  action has to be limited to the copulation of cliches  Style  structure  imagery should never distract the reader from his tepid lust   pg  284   Nabokov categorizes his book as one of  aesthetic bliss   that is  consisting of no outward moral  despite the foreword s assertions  or lesson that should be gained from it Ay  there s the rub   Nabokov also does reference Polonius in Lolita  which is interesting given the Polonius Opelia and Gertrude Hamlet relationships  So my quote here from the play is relevant   When I tell people Lolita is  in fact  my favorite book  or at least one of them  people get offended and completely taken aback because of the reputation they think they know of it  For instance  my roommate recently read the book with that idea in mind  And sure  it takes several readings to get everything Nabokov is saying in the book  and probably not even then  But even on first reading  one can probably pick up on clues that go to the contrary of everything Nabokov intended with this novel  Of course  Nabokov purports to claim nothing  but I d wager that he definitely didn t intend for people to come away fetishizing Lolitas and developing fashions from her plight  Reading it this time around  I picked up much more on not only the sexual horrors that Humbert subjected Lolita to  but also the overt emotional abuse that was evident in every dialogue  every physical touch  every interaction Humbert had with Lo  Reading it time and time again  I understand more of Lo s actions  even if they sweep by Humbert unnoticed There is no excuse for not recognizing that Lolita is the victim  What s interesting to me  then  is how Humbert doesn t realize what he s doing to her    and even in the end  when he engages in some retrospection  his seemingly genuine remorse is always questionable given his status as an unreliable narrator  That is what is so interesting to me  that Nabokov can deceive the reader into thinking Humbert is benevolent and just wants to love Lolita  rather than recognizing a story of abuse  Indeed  John Ray says in the foreword   How magically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse  a compassion for Lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author   That s the most intent I can figure Nabokov had  but he does so in a way that makes you realize that you are only getting Humbert s point of view  So if you find yourself agreeing with Humbert  that is the stark moment of recognizing that his spell has worked on you too  And that s the whole point You are supposed to read with a sense of disgust and discomfort  The few explicit sexual descriptions are supposed to make you squirm  as they make Lo squirm when they are actually happening to her  The psychology behind Nabokov s villain  who refers to himself as a hero in one explicit instance  is fascinating  how he can be so blind to Lolita s suffering  and then later claim to understand what she went through  It s interesting analyzing his earlier loves and the purpose for those  He refers to himself as a monster  a brute  all the things that Lolita knows he is but he can t objectively see    or subjectively see  empathically  from Lolita s perspective I could go on and on about Humbert s character based on little hints and snippets he says in this book  I ll let other readers decide on their own why Humbert acts the way he does and how Lolita deals with it  Just understand that I will defend this book    and its young female hero    to the death  I could never understand how people can NOT love this book  I am absolutely in love with it  its one of my new favorites of all time  Perhaps it was because I read along with Jeremy Iron s audio recording  but the book came alive to me  I love Humbert  and I completely understand how he feels  I feel for him  I can tell all he wanted was for him and Lo to be happy  and for her to love him in return  But she just hated him more as time passed  He was polite  obsessed  and giving  And I thought  if only she felt the same way about him  their relationship might have worked  I love these kinds of relationships  I hope I find more literiture on this topic  Nabokov s prose gets 10 stars out of 5  The subject matter was not the most appealing I ve ever considered  but his writing leaves you breathless   Jeg er vild med kontrasten i det smukke sprog og den fordaervede historie  AMAZING STORY   This definitely became one of my favourites   An old and interesting story of a middle aged man Humbert that falls in love with a twelve year old girl named Lolita  They pass through a lot of sacrifices and really hard moments until the end  but the end finishes with them being separated  Lolita married with someone else waiting a child  and Hambert staying alone forever For the first time that I took this book on my hands   I thought it wouldn t be such heart breaking and such marvellous  But it just surprised me and     WOW no comment  I highly recommend it to anyone   Beautiful writing  intentionally comical at times and very well done  Regardless of the subject matter  this is an excellent book that tells a story in such a way that many books try  and fail  to mimic even today  If you can read this as objectively as possible  it is an incredibly wonderful read  For me the genius of this story was how much sympathy and understanding I developed for the monster of a man telling this tale despite my better judgement  I don t condone him or his behaviour  but I couldn t help but feel for him  This book is incredibly well written and I highly recommend it  This book kept me busy    busy laughing out loud  busy being disturbed  busy looking up countless word definitions  references and French to English translations  And although the book s subject matter is controversial and it took a bit of labor on my part to read   I cannot deny the fact that I really enjoyed reading this book  This novel starts off  at the surface  by delving into the mind of a crazed intellectual s pedophilia and the great lengths he will go to for his obsession with  Lolita   Then somehow  along the dark twisted road of this book s plot  the story blossoms into a deranged yet touching love story  I really don t know why Lolita had me giving it five stars  It is a decision I made maybe on the last four pages  but I was pondering on writing about the book way before that  Maybe it was the flamboyant pages on the most beautiful and well mannered prose you ll ever find  Maybe it was the symbolism  written in what were small  but necessary and present doses  Could it be the moral dilemma  This book certainly has enough to be both a classic and a travesty  I must push on the moral dilemma stuff  though  because that s what makes the reading of Lolita a painful  although beautiful one  The truth is that Lolita hits all the marks of what constitutes a great novel    I just listed them here  but you can look for yourself to see if it isn t the most appealing piece of fiction even before you read it  the most gruesome experience in the process of getting to the end of it and the sense of relief and awe for having finished it and see it sitting on the shelf with no more pressure on you  the reader  Using the words as his weapon  our protagonist tries to get us on his side by distorting reality and presenting her differently  I m sure you could resist his charm  but can you resist his talent I know I was conflicted from page one  Sometimes I wished I could stop and drop the book just to assertate how gorgeously edited it was  I but couldn t  since it had such a dreaded theme  It s even more difficult to decide on wheter you like it or not  because every bit is written with the virtuosism of a scholar  who manages to present the honesty of someone who knows not only his library  but real life too  If it weren t for it s theme  Lolita would probably be one of my favorite books  But Nabokov insists on pulling no punches  so I rested lying in the canvas  We know its protagonist  H  H  is a pedophile  The author probably knew he would be mistaken as one  since it is such full of thoughts on the theme  But what he did was simply  simply my ass  that is one of the most difficult feats of writing a book  create a narrator  one with full biography and traits that would make you believe that it is a real person  maybe the writer itself  But look farther than the same characteristics of most Nabokov characters  foreign middle aged man  University teacher and scholar  and you will find a creature  and I couldn t use a better word  more true to reality than 90  of what we re used to see in Literature  It is also important to remark that nothing in this book is by chance  Nabokov s symbolism is more easy to pinpoint in its short stories  and I m looking at you  Signs and Symbols   probably because it is spread in less words  But in Lolita  it is more than present and it is completely required  Annabel and its freudian consequences are easy to stand out  but we can go further and make a game out of finding meaning in objects  phrases and actions on the novel that you could certainly overlook if you had your brain half turned off  Don t do this to yourself    Lolita deserves all of your attention  In the end of the book  it s like we forgot everything Humbert did while we watch his last steps feeling no more anger about his actions and treating him like a western hero with his gun and revenge on his mind  Even if we don t cheer him on the pursuit of the lost girl and her omnipresent patron Although my portuguese translation made me feel like I was definitely missing something  I think I could still appreciate both efforts    the creator s and translator s  It is a book with no spare words  even if it is a few chapters longer  with what it seems like two different books altogether   But it s all in there  Since my recommendation is too long  I m putting it here  I recommend to people who like to dive headfirst into a book  Mind that this one is a frozen lake  And it takes a few bumps to reach water  But oh how good it feels to reach the bottom  I m going to unfortunately be quick with this review because I m writing it on my iPhone  This special little book my class took two weeks to dive through  but oh my goodness  with good reason  There s so much in the language  I know it demands at least two more good reads  heh  i made a funny  out of it  While reading it I kept a pencil in hand and a majority of what I marginalized or circled was either the french  i took two semesters of french  however a good majority of it didn t stick  or the words I was unfamiliar with  Which was a considerable amount  I haven t experienced a vocabulary like this since Catch 22  Thats not a bad thing  but I do not currently have time to sit and look them up in a dictionary  However  whenever I get around to that second read  which I most definitely will   I will do so  If you re on the fence about reading this book  just remember that yes  its an uncomfortable read  content wise  for sure  One of my peers said she wont even read it and I cant fault her   and you cant on moral grounds agree with a good majority of the choices made by the characters  but if you read it anyway and look beyond that  the book can be an interesting read And now i ve got to go to class  and see what others thought of it   While the topic of this is a little hard to come to terms with  the writing is just amazing  which is probably what everyone else says about this book  but oh well  there are sentences in Lolita which bloom and clutch at you  making you stop to read them again  but they are never so awkwardly placed as to draw your attention from the story  nor do they drag on and tangle you up in thought  Though it makes for a slower read  I highly recommend reading the annotated edition of this book  I think Lolita contains more allusions to art  literature  and culture than any book I ve ever read  There s something like 10 annotations just for the first chapter  and that chapter is only two paragraphs long   An obscure love story of humbert humbert and his counterpartes daughter  The normal  the not so normal  and the suprisingly sweet and romantic story about an older man and a little girl who seems to have gotten into beauty from a young age  It denotes the the tragic  sudden  and timely romance of two people that are not so meant to be  A relationship as indifferent and secretly a rollercoaster ride of what relationships are or have always meant to be  odd and unpredictable   I prefer this version  with the annotations  I missed so many things the first time I read  What did I learn  Don t trust your trusted narrator  A very frantic glimpse of post post war America and America s obsession with youth  America has only changed for the worse since this was written  Our tastes have only gotten more banal   Delicious subversion conveyed with the most beautiful language  not the native language of Nabokov  The writing is so beautiful that it can capture your heart despite the subject matter It s sick  it s a romance  it s a road story  an attack on American kitsch  and a detective novel wrapped up in one  The story in itself is a tragedy  Humbert  Quilty  Charlotte  and especially Lolita all face tragic circumstances  Some or more guilty than others  some are just guilty of being dumb  For the subject matter  I was concerned about how interested I could really get into the fictional memoir of a pederast  but I was able to connect with some of Humbert s emotions  Even madmen have hearts  the only difference is their perception of what is wrong and right is twisted  From my own experience  I began to pity Humbert  which I think was Nabokov s intention  However  I always pitied Dolores Haze  all the way until the last page  Her plight is one we never are too certain about because we never hear things from her perspective  but there are plenty of clues  A Russian friend described this to me as Nabokov s love letter to the English language  Too much is made of the book s controversial storyline and too little is said about how fantastically and hilariously written it is  This  I think  is why I wasn t really impressed with Kubrick s film version  and why I never bothered to see the other  more recent movie  To see the story minus the prose is to miss the point of Lolita completely  before reading Lolita  it appears I have made a little fun of the author the last time I ve passed through Montreux  Didn t notice the name of the statue at the time  but it sure looked familiar on his wiki page I finished the damn book about a month ago  yet I still feel cranky  I know I should give it the masterpiece treatment it deserves  yet I also would like to take Nabokov down a peg for his afterword where he plays the misinterpreted genius card and looks down his nose at the critics and at the reading public alike  I feel the only challenge to his amazing talent comes from his equally massive ego  I presume there exists readers who find titillating the display of mural words in those hopelessly banal and enormous novels which are typed out by the thumbs of tense mediocrities and called  powerful  and  stark  by the reviewing hack  He is equally dismissive of accusations of pornography  While it is true that in ancient Europe  and well into the eighteenth century  obvious examples come from France   deliberate lewdness was not inconsistent with flashes of comedy  or vigorous satire  or even the verve of a fine poet in a wanton mood  it is also true that in modern times the term  pornography  connotes mediocrity  commercialism  and certain strict rules of narration  Speaking of ego  I know it s wrong to judge the author based on his fictional character  and that  Lolita  is in no way autobiographical  but our not so humble Humbert Humbert is similarly burdened by his egocentric belief in his own superiority to the riffraff he had to deal with in his journeys  He can be a suave and entertaining bastard with his Old World charm and his caustic observations of New World affectations and petty mindedness  Repeatedly he mentions how good looking he is   like a Hollywood actor  and how cultured he is  He s also a real clever fellow with all his word games and chess playing and self serving psychological arguments he uses to justify his criminal behaviour  A reader can almost be swayed to his cause by his gleeful recollections of the tactical maneuvering in getting his dirty hands on the object of his desire  Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who  to certain bewitched travelers  twice or many times older than they  reveal their true nature which is not human  but nymphic  that is  demoniac   and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as  nymphets   In another place    My little cup brims with tiddles     this one referring to his encyclopaedic knowledge of preadolescent girls physiology and mentality I didn t buy into his arguments  True  I have direct knowledge of traditional gipsy communities where even today 12 year old girls are considered marriageble  My issue with Humbert is not so much the age of his nymphet but one of premeditation and one of consent  He paints himself as a helpless sclave of his obsessions  yet he goes about the conquest with relentless focus and subterfuge  He shows no remorse  no regrets for his actions  view spoiler   with the exception of the very last pages of the novel  but for me it was a case of too little  too late   hide spoiler     The most damning circumstance comes once he has Lolita under control  a classic case of the criminal blaming the victim and blackening her character   She made me do it  Your Honor  She s no innocent   argument left a bitter taste in my mouth       she was holding in her hands a beautiful  banal  Eden red apple  To compound his guilt in my eyes  Humbert is clearly browbeating   bullying the girl into keeping the secret with threats of orphanage and with physical violence  I think my reaction is not accidental  Nabokov the chessmaster who spent days devising game puzzles and the entomologyst who stared for hoursat a microscope and catalogued butterfly sex organs knows how to play with the reader s expectations  and there are clues and portents on every page that Humbert is an unreliable narrator and that the story is headed for a bitter ending  not a spoiler  since the book opens up with the death of Humbert Humbert in prison   It may be a single phrase of the girl going to sleep crying  every night  every night    It may be the foreshadowing presence of the gun in his baggages Another aspect that bothered me is the lack of empathy  the objectification of Lolita  The novel is all about Humbert  and Dolores Haze remains hazy to the end in her characterization and motivations  Humbert is singing hymns to her body and to her youth  but he doesn t bother to talk to her  to get to know her  He is all about jealous control  exclusivity  obsession  In the later chapter he is more interested in extracting revenge for his wounded ego than in helping Lolita through a difficult moment I think I ve talked enough about Humbert  pederosis   If this were all the novel is about  probably it would have been forgotten by now  seeing as it isn t all that explicitly lewd as its detractors tried to demonstrate  Apart from one famous couch scene  the author uses suggestion and allusion towards intimate details  and prefers to concentrate on the mind games Hubert plays  I have identified two major themes that have little to do with Lolita but justify for me the opera magnus label 1   the roadtrip   the journey through 1950 s American landscape  the sweeping vistas  the dusty small towns  the dingy motels and the endless highways  the small minded people and the cultural desert as witnessed by the Old Blood European intellectual  lolita belongs in the same category with On the Road by Kerouac and With Travels With Charley by Steinbeck  The main difference being that instead of drinking companion or trusty pet  Humbert takes along his trip a nubile plaything 2   the language   such joy  such exuberance  such playful subversion of conventions in the construction of the phrase  in the descriptions of ordinary objects or emotions make a stark contrast to the morbid plot and inspire me to consider re reading the novel only for savouring the stylish presentation and the numerous hidden gems of literary reference  anagrams and ricanements  furious sarcasm   I m lucky in being familiar with the French language  but I think I will still need an adnotated edition of the text next time  For example  I think I caught a reference to Theodore Dreiser in a scene on the lake with Lolita s mother  and I would like confirmation Other discoveries include a word that wikipedia doesn t recognize  but it is familiar in Romanian language  probably of Turkish or Slavic origin   charshaf  instead of diaphanous veil  simultaneously hiding and revealing Lolita s charms The English language is not a fixed  rigid system to Nabokov  it is constantly changing  evolving  renewing itself with new blood   from French  German or Latin roots  from science or from pop culture elements  from invented words and from looking at old  familiar words from a different perspective  Here s a few examples  My west door neighbor  who might have been a businessman or a college teacher  or both  would speak to me once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his car  or  at a later date  defrosted his driveway   I don t mind if these verbs are all wrong  or  The tone of his brain had affinities with my own  He mimed and mocked me  His allusions were definitely highbrow  He was well read  He knew French  He was versed in logodaedaly and logomancy  He was an amateur of sex lore  He had a feminine handwriting  He did not use a fountain pen which fact  as any psychoanalyst will tell you  meant that the patient was a repressed undinist  I checked and  logodaedaly  stands for the arbitrary or capricious coining of words   logomancy  for word divination   undinist  for onanist  I m still baffled by  kiddoid gnomide    Something about goats and gnomes  Probably There s even some Lewis Carrol word association and nonsense rhymes around  probably used to mock psychoanalysts  The Squirl and his Squirrel The Rabs and their RabbitsHave certain obscureand peculiar habits Male hummingbirds Make the most exquisite rockets The snake when he walksholds his hands in his pockets    mocking or not  his efforts at poetry can be beautiful and haunting  My car is limping Dolores Haze And the last long lap is the hardest Ad I shall be dumpedwhere the weed decays And the rest is rust and stardust  From Nabokov s afterword comes the best summary of the novel and the best reason for recommending the book  An American critic suggested that  Lolita  was the record of my love affair with the romantic novel  The substitution  English language  for  romantic novel  would make this elegant formula more correct   At first I thought it was going to be erotic  Then I thought it to be sinisterly masturbatory on Nabokov s behalf  Now it is just plain haunting  It s a convincing love story of the worst kind  which makes it so palatable for even the sensitive reader  It s also a looking glass into post war America from the eyes of an emigre  It s also meta fictional  Great read  Years ago when I first read this novel I was too immature to really appreciate it s aesthetic value  In fact  it was the main reason I disliked the novel to begin with  I thought it was excessively euphuistic back when I was only accustomed to reading the featured crap that comes into view when you first enter a bookstore  I couldn t comprehend how people could enjoy a novel which initially seemed to me rather unstimulating  As I later began reading more highly regarded classics  and slowly started realizing what was within the pages of  Lolita   I decided to go back and re read it again  and what a wonderful re discovery that was Perhaps it s not politically correct to admit I enjoyed the boldness of Humbert Humbert  the pervert  the pedophile  but I did I usually despise arrogance  and I absolutely loath child molesters  as most people do  but as crazy as it sounds  Nabokov does an excellent job of making these qualities becoming to Humbert  I don t know what my justification for tolerating Humbert s audacity is  but to me  with this particular character it is permissible When you read this story  deep down inside a part of you condones Humbert s behavior  True  Humbert is a sick man  There s no question  But Nabokov  in a very particular way of presenting this piece of literary art  executed his conduct as sadistic  yet ever so graceful When I m reading the words in this book  I feel like I m licking an ice cream that doesn t melt  and I m licking it for the pure enjoyment and act of licking itself  It s lustful  but not in the way you think  not in an explicit way  Nabokov s prose is like an aphrodisiac that mollifies the consciousness  One can feel voluptuous sensations on the mouth and lips when reading these sensually strung words Yes  Humbert is despicable    but the prose is spellbinding  A very little part of me thinks of Humbert when I read this book  Not to say I don t think of Humbert at all  I find his devotion to Lolita persuasive and succumbing I think many readers pick up Lolita expecting  not necessarily wanting  to read vivid descriptions of salaciousness and debauchery  but it s not like that at all  Humbert s predatory advances are almost covert  Only in the readers  mind do the words become corrupt I often swerved into judgment on the general subject  but the instant I realized this I jolted myself back into the art of the prose so i could be able to enjoy it thoroughly  That s not to say I didn t have opinions about the subject of Lolita I struggled a lot to understand how I felt about Dolores  There was definitely a certain admiration on my part  I felt like I inter connected with her feelings of detachment and the inconsequential impact it had on her life  Not only was she not a virgin by the time Humbert mishandled her  she had also already had had lesbian experiences by then as well  I m not making excuses for him  of course I am not  I realize he was a child predator  with or without Lolita  but I choose to view them as two isolated characters in the world of literature  Had Lolita been a pure  uncontaminated  wholesome  untouched  and an inexperienced young girl  I might have yelled bloody murder  But she was not So in essence there was a lot of realism involved in the writing of this story  though people can t fathom it  and choose to narrowly judge and dismiss all possibilities that this is realistic  It s very realistic But mostly  my condoning this behavior stems from my own experiences back when I was a nymphette myself  So instead of making excuses for Humbert  I should just come out and say that I see a lot of my old self in Lolita It s hard for me to read Lolita and dismiss it as vile and morally offensive when I feel as if I m reading what could be a story of my own past childish  love  stories   but I digress Albeit  there are fragments of displeasure that remind the reader who we re dealing with here  For example  when Humbert goes to the schools everyday to observe children being let out of school from his car  and in bringing Lola with him we re reminded he s a kidnapper  and in making Lola do favors for him in the car  forces Lola to be an accomplice as well  Here is one of the examples of how the author dehumanizes Lolita  She never once objects to Humbert s other interests of perversion that might have involved others like her  Nabokov did not equip Lola with any feelings other than selfish coquetry in this book whatsoever  In comparison to the fresh rosy cheeked children that Humbert hasn t had the pleasure of bastardizing yet  Lola  in those brief moments appears to us careworn and de colorized and most sadly  dispensable Humbert goes on to share with his readers his fantasy of possibly having his own biological  nymphettes  with Lola  How disgusting  and so disappointing  I have to choose to believe he only loved Lola  otherwise it would probably ruin the whole novel for me In the end Humbert pays for what he did to Lola  in spades When Quilty enters the picture and follows Lo and Humbert as they travel from hotel to motel  readers witness the two demons vying over the same soul  I loved it Quilty possessed a remarkably creepy factor  They couldn t have picked a better actor to portray that part in the film adaptation  Frank Langella is so freaking disturbing   You see I loved her  It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight     Vladimir Nabokov  Nabokov s writing is flawless   People were surprised when I picked up Lolita  Many people assume it to be trashy and  well  disgusting  I don t particularly blame them  as it s a story about a pedophile and his relationship with a young girl  But if you can work up the courage to read it  you will find it s an amazing piece of art Essentially  Vladimir Nabokov took a taboo topic  a terrible  disgusting  nasty topic  and created a story of love  devotion  and beauty Now I m not defending the actions taking place in this story  and I completely agree it s sick  But it isn t presented that way  Instead  readers are in the mind of a pedophile  witnessing each decision he makes  and the thoughts behind it  We see the struggle and madness taking place  but we also see the love and care as well I m not saying Lolita is for everyone  I certainly don t believe that  It really takes a mature  and somewhat open mind to be able to get through this book  But if you may be able to  I highly suggest giving it a try   Nabokov succeeded in writing one if the most enthralling books I ve ever read  There are so many great reviews on storyline that I will limit mine mostly to his writing  The title of the book suggests it will be about Lolita  but it is the fictional autobiography of HH  A testament to Nabokov s skill  even with a flashback approach  the suspense of the novel isn t ruined  If anything  you want to keep reading to find out how HH ends up where he does  Another example of Nabokov s excellent writing is to keep the reader intrigued through the creep factor that underlies the story and bubbles over on some scenes  I agree  it takes a master to make the reader almost feel sympathy for the lascivious protagonist antagonist  You catch yourself saying  wait a minute  This isn t a pathetic creature  He is a sicko  But too late  you are torn because you are in his head  Because he is such a multifaceted character  you see his bits of humanity as redeeming  I agree with other reviews  this book can mean different things to people depending on your views and age  Some people root for Lolita  some condone her  Interesting for any reader though  I think  Disturbing  thought provoking  so well written I couldn t put it down    One of the few books which can turn the story of a monster and victim into a subtle  personal lens on the way our world works to hide uncomfortable truths  The lack of care protection of children is woven into the entire story in tiny  veiled glimpses  especially in terms of Lolita s youthful confusion  but also in Humbert Humbert s sometimes hilarious   but so clearly predatory   attempts to make her his own  Chilling  Written with power and perception  A very interesting read indeed   Well and truly a masterpiece  I actually don t think I ve ever read a book with a more intricately compelling narrator  Humbert Humbert is unreliable  insane  poetic  romantic  hideous  despicable  witty  cloyingly narcissistic  enthralling  at times laugh out loud funny  A monster  I mean  a monster  Creepy fucking creeper from Creep Town  And it s fascinating   to be told this story in such beautiful prose with someone so heinously awful at the helm of it all  It s the ultimate crafting of character  For real  Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita Did she have a precursor  She did  indeed she did  In point of fact  there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved  one summer  a certain initial girl child  In a princedom by the sea  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer  You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  exhibit number one is what the seraphs  the misinformed  simple  noble winged seraphs  envied  Look at this tangle of thorns  Opening paragraphs  AAAARE YOU KIDDING  That s unbeatable  That s a kick to my goddamn solar plexus  And the rest is just as remarkable   ethereally lovely juxtaposed ly driven by the dark  insidious  terrible things at its heart Masterpiece  Absolutely fantastic  I m sad to have finished it  Vladimir Nabokov is brilliant and truly weird  While reading Lolita  I often felt the book should be illegal  Humbert Humbert is too creepy yet fascinating and Dolores Haze is strange object of desire  i e   I fake it so real  I am beyond fake  Courtney Love   Doll Parts  I was disturbed yet enjoyed this story  Pale Fire is next on my list  Incredible ReadingFunny  sad  angry  confused and shocked   those were just some of the emotions I experienced while reading this book   A must read  Not quite finished but how could you give Nabokov less than five stars  I have been meaning to read this book forever  but I felt reluctant given the subject matter  Let me just say that his virtuosity as a writer  he is almost painterly in his descriptions  makes for a blissful reading experience  His creative  playful  innovative use of language makes me think I would give just about anything to be able to write like that  What a master  What a genius  I don t know any writer who compares in inventiveness and pure poetry  That said  we now turn to the theme  a hulking old man  as I imagine him who lusts after and uses a young  very young girl for his deviant sexual satisfaction  I don t know why Nabokov decided to use his gargantuan talent in writing about something so revolting  I can only guess that he might have felt it was interesting psychological material As Fate would have it my library finally came through with a request I put in ages ago  I am now reading A Stolen Life  the memoir of the little girl who was kidnapped by a real pedophile and lived in his backyard  I m half way through and want to hurry and finish it and get that book out of my house  It is sickening  Which has made me have to acknowledge the vast plains of difference between art and life  I don t know exactly what Nabokov s aim was in writing Lolita  but no real pedophile  no matter his IQ thinks like Humbert  And no real little girl has any power at all against her attacker  Lolita exacts all kinds of payment and manipulates her captor as often as he does her  In real life  this could never be  Anyway Here are some of my favorite passages from Lolita  There was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which made my wild delight also perfect  just because the vision was out of reach  with no possibility of attainment to spoil it by the awareness of an appended taboo  indeed  it may well be that the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and great promised  the great rosegray never to be had   She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet I had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past  an echo on the brink of a russet ravine  with a far wood under a white sky  and brown leaves choking the brook  and one last cricket in the crisp weeds        it struck me       that I simply did not know a thing about my darling s mind and that quite possibly  behind the awful juvenile cliches  there was in her a garden and a twilight  and a palace gate  dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me  This book is disturbing in all the right ways  My thinking will never be the same  as though someone spilled something rotten and foul onto my consciousness  Of course  Lolita s life is irrefutably ruined by what Humbert inflicts on her  the outcome of the novel highlighted how monstrous Humbert s actions were  that no little girl should be subject to such things  but let us hold our judgements for a moment and consider the soul crippling reality of Humbert s attraction to these  Nymphets   Paedofilia is dissimilar to conventional homosexual or heterosexual tendancies in the way that age is key   not gender  age  Humbert calls women of his own age  cows  and so forth  he feels no attraction to them  When faced with his husbandly night time duties  he is not only reluctant but actually hates to have intercourse with Mrs Haze  He is aroused solely by these nymphets  Consider yourself in the same position  Your sexual urges lean to nothing but to female minors  Moreover  your lust cannot transcend the boundaries of physical world into love  for you are well aware of the damage that the manifestation of your feelings will inflict  You are consumed by your obssession as all humans are with the object of their desire  Your opportunity comes  Afflicted we are not   I m addressing us readers  and I do see this form of sexuality as an affliction  thus we are unaware of how we would behave should we find ourselves with such urges and in such a circumstance  To clarify  Humbert was wrong in every sense of the word in his advances toward Lolita regardless of whether or not she seduced him  I want only to ask  are we really morally superior to this man if we have never been faced with this moral dilemma ourselves  Assuming  readers  that we are not attracted to pre pubescent girls  have we shown such a feat of restraint as we so self assuredly expect Humbert to have done  If a person who WOULD be a paedofile goes through life never touching the subject s of his desire  let him speak  As for us  I think perhaps our judgements only go so far  I assure you I m not getting carried away   the monster Humbert ruined Lolita s prospects   this is merely something to think about  Don t let the book s reputation of being some perverted man in lusting over a young girl  turn you off this book  If you want to better understand the brilliant prose of Nabokov  read his short story   Spring in Fialta   If you find the imagery breathtaking  then try  Lolita   Parts of Lolita will actually make you laugh out loud    The Hollywood movies should never had been made  they couldn t touch Nabokov s writing  the movies just wanted to cash out on the sex    Excellent book  I want to read more about this author  I read Lolita because I first read Azar Nafisi s book Reading Lolita in Tehran  I was very curious to understand why Nafisi would title her novel after another book  and after reading Lolita I now do  With a very troubling plot and enchanting characters this book was   heavy and sophisticated  Nabokov is beyond mastery of the English language It s a beautiful book  and an important read  In all fields of art  there is a certain line drawn for madness  Many artists tap dance across this line  few cross it  hesitant of the outcome  But the few who walk the line and somersault perfectly over it wouldn t come near to the genius of Nabokov and his genius  Lolita  Thought provoking  heart wrenching  hauntingly beautiful and disturbingly wonderful  Lolita stirs our own inner insanity with its genius prose and plot  I beg anyone and everyone to give Lolita a try  it is more than just a mere perverse affair between man and child  It is a torrent romance  the loss of love and corruption of innocence while still being beautiful beyond words  One of the best writers ever and a personal favourite of mine  due to his impeccable writing style and skills as a translator In Lolita  Nabokov manages to make us sympathise with the narcissistic pedophile Humbert  who is blinded by his obsession and despair  Literature at its best  WARNING   Dangerously  sexy  This is a review of The Annotated Lolita  My review of Lolita

of the many  too many  my dear Vladimir  French sentences  the trillion allusions to other books and poems  the zillion links to Vlad s other novels  is to wade through a fog of half comprehension

Diary  a novel by Pia PeraAarrgh   someone had to go and do it  didn t they  Noooooo  This book  written in the form of an autobiography of a murderer  is as disgusting as beautiful  Nabokov s powerful descriptions of the American landscape  of Humbert s craving for Lolita and of his psychopathic peadophilic nature are beyond earthy comparisons  This book must be read to for the sheer novelty it offers in terms of writing style  form  structure  the idea of a foreword for Humbert s autobiography by a fictitious editor John Ray  Jr   Ph D    and a lot more  Prepare to be haunted by it s undying themes  I highly recommend this book and this version for Nabokov s extra essay about fiction  The sentence structure is just amazing  Humbert Humbert is an amazing larger than life literary creation  This is one of my favorite books  and although I first read this when I was roughly Lolita s age  I remember thinking how it was so beautifully written Humbert Humbert had me at the first paragraph  The sentence  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth   had me whispering the name repeatedly to myself  and trying  and failing  to describe other names in the same manner I disagree with those who say that this book will make you sympathize with the pedophiliac Humbert Humbert  Yes  he is a miserable and wretched man  but the only difference between him and other monsters is his ability to write in such beautiful prose  Beautiful  challenging  sarcastic and savory  Highly influential  to me  that is  I m not qualified to speak of literary influence     This is the only immortality you and I may share  my Lolita I never expected this book to make me feel so much  I felt sympathy sadness and hatred towards Humbert Humbert  with the sadness element  to an extent  winning overall  which felt strange given the nature of his character and actions   It was heartbreaking to see the impact everything had on Lolita  and although at times she was an irritating character  I felt sorry for her exploited innocence and the lack of a stable childhood she had  I had high hopes for  Lolita  before I had even picked it up  and somehow it exceeded those expectations   A gorgeous  chilling read  I was creeped out by my own thoughts while going trough the book  Humbert Humbert s manipulating words worked well on me right until the end  during which I started realizing how horrible a person he actually was  There is no hero  every single character was real and raw   No matter what  you have to read this book   Originally published by Olympia Press in two volumes in 1955   Lolita  exploded on the American scene in 1958  Since then  Nabokov s novel  the memoirs of a pedophile named  Humbert Humbert   has appeared in list after list of the world s greatest literature The memories of a pedophile would seem to be curious material to climb to the top of highly regarded literature  However  it is a master work of comedy  tragedy  and an ironic look at American pop culture of the 1950s Humbert Humbert writes his memoirs as an explanation for his obsession for the taboo of his love of  nymphets  and  faunlets   These are words coined by Humbert himself  But nymphet has entered the dictionary of common English usage We know from the novel s academic foreword that Humbert is dead  that he has perhaps paid the price for his crime by spinning off this mortal coil  struck with a pulmonary thrombosis  Of course  by doing so  he avoids trial for his alleged criminal acts Alleged  Hardly so  as we are told Humbert s story by the man himself  in great detail Why does Humbert find pubescent  girl children  so attractive  His answer has been confirmed by many contemporary researchers who have studied innumerable cases of confirmed pedophiles  Humbert  during early adolescence  fell in love with a young girl his own age  The memories of his tempestuous love leave him fixed in a level of sexual development which he seeks throughout his life  While Humbert is perfectly capable of performing sexually with age appropriate partners  he is not satisfied with those relationships  And so it is with those individuals who find their sexual preference among children In fact  Humbert is cursed  so he thinks  that women his age find him an irresistible target  But it is this curse that leads him to his ultimate  nymphet   Lolita  Humbert finds himself a border in the Haze residence  Mrs  Haze is a widow  supplementing her income by renting out rooms  Humbert senses another unwanted adult entanglement until he happens upon Delores Haze  the landlady s twelve year old daughter Who is Lolita  She is Humbert s idealized image of Delores  She is  L   She is  Lo   She is  Lo lee ta   If Humbert must pay the price of marrying his love child s mother  it is a small price to pay  But luck seems to follow Humbert in his pursuit of the taboo  Lolita s mother is conveniently struck down by a car  running across the street upon discovering Humbert s diary in which he details his lust for her daughter It is a child lover s paradise  Humbert finds himself the stepfather of the girl of his dreams  Lolita returns Humbert s affections  if we are to believe Humbert s memoirs  However  through slips of conscience  Humbert reveals his realization that he has stolen Lolita s childhood  After having his fill of her  night after night  he acknowledges he falls asleep to the quiet sobbing of Lolita  At times when his lust spurs him on to a repeat of the act he has just completed  the child resignedly says   Oh  no  Not again  Humbert s transformation of Delores to a highly sexualized Lolita is a mixed blessing  perhaps bordering on a curse  In his effort to woo her with travel  clothing and gifts  Humbert teaches Lolita that her favors have value  a concept she quickly learns and masters Humbert and Lolita embark on a cross country trek of seemingly every American tourist trap  colonial inn  cabin resort  and monument  famous or not  Lolita is entertained with comics  clothes  and stops at every gift shop where Humbert dutifully forks out the price for whatever Lolita asks  Restaurants are selected on the basis of being favored with  Huncan Dines  desserts  Nabokov skewers American culture in the process But Humbert s sexual education of Lolita leads to his losing her  Ultimately  Lolita abandons Humbert for another  Humbert will search for her for years until he finds her  no longer the nymphet of his dreams but a young married woman expecting her first child  However  the tale is far from over  Humbert searches for the man who stole his Lolita  It is during this quest that Humbert emerges as a tragic anti hero  Could it be that levels of pedophilia exist  with one being more evil than another  That is a decision for the individual reader Nabokov weaves comedy  pathos  and tragedy in a novel that envelopes the reader in a world of taboos  activities that that are culturally unacceptable  all the while beguiling the reader to turn to the next page  However  when Nabokov wrote  Lolita   children who were creations of the imagination of men such as Humbert were just that  Today  what imaginations are being fueled by television programs such as  Toddlers and Tiaras   Flip over to The Learning Channel and decide for yourself  Put aside its controversial story  I think  Lolita  can be seen as the most honest representation of the classical unhappy love story between someone who loves too much and someone who finds themselves so opressed by that love  they have no ther option but to give in The question that I find myself asking was  was Lolita broken to begin with  or did she break because of her  father s  acharnement  Of course  H H was to blame  for everything  but still Her slyness in finding the man s weaknesses  because  no matter how monstruous  Humbert is the weakest of them all  and twisting them to her advantage  getting gifts and money out of his devotion surpised me  for someone her age  she s incredibly manipulative   or maybe it s just that had Humbert been a little stronger  she wouldn t have gotten to be so clever  and maybe  she would have turned out much  much worse  Her mother was never particularly repressive  her  father  wasn t  either   and I suppose that s what saved Lolita  allowing her to escape with that famous man  meeting simpleton she married  finally settling down in a place that  not matter how unpleasant  was still much better than the one she d been in all her young life  And all this happening as she was still young  far too young As for the book in itself  it s written with frankness   Humbert is not in denial  he is aware of his condition  he hates himself for it yet he can t refrain himself   and a touch of enjoyable dark humour  The way he describes Lolita   lovingly  tenderly   is very poetic  and the narration rarely gets dull despite the second part being full of descriptions  they set the scene nicely However  if there is something I deeply disliked   but perhaps that s just due to my reluctance to the genre that is poetry in general   is all those little  poems   or whatever it is they were  towards the end  I suppose that Nabokov had those lines scribbled somewhere and desired to use them at all costs  He shouldn t have  in my idea  but the fact that Quilt s interjections break the rhythm of those poorly constructed rhymes makes it a little more tollerable  however still terribly corny But  despite the poetry  I would say it s definitely one of my favourite books   From spoilersliterature blogspot com  Before I start this entry I want you to keep a couple of things in mind 1  The back cover of my edition has a quote from Vanity Fair describing the novel as  The only convincing love story of our century   This quote is apparently on a number of editions but I cannot find the review it came from  if you know where I can find it please tell me because I m quite intrigued to read it  2  If this novel can be described as a love story I would like to present the following description Humbert Humbert  the narrator  gives of the individual he loves   honey hued shoulders  the same silky supple bare back  the same chestnut head of hair       her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound mouth had briefly paused  and those puerile hips on which I had kissed   Nabokov 39   Pretty lovely and sensual description  right 3  I was drawn to read this book after it was suggested as a perfect example  during a discussion  of how narration can greatly affect an reader s view of the subject matter If you are not aware  Lolita  317 pages  is Vladmir Nabokov s infamous novel that at its core is about the love a pedophile  Humbert Humbert  holds for his 12 year old step daughter  Dolores Haze  although  you must understand  this is an overly simplified description of this novel   The novel is given as a  confession  from the narrator  Humbert Humbert  as he sits in prison  this is set out by a short introduction from a the friend of a lawyer  John Ray  Jr  Ph D  who is given the manuscript to edit after Humbert has died in legal captivity  Although English is not Nabokov s native language  originally born in Russia  his mastery of the English language and the elegant prose he allows his narrator to use is remarkable  I believe it is this noteworthy use of language that leads to the Vanity Fair review in my first point above Throughout my reading of the novel  which I found hard to put down  I found myself feeling considerably sorry for the narrator and somewhat rooting for him  It is only through mentions of Dolores  Lolita  Haze s age that I was pulled out of these sentimental feelings for Humbert and realized that  no matter what  this protagonist should not get what he wants and desires Due to the narration coming from the pedophile himself the subject matter of the novel gets lost within explanations and excuses for his urges and is not shown in the awful light you would expect but given a ray of normality as though every man across the world holds these same desires  I am not saying that I hold desires like this myself but Nabokov s language tricks you into believing it is  regular  The novel is spilt in two parts  the first part explaining everything leading up to the joining of Humbert and Dolores and the second part explaining everything afterward  including their two plus years living together across America as  lovers   and the first part ends with a particular passage that sent shivers down my spine and really explains the situation the young girl is in  This comes after Humbert has told Dolores that her mother is dead and that she only has him   At the hotel we had separate rooms  but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine  and we made it up very gently  You see  she had absolutely nowhere else to go   my italics  Nabokov 142   If helpless had to be described in one sentence it would be that last line I will not lie and say that this novel is an  easy  read  although it flies by  because many of the more descriptive passages can be hard to swallow  as a reader that is disgusted by the idea of pedophilia  but it is worth it in the long run  Nabokov walks a very fine line through Lolita  between an awful subject matter and beautiful narration  but he walks the line well  for this reason I will definitely be reading his work again  Maravillosamente compleja  3  4 25 starsObjective rating  4 5  Characters  5 There are only two important characters in this book  and in both cases it must have been extremely tricky to get them right  First and foremost  there is Humbert Humbert  the pedophile protagonist  how do you write a pedophile  More challenging  how do you write a pedophile that people might actually relate to  and sympathize with  For my part  I think Nabokov met the challenge marvelously  At first  I found it difficult to relate to Humbert Humbert  He seems awfully sure of himself at first  with his pompous prose style  and what with him waxing lyrical about his girl  a  nymphet    which makes one quite uncomfortable sometimes  But as the novel progresses  he reveals some of his vulnerable sides  and you can see that his feelings towards Lolita aren t in themselves  perverted   he is genuinely in love with her  The second character to get right was  then  Lolita  or Dolores  or Lo   Also a difficult feat  because children in literature are too often portrayed as people with no characteristics  because supposedly their character is still developing  Not Lolita  She s a cocky little girl  with all the contradictions and exasperations one can expect of a girl bordering on adolescence  What s more  a  pre  adolescent girl in a situation like hers  being carted around the country by the pedophile who loves you must not be very conductive for a healthy personal development  I can imagine  But here again  Nabokov rises to the challenge admirably  Lolita has character  and not just a little bit  And her unpredictable reactions and teenage dramas are entirely believable  Very well done   Plot  4 I do have some doubts about verisimilitude here  The situation described in this book  i e  a pedophiliac lover taking his object of affection on a wild road trip through the States  seems sometimes too crazy to believe  But while Lolita can hardly be claimed to offer a realistic depiction of everyday life  the way Nabokov describes their progress seems entirely reasonable from the psychology of the characters  As such  I think you could definitely call this novel  character driven   In the beginning there still is some interference from the outside world  cf  Humbert s marriage to Lolita s mother  the death of Lolita s mother etc    but as the book progresses the two main characters are increasingly dependent on each other  Which is good  because it allows the author to really flesh out his characters  and to see how the two influence each other  Right before the end  at about three quarters  I did experience a dip in the story  as Lolita temporarily disappears  This is where Nabokov s brilliant prose keeps you going  however  see below    Writing Style  5 Beyond compare  If you don t like a baroque writing style  this book is probably not for you  but if you enjoy rhetorical writing  you ll feel right at home  Indeed  it s more than anything the protagonist s writing style which make you sympathetic towards him  much more than his plight  though that does change towards the end   His generosity with his writing establishes a general sense of bonhomie  and he manages to balance those two characteristics which people tend to find endearing  he is clever  intelligent  and shrewd  resulting in a grand sense of humor   but he has a sentimental heart  resulting in ecstatic exultations about his one and only love   I would recommend anyone to read this book because of the writing style alone  It is not for someone who likes simple  straightforward prose  but it is a treat to someone who likes  as he calls it   a fancy prose style    Originality Innovation  4 I ll give him four stars here because both his subject matter and his characters are so original  I wouldn t say he ever engages in any formal experiment  in terms of chronology or story structure he does nothing much new  Even the writing style  while it is masterfully handled  I wouldn t call  original  in the strictest sense  In his rhetorical stylization of his text he uses tactics that are centuries old  after all  Nevertheless  I find it a frighteningly original text  Subjective rating  4I think Lolita is a brilliant book exactly because it is so disturbing  Contrary to popular belief  books aren t necessarily written for the reader to  enjoy  in the strictest sense  I think this book is a triumph  but not because  at first  I readily enjoyed it   Enjoyment does come  but only after a while   The most disturbing about this book is that  as a reader  you are constantly thrown into a moral dilemma  because you re never quite sure what it is that you want to happen  You sympathize with the main character  sure  but you don t want to condone his actions  or encourage his romantic fantasies  You feel squeamish about sharing in his joy when his conquest does happen  But then  you can see that he never intended to  corrupt  Lolita  this only happens later  and it s she who made the actual advance  So he was only  wrong  insofar that he let it happen  but knowing how he feels  can we blame him  It is a moral dilemma which lasts quite long throughout the novel  It is only towards the end  when Humbert loses his Lolita  that you can see how desperate he is  and you feel genuinely sorry for him  You don t even blame him for wanting to kill that guy  Since Lolita herself is  by that time  out of the picture  one s moral conscience is eased somewhat  Murder seems more easily understandable than pederasty  for some reason  It is a book which will make you learn more about yourself  I find  Much recommended   This novel is one of the most incredibly verbose literary English compositions I ve read  hell  it gives Shakespeare a  run for his money    and it wasn t even written in the author s first language   Holy Sh t   Neverthless  it s probably the most F CKED up and disturbing of tragedies to pass left to right across the ocular sense of humanity  a grand slam by Mr  Nabokov  I d read it again  Listened to unabridged audio recording by Jeremy Irons  Fantastic  Genius  but of course very creepy too  Brilliant writing  had me completely hooked with it s lovely prose  Yes  I know it is a shocking story but the way it is told draws you into Humbert s mindset time and again before rudely awakening you  that actually  that s not right   As is quoted on the back by Martin Amis   You read Lolita sprawling limply in your chair  ravished  nodding scandalized assent    that about sums it up  Very  very clever  It is funny in parts  Humbert is an ideal narrator  exagerating his virtues  gaining sympathy  before cruelly dashing his own hype and showing himself up for what he is  A very profound read  you always have to be looking beneath the murky surface for the reality that Humbert manages to prettify so well  Books that require effort to read   and not in the sense that evidence of the book s finite length is required to secure the reader s sanity   aren t common these days  even in the realm of older literature  Nabokov favors a very literate style that rewards careful reading  external reconsideration  and perseverance on a small scale  Each sentence and paragraph deliberately conveys a mood  be it eroticism  self loathing  or the ennui of an interminable road trip Hebephilia isn t a universal human condition  but the convoluted  contradictory mental gymnastics required to reassure oneself that things will be all right surely is  It is difficult to sympathize with a child rapist  Our society tells us that this man should not deserve sympathy  and Nabokov fulfills that prediction by taking to its logical conclusion the match between a 40 year old with a fetish and a tween with neither the wisdom nor the recourse to turn him down  At the same time  Humbert s intellect allows him some abortive self awareness  and the possibility of his real heartbreak and regret provides an emotional in for the reader The fascination of the unreliable narrator genre is that  given appropriate authorial skill  the characters are allowed to be smarter than the readers  Because most stories are presented with the assumption that they are objectively exposited  a reader might actually be inclined to believe that a narrator s evaluation of his own mental state is entirely accurate   and is that ever true of anyone  Crime through the eyes of the criminal  especially one as erudite and inclined to metacognition as Humbert  is an exercise in confronting one s own failures of morality and self criticism  Lolita is as amazing as everyone claimed it to be  erudite yet playful  tongue in cheek  linguistically acrobatic  bold and sensual  disturbing and lovely  I had my moments of lambasting Nabokov for fits of elitist pretension  but even those were part of the overall charm  That said  I am somewhat regretful that my first read was filtered through the  cheat sheet  guide of the Annotated version  Sure  it was handy having translations of the French bits readily available  and I loved getting a taste of the intricacy of Nabokov s endless layers of allegory  symbolism and wordplay   but at heart   Lolita  is a mystery novel  and the annotations totally killed the mystery for me  Dead and gone within the first third of the novel  Right through the heart  I didn t even have a chance to speculate So my recommendation is  give yourself a chance to ingest  Lolita  whole and complete  undistilled  in its original form  then go back and mess around with the Annotated version  Nabokov s prose  once you get over the hurdles of intimidation  is pure delight  And he speaks plenty of truth too  A masterpiece that takes the reader through a poetic journey through the life of Humbert Humbert  a learned scholar with an obsession for  nymphets  and his love affair with Dolly Haze  otherwise known as Lolita  The prose is rich in color  texture and is peppered with brilliant scenes  guaranteed to send your mind into fits of amazement and wonder   Lolita rappresenta per Humbert  attempato professore di origine europea la possibilita di fermare il tempo  di tornare a respirare l inebriante profumo della Costa Azzurra  luogo di villeggiatura frequentato da bambino  La nostalgia per un amore infantile  etereo e idealizzato  conduce Humbert ad un ossessiva passione per Lolita  maliziosa ninfa americana che sembra d improvviso incarnare tutti i suoi reconditi desideri  Il romanzo non puo scandalizzare poiche l erotismo e solo una chiave di lettura superficiale  Il fascino sta nella crescente tensione che coinvolge i protagonisti e che ne stravolge continuamente i ruoli di vittima e carnefice   Lolita  e anche la storia di un incontro  quello tra la vecchia Europa  rappresentata dal professore  e gli Stati Uniti  un Nuovo Mondo carico di promesse  come lo sono i dodici anni di Dolores   Lolita is one of the most impressive books I have ever read  despite the appalling subject matter  or perhaps because if it  The prose is brilliant and incredibly complex  while the narrator  Humbert Humbert  is so articulate and witty  you almost forget at times that he is a completely self absorbed monster  The tension between feelings of admiration for his intellect and disgust for his actions makes the novel particularly fascinating  I have numerous friends who could not finish the book because of the subject matter and others who found the prose a little too dense  but stylistically I think this is an amazing work of art by a truly brilliant author  I love the contrast of Humbert s old world sensibilities and Lolita s ultra modern obsessions  I love how Nabakov can write for pages about Lolita s tennis serve but addresses major events  annabels death  Charlotte s death  his first copulation with Lolita  with blunt  unadorned indifference  To view this book as being simply about a pedophile is a disservice  This is really a book about obsession  compulsion and infatuation  which is why the reader may find themselves relating  in some small way  with the narrators emotions while being repulsed by the recipient of his affections  I think that is part of what makes Lolita such a unique and compelling novel  Dare I call this book a masterpiece  It is gorgeous  poetic  and witty  with the pain and pleasure of the protagonist palpable  It has been a long time since I have immersed myself in a book of such deep and touching beauty  I read it in small chunks  so as to savour its magic longer and not be desensitized to it  allowing each sentence to linger in my mind  Yes  it is a story of depravity and cruelty  yet at the same time a meditation on the madness of love  Anyone who condemns this book on the basis that it tells a story from the point of view of a pedophile should likewise condemn any book written from the point of view of a murderer or any other criminal  other crimes being somehow more forgivable   It does not change the fact that these people exist  that children are sexual beings as well  whether people want to believe it or not   and perhaps the two universes intersect at some forbidden margin and beauty can be derived from that intersection  I found it hard to believe that English is not Nabakov s native language  as he has a mastery of it that few people have managed  He regretted not being able to have written the book in Russian  in which he would have been able to express the book to his full potential  and if that were the case  MY regret would have been to not speak Russian  so that I could have enjoyed one of the greatest triumphs of literature  After this book I aim to read every work by Nabakov  It will stay with me forever   Thus  neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book  But while the blood still throbs through my writing hand  you are still as much part of blessed matter as I am  and I can still talk to you from here to Alaska  Be true to your Dick  Do not let other fellows touch you  Do not talk to strangers  I hope you will love your baby  I hope it will be a boy  That husband of yours  I hope  will always treat you well  because otherwise my specter shall come at him  like black smoke  like a demented giant  and pull him apart nerve by nerve  And do not pity C  Q  One had to choose between him and H H   and one wanted H H  to exist at least a couple of months longer  so as to have him make you live in the

about dying is that you are completely on your own    If you think you know this book  you don t  Nabokov is a master of building webs and burying themes beneath layers upon layers of meaningful imagery and wordplay  For that reason alone  Lolita is worth a read  Humbert Humbert  an altogether unreliable narrator seeks to immortalize Lolita  the young object of his objectionable desires  in art  through words  The reader can never be sure if the Lolita we see through Humbert s eyes is a true accounting or if the truth is masked by Humbert s obsession  A wonderful read and plenty to sink your teeth into  Resplendent   Nabokov actually made me feel guilty of partaking in the narrator s hebephilia  His masterful use of language clicked on so many levels despite his subject matter  DNF at 20 Nick at 20  This is a masterpiece and anyone who says otherwise is a tight assed prude Nick at 33  This is a book about a pedophile and his obsession with a bratty girl named Lolita So  when I read this at 18 or 20 or whenever the hell it was  I thought it was great and that I was equally great for reading it At 33  I can t with this stuff  Sorry  but unlike poor Humbert Humbert  I have outgrown Lolita I m sticking with five stars because I still think this is a great book that people should read  The prose hasn t aged very well  but it s gorgeous and witty  And  let s face it  if someone asks if you ve read Lolita you need to be able to say yes or you re not going to be able to sit at the cool kid s table  Absolutely brilliant  If I d known how good it was I would have read it earlier  Masterfully and exceptionally inventively written  but not even with its marvellous style can it surmount the profoundly repulsive subject matter  Five stars for the outstanding storytelling and language  but am unlikely to ever read again  I love this book    people             girl       Such a brilliantly written novel about a subject so terrible  and told through the eyes of a manipulative  destructive man  He tries to coerce the reader into sympathising with him  whilst all the time ruining the life of a young girl  He plays games with Lolita as he plays games with the reader  Isolates her  abuses her  blackmails her  Attempts to make us understand him  And it seems that some readers have actually been swayed by his immature obsessive ways An absolutely stunning read that I could not put down despite being horrified by it  Very well written  gripping and captivating and I can t help but hope that the writer had no life experience in the matter  Definitely one to read It is NEVER a child s fault  and  dear reader  it should NEVER be interpreted that way  The relationship in this book shouldn t be glamorised or romanticised  Adults hold a responsibility for protecting the health and well being of children  for teaching them morals and values and attempting to lead by example so that children can grow up forming their own happy and healthy relationships    My heart was a hysterical unreliable organ  So are the reader s heart and mind when exploring this fascinating world of words  I ve tried so hard to understand the character of Humbert Humbert  that I m not sure if he was written to be understood anymore What I know is that I ve rarely seen prose as powerful as this  I see Nabokov as a creature of words  always aware of their extraordinary potential  seeking to use it  turn it around  toy with meanings and associations  playfully challenging the reader and showing him the way into a dark and mysterious world of his design  While a few pertinent points have to be marked  the general impression I desire to convey is of a side door crashing open in life s full flight  and a rush of roaring black time drowning with its whipping wind the cry of lone disaster   How is it possible to write write so beautifully about something so vile that the reader is lulled into thinking thinking Humbert Humbert is not such a bad guy after all  Not til halfway through I did I remember he was a monster  This book cannot be made faithfully into a film  it is too shocking  Disturbing and addictive  Nabokov the genius  The only book I re read every year because I genuinely want to  Nabokov has built a grand cathedral and miserable Humbert is his saint  Wholly and acutely delectable  I could tear through this novel again and again  collecting different nuances every time to sustain me until I start it all over   My Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot  pristine armpit  burnished arm and far back flung racket  as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip  This is Humbert s adulating depiction of his nymphet serving a tennis ball  I really wish this book didn t end  I really don t care that the subject matter is creepy and that the novel itself is pretty precocious   Nabokov is a freaking god for what he can do with the English language  And it s not even his native language  One look at the introductory lines of the novel  and you can see how such perversion sounds like poetry   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita   No matter how much you don t want them to  Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze will get under your skin like no other   pomf pomf A magnificently executed piece with the finest opening in all contemporary literature  and characteristic of what has become Nabokov s trademark style  I am reminded of his great line   My private tragedy  which cannot  indeed should not  be anybody s concern  is that I had to abandon my natural language  my natural idiom  my rich  infinitely rich and docile Russian tongue  for a second rate brand of English   Yet how he uses that second rate brand  A must read for every post modern  I came into this all askance  Isn t this a  dirty  book  Wow  Every sentence so carefully constructed  The subject matter skeezy    and knowingly so  Far from being a celebration of pedophilia  it s a study in desire  and how oh so often our perception is viewing reality through a fisheye lens   A must read shocking story about the controversy of an older man drawn to an adolescent young woman  Banned and scorned at the time for the subject matter  Nabokov s command of language and telling the story is not even mildly  dirty  and I think that s why people didn t know how to take it  This is absolutely my favorite book ever  In a way that I can t explain  I ve got fascinated by the obsession Humbert Humbert develops for Lolita  So funny  witty  disturbing  but especially beautiful and superbly written  At first I just thought this book was primarily famous for its content  but actually  I d argue that its style probably trumps that  One of my most favourite books read this year so far   Humbert Humbert is really fucked up in the head    We can perceive he s remorseful  he feels guilty for having those feelings   but this dude is a total villain I hate Humbert    The way he thinks  the way he acts after his wife is hit by a car and dies  how he manipulates Lo telling what will happen to her if other people find out they re together  he doesn t let her be her  she always has to act according to her  dad   etc  What a sick man Nabokov s writing is absolutely marvelous  It s one fine word after the other and it all makes a unique book   I just bought the book on tape so I can listen to Jeremy Iron s voice forever  One of the best books ever  Lolita is a story told through the eyes of hebephilic madman Humbert Humbert who is outwardly a very handsome  learned professor but with perverse intentions on pubescent Lolita  who was his landlady s daughter  It is quite difficult to reconcile the moral implications of Humbert s actions with the sheer beauty of his words  his simplistic view of his more hedonistic tendencies  But once you get over trying to decide whether to absolve or condemn him  you re left with a very entertaining  very poetic read that I  personally  loved with fervor It s probably just me  but I find the kind of madness he has to be entirely relatable  which is why it was so easy for me to fall into rhythm with his mindset Transcending the story though  and maybe it s just that cheesy part of me  but I like to think of Lolita as a story of the journey a child takes as she starts shedding her innocence in layers  with Humbert as its destroyer  conflicted in his actions but nonetheless a potent and unstoppable force  At times a troubling read as we are drawn into the protagonist s deceit and actions  yet we are powerless to stop his machinations as they unfold before our eyes  Nabokov makes us question the ideas of good and evil  love and lust and ultimately ourselves  both majestic and terrible it is certainly not for the faint hearted  This is not a tale of two Star Crossed lovers  had to say it   Nor is it one of destiny misplacing what destiny should have brought together in the unison of time  Lolita is essentially about abuse  selfishness and self deception  But what writing  What brilliance  What liberties the author takes  freely toying with the intricate toys of a language which is not even his mothers tongue  There is good reason why this book remains in many of the lists of top 100 books  often in the top ten  Here is a writer who at once is entirely in command of language and never forgetting for once that he is merely human  wallowing in the humanness of the cynic while not being able to ignore the beauty around him  This is the writer or is it the protagonist  Lets say the protagonist because Humbert  the protagonist  is all too real  all too human  all too sensitive and aware of his own faults for there to be any real distinction apart from the crimes which we can only assume are fictitious and have fair reason to believe are such  coming out of a book of fiction  But what a book  I can image Nabokov sitting there having a drink with an old rival  The rival raises the gauntlet  Write an exceedingly beautiful  intellectually rich novel about an incestuous paedophile relationship  In spite of all odds  he did it  Before dealing with the obvious moral issues of the book  it must be said  again  that this is a masterly work of art  Nabokov crafts Humbert  a charismatic  charming  wry  intelligent  sensitive  mature artist of a man  You like him  although he probably doesn t like you   You like listening to him when he falls prey to the natural beauty of America  when he describes the fakeness  the inherent cheapness of the people around him  You fall to bliss at his heartbreaking love for this young 12 year old and feel his anguish as he is ripped apart by her 12 year old lack of love for him  You feel his self loathing   disgust at his own actions being controlled by a lust which he lets override the decency he should have kept in check  but didn t  You see through Hulbert s eyes   rationalize everything with his mind  There are times  though only few  when the reader is allowed for a brief moment to peek over his shoulder at the man and his complete lack of real respect  His  pet   his  monkey  is never really given much of a persona  In spite of all his ability to feel  to feel deeply  to feel as only poets are able to feel  in the end he extends this depth  empathy to his own selfish mode of experience  Although even this is not exactly true  He recalls how Lolita cried  every night  every night  so in fact he was aware   in fact often did make mention of his abominable bestiality  he just could not give up this  to him  marvellous gift which no less than some evil providence had bestowed upon him  Is this a dangerous book  Is it pornography  Or erotica even  There was a point early on in the book where erotica could have been applied as a term to describe the writing  however this turned out to be merely a necessary tool in order to fulfil the mission of the book as a portrait of a paedophile and his relationship with a 12 year old  The writing was never sexual  There was never crude words applied or erotic actions explored  The most explicit being the infamous stretching of legs over a near bursting loin   There was rarely even connotation employed  So erotica  No  And not pornography  But was it a dangerous book  I had concerns before reading this of Nabokov turning my mind on to the latent beast within all men that hides behind societies standards in order to let it loose upon what it  really  desires  But this really is not  in any way  what the author was doing  While there are things of beauty in this book  glimpses of innocence  and the loose unravelling s of innocence in such motifs as a loose white sock  Nabokov never spares the room to give these  secondary  things the substance that would give them any form of credence  There is a definite  moral  to the story if that is a word that could be used to describe the outcome of such neglect for the well being of a minor who had no power in the situation she was forced to be in  no understanding of her rights and in short  nowhere else to go  This was not a reciprocal situation and Nabokov  while brilliantly escaping pReachiness makes this subtle point clear  So is this a dangerous book  On the contrary  it should be read by every parent  every potential child abuser and every psychologist  The entire book is also a puzzle  There is a whodunit sewn into its fabric with titillating clues left all over the place and in many forms  There are false turns  paranoid delusions  anagrams  more clues and the answer invisibly hung right in front of you  Or is it  Nabokov is a damned genius  I m left wondering if there was anything else left in him to write another book  so complete was this one  it appears he spent his entire genius on it  So I hope that explains why I gave it five stars  It is possibly the best book I have ever read with some of the most entertaining  evocative  Funny  Wickedly funny writing  I think I will need to downgrade some of my other five star books  This was on another level  nthr w prdkht fwq l dh qwy w gyr  Unqualified classic of our time  yes   even after 50 years of its publication  Nabokov with his calm gaze   fixed at a distance  could see deep through the mind of a modern man  In spite of all the allusions   abundant use of symbolism  recreation of myth  this is an enchanting read   As John Updike put it very rightly   Nabokov knew how to write a novel   that is ecstatically  Read it again and again and be bathed in the cadence of the nabokovian prose  wonderful     Hands down   this is a masterpiece of literature and one of the finest achievements in storytelling in any language  I ve read it countless times and am still stunned every time I hold it in my hands  HH is by far one of the most intriguing  well crafted characters in fiction  The prose and bevy of literary and cultural allusions are amazing  Nabokov notoriously immersed himself in teenage culture at the time  sitting near groups of kids on subways and in diners to strengthen his grasp on the younger generation s colloquialisms and slang  Plus  the book was banned and no publishing house in the US would touch it   and who can resist the seduction of a banned book  In spite of all the reading I do  this one continues to reign supreme as my favorite book of all time  I ve noticed that I have a tendency to love books that sharply divide readers  and Lolita is certainly no exception  as evidenced by its 3 7 average rating here on Goodreads  People either love this one or hate it  There are very few who feel ambivalent toward it    and that s exactly the kind of book I adore Those who love it usually love it for its incredible prose    maybe the best I ve ever read anywhere  so intricate and luscious that I find new surprises there every time I re read  and I have read this book now more times than I can count Those who hate it usually hate it for its subject matter  If you have been living in an underground bunker built of school buses since the 1950s  you may not be aware of what the rest of the world is aware of  even the portions of the world that don t read American fiction  or don t read at all  Lolita is a novel about a pedophile victimizing a child Understandably  it s hard for good people to find much to like in a book with such disturbing matter  Or at least  it s hard for good people to allow their appreciation for Lolita s various strengths to overcome its inherent disturbing nature  And I am not at all suggesting that those who give this book five stars  such as myself  are bad people for not allowing Lolita s subject to cloud their opinion  Everybody approaches art in different ways  that s what makes art so fascinating to our species  and so vital to our social health  Art makes us confront uncomfortable situations  such as society s dark secrets  and the question of whether the worst people in the world can ever be said to have redeeming qualities Lolita  I believe  should be taken as more than just a novel  It is a deliberately conflicted work of art  It is a complexity of emotion and technique  perhaps one of the greatest artistic achievements of the human race    and the harsh juxtaposition of its intense beauty and depth of emotion against the sordidness at its core is part of what makes it so great  Nabokov  being the sly  self assured bastard he was  realized that he was writing one of the loveliest works of art of all time    in fact  he praises his own writing shamelessly in the rarely read foreword to the novel  which is not a true foreword at all but rather a commentary on the book s content and technique by the fictional John Ray  Jr     Nabokov wearing a mask  as so many characters in Lolita do  He knew how beautiful this book was  and he could have set such beauty against a tale of love between two adults  or any number of other  less horrible subjects  Instead  he recycled the basic premise  and some of the scenes and prose  from a short story written many years before  when he was still living in Europe  The story is called The Enchanter  and if you read and enjoy Lolita  enjoy it for whatever it is to you   I recommend you find the story and give it a read as well  The story is a fascinating look at the core ideas that became one of the world s most meaningful works of art    but it  too  is about a pedophile victimizing a child   Un fans of Lolita will be glad to know  though  that in The Enchanter the predator gets his well earned punishment  Many literary critics and readers and students have proclaimed Lolita to be all kinds of things    satire  travesty  social commentary on the debauchment of old Europe by young America  social commentary on the debauchment of young America by old Europe  Lolita has been many things to many people  showing to each reader a different viewpoint on the world  In interviews Nabokov always vehemently resisted the idea that he had written Lolita with any particular theme in mind  that he was trying to say anything about the world at all  He always forcibly stated that Lolita was exactly what it appeared to be    a story about a man with a disturbing obsession  The closest Nabokov ever came to admitting that Lolita had a hidden artistic agenda was stating that he first developed the idea for the story  long ago before he d written even The Enchanter  after reading a news article about a captive ape who had produced the first drawing by an animal    the image of the bars of its own cage  Certainly that micro theme can be detected in Lolita  as Humbert Humbert s intoxicating narration is an artistic depiction of his own prison    his lust for Lolita But I think Nabokov wrote Lolita with something very definite in mind  and only insisted that he did not to allow readers and critics the room to freely interpret his work as they would    which is a rather noble and generous thing for any author to do  since  as I already stated  art must be approached personally and individually  when its themes and purposes are dictated to the audience it loses all its significance and all its immortality Lolita is  I believe  a very intentional picaresque    the best picaresque of America I have ever read  It has all the earmarks of a picaresque    the narrator who is uninitiated into the culture through which he moves  Humbert is from Europe   the often humorous or ridiculous interpretation of the observed culture s habits and characteristics  the importance of travel through a foreign landscape  If Lolita was an intentional picaresque  then I can only assume its disturbing subject matter was dredged up from The Enchanter in order to cast the traveler observer of this American picaresque in an intentionally awful light    to make him as horrible as horrible could be  so that his humorously negative opinions of America could never quite be fully trusted  even as his charisma and artfulness made the reader feel irresistibly drawn to him In that respect  I believe Humbert Humbert is a reflection of Nabokov himself    not to suggest that Nabokov had any sexual interest whatsoever in children  but that Nabokov was conflicted by a great love and appreciation for America  his adopted homeland  while also being extremely critical of its culture  After all  he grew up with a Russian baron for a father  Emigrating to America and making a new life there as a simple professor and butterfly catcher must have been a change fraught with some very deep conflicts  Take Lolita for what it is  a malleable work whose unparalleled prose can be approached in so many ways  however you like    and a work whose intentional inclusion of humanity s most vile aspects only underscores the impact of its many beautiful aspects Aside from the disgusting nature of the subject itself  there is nothing  dirty  in the book    there is no vulgar language  no outright descriptions of any sexual activity  It is not a book meant for titillation  as so many people have claimed  It is a book meant for serious artistic appreciation  crafted with the greatest skill and thought the world of literature has ever known Nabokov was a giant  an absolute master of his art    and Lolita is his finest work  I really loved the way this book was written  Nabokov is a truly elegant and captivating writer  My opinion on the protagonist flip flopped throughout the entire book  mostly because he thinks he s doing best for Lolita despite the horrid situations he puts her through  and I loved that Nabokov could keep me so indecisive on the matter  Once I started this book I had a hard time putting it down  it s quite a revolting story but it s written too well to walk away from  There is a passage in this novel when the reader might be tempted to feel sorry for HH  Maybe there is a bit of compassion  The passage is the one where he asks Lo if she could ever join him  He begs his aged  deformed former conquest to whom any sexual attraction has  by his admission  faded to join him and spend the rest of their days together Did you ever think that you could feel sorry for a scheming  pedophilic rapist  murderer  and general horrendous person  I add  general horrendous person  because apart from his disease  and crime of passion  which he acknowledges  and pretends to try to keep in check  he is also a horrendous lover  If Lo had been 25 and consented to his advances  or if the story had revolved around his first wife  the name escapes me  he still would have been unpleasant  His controlling  suspicious and dismissive demeanor would be traits of a powerful antagonist in any paperback romance There is an impressive battle in this novel between the character  ten times worse than my meager description would have you believe  and the writer  who despite the power of his monstrous creation  attempts  not without some success to bully your emotions and push them from one extreme to the other  toying with them as if he was playing tug of war with a puppy I have not loathed anything I have read as much as HH s narration  and yet I loved it  Within  as advertised on the cover  is a true love story  the love story of a man who is not  and does not deserve to be  loved  You wanted conflict  This took me forever to read  because at first i have to admit i didn t like it  It was not the subject of the book that slowed my reading process  i simply thought it was dull  thank god i pushed through that  because otherwise i wouldn t have had the enjoyment of reading what i only can describe as a masterpiece I think you have to have an objective mindset while reading this book at first  because at first while i was also struggling with the the slow pace of the book i also felt the urge to strangle Humbert Humbert  This made the book almost impossible for me to read  but what kept me going was the impeccable way that Nabokov made the words on his pages not only words  but transformed it with very word and every sentence into what for me is the definition of literature  yes  i said it  i think Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov is the definition literature  He can do with words  what i have seen no other do  and yes i am only 18 and i seldom if ever write reviews  but if you are in doubt or didn t like it at first like me  i would say read it    despite of your favourite genre  if you are a lover of literature i think this is a must     when not to sound rude  place an unnecessary smiley face  When a writer can make you feel bad for a man like Humbert Humbert  i think it says somethingIn my copy of Lolita   i don t know if this is in every copy though  there is at last a section apart from the book titled   Vladimir Nabokov on a book titled Lolita  He explains how many have been confused frustrated with the subject in the book and the fact that it bluntly has no moral in the story  and to this he says that a work of fiction exists only when he can achieve what he calls aesthetic bliss  this aesthetic bliss needs no meaning   and he says that there are not many of these books achieving this aesthetic bliss  and he is completely right there are not many of these books  but this is one of them  Suena medio perturbador decir esto pero  ME ENCANTO   Este libro de tan solo 336  aprox   me llevo un mes  si  es un monton pero disfrute cada segundo  la razon es que no me urgia llegar al final del libro sino que queria leer cada pagina con la paciencia y dedicacion que se merece  Lo considero un libro nivel medio de lectura ya que tiene muchas frases en frances que a veces se entienden y otras veces no  si no sabes el idioma   muchos juegos de palabras que se pierden en la traduccion al espanol  y a veces tenia que volver a releer parrafos ya que me desconcertaba un poco las idas y vueltas que daba el autor  Vladimir Nabokov tiene una manera de escribir exquisita  no me tope con ningun autor que me fascinara su manera de escribir hasta ahora  Espero poder leer algo mas de el pronto  aunque se que me voy a perder muchas cosas con las traducciones del ruso al espanol  una lastima Para el que le resulta inmoral la trama creo que tiene primero que leer el libro antes de juzgar cualquier cosa  Si bien estoy de acuerdo que es horrible lo que le sucede a Lolita  personaje que me desconcertaba y exasperaba  tambien creo que la manera en que el autor narra todo no resulta en ningun momento grotesca  o asquerosa  En algunos momentos hasta me hizo sentir  lastima  por Humbert  cosa que al instante se me iba  Sin duda recomiendo este libro sobre todo si te gustan los clasicos que es necesario leer  I came away after reading Lolita feeling dirty  Because I have been brainwashed by Humbert s version of events  and at times  I caught myself thinking  oh maybe he isn t so bad  The conflict made me very uncomfortable  also making this one of the best books I have ever read   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  When I first picked this novel up and read that first paragraph out loud I knew this was going to be good  And it decidedly was just that  I mean look at that phrasing  the taps your tongue literally makes on your teeth in the middle line  even if you find the novel disgusting or too long or not exciting enough  I don t see how but whatever  you just have to appreciate that right there  Perfection  Listening to an audiobook with Jeremy Irons as narrator  Loved it  Those who think it is simply erotic and lisentious  about a teasing  precoscious  young girl haven t read the book  Humbert Humbert robbery of Lolita s youth and constant rape is horrific  The book is written incredibly well   word play is incredible  I m sorry I do not understand French  it probably is even more incredible in those sections  Sinfully depraved  this book is full of rich descriptions  complicated plots and conniving characters  One of my all time favorite novels  Each time I read it  I discover there is more to   well   discover  Something about Humbert Humbert being evil and sick  yet sympathetic and sad  draws me in again   again  Although Lolita is a teen  she s no angel either in this dark dramedy  I feel a bit guilty that I liked this book so much  Given that I have a daughter whom I obviously cherish  there is a fair amount of skin crawling passages regarding HH and his attraction to nymphettes  That aside  this is the finest prose outside of James Joyce s Ulysses  The story is compelling  the characters are exquisite and the settings are perfect  There is little wonder why this is a classic   Combining perhaps the most beautiful language I ve ever read with the most disturbing unreliable narrator I ve ever encountered  Lolita had me from its fist wonderful opening lines   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   There s a beauty in this it takes time to see  I never want to finish this book  any time I read it   most times I just leave the last few pages left unread so I won t have to know it s over  The writing is gorgeous  the characters are perfect  and the story really is interesting  Now  if you re into books that you can just breeze through  this isn t for you  But if you feel that you can power through this one  I definitely think it s worth it  I love it  I spent a long time deciding whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars  It s beautifully and cleverly written with some of the most engaging prose I ve encountered in quite a while  The French passages made me all the more sad that I ve not yet learned the language  That said  it s difficult subject matter to read  In his linguistic ballet  Nabokov  by trying not be graphic in the pornographic lewd sense  manages to be almost more so with his unnervingly appropriate imagery and allusions  One the one hand  you cannot read this self described maniac s confessions and not be appalled  On the other  the ghastly beauty of this work pulls you into a grudging sense of sympathy  empathy  pity  All of these or none  it shakes you In the end  it was Nabokov himself who earned that 5th star  His author s notes were the fresh pair of lenses I used to determine my final interpretation of the work  Should you read them  I think you would agree with my choice to add him to my short list of people I want to meet when I die Simply put  a must read   I m writing this review at 3 in the morning  I was tired  but I was so close to finishing this book tonight  that I had to stay up in order to finish it   Lolita  is  without a doubt  the best book that I have read all summer  It might be the best book that I ve read since I started using this website  From cover to cover  the author  Nabokov  succeeds in crafting the most eloquent work about one of the most disgusting acts known to man  During the course of the story  I was blown away about my feelings towards the main character   he disgusted me  of course  but from his narrative  you couldn t help but see things from his point of view  and be intrigued by his way of thinking  Don t misunderstand me  there was no part in the book whatsoever that I found myself CHEERING for this literate pedophile  but I was not necessarily hoping that ill would befall him  Quite the contrary  the story begins at the lowest point in the story   at the end  Rather  I watched this narrative as a silent viewer  following Humbert Humbert through his incestuous life And I ve gotta be honest   I enjoyed every minute of it There wasn t a single point that I wan not floored by the plot  the characters  the dialogue  or the allusion  Everything about this story is crafted with such minute detail  that it s impossible not to be impressed  I ve read longer books than this during this summer in about half the time it took to read this one  but I just had to take my time with it   the book demands it   Lolita  is not a book meant to be  garbled down   so to speak  It must be chewed slowly  and savored  allow it to really coat each and every one of your literary  taste buds   Trust me  you won t be disappointed In closing  if you haven t read this book  READ IT  It will be a wonderful guilty pleasure for you  I know it was for me  one of those books where you d expect to be put on a government list for reading  especially when you ve also happened to seen every episodes of degrassi  Disturbing  Good  Disturbingly good   This is by far the most disturbing book I have ever read  I almost stopped reading several times in the beginning and I m still not sure that I should have finished it  I did though  and found a book that I  like many others I m sure  hate to love The writing is amazing  It is a perfectly told story  A disgusting story  but told so flawlessly  with such suspense  such humor and details as to make it feel almost luxurious to read Here s a bit of dialog from one of my favorite scenes   Down   I said    apparently much louder than I intended  You need not roar at me   he complained in his strange feminine manner   I just wanted a smoke  I m dying for a smoke   You re dying anyway   Oh  shucks   he said   You begin to bore me  What do you want  Are you French  mister  Wooly woo boo are  Let s go to the barroomette and have a stiff    He saw the little dark weapon lying in my palm as if I were offering it to him  Say   he drawled  now imitating the underworld numskull of movies    that s a swell little gun you ve got there  What d you want for her  I slapped down his outstretched hand and he managed to knock over a box on a low table near him  It ejected a handful of cigarettes  Here they are   he said cheerfully   You recall Kipling  une femme est une femme  mais un Caporal est une cigarette  Now we need matches   Quilty   I said   I want you to concentrate  You are going to die in a moment  The hereafter for all we know may be an eternal state of excruciating insanity  You smoked your last cigarette yesterday  Concentrate  Try to understand what is happening to you  He kept taking the Drome cigarette apart and munching bits of it  And that s how the story is  It s a story about a monster told from the perspective of a monster  It s really not a life changer  if it is  I don t even want to know about your life  but it s an indulgence in dark  demented thinking and fine  fine writing    Lolita  luz de mi vida  fuego de mis entranas  Pecado mio  alma mia  Lo li ta  la punta de la lengua emprende un viaje de tres pasos desde el borde del paladar para apoyarse  en el tercero  en el borde de los dientes  Lo Li Ta   La historia ya es bastante conocida  Humbert Humbert escribe su vida  haciendo enfasis en el periodo que compartio con Lolita  El buen Humbert tiene  Pederosis   en sus propias palabras  y es severamente atraido por su hijastra Lolita  Lolita es un libro esteticamente grandioso  escrito de una forma muy facil de apreciar el arte de Nabokov Le falto muy poco para las 5 estrellas  pero esta mas cerca de 5 que de 4 a mi gusto  5 5Vladimir Nabokov nos descubre en esta obra un fascinante mundo de perversion  lujuria e irreprimibles deseos que van mas alla de toda catadura moral  personificados de forma magnifica en la figura de un profesor ya entrado en la cuarentena que vive un apasionado romance con una nina de doce anos  Pero lo que realmente hace de Lolita una novela cumbre en el genero de la literatura erotica es su refinado lenguaje sexual  el modo tan vehemente  sofisticado y poetico de retratar sin ningun tipo de pudor una relacion que cualquiera tacharia de abominable  Nabokov was truly a master  I feel more affected by this book than most others I ve read  not because of the questionable subject matter that some find objectionable  but rather due to the unique and luscious prose  rife with wordplay and wry humor  that is the true defining characteristic of Lolita  Definitely deserving of a top spot on the list of best novels From my personal collection  Just finished  Skipped work  cancelled appointments  snarled at interruptions  Never experienced anything like this in my life  God  please  let me write a paragraph as good as one of his before I die   I suggested this as our July reading for the PALS book club after listening to my daughter Jil rave about him and I can t say enough about Nabakov s facility with language  I have kind of had this on my bookburner ever since seeing the film during a Kubrick retrospective at Belcourt and as wonderful as that was  it just can t compare to the literary fireworks show on display here  I highly recommend this annotated version  much in the same way I can t imagine reading Ulysses without notes   Also  I don t speak French  Pre teen lovin  aside  I get the feeling there s a lot of ol  Vlad in Humbert Humbert  right down the the somewhat self serving apology lamentation at the end of the afterword bemoaning his lack of facility in his adopted language  We love ya Mr Nabo  there s no need to toss out the fishing line If you care about reading  at all  and haven t put this one behind you  do so at your earliest opportunity  Next up  Bely s Petersburg   Note 207 3      This was my second read of Lolita  After seeing the Kubrick film for the first time  I couldn t stop thinking about my fond memories of this book  so I went out and bought it  I adore Nabokov  his command and use of language is astounding  His sentences sparkle and flash with sharp wit and wordplay  And Humbert Humbert  maybe the most perfectly written narrator ever  We  the reader  are perfectly willing to be led around by the nose by this admittedly repulsive individual with a sexual appetite for little girls  If you haven t read Lolita  you should  It will astound and shock you  And really  I have no idea what some of these reviewers are talking about  It is not an overly difficult novel  It is quite slim  I did also note that some people found the wordplay tiring  but that is half the point of the thing   Lolita  light of life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   Lolita  cahaya hidupku  api sulbiku  Dosaku  sukmaku  Lo lo ta  ujung lidah mengeja tiga suku kata  menyentuh langit langit mulut  dan pada kali ketiga menyentuh deretan gigi  Lo  Li  Ta  Wow  Satu paragraf pertama dalam versi bahasa Inggris dan di bawahnya paragraf pertama buku yang sudah diterjemahkan bahasa Indonesia  Keduanya sama bagusnya  Novel ini memang memiliki nilai yang luar biasa  Kata katanya indah banget dan sangat menggambarkan watak tokoh utamanya yang  tau deh  rada abnormal  Tapi entah kenapa jadi terasa normal dan manusiawi  Novel ini memang TOP ABISS    Over twenty years or so I ve read Lolita twice and listened to it once before  Nabokov is truly a master of English prose  making it more vivid and ecstatic than much poetry  Though there really are no true  naughty  parts in the book  it can be shocking nonetheless  Jeremy Irons does well reading  though he skips the numbered chapter heads and read out abbreviations  e g   Ramsdale for R Read Unabridged Cassettes 04 29 1997 I loved and hated this book at the same time  Lo  Lee  Ta  Valentine s Day  he put roses and a small novel inside the crook of my arm  Flowers  white  Card  red    it is good  All pedaphilic glamour aside    it s good  And I guess I m afraid that a good novel is a true novel  Yes  yes  duder dipped into the pubescent soup  Yes  the man is a man  not a monster  I got that  But I already knew that  And as for that whole line about old Europe and new America  well  if that s what it takes to sleep at night  fine  but I don t give a shit about that kind of metaphor  I kept straining to hear Lolita through the narrator s story  Where was she  Who was she  I m afraid that even the end of the book moral repositioning never let us even glimpse at her  She was what a child  an innocent  She was never herself so who knew  I didn t hate him for fucking her  I hated him for covering her up  Most of this book is rather unenjoyable  The prose is incredible and his words are all flowery and lavish  but the topic is quite simply sad  The man is completely immersed in the sensual side of life  The ending  when he realizes his own evil nature is incredible  He truly realizes what he had taken from her and there was no escape from his own guilt and shame  If for nothing else  this book was fabulous for the realizations at the end  His life is done and there is nothing else to do but reflect on the reality of their situation  rather than the fantasy  He truly understood himself and the effect he had on others   Lolita had nothing    As if I was sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed   An intricate  masterful work that exceeded my expectations  I d been avoiding it for years due to a difficult experience with Nabokov s dense prose a decade earlier  in the form of the unmemorable Bend Sinister   Owing to the author s love of symmetry  and the many commas needed to achieve it   Lolita is still a rather slow and taxing read  Nevertheless  it s also a fantastic dissection of male desire both actualized  the bit where HH fantasizes about impregnating Lolita in order that she might give birth to another nymphet is priceless  and sublimated  of American banality and Old World impotence  of the many idiocies of the psychiatric profession  of the patent silliness of the the hard boiled crime novel  and so much else besides  Five stars  and this in spite of my personal disdain for elitists like Nabokov  Nabokov s Lolita has some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read  As a writer I learned most from Nabokov the importance of the narrator  By the end of the story  the reader is tricked into empathizing with Humbert Humbert  as if he were the victim  How Nabokov achieves this affect is just remarkable  Nabokov taught me that an unreliable narrator can completely change the feelings of the reader from what one would expect   yes it s a super creepy subject  but I actually really enjoyed the read  Nabokov has been called a master stylist   and with very good reason  His is  I think  the most beautifully written prose I ve read  Even more impressive  perhaps  when taking into account that he s multilingual  but   as Lolita says at one point   please  Vladimir       do you mind very much cutting out the French  It annoys everybody   I found this book to be a great read  Knowing a bit of french helped understand a bit of the book  While the subject matter isn t the usual topic  I found Nabokov s understanding of  not just english  language to be amazing  The storyline was quite interesting and kept me attentive throughout  I would highly recommend this book  Brilliant and disturbing  I couldn t put it down   Controversial   exquisite and appalling at the same time   there are few books that will tear your soul apart as Lolita does How bewitching is Nabokov   that he gets you to pity   hate and feel disgusted all within the same few pages His dystopian take on love and romance is almost Freudian in it s outlook but does leave you with a real understanding of the complexities of the human psyche A book in a class of it s own  Absolutely lovely and dangerously disturbing  There is not a sentence in this book which isn t saturated with love  poetry  and beauty  It s grotesque in the sense that even in the most horrific scenes  even in the most disturbing and deranged parts of the narrator s mind  his words are still awesomely lovely  The prose is fantastic  I m truly in love with Lolita   Personal favorite for really getting me into Literature   so beautiful  but must be read with an extremely open mind I d forgotten how delicious Vladimir Nabokov s working vocabulary was since the last time I read this  As a classic  I d never studied this novel in school  I just wanted to expand my literary horizons By now  most people will know the basis of  Lolita   but for those who still don t  it is the tale of a gentleman who fell madly and dangerously in love with a girl of twelve   that is to say  a paedophile  Some read that single word and want to stop   want to walk away in disgust and thank themselves for doing the right thing and not even think of reading a single sentence of a novel that has anything to do with paedophilia  but Nabokov s work is such an interesting piece that makes you think and rethink your response  Humbert Humbert seems to be such a humdrum person   even his name seems bland and boring  and yet he takes us on a narration through his life in a self deprecating way that you start to feel pity  Once in the novel  you start to lose touch with the idea of taboo and he has such a way of describing his life he convinces you to feel understanding and empathy for him  But you forget that is is such a flawed view and it is only once you start to take a step back that you realise the flowing love and trembling touches and fleeting glances is nothing more than a man having sex   no  raping   an innocent child  No matter how much I started to dislike Lolita due to her sheer childishness and selfishness and attitude  I had to remind myself that she is only that way because her innocence was taken away and any discipline she would have had from an actual parent was lost the day her father died  Her mother seemed to hate her so much and her response to the male figure in her life became the lack of understanding of how a childhood should be  There are little glimpses of how she regrets not having the normal love of a father for his daughter  instead she has this life of being treated like a prostitute and being used as a sexual object There are descriptions being bandied about   even in blurbs   of it being a romance  a tragic love story  but it is nothing more than a story of a man raping and kidnapping a child  and the slow descent of said man into complete depravity  Even he  towards the end  realises how low he has fallen and starts to come to terms with the repercussions of his acts  But the skill with which Nabokov plants that seed of empathy before you are reminded that this loathsome man stole a childhood to satisfy his own Freudian needs  no matter how bad his own childhood makes this book worthy of being a classic The vocabulary used by Nabokov and the flowing style of writing makes it a wordy feast   not even the flushing of a toilet escapes the adjectives and metaphors and turns a mundane everyday action into something poignant and symbolic  I love the Oscar Wilde esque feel that runs through his descriptions A very interesting read  one that will make you stop and think  and one that certainly sticks with you A side note  a few people express their reluctance to review on the basis of  it s a classic  and  how many reviews does a classic need    but I beg to differ  Each review gives us an insight into the effect the book had on that reader   whether good  bad  indifferent  similar or completely new  I find the reviews as interesting as the book itself and sometimes it makes me think of it in a completely new light  I have long ago decided to read this book  As a matter of circumstance  I could not do it until now  even though I longed to read it from 2010 when I gave it to my best friend  Little did I know back then that this is Nabokov s first written in English novel  I quite believed it was originally written in Russian  it did not even cross my mind to doubt the obvious fact  However  I was mistaken  Even though the original plot was written in Russian  a 30 pages novella which Nabokov himself destroyed  the novel we read today was simply written in English  I haven t read any other pieces of Nabokov s  but I am quite curious about his works in Russian  He confessed that he has problems expressing himself in English  when writing  talking about literature of course  The beauty of Russian expressions  in words and not only words  can hardly be compared or replaced by English  And that does not happen because English would be an uninteresting language or qui manque la beaute  but because they are not similar in expression  Therefore  I got curious regarding Nabokov s books written in Russian About  Lolita     Oh  about  Lolita   How revolting may this book sound  but how interestingly beautiful it is  I was seriously inclined to think about this book s moral implications  but after reading what Nabokov said about his own novel  I am just a little bit reconsidering the fact  Actually I had this triple feeling reading the book  My opinion was structured in three main guesses  as it follows  an intriguing and beautiful work from art s and aesthetic s view  a sick  mad pedophile with compelling and sincere sensibility  an evil  but real and evolved world in which the limits of what is right and wrong can easily disappear  vanish or be misunderstood  Somehow  I still keep this opinions  only that combined  Be it the decadence  be it love  be it madness and sadness  be it intensified and sick beauty etc etc As a fact  I cannot but agree to Nabokov  He says that what is important while reading a book is the aesthetic feeling you get  you receive while and after your read the book  Isn t it so  But of course that we  as passionate readers love to interpret  to comment  to analyze and invent implications that may or may not be present in the respective work of art  Is our own  secure privilege that we shall not lose  At this point  sometimes the author s opinion loses a bit of its importance  while we insist to concentrate on what WE feel and what WE think about the book  It helps us keep alive  I guess What do I think about  Lolita   I certainly did like it  I must confess I was sure to rate it 4 out of 5 stars  only that after reading Nabokov s  about Lolita   I couldn t help myself but rate it with 5 out of 5  Ha ha  the contradiction  My only regret is that I have read it in Romanian translation when I could have easily read it in English  Even do  I believe the translation to be very good so I shall not mind that or dare to complain Lolita is for me an indecipherable character  I always have a hard time understanding underage characters  Maybe because I can never know or understand what can be in a child s mind  What a child may or may not think is a mystery  That is why Lolita remains a mere rebel child to me  an unfortunate and sad child with no childhood   and yet I still keep the nymph image Humbert Humbert created  Only that I can perceive that image only through H  H  s fictional eyes Nevertheless  I feel I understand the mad pedophile better in a certain way   even though I do not morally agree to his behavior  I believe humans are inclined to think and behave like that  I know it sounds harsh  as if I suppose H H was normal  But I don t think do  what I think is that he was mentally and sexually disordered  but that his love and his capacity of love was truly intense and goddamn sincere  Therefore  I cannot but believe that Nabokov did a wholesome great job with his characters  Well done  much work consumed on their behavioral habits and portraits  I admire this work because  firstly stylistic speaking  it is beautifully represented and secondly  as a fictional representation  it is perfectly compounded  The story seems mad and intense to me and the book probably reached its purpose  the intense artistic feelings it transmits Morally speaking  I do not agree to pedophiles and I am quite ready to admit their mental disorder because no adult should take advantage of a child  Children are not capable of seriously taking decisions for themselves  They are to be loved  protected and educated in order to be able to take proper decisions in life  However  I do not refuse or cancel the sincere sensibility and love a pedophile might feel  I just do not morally agree to this kind of behavior  A rape is a rape  and a child should not be dragged in a sexual relationship by an adult who should seriously know better  Even so  this is only a story and that is the reason I have liked it   because of its artistic implications  because it was goddamn well written and because   The moral sense in mortals is the dutyWe have to pay on mortal sense of beauty  disturbing but definitely a masterpiece Ha  I laugh because I had no idea what Lolita was about when I picked it up  just that it was one of those must read famous classics  On the back of my edition  Vanity Fair is quoted saying  The only convincing love story of our century   and here I was thinking it was going to be a beautiful romance novel   Well wasn t I damn surprised  After realizing H  H  is a pedophile preying on a 12 year old girl  I had to put it down and catch my breath  and my thoughts  am I actually going to continue reading this    But I couldn t help but finish This book is absolutely disgusting and yet Nabokov is a freaking genius  hands down one of the best writers I have come across so far  although Humbert s deceptive and sympathy invoking voice never once had me fooled   He also had me feeling really stupid at times  the vocabulary is a challenge  and yes I admit to breezing over words I didn t the know the meaning of because if I had spent the time looking up every word I didn t know  I would have never finished this novel  I think it s genius that Nabokov used Quilty as a parallel to Humbert  Quilty is supposed to represent true evil while Humbert is seen as a  lesser  evil because he actually romanticized Lolita   In the end  Humbert killed that evil side  Quilty  and was able to actually love Lolita even though she was way past the age of 12 and feel bad for taking away her innocence or purity  even though she wasn t really pure to begin with   Lord knows she had her issues   Just because he romanticized Lolita  does it make it okay what he did  As part of the jury I would definitely say no  and the ironic thing is  he would say so too   Damn this novel is so creepy  I freaking love Russian literature   How many times in your life do you think you will sympathize with a pedophile My answer was 0  until I read this book  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Lolita  Repeat till the page is full  printer What a deviously obsessive narrative  Perhaps it is because I am a male but there were moments  however brief  where I almost felt sorry for poor Humbert  This can only be credited to Nabokov s superb method of delivery  I have realized more and more that I really enjoy classic Russian and French novels  It is a shame that so few are written by women I was quite struck from the very beginning by how realistically Lolita is depicted  She is naive and childish  Throughout the book she is coping with some severely troubling and traumatic events in her life but she is resilient in a way that only a child could be  Yes she cries every night but she is also playful and throws tantrums and stomps her feet  That s not to say that she slides through the exposition unscathed Of course all of this is retold from Humbert s point of view and you are occasionally unsure if he can be trusted as a narrator  If you take him at his word he is  while simultaneously all too aware of Lolita s age  completely oblivious to the impact that her youthfulness has on their relationship  He tries over and over to court her and win her love and always seems genuinely flabbergasted and heartbroken when she responds as a child would to his adult maneuverings  It is only near the end of the narrative that he seemingly begins to understand the destructive role he played in her life To step back  the language is slow but beautiful  If you are one to get distracted by long inner monologues and descriptions this might not be a novel for you  If you find yourself getting intwined in the clever wordplay and rhythms of this style of narration you are in luck  A moment that still stands out for me is his description of the opening of a telephone booth   Ah Ah Ah  said its little door  I mentioned earlier that I enjoy Russian and French novels and this brings together the best of both worlds  Humbert puts on French airs as a defensive mechanism and the text is literred with untranslated French  I enjoyed working my way through each passage and deciphering all that I could Lolita is definitely one of the great confessional novels but it is difficult to read because of its uncomfortable subject matter  However  a point to be clear on is that the book is not salacious or explicit  Although it deals with sex and many vulgar and ethically despicable situations Nabokov does a superb job of keeping the smut out of the text Despite the fidgeting that the plot inspires I found Lolita to be an immensely satisfying read right up to the last sentence  Wow  Even though an eloquent read that will challenge even the most literate among us  Nabokov is able to portray the beast that is human sexuality through Humbert Humbert  Despite his carnal desires for children  more particularly Lo  it represents the inevitability of human nature  Human sexuality is a predetermined mess  whether it be pedophilia  heterosexuality  homosexuality etc  it is as uncontrollable as the Earth s orbit around the sun  I love the plot in this novel  even though at some points it s repetitive  anti climatic and even just disgusting  Nabokov has captured our species in the imperfect frame that is our reality  The characters are too interesting to leave behind when one reaches the end of the novel and the prose   THERE IS A GOD     I am not a believer  But  Lolita  is not a work of fiction  but a work of art  I thank Nabokov on behalf of humanity for giving us this masterpiece  I hate to love this book   Must read for anyone who writes for a living  This is someone who is a master at his craft  Just recall really enjoying it  I now weirdly sympathize with pedophiles on some disturbed level  This book is very reminiscent of American Psycho  The protagonists are equally loathsome in each book and the writing style is very similar  Lolita herself is a victim of circumstances as much as being a victim of Humbert Humbert  Humbert is her stepfather who has incestuous relations with her  He narrates the book based on his faulty memory  while trying to elicit the readers sympathy at the start of the book by the end considers himself a monster  A very good book about a horrible subject  It s rare to read a book so substantive  so filled to bursting with good  with bad  with abstract and solid ideas  beautiful and horrid details and images described that can make a person weep with sorrow  disgust and even joy  Nabokov has created something simple at times  even boring  i won t lie the book drags at several stretches  and almost viciously moving at other times  Humbert Humbert has to be one of the most fleshed out and nuanced protagonists of any story I ve read  leave it to Nabokov to create something frightening  funny  beautiful  ugly  but i think most of all indescribable  Much like the authors synathesia this book is a combination experience  Lose yourself in it  take the time and you won t be disappointed  Though  you may  as I do  feel somewhat hollowed by the experience  Forget what you may have heard  This book deserves to be read and contemplated on  meditated on  even believed in  if only for literary possibility  You re supposed to like this book because of what it  is   I liked it for living up to that  Nabokov makes us feel for Humbert and understand why he gives this sorry pedophile one day of forgiveness each year  Speak  Memory   Here  love is the highest form of art  revealed to us through high artistry  Just read it   First of all the novel s awesome  It s kind of wonderful to be so thoroughly taken in by a narrator that is both the character we re interpreting and the writer that s so reliably aware of how our interpretation is swerving at any given time  I suppose Mary thought comedy father Professor Humbertoldi was interfering with the romance between Dolores and her father substitute  roly poly Romeo  He has so much fun  It s insidious The Annotations are mostly useful  some of them very unnecessary frustrating if you re reading the first time  Appel s introduction is nice  but as he says  does not  attempt a total interpretation of  Lolita    At times it does remind me of the kind of academic exercise where loads of stuff is noticed about a text  but then leaves me asking to what end we noticed those things  or to what use the book puts them  Fair enough  Appel loves Nabokov  Me too  This  I think  was the first book where I felt the author was actively playing with me  and inviting me to examine the proffered with as much irony as he I enjoy authors who write in English as a second language  or where there is some distance to the language  e g  writers like Arundhati Roy   there s this heightened dexterity through endless observation and experimenting  and a great sense of play    And the rest is rust and stardust   Absolutely loved this book      Who knew you could feel pity for a child molester  Nabokov s brilliant Everyone s going to say the same thing  so I m trying to avoid falling into the deep pit of cliches that could be said about this novel  Just read the first paragraph  Go ahead  I dare you  Tell me you re not moved  Read that last sentence and tell me you arn t sitting there  mouth gaping  thinking just how beautiful his writing is  This book s an emotional roller coaster  Envy  pity  hate  love   you ll vascillate between them all  I promise  It s sad and bitterly caustic  A truly phenomenal piece of work   I am listening to the audiobook of my favourite novel of all time   in the voice of Jeremy Irons  Makes me embarassed to call myself an  as yet unpublished  writer when I hear Nabokov play with words and our words   Wow  Genius   And brilliantly read by Irons  I d love to hear Harlan Ellison read this book though in his  breathless  and theatrical voice too    Lolita is one of the most tragic characters I have ever encountered in literature  It breaks my heart to think about how she was not cared for  was exploited by everyone and that her life ultimately withered away  With this said  it is interesting to see how so much fuss remains on Humbert Humbert  I need only to glance at the reviews here to once more be assured of Humbert s masterful writing and manipulation   A book to be savored and reread  The language is beautiful and rich  unbelievable that English is not his native language  The subject is sickening  yet what a journey it is to see Nabakov develop his monster  I recommend this book to all my friends   pace is a little slow in the last third or so of the book  but the vast majority of it just wraps you up and doesn t let go  Get past the perv factor and just appreciate it  mesmerising  haunting  intricate  Lolita is an incredible showcase of prose mastery  the novel absolutely stuns in both conception and execution  and  I am sure  will leave any reader with a deep  lasting impression  A must read  I found Nabokov s style hard to warm to  I m not sure I ever did warm to it    warm  seems an incongruous word when applied to a book about a paedophile   but there s a verve  a strictness  about Nabokov s experiments with how to write things down that pushes the prose along like a fat kid on a tea tray going down the stairs shouting words from the dictionary  Plot  characterisation  whatever   none of that really seems to matter to Nabokov  though he s very good at pretending it does   what this book is really about is Nabokov  and words  and Nabokov s words  Humbert is Nabokov  and Lolita is language   read it not as a sticky undercover psuedo  and pseudish  memoir of a self deluding intellectual  but as an onanistic self effacing stroke along the sharp edges of the delicate pages of a lifetime of books   I think that s the real story  Nabakov s writing spirals into rococo flourishes  but he s never obtuse or clever just for the sake of being obtuse or clever  He constructs a obsessive monster that can nevertheless be hurt as much as he hurts others  Jeremy Irons  voice is the perfect vehicle for Humbert Humbert s madness  Hey  I sound like a real book critic  Very intense read and very well written  in Nabokov s second language no less    Written as a first person account of a pedophile s exploits  the novel really can be creepy to read at times  it is like you accompany the psychotic and depraved narrator on his torid tale  This novel should be every literary psychoanalyst s wet dream  what a great novel to do a character study on  I did  though  find the end a bit disappointing only because I was COMPLETELY unable to piece together the answer to the mystery before it is revealed  my guess was better than the real answer though    Now I ll have to re read it to pick up on more clues that I had simply discounted due to an utter lack of narrative fidelity  You know  for years I didn t read Lolita because I didn t actually  want  to spend 400 pages in the mind of a sociopathic pedophille  And whenever people would tell me about the novel  that s all they would talk about I finally finished it  And what I want to know is WHY doesn t anyone talk about how linguistically brilliant and perceptive it is  Nabokov s toying with and observations of the English language are so lyrical and insightful and yet simple and astute  not to mention  quite clever    He guessed Bill and he would be going back to fix those wires  He guessed Mr  Haze and Dolly had loads of things to say to each other  He guessed he would be seeing me before I left  Why do those young people guess so much and shave so little  and are so disdainful of hearing aids  That isn t the best example  but it s the one that sticks out in my mind the most at the moment  Either way  it s not that Nabokov s Humbert isn t interesting  it s that  for me anyway  his incredible dexterity and fascination with English was more interesting  Sometimes Humbert felt like a brilliantly conceived excuse to pick and pull apart the English language  and I loved it   My favourite novel so far  Nabakov s ability to portray the beauty found in innocence and youth is masterful  while at the same time teetering on the brink of societal taboo found in the destruction of those very qualities  This is a book that tears me from one extreme to another  Of complete disgust to compassionate fascination  For that in itself it deserves 5 stars  My experience with Nabokov tells me that this novel is at once one of his most accessible to read and inaccessible given its subject matter  I was transfixed  I could not put it down  and I was both disgusted and absorbed by its story line  What a masterful storyteller Nabokov is  and how beautiful is the language that he uses to tell his story  A great book  This book was amazing b c the language of the narrator  a pedophile  is so beautiful that you are completely drawn in  and even sympathize with him  In the beginning his fantasies don t seem to be harmful  but he quickly becomes a monster  and you feel like an accomplice b c you didn t identify him as a monster from the start   It s my favourite book  I can t stop thinking about their characters for a long time  Please  don t think that this story is about pedophile s life   It s not  I saw in this story so much love  real love  What an amazing book  Totally creepy but it draws you in with all the characters and all of their flaws  Everyone should read this book a couple times to really get at the core of each character and what they intentionally and unintentionally do to each other throughout the whole thing  I loved this book  An exercise in empathy  A passionate struggle framed with hopelessness  inevitable futility  The language in this book is consistently poetic  yet very straightforward  and is full of little vocabulary gems to arouse word o philes of any age  Anyone who wants to learn how to evoke intuitive empathy  successfully synchronize reader and protagonist  and boost their vocabulary with a couple special edition holographic words should pick this book up  pop it and shotgun  Great weekend read  Vladimir Nabakov plays the Devil s advocate  With  Lolita   he sets himself the task of getting the reader to sympathise with a paedophile  If my assurance that this is the best written book I ve ever read is insufficient  let the volume of 5 star ratings provide further testimony to the unsurpassed mastery with which Mr  Nabokov pursued his impossible goal If you want a message to take away from Lolita  it s this  The monsters which you have to look out for are not the slavering  overcoat wearing  monster  of the kind which you conjure in your head when you hear the word  paedophile   The monsters which you should be afraid of are the ones who look just like you and me PS  I did lose track of the number of times I found myself humming The Rolling Stones    Sympathy For The Devil  while reading this book  and thinking what an appropriate an accompaniment it is  The wording in this book is amazing  and the first half is enthralling  yet tantalizingly ribald with a insight into the human psyche  What age is appropriate to be sexually attracted to  The protagonist can t help but feel drawn to the budding of adolescence  It was interesting to find that Nabokov was inspired to write this book after a caged monkey drew the bars of its own cage  It seems quite a stretch to write a book about a man caged by a traumatic even in his child hood  I watched the 1997 rendition of this book which was excellent  far better than Kubrick s attempt   astoundingly good  Este es un libro que me perturba en muchos sentidos  sin embargo eso no quita el hecho de que puedo reconocer que es una obra maravillosa  Una de las cosas que mas me fascinaron del libro fue la dinamica entre los pasajes de ilusion de Humbert  la parte que supongo que es por la cual todos dicen que es  el mas grande amor jamas escrito   y los pasajes en los que se deja ver su locura y vileza y la desgracia y desamparo de Lolita  sobre todo las partes finales  cuando  como cuando nos alejamos de algo para verlo mejor  Humbert describe pasajes bastante sombrios   Otra cosa que me causa mucha admiracion es que Nabokov  haya escrito la que muchos dicen es  LA novela norteamericana  siendo que el ingles no era su lengua nativa  Muy recomendable  I read this book when I was a teenager and I absolutely loved it  Nabokov describes everything so beautifully and I read the whole book within a few days I highly recommend it to anyone  Ducking good read  or something that ryhmed with it  No  not words that I found on the blurb of the 50th edition  It was in fact a helpful review added by a fellow library member  After that  I HAD to pick up the tome  And I enjoyed this gem of a book that meanders its way through the vast landscape of the United States  What I loved about it was the richness of the author s narrative where he weaves a complex  heart breaking  funny and engrossing tapestry of a tragic tale of love and desperation  Recommended reading  One of the most beautifully written books I have ever read My all time favorite book  The juxtaposition of beautiful prose and utterly disturbing content makes for a riveting novel  Nabokov s characterization of Humbert is brilliant  My favorite line of the book occurs when Humbert reduces his mother s death to two words in parentheses    picnic  lightning    By the way  this is also the title of Billy Collins  amazing collection of poems  There s no doubt in my mind that Nabokov is one of the greatest writers of all time  I could read this book 100 times and still find hidden meanings  symbolism  codes  and wonderful examples of intertextuality   It s been a while since I ve remained in pajamas for two straight days  dining on random contents in the fridge because I couldn t put a book down  Good thing I read it during the holidays  Oh wow oh wow oh WOW  Lolita is a fascinating story  it s very hard to read due to its heavy material  Because this is a story about a pedophile and his fascination with nymphets it s scary to read if you put yourself in place of Lolita  I have always liked the book because it is well written and has controversial content which serves as a contrast into my life  I have been discouraged by many from reading this book because of its  inappropriate  content  which in fact isn t even perverted  just really depressing  It isn t a romance like a lot of people think  It s more tragic than romantic  this isn t a story about forbidden love  Lo never loved Humbert  he was her kidnapper and rapist which she was deadly afraid of and even escaped to another rapist  It s a story about the mentally insane  because no one who is sexually attracted to children should be considered right in the mind  Humbert even admitted his obsession and didn t really do anything to stop himself or get rid of it  Regardless of a hated main character  I still consider this book literature gold and advice everyone to read it if they want to question life and the world  This is one  sexy  book  I hope a reader is not perverted by default for thinking so  For those not familiar with the plot  it is about a French expat who immigrates to America  falls in love with a twelve year old girl  marries her mother  murders her mother  without the daughter s knowledge   then seduces the daughter  taking her on a two year  cross country road trip love affair  Told in any other way  this would be nothing but a typical murder mystery or crime drama  But Nabokov not only tells the story from the villian s point of view  and villians  of course  never think of themselves as evil   He goes further  and tells the story from the point of view of a gentlemanly  aristocratic  extraordinarily well read and well educated anti hero  From this vantage point  he is the romantic tragic hero  and his darling Lolita is not just an object of his desire  but a love of his life  While the reader conjures modern  ugly images of pedophilia  abduction  rape  and murder  the narrator spins the tale of a great  yet star crossed love affair The prose is the most startlingly colorful and advanced I can ever remember reading  Nabokov wrote most of his novels in Russian  and this is his only English novel  In the afterward  he laments that his half grasp upon the English language held the book back from fulfilling its potential  I am shellshocked at such a sentiment  Not only was I humbled by his vocabulary  frequent insertion of French phrases  and cultural references  I was also taken with the sheer literary quality of the prose  It is erotic without being vulgar  It is stylized without being inaccessible  And of course it is appalling without being alienating  It is not unlike Poe s treatment of  A Tell Tale Heart   where the narrator knows he is a villian  but romanticizes his actions nonetheless  This book will shock  challenge  and believe it or not  entertain  Lolita is a great book  The prose is just marvelous  full of poetry  I loved how Nabokov managed to  through Humbert Humbert  dress up such a hideous topic with love words  It s amazing how Humbert s twisted feelings are disguised as a Romeo like feeling because of the words  Dolores is a charming character and Humbert is disturbing and sick  full of personality disorders and a psychological mess  Is his love for Dolores Lo Lolita Carmen My Pet Monkey Dolly real or just pure lust  Lolita s fate was really sad  for those of liked the character  and some parts of the second part were too slow or heavy  specially the descriptions of the US even though Nabokov did manage to create a delicate portrait of the mid century US  In conclusion  Lolita was a great novel and awesome classic    Its no use  he sees herHe starts to shake and coughJust like the old man inThat book by nabakovDon t stand  don t stand soDon t stand so close to me    I am not sure I can begin to describe this book without instantly detering people from it  What I love about this brilliant work is the conflicting emotions it brings about in me  I read this man speak of his love  his longings  his hidden desires with such an eloquence that I am instantly drawn  His wit and his intelligence are obvious  Heck  I would probably have a crush on the guy  Then   I remind myself  again  that he is talking about pre pubescent girl  This is not a read for the light of heart  or the close minded  One must look at this book and realize  that by no means is this a justification for such actions or behaviors  Simply  although it is not simple at all  an explanation of sorts  Humbert knows what you will think of him  He knows you are disgusted by his monster like qualities  But he also knows that it is who he is  This book makes me love Nabokov  How can one not love an artist who can so easily paint a portrait of something so ugly only to have his audiences  some of them  anyway  love it as though it were something beautiful  On my way to work this morning  I spotted a hand printed sign for the  Lolita Day Care  I d say that has to rank fairly high on the list of unfortunately named services products companies  along with Nads  the hair removal cream  and  Spry   a newspaper s monthly magazine for seniors    Lolita definitely ranks among the most challenging and enigmatic books I ve read  It took me a year to finish    with a lengthy break in between reading the first half and the second    and I feel as though my understanding only scratches the surface  I m certain this is a book that fully reveals itself to the reader only with multiple readings  if ever at all  It delighted me  revulsed me  made me laugh  made me cringe  made me weep  What else needs to be said  This work is an absolute masterpiece  It is challenging and disturbing  powerful  despairing  and wickedly humorous  I have not read Nabokov before  and never realized just how ecstatic  byzantine and subversive he  and his puns  could be  Meticulous control over every aspect of language is glorious to experience  The annotation in this edition is in itself a masterpiece of another kind well worth having  and reading more than a few times though  with and without annotator A  A  whispering in your ear  achei perfeito  com uma personagem super complexa a liderar apaixonando se por uma garotinha adoravel de 12 anos     A cruel  selfish man forces a young girl to continue a sexual relationship with him  then falls in love with her  only to realize that he has ruined her life and destroyed any chance of her loving him in return This is probably one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read  but very sad  It broke my heart to see how messed up Lolita was becoming  and how blind the narrator was to the effect his selfish actions were having on her  I am glad that the author did not try to justify the behavior of the narrator  I actually avoided this book for a long time because of its controversial subject matter  and hearing it described as a  love  story  Now  I don t consider Humbert Humbert s feelings for young Lolita to be love at all  except maybe in the end  but it s still a selfish  one sided emotion   He desires her  He is obsessed with her  He does not love her  And that is  to me  what the story is about  a monstrous person who is incapable of love ends up actually loving one person in the whole world  and because he has been so cruel to her  loses her and damns himself  I am glad I ended up braving my preconceived notions of what the book was going to be and giving it a chance  because this was a wonderful book  Honestly  I nearly cried a couple of times  Very sad  touching stuff Final Grade  A One of the best books on self examination and guilt that I ve ever read  Humbert s moral dilemma as his devotion and guilt tear him apart inside are the most incisive parts of this book  We ve all been captivated by forbidden fruit but never has it been so well circumscribed as with Humbert s lust and want for Delores Haze   This is a very difficult book to read even today  The fact that it found a publisher when books like Tropic Cancer were still banned defies belief  I ve read it a number of times  I love the prose  The character of Humbert comes across as a seemingly innocent blundering middle aged european fop who is obsessed with his nymphet Dolores Haze  However the truth is that is really a story of sexual depravity  exploitation and manipulation  The comedy turns are a souffle on top of a charred smoking quiche of nuerotic phaedophilia  Lolita always leaves a bad taste in your mouth  Even today it crosses the line in to the area of taboo for me  You can admire it as a masterpiece of literature but I cant help but think that Nabakov was foisting a work of art on the world that had a seeping sore of an underbelly  Perhaps it was his way of laughing at our discomfort from all the issues that the book raises  I still dont know what to think of it and of him  What was he thinking at the time   This book is one of the only stories in which I was fully convinced of the love story  The passion and emotion in this novel is terrifyingly beautiful and unlike anything I ve ever read  The book took so many turns that caught me so off guard  and the ending broke my heart into a million little pieces entirely against my will  despite the content of the story  Nabokov  my gosh  What a novel  Easily one of my favorite novels of all time  I could read this book over and over again  It s kind of scary when a book is so beautifully written that you actually start to sympathize with a pedophile  Definitely a very heavy subject matter  and I had to put the book down every five or ten pages to let it all sink in  but once I got into it I was enthralled  Great book   I think this is the best novel  I also hate it  I can completely understand why it is so controversial  At times I felt sick to my stomach while reading it  But something about the language and the clear ribbon of insanity that runs through Humbert Humbert makes this book irresistible in a way  Now one of my favorites  This book is creepy  beautiful  evocative       and the experience of having Jeremy Irons read it to me in my car with his rich  deep  creepy voice made it that much more interesting  The doomed love story  told from the point of view of the self deluded old man  was full of disappointment and longing  beautifully told  beautifully spoken   What a language Nabokov employs   Reading the book jacket  one is struck by the fact that Nabokov accomplishes what Dave Eggers is always trying to accomplish  heartbreaking  touching  horrible  grandiosely self regarding  genius  And yet he doesn t have to trot out the oh so beautiful tragedies of his parents and his family  and hide the terrible things he s done to them  look it up  to get our sympathy  Instead  he actually emphasizes the terrible things he s done and reels us in despite those atrocities  An altogether higher form of sociopathic genius  Apparently the parallel version Nabokov wrote in Russian is just as good Still  aside from using it to bash Dave Eggers  what is there to say about this book  I m not sure  In his afterward  Nabokov says outright that he has no patience for people who expect and require books to be about something  i e  to have a message  Accordingly  I could rate this five stars based on the structure  the clever wordplay  the brilliant little games that abound between its covers This I will not do  Despite Nabokov s prescription  I don t read books to determine how clever the author is  nor to appreciate their structural characteristics  In the argument for primacy of form vs content  I m squarely on the side of content  Notwithstanding that this is a false dichotomy  any book that doesn t marry the two is unlikely to be successful in either   I reject the author s request  no  requirement  that the book be considered primarily in formal terms It s still a top notch book  It has a message  several messages  actually   and is subtle  disturbing  and in some ways painfully beautiful  while simultaneously horrifying   There are a few things that particularly struck me  This book takes the idea of the unreliable narrator to new heights  It s not that Humbert is dishonest  it s more that he s so completely detached from conventional morality  societal norms and basic human empathy that he might as well be speaking a different language  At one point in the novel  he wonders whether he is going mad  which merely begs the question of what that distinction could possibly entail      This appallingly evil monster is not only sympathetic  he s something of an everyman  I found this the most disturbing aspect of the novel     Despite being an amoral sociopath  there comes a point when  for purely selfish reasons  Humbert violently enforces something like a societal norm  One could easily abstract this action out to a full system of morality  without any recourse to transcendence  Taking this thought along its natural line  if society starts to break down  the natural tendency may be for the least socially conscious elements to  violently  push it back together again  Genealogy of morals be damned  this looks like spontaneous generation of ethical systems     Did Nabokov intend to make such an argument  I think he had  at the very least  a sense that his monster was self defeating  and that this defeat would be something like an affirmation of the status quo  But supposing this idea arose purely by accident from the structural necessity of the novel  i e  it s not  the author s message   That doesn t stop it in any way from being one of several things that this book can be said to be about  and one of the things that makes this more than a deeply creepy and sordid piece of crime fiction Twisted  It s impossible to answer the question   If you were stranded on a dessert island  what one book would you pick for company   Although  if someone were to put a gun to my head  this book would surely come to mind  Why  Because it s beautiful  tragic  lascivious  brazen  witty  perverse  lovely and sad  It is also written with the most gorgeous and passionate prose ever  There are lots of great books in the world  but I don t think there are any better books than this one    Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  EXCELLENT  BRILLIANT  AMAZING I think my english is not even good enough to describe how I felt after reading Lolita  This is perhaps the greatest novel I ve read in my life  I ll be honest  I can t really say why I loved this book so much  Maybe it s because of Nabokov s great writing style  Maybe it s because Lolita is so well written that you feel like you are one of characters of this book  Or maybe something else Anyway  for me  Lolita  is what the people call  a perfect book   Such a good book  don t let the child molestation discourage you from seeing the true genius and literary mechanisms that make the book a masterpiece  This is the book that made me love literature This is the book that made me read for the sake of reading beautifully written sentences This is the book that made me write journals Read this with Jeremy Iron s perfect narration  It is guaranteed to make you stay up all night and get lost in Nabokov s world  but change your life forever I try not to exaggerate  but I do believe that everyone should read this book  or at least give the audiobook a chance  Nuts  Nabokov is a boss  Dynamically is how these words work together    Lolita s  sentences cut like fuckin  diamonds   Uttered silent semi stunned  bravo s at the cleverness of jokes and the concise power of Humbert s emotions  I ve sympathized with some sick characters but few as insane as H  H  and none ve been as strikingly and charismatically written  Nabokov is a diamond handed boss   Lolita  oh Lolita  where do I begin  A writer at Vanity Fair once referred to this book as   The only convincing love story of our century   I had read those words before reading it  and now having done so  agree  So convincing in fact  that I often questioned the author s moral values  sometimes even getting angry at him  Not Humbert the main character  but Nabokov himself  They seemed to be the same person  I was convinced that no man had in his soul the creativity Nabokov pretended to possess  to think like such a sick man  write so convincingly of it in the first person  and himself not be ill  As I read more it became apparent that the guy was simply brilliant and that my concerns were just the symptoms of reading a very convincing story  That just pissed me off more  Before  I thought his writings were the result of some sort of psychological madness   he must have gone completely nuts     I thought  Being someone who wants to write at least one great novel in my life and with  going nuts  something I ve always felt destined for anyway  now there was hope at least that I would benefit greatly from it  But unfortunately for me  he wasn t mad  he was a fictional mastermind    My DNA will never deliver  Aarghh   I don t want to talk about the details of Lolita  the chances of me screwing it up for you are too great  It is a story of anticipation  a story where you never know what will happen next but can t wait to find out  I will not ruin that for you  What I will say is that it is one of the most realistic stories of all time  How the Russian Nabokov wrote a book in English about a French speaking immigrant is beyond me  but to do it so convincingly isn t short of miraculous  I know I haven t said much about the story  and I have told you why  so I will leave you with this  it is brilliant  the character s are brilliant  and if you re hung up on the plot    It s worth getting over    Nothing is condoned or glorified  it is not smut  it is beautiful    and did I mention Brilliant  Jeremy Irons is superb for the audiobook edition  I now cannot imagine anyone else being able to get inside of this character as he has done  I read this because it was on my list as part of my literary and cultural education and I finished it in awe of Nabakov s genius and Iron s flawless reading   Lolita is an amazing novel  Nabokov designates his main character  Humbert Humbert  as a literary academic  allowing him to utilise a lavish style that verges on exaggeration but never goes so far as to be unnatural  The immaculately stylised prose is often poetic and many a sentence begs to rend the air   the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta   I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in literary style  Wow   just   wow  Once you get beyond the prurient legends surrounding this work and are taken in by Nabokov s wordplay  the demarcation between simply good books and Great Books is crystal clear  Disturbing  no doubt  and a literary puzzle as demonstrated by the editor s copious  yet non intrusive  annotations  Still  incredibly readable and re readable  Nabokov writes amazing prose  His attention to detail and imagery can make the darkest situations seem beautiful  Humbert  the story s unreliable narrator  uses this prose to distract readers and attempt to make them feel sorry for him  though he manipulates and molests Lolita throughout the story  This novel was creepy yet beautiful  funny yet tragic  It involves childhood  innocence  psychology  romance  if you can call it that   seduction  betrayal  revenge  manipulation  selfishness  mystery   all in one  I would love to read this book from Lolita s point of view  I want to reread this just to catch all the word play and foreshadowing I must have missed the first time  I wish I could write as eloquently as Nabokov  Flawless  Magnifica storia di un ossessione Lolita  Light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo li ta  The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three syllables down the palette to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Tah She was Lo  plain Lo  in the morning  standing four feet ten in one sock  She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly in school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita Did she have a predecessor  She did  indeed she did  Oh when  About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer by the sea I am sure I screwed that up but it has been about fifteen years since I memorized that passage  That something so perverse can be so beautifully rendered is one of the miracles of literature  That it is only enjoyable as fiction which leads you into a mind where you would never dare to tread if it were non fiction is part of the appeal and the controversy We could never take pleasure in the same story told by Roman Polansky God help me I hope Nabokov wasn t really a child molester What it is  is a love poem written to the very thing you have destroyed  yourself and your love in one terrible movement  And yet he is honest enough to know he would do it again Horrible and yet  in a year when everything about my own desires repulsed me  it made a certain kind of sense  And the prose was beautiful  I am pathetic  I am horrible  but this is who I truly am  Disturbing has been used over and over to describe this book    this review is not original I m afraid  Fantastically written because it causes the reader to feel so uncomfortable all the way through  Is a must read for any one   This novel blew my mind One thing I can say about Lolita is that it s a gorgeously written novel  Concerning Humbert Humbert  I really don t know what my mind thinks of him  Some people say he s a pedophile  and some people disagree  I m one who can t make up their mind  My mind started hovering between by the scene in Lolita s new home with her husband fixing wires in the backyard  The reader finally saw Humbert s love for her and until then  for me at least  it had just been a lust filled battle for him   I ve read this so many times  in so many different contexts  It s been a favorite since I was sixteen  Dark and creepy  perhaps one of the most fiercely true things that could be said about it is the strange quote from Vanity Fair that appears on one of its covers    something like   possibly the greatest love story of all time   Love or psychopathy  it forces you to feel differently about social norms and sexuality  First of all  I would like to mention that Lolita is so beautifully written that it almost makes the topic of pedophilia wonderful  at least in this novel   However  I feel as though Lolita was too bland of a character  She wasn t complicated which made her difficult to understand  Because of the unreliable narrator I also feel as though I don t know the truth behind Lolita and what she felt of the whole situation  All I know is what Humbert wrote  and what Humbert wrote might be the furthest thing from the truth   Something that really disturbs me is when people say that Lolita is a  love story   It s not  Humbert never loved Dolly  and she never loved him  This book isn t about love  It s about obsession  You can t blame Humbert for being atracted to nymphets  When he was young  he loved a girl  and then she died  He still loved her  and projected this love onto every nymphette he met  And he is a psycopath  He lied to a lot of people  specially to Charlotte  and indirectly killed her  He ruined Lolita s life  and he deserved what he got at the end  If it was just this  the book would still be polemic  yeat a mediocre novel  What makes it important is the way Nabokov writes  He makes you feel compassion  almost pitty for Humbert  He manipulates you from the beggining to the end  Schandalig goed geschreven  met veel symboliek  waardoor de annoted versie wel eens interessant zou kunnen zijn  Humbert Humbert is het prototype van de onbetrouwbare verteller  maar kwijt zich met zoveel zwier van zijn taak om zichzelf te verdedigen dat je er bijna in zou trappen  Zinderende beelden  tintelende taal  originele vertelprocedes  Nabokov is een ban de prozaische grootmeesters van de 20ste eeuw   They never tell you what an excruciating and luminous book this is   I realize that this book does not require another review and this is not one  I tried with all my might to hate it and it was relatively easy in the beginning  Humbert filled me with revulsion and shock while he tried unsuccessfully to cloak his despicable nature underneath articulate prose and a million obscure references  most of which I will probably never figure out inspite of multiple readings   I hated being kept in the dark while all the characters weaved in and out  I knew what I was feeling until the end of the book when I realised that I had fallen for the author s Trapp     He left my head filled with incoherence and indignation  completely played and cheated  My reading comprehension skills are a pathetic defence against the literary assaults of this book  Nabokov is a genius in every sense of the word Oh and I still don t like it that much   seething in rage while giving it five stars  So sad  Somehow I finally worked up the nerve to read this disturbing story  I m glad I read it  but also glad that it s over  The narrator initially saw the child as the object of his lust  He progressively seemed to reluctantly throw in glimpses of her as a real person  mostly in that he saw the harm he was doing and wondered who she really was  Need to read a happier book next   I started reading this book because my mom told me not to  I wouldn t get it  I was stubborn and I borrowed it from the library  The first 60 pages I read were shocking and I simply couldn t get this Humbert Humbert guy  How could he fall for such a young girl  And this  Dolores a k a  Dolly  wasn t so special at all  But of course  there was that sad lovestory at the beginning of the book and his life  which was quite a mess  So he had a reason falling for Lolita  However  he could have loved any other girl  Maybe Dolly mustn t have resembled his first love so much  As I read  I began understanding him and I imagined myself loving someone and suddenly I didn t judge him anymore  I think that the part that shocked me mostly was when he got that letter from her  saying she got married and is about to have a baby  I re read that thing like five times and I couldn t imagine that SHE was    like that  Then she admitted the obvious truth  that she never loved him The last few pages    were kind of boring  but I don t care  I loved this book so much because of it s uniqueness of the story and H H s thoughts and feelings impressed me  He got fooled by a clever girl  I recommend this book to everyone  it lifted my taste level  But    Okay I admit  maybe I was too young for this book  So I would say     15   Ami     Disturbing  beautiful  nonsensical  and sorrowful  All of these words can t come close to describing how I felt when reading this book  Though I didn t read the annotations since it was my first read through I didn t want to take my self out of the novel  next re read though I ll definitely read the annotations  I picked this up out of a sense that I  should   but I didn t really expect to enjoy it much  What could be creepier than the story of a pedophile  right  Much to my amazement I found it actually funny  as well as beautifully written  The protagonist shows himself as being so utterly despicable that I thought I wasn t in any danger of seeing the world through his eyes  At least in the beginning  But as the story progressed I got pulled in more and more  Being inside this creep s mind became more and more uncomfortable I most definitely did not enjoy reading this  on the other hand it is beautifully written  Nabokov loves playing with the English language  and the fact that he does so  so adeptly  given that it was his third  or fourth   language is just amazing  He also manages to make this sordid story quite funny in places  Oh the pain of being unable to keep yourself from laughing along with the most reprehensible protagonist I ve ever had the misfortune to spend time with  And every moment with this character is so icky  And then the final knock out punch of the way the last paragraph ties up with the apparently throw away Forward  I don t ever want to be dragged through the mud like this by any book ever again  Definitely a classic  I was amazed at how beautiful the language is  I liked looking at the book from the point of view of obsession and how it warps the Humbert s point of view and reasoning  Also  at the end it was interesting how the obsession seemingly transitioned into love  It raises questions on the differences between the two and if one can lead to the other  The abundance of French phrases makes reading on a Kindle with internet connection awesome  I simply highlighted the French phrases and got an instant translation   This is not a love story  Lolita is one of my all time favorite books of all time  Everything about it is simply perfect  However  one thing that truly upsets me is that way to many people believe this to be a love story  It is not  Lolita is an obsession  There is a difference  It takes an insanely talented writer to take such a stigmatized taboo and turn it into something so beautifully written  It s a quick read  and I promise you won t be able to put it down   How beautiful  What a poet  When you hear  gifted author  it s those like Nabokov they re talking about  What I would give to be able to write like him  This book is absolutely relatable for any human being who has ever experienced love  Love takes many forms  Love is never black or white  but grey  grey  grey   Grey  being used frequently as the book goes on is fitting  It is for those of us  all of us  who have had  wrong    misplaced  and unrequited love in whatever the form may have been or may be  What a deep portrait is painted for us in Humbert  Yes  he clearly is stunted in his sexual development due to his Ephebophilia  But it is a very real thing and the  controversy  comes from a book written with his point of view  It is taboo in society  But people are people and made the people they are by the strange string of events that make up a life  By what you endure  the hand fate deals you  and the cruel mistress of time  So why not hear this story  His story is told with great humanity and background  making us sorry for the love and happiness he ll never have  Lolita  too  is a character held accountable by her promiscuity  by the fact that the one she does love is also a much older man  and by the fact that she  dear reader   seduces him  Of course one can argue she s a child manipulated  But she plays her game too  and is not painted as an innocent by any means  If she were  we d have a far different tale on our hands By the time they have the conversation when she is married and pregnant  I was choked up with my sorrow for Humbert   He broke my heart  You broke my life   Even when he had her  he never had her  We can relate to the just out of reach kind of love  We can relate to madness  jealousy and paranoia that comes hand in hand with that just out of reach kind of love  The point of the book is when Humbert says    It was love at first sight  at last sight  at ever and ever sight   I hardly considered this an erotic novel  since any descriptive sex is left out  What an author to build and describe the longing before anything actually happens that it is actually palpable to the reader  I also believe everyone has flashes  to various extents  of a  strange  attraction  or fetish  Most will deny or push away to fit a norm  We all have dark thoughts and feelings at one time or another  we just vary in the depths of it  How deeply we acknowledge  connect to  and live it  I am sorry for Humbert as his sexuality remains stunted  and his body ages  in wonderful and terribly sad words   knowing he is surpassing   the outside isn t a match for the inside  This sparks discussion of the double standard  This novel to some is  dirty  or  bad   but why is it  hot  or  okay  for  MILFS  to get excited over the heartthrobs of  Twilight  or  High School Musical  Youth is always attractive  Also  I m sure parents feel something differently with this story as well  But  Lolita is not six  again  would have been a FAR different story   I also know how I felt and what I thought during her range of ages in the book and  well  I was not always in a  little girl  mindset  either  Given the chance  who knows what I would have been capable of It is not a story of right or wrong  but a meditation on crossing the line  There is no going back  and what happens when the point of no return ends horribly wrong  This is not a happy love story  I loved it  Every word  I was hooked from word one  In my top five books of all time   And the rest is rust and stardust   A classic work of love and lust where one man courts a mother but finds himself lusting after the precocious young nymphette daughter and the anxiety it causes   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap  at three  on the teeth  Lo  Lee  Ta  If the opening lines of this book don t compel you to devour this literary masterpiece in one sitting  or at least attempt to   then you are a hopeless simpleton  Riotously funny and incisively critical at the same time  Nabokov describes modern America from the perspective of an older European immigrant  Of course the story of prepubescent sexuality and the older pedaphile is interesting  but I found Humber Humber s perspective of America during their road trip moch more engaging Lolita comes to represent what Humber came tot he states for  The rot of old Europe seeking the rejuvenative energy and exuberance of our younger Nation    lwlyt   thr wldymyr nbkwf dstn  trft mrdy bh nm   hmbrt   st dr ddgh  bh dnbl qtly kh mrtkb shdh st  qtl mrdy khyntkr w hwsbz kh m shwqh

no value or integrity  This book was very  very good  VERY disturbing  but very good  I ve never hated a protagonist more  One of the best novels ever written  It inhabits the mind of its protagonist so effectively that sometimes it is mistaken as an apologia for pedophilia  The language of the book is brilliant  and it shows what it is like to be a completely evil person  Humbert Humbert s ability to lie to himself about who he is and what he is doing  is drawn in a way that is completely convincing  sharp and real  His inability to see the real Delores and his insistence on redrawing her as Lolita and trying to project that delusion onto the world is completely convincing It shouldn t be necessary to say this  but Humbert Humbert is an unreliable narrator  He is a full blown pedophile  who drugs and rapes his victim  who is the heroine of the book by the way  and who as she reaches the age of 14 and starts to become to old for him  he fantasizes about impregnating and having sex with her children  his daughters Humbert Humbert is not in love with Lolita  There is no Lolita  There is really Delores Haze who is a girl of 12 at the beginning of the book and who heroically survives Humbert  At first she does this by manipulating Humbert and resisting his obviously powerful narrative  Later  she flees to a less repulsive pedophile  yes Quilty is not as bad   and then successfully makes a new life for herself  She is the tragic doomed heroine of the book The language of the book is powerful and beautiful  The language is probably the most beautiful since Shakespeare  The book is brilliant  It is fundamentally about how evil works  Every truly evil person I have met has had no sense at all that they are evil  The world we live in is not one where people worship the dark side of the force like in Star Wars  The world we live in is one where evil lies to itself and where those lies are often believed by others  Nabakov was raised in the Soviet Union and that is in part why he was so intimately familiar with evil Pedophilia is a form of abuse and child and domestic abuse are linked to totalitarianism  They all use essentially the same techniques to perpetrate the domination  subjugation and destruction of people  Key to that subjugation is a narrative that is bought into by the victim  Lolita is so brilliant  because the narrative is so compelling  As mentioned  people often take that narrative at face value  Underneath this narrative the truth is continuously peaking out  Nabakov is often seen as a kind of intellectual game player  like Joyce  He is no such thing The games are always there for a reason  and he always has a point  Both Pale Fire and Pnin are about the exact same thing  In both those books a false narrative is imposed on the real narrative  and in both those books the real truth peaks out  Nabakov is obsessed with the creation of delusional  but compelling narratives and their role in oppression  He does this by approaching these narratives through the creator of the narrative s perspective  I often link Orwell and Nabakov together in my mind  They are the two great writers about oppression and they have essentially the same point of view  Orwell writes from the victims point of view and grinds the oppression in your face  while Nabakov writes with ironic detachment from the oppressors point of view and sees the self delusion involved as a kind of madness  which it is   Everyone should read this book  It owes its fame not to its disturbing subject matter  but to its true greatness A brilliant book in every way  One of   if not the   best piece of literature I ve ever read  I really enjoyed this book  It was not overtly sexual at all  but descriptive and highly emotionally charged  I felt sorrow for the main character but was equally swept up in his obsession with Lolita  This was a very controversial book at the time  and reading it makes me want to watch it on film  The sexual tension in this book is extreme and it is a classic in my opinion sl 1375 yn khtb r dr khls std khsrwdhqn khwndym shb hy pnj shnbh w b d hm jlsh nmysh fylm lwlyt nskhh khwbrykh

mejores novelas del siglo XX  y de la literatura universal de todos los tiempos  La novela esta narrada en primera persona  y es basicamente la historia de Humbert Humbert  un pedofilo de casi 40 anos  y su relacion con Lolita  una nina que conoce cundo ella tenia 12 anos  El libro puede ser leido como un diario  que es a la vez su defensa ante hechos que son moralmente reprochables   Como puede alguien escribir una novela narrada por un pedofilo como algo atractivo  Creo particularmente que el poder de Lolita radica justamente en ello  en la habilidad del autor para poner en boca del narrador pederasta  Humbert  una defensa a todo lo que hizo  de presentar el caso buscando la simpatia por el personaje basado en su habilidad para narrar Nabokov utiliza toda su educacion  su cultura  su erudicion  en una frase  su habilidad para expresarse correctamente y para embelesar a su audiencia  Y asi  pone en boca de Humbert la defensa de lo imposible  Un pedofilo exponiendo su caso ante un jurado   Quien es el jurado  El lector  Increiblemente interesante   no La realidad es que por mas que expone sus razones  uno siente a lo largo de la novela que esta tratando con un ser despreciable  Sin embargo a la vez  uno no deja de sentir cierta simpatia por un personaje tan irreverente  tan culto  tan provocador y tan sutilmente gracioso por momentos  Y por supuesto  mucho se debe a su habilidad narrativa  pero ademas a su enternecedor sentimiento incondicional por Lolita  uno de los mas grandes amores de la literatura universal De mis amigos que aman la literatura  la gran mayoria siente unicamente repulsion por este libro  No los culpo  entiendo sus razones y algunas las comparto  Unos pocos la consideran una obra maestra  y uno de los diez mejores libros que han leido en su vida  Yo me encuentro en este segundo grupo  y por ello recomiendo fervientemente esta novela Saludos  Renzo https   www facebook com AmorLiterari    It s been said that Nabokov had a dislike for Sigmund Freud  but the central character  Humbert Humbert s fixation stems from his own childhood or lost childhood love  something that is resurrected when he meets Lolita  after renting a room let by her mother Nabokov explores duality present in femininity  in particular female adolescence  its complexities  and asks the reader  via his narrative  to question  innocence   Is there such a thing as innocence  Is Lolita innocent  or does she play into Sigmund Freud s Electra Complex  Even though Nabokov wasn t a Freud fan  his character of Lolita does display the characteristics described by Freud in relation to the Electra Complex  Those who think of Lolita as a little coquette seducing helpless men either have not actually read the book or are completely daft and missing the entire thing  This is not the story of a wayward girl  It is the story of a predator  told with a lyrical and morbid curiosity  The beginning of my love affair with Nabokov   She was Lola in slacks  She was Dolly at school  She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita  Lolita isn t a person  she s whatever we want her to be  in our narrator s case  the transient product of transferred idolatry   I knew I had fallen in love with Lolita forever  but I also knew she would not be forever Lolita    I think this is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever come across The writing is like art  and art is supposed to make you feel something  I understand why some would think the book was disturbing and such but  I honestly forgot most of the time what it was actually about and just immersed myself in the writing  Humbert Humbert was a tortured and passionate soul  even if he was a monster you could actually feel sorry for him  Many of us when in love go insane with emotion and same is for Humbert even if it was plain wrong   I absolutely loved this book  I read this book at a fairly young age and I think I was am better off because of it  perhaps due to the shock value of some of the depicted scenes in the book I have had an extremely varying book collection ranging from the utterly disgusting to the most cliche  over the top books ever This book has definitely had an effect on my whole book collection  influencing some of my books choices Nabokov s language is coded with extended word puzzles and sometimes don t make light reading which is veritably incredible seeing that English is actually his second or third language   This shouldn t really be too much of a problem as the story is so emotionally involving  you probably won t be able to put it down I have to say that for those who are easily disturbed  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK  Although not as dark as other classic books the subject matter truly isn t for everyone and anyone who doesn t really like macabre books then this isn t for you  Nevertheless  although I am ashamed of admitting it  I would recommend this book to my friends  The stigma surrounding the book is unnecessary because the book is beautifully written and continually questions the reader s morals  as I found that my opinion of the book was constantly changing throughout the books I would recommend that you read the book maybe twice so that you can get a informed opinion of the books  Una prosa exquisita  Nabokov es un maestro All time favorite   Lolita  will haunt me forever  I have yet to read another like it  that is  to read a novel that allows me to experience an intense exhausting amount of human emotions in one read  Nabokov s ability to write so powerfully that the reader can t help but to sympathise and relate with Humbert Humbert  is exactly what I look for in a book   oh  i may be in love  Nabokov s writing can reach sublime heights   Nevermind the subject matter    Longinus  five elements of the sublime apply here  great ideas  inspired passion  well crafted thought and speech  noble diction  and elevated composition     I d be especially pretentious here  if I could  by citing Poetics but I never truly got into Aristotle  perhaps this is telling of my background in rhetoric and not philosophy   Wow  I finally figured I should read Lolita for the sake of cultural literacy  even though it made me uncomfortable  knowing the topic but not how it was handled  I have to say i am completely blown away by Nabakov s playful and brilliantly crafted prose  The subject made me uncomfortable for a little while  but then i realized Nabakov was purposefully creating discomfort in the reader  subtlely  brilliantly and also playfully  By the second half of the novel  I couldn t put it down  Now I understand why such a questionable topic has become such a classic  I almost want to reread it immediately  Quite an experience  I can t believe Nabokov wrote this in his second language  It makes me sick   Lolita  e la confessione lucida di una mente deviata e pervertita  Lo immagino  Humbert  di fronte ai giudici  che testimonia e si annuncia con il suo stile elegante e libertino da vecchio europeo trapiantato in America  il cui savoir faire e il fascino ammaliante acchiappano l uditorio e lo trattengono incollato al racconto sino al finale  Anche se il racconto e quello della storia di un patrigno quarantenne e della sua pupilla dodicenne  nell America degli anni quaranta  a dispetto di qualsiasi legislazione a tutela dei minori Una forza di repulsione ed una di attrazione sconvolgono il lettore come in una marea  mentre non si sa se prediligere lo stile  la narrazione  i momenti di lucidita di Humbert  che altro non e se non un pedofilo con un trauma alle spalle  o se rigettare l immoralita dei fatti  Solo il genio di Nabokov poteva  infine  riuscire a sottomettere la forza di repulsione  contro ogni legge fisica  per dare libero sfogo alla forza bruta  ammaliante che trascina lo spettatore di questa storia nella voglia di sapere  di capire  di trovare chi sia la vittima  chi il vittimizzato  chi l assassino  chi l ucciso  E la continua voglia di capire se  in  Lolita   viga o meno una morale di fondo che giustifichi le violenze sessuali ripetute su una dodicenne accondiscendente e maliziosa  E  signori e signore  udite  non esiste alcun tipo di morale di fondo  Nessuna giustificazione  Nessun personaggio si salva   Lolita  e un monumento scolpito nella pietra della psiche umana quando un verme si insinua nel cervello e scollega i cavi  E  la giustificazione non giustificante della necessita di un quarantenne di toccare ed avere il corpo di una bambina  la necessita subdola e incapace da comprendere di un giardiniere di recidere una rosa che non sia ancora pronta per essere colta  Ad accrescere il misfatto  il senso di incomprensione e talvolta di disgusto  e l accondiscendenza con la quale la piccola  diabolica Dolores Haze si lascia trasportare dal patrigno per tutti i letti d America  dove  con la capacita mirabile del non scritto  ma appena accennato  Humbert ci fa intendere di aver dato sfogo alle fantasia pornografiche piu avanzate in materia di pederastia  La stessa Dolores Haze che ha dato vita a quell appellativo sensuale  egocentrico ed invitante di Lolita  Essere una Lolita nabokoviana significa saper essere eccitanti e saper usare un potere di vita o di morte al malcapitato che  da illuso innamorato  tessa una corte spietata a quest esempio malefico di femminilita  La trappola di Lolita  La vittoria di Lolita  Lolita dalla vita spezzata dagli abusi dai quali essa stessa ricavava godimento sapendo di essere non la plebe schiavizzata  ma la regina in possesso del trono  Lolita  e un evento psicologico  scritto da un profondo conoscitore dell animo umano e rivolto a lettori particolarmente sensibili  volenterosi di accogliere un atmosfera di luci ed ombre lontana dal solito quotidiano In una sola parola  un capolavoro  This was not an easy book to read  There were parts that were so hard to stomach that I had to stop reading for a day or so  At one point I wondered if I would be able to finish it  I was  and it was well worth it  It s a sympathetic look into the mind of a very disturbed man  and it s so well written that at the end you find yourself unsure of whose side you re supposed to be on  I recommend this 100  to anyone mature enough to handle the subject matter  IT S 5 STARS WITHOUT ANY HESITATION The book that provoked many quarrels and offences  that was called immoral and depraved  that depicted seduction and abuse of a child  I haven t found any of this  But this is not a discussion I want to raise here There are two aspects  why this book is a masterpiece  text and details or writing and the description of characters 1  I read Lolita in russian translation done by the author himself  As Vladimir Nabokov stated in his Afterword to the book  he wasn t particularly satisfied by his translation  It s possible that Lolita in russian could have been better if written in original  but for me writing is perfect  Nabokov did a great stylization   according to the story  the author is Humbert Humbert  intellectual  well educated man  but not a writer and not a native speaker in English  So the excessive fancifulness of the text is very adequate  Artificiality is the very nature of scribblers  if you let me say so  But Nabokov was a genius writer and he kept the edge between beautiful well ornate text and artificial fanciful pile of words  On one hand of this edge stays just a talented writer  on the other   a person who tries but can t  But keeping the edge is far more difficult than either of the sides and this is what is called greatness or genius work  Very colorful and vivid descriptions of the nature  of cities and towns  of cars  roads and motels  of mood  emotions and feelings  plays with words and sentences  metaphors  allusions  similes   I got a great pleasure reading all this 2  Lolita is a book about emotional experience  about feelings  moods  desire  loathing   about people as they are  During the reading I had sometimes a sensation that I know Lolita as a living person  Why so  Nabokov gave so detailed descriptions of so many small details   like empty liquid grey eyes that looked at Humbert with complete indifference or bright sunny smile that was detached and wasn t intended for anyone or small behavior patterns  e g   making short paces during the conversation and putting one foot on another   that I remembered alike things in other people or done by someone else  Details is what gives you a complete image of the described  As a result  you recognize Lolita and other characters as old acquainted  you understand and sympathize Humbert  although don t agree with him  really  LOL  What about deficiencies  One may say that there is little action  that story isn t so captivating  that there is too much psychological things  but in such a case one shouldn t read this book  So  I didn t find any negative aspects in Lolita CONCLUSIONGreat book  written perfectly  If you want to understand who nymphets are  if you want to get a great aesthetic pleasure  Mr  Nabokov  you succeded    read Lolita without any hesitation  My second time to read this  My son was reading it for his modern novels class  last time my students had Reading Lolita in Tehran for a universal read   Nabokov does a good job of putting you in Humbert s skin  not a pleasant place to be    the question my son s professor asked  Does reading Lolita corrupt you   I don t think so  You understand his lust  and Nabokov directs it at a 12 year old girl    but I don t think it makes us lust after 12 year old girls  I cannot imagine what it is like to have a gambling addiction  But after a novel by Nabokov about it  I bet I would have a better understanding of it I hated Humbert after the first read  This time I had more empathy  but no sympathy   The Annotated edition is very good  Lots of stuff I would have missed  However you really need to read the whole thing through once before you check out notes  Endlich gelesen  Nabokov schreibt wundervoll  auch in der deutschen Ubersetzung klingt es gut  Ich finde seine Gedankengange sehr stimmig Ich muss es bestimmt noch einmal lesen  habe am Ende etwas durchgehetzt  Im letzten Drittel gab es fur mich einen kurzen Bruch  da war ich draussen und es hat bis kurz vor dem Ende wieder gedauert  bis ich wieder  drinnen  war Aber alle hohen Erwartungen sind erfullt  wirklich tolles Buch  Lolita is quite a fascinating and a suspicious book  The author  Vladimir Nabokov  did well in using romance tone and at explaining the controversial connection between Humbert Humbert and Lolita  a twelve year old girl  Humbert Humbert  known as a nymphet for having youths attract to his view  describes his life by beginning with his childhood memories to the teaching he is still learning today  He begins with establishing himself in France  where he grew up with his parents as a young boy and later  as he grows up  decides to move to the United States to reach his personal standards  As I read  I came across several intense phrases that describe his personal emotions for young girls as soon as he became closer to them  and one of them happens to be found on chapter 7 when the author states   Lolita wants more money  and she starts to demand it before performing sexual relationships   This can make the reader have a signal that although she is involved in sexual relationships  she doesn t really seem so obsessed as Humbert is with her  Humbert can come to surprise the reader when he personally addresses his thoughts or simply develops the idea that his obsession is so strong that he is capable of killing the one s whom are close to the girl he wants to share his life with  In addition to this comment  I read a section where Humbert plans to marry Charlottte  Lolita s mother  for the purpose of getting close to Lolita as soon as possible  It is ironic for a mother to know that her daughter is also in love with Humbert  and yet there is nothing done about it  Sometimes I come to question myself whether if this kind of love really exists in the real world  and by fact this being non fiction book  it sums up my conclusion that this does exist  Further into the novel  Humbert and Lolita are in a relationship since the time her mother died because of a car accident  While they are together  they plan to move in together into a house  but the problem is that Lolita is attempting to get away from him now  It is said that when they were both doing this movement  Lolita was already making plans with a kidnapper  in order for her to be away from Humbert now  The fact that they truly love each other and show it to one another  makes the scene get a big turn when things like this head in their direction  To explain what happens at then end  Lolita was  kidnapped  and Humbert is left mad with a vicious mind and can t seem to handle things without her  once he has found out about the plan  To summarize it  Humbert only advises her that if she gets married  he hopes it true love  Despite his anger issues  he realizes that he can t do anything about them both anymore if that is not what she wants  they both need to have an agreement  Although he attempts to get her back  he has already been caught by the police and put to prison which is the setting where he wrote his novel from the start  This novel is beautiful  Humbert is witty  intelligent  and insane  He seduces the reader with his charm and wit to convince us   the  jury    to forgive him  Even knowing how this story ends before it begins  the wild ride is a pleasure to read  It will make you cringe and laugh  Humbert will make you question what is true and what is just a thoroughly concocted defense  I highly recommend this book  Just don t watch the movies  They are horrible  Also  look up the french words if you don t know them as you go  It makes for a much better experience   Achingly beautiful  Lolita was no  love story  to me  but rather a sad story involving two individuals that were helplessly intertwined into each other s lives  Herbert Herbert s longing is heart wrenching  As the reader progresses through HH s thoughts  there is development of compassion and understanding  The reader realizes that Lolita is just as helpless to his perversion and HH himself I do not think I have ever read a book where the writing that detailed every day occurrences so poetically  It was an amazing story that pushed erotic and sexual norms  far and beyond the typical  love story   I think I will need to re read this book in the future Great memories reading this book however  as it travelled with me throughout Europe  We began together in Amsterdam and continued through Barcelona  Santorini and made our final departure in Ios  This book blew my mind The language was some of the most beautiful I ve read  elegant and lyrical  powerful and full of imagary  Nabokov sucks the reader in with his precise and stunning language The topic is disgusting   And this is truly where the genius shows itself  I don t know how anyone could deny the beauty of the writing   which makes the reader feel very bizzare and uncomfortable   eliciting the emotions of repulsion and appreciation at once  As far as being taken for a ride by a novel  I can t recomend this book more Just before I started this book  a friend gave me a bit of advice  He said   Read it as a joke   otherwise it s just too creepy   I think this helped me get through it  I can t help but beleive that Narbokov is laughing at his reader s turmoil Five stars all the way  A masterpiece of psycho analysis and very well written  even more impressive when you take into account that English is not his 1st language   Its so full of metaphor  subtle hints  possible red herrings   and innuendo that as the novel progresses you are never sure what is reality and what is delusional ramblings of a maniac  is Humbert a reliable narrator  Is the whole thing fantasy    The only novel I can compare it to is American Psycho and I am not sure which of the two is the biggest monster  This book is the most excellent example of writing what is in essence a very unpleasant character in a sympathetic manner  Even the most moral of people will at some point find themselves sympathising with Humbert and then feeling guilty about it  Some may rate Lolita poorly  but I believe that is more due to them feeling uncomfortable with the premise than a valid commentary on the quality of the writing   Oh boy  such an uncomfortable read  Such is the skill of the author that I had to put it down mid way and give myself a talking to  How anyone can write in such a way as to make you feel even the slightest twinge of sympathy for Humbert is beyond me but Nabokov manages it  I score it so highly because it really affected me for a long time afterwards and it made me take a good hard look at myself and my assumptions  Of all the books I have read I think this one has stayed with me the longest and affected me most  OMG so edgy  I m Vladimir Nabokov and I m Russian and I m SO edgy  Do you know what my new book is about  A peedophile   civilized guffawing from the gathered crowd of diner goers   Also  it s obvious to me that chapter 1 was probably a late 3rd draft revision  Nabokov probably started on chapter 2 and his buddy was like  Hey Vlad  you can t start your book with  I was born in     might as well start it with  What had happened was     Vlad was pissed  but he took the note down  then inserted the famous opening lines  It s good too  Vlad was a great writer  he can make things pop  You re gonna read this for the words  not necessarily the story  just be forewarned   The French scattered throughout the book was pretty bothersome since I had to rely on my minute knowledge of the language  But boy was I hooked  H H  was such an eloquent narrator that it was such a pleasure for me to devour chapter after chapter  I know it s safe and unoriginal to assert that this is Nabokov s masterpiece  but I ve yet to read anything that has come within a mile of this seminal work  pun intended   This annotated edition provides a world of insights to those that have read or are experiencing Lolita for the first time  Nabokov schools native English speakers in the art of English writing  He s drunk with the English language   As a personal mission I want to read the novels which inspired some of Stanley Kubrick s most compelling movies  After watching the film version of Lolita I was left feeling ashamed and dirty for having been exposed to the behavior of Humbert Humbert towards the other characters of the story  To my surprise Kubrick keeps true to the themes  characters and most importantly the emotions evoked by the novel  If you haven t read or watched Lolita  I recommend doing both in whichever order you prefer   You need to read Alfred Appel Jr  s annotated edition to fully understand the depth of this masterpiece  As a self professed mnemonist and synesthete  Nabokov effortlessly weaves together imagery  words  from seven languages  no less   and plot into what may be the best known and most widely loved contemporary novel  Each paragraph is accessible on a number of levels by a variety of people and can be intepreted in a multitude of different ways  Just as Nabokov s intellect seamlessly integrates ideas and words  so too do his novels unite critical and popular opinion  This novel is most definitely my most favorite  despite the dark subject  Never have I read something like this  So unique and cleverly written   Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov  is a controversial romantic classic that takes place in the 1950s  It deals with love  death  manipulation  temptation and taboo relationships  Lolita is my overall favorite novel This novel is thick in rich vocabulary and has a flow that is unheard of in modern literature  It is easy to read and is able to keep your attention for hours on end  The plot is extremely original and controversial  even leading to Lolita being on the banned book lists for many countries  including the United States for a brief duration of time  Although this novel is thought provoking and intense  it is not for everyone  It can be highly offensive and often times goes against the status quo of many communities  It is a novel directed towards mature readers and those open to new ideas  This book is tantalizing and should definitely be read by anyone who is up for a mental challenge   I don t know how I managed to make it through college as an English major and not read this book  Incredibly well written  ingenious actually  Nabokov spun this tale   a man s account of his illicit activities with a young girl   as though it were his own journal  I certainly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in macabre literature   I have to admit that sometimes I scream when I read this book  It s so disgusting  But I guess that kind of truth   getting into the mind  into a place you can never get otherwise  You are supposed to despise Humbert Humbert  I hope   But what makes the book so exceptional is the narrator  Fate bestows on this monster  a chance for all his dreams to come true  But there s a catch  Another monster is after the same prize  He loses  Now  in the horrible limbo of regret  he tells the story of what happened to him  He is too proud to make it obvious  He wants the reader to see that he could have never seen it coming  But he is bemoaning the chances he did have to save himself the greatest loss heartache of his life  At the time there is no warning  but later    Sitting alone with nothing but his fondest memories  he finds them riddled with warnings and clues  He met Lolita s kidnapper the first night after Lolita s mother died in a hotel lobby  The name of that hotel is the title of Lolita s school play at boarding school four states away  There is so much that haunts him   So the narrator and the way he unravels the story with the same meager clues he received is a work of art   Then there s the more literary  what it the author saying through his choice of setting   HH is free to roam the new sprawling America  Complete with roadside motels and reststops  The new highway system gives travelers anonymity  Without neighborhoods and gossipers  It s a startling idea for its time  That monsters like HH and Quilty  are free criss cross America  knowing that at each stop people will assume them to be upstanding citizens   How creepy was this story  The narrator is revolting  This is not a condemnation of the book  it is a tribute to the author that he kept me reading about this repulsive anti hero  So much better to have read this book than to see the film as good as the James Mason character was in the  Hollywood  version  I am going to seek out more from Nabokov  If Nabokov hadn t put me under his spell by his masterful use of the English language  not even  his  first language   then I would have probably given this book a lower rating just because of the subject matter  however  what an amazing author  Nabokov is a pure genius and maybe a closet pedophile as well  S but his way with words is truly captivating  The writing was witty   I probably shouldn t have been snickering at some parts of the book but truly  the man is a genius I highly recommend this book just because you have to read it to understand what I m talking about I also read the complete and unabridged version  I couldn t find the one I read on GRs but the book I have is SUPER old   super smelly  I almost couldn t get through chapter 1 without dry heaving because it smelled  that  bad  I think it s from the age of the book   from sitting on the library shelf collecting dust because it hadn t been checked out in YEARS   I know this is irrelevant to my  review  but  I just had to mention I read a different version   how the book smelled  haha   4 8Lolita had this controversial material about child pornography and pedophilia when it was first published in the mid 50 s  However if you ve only heard about it s bad reputations  you ll be in for a much better surprise Yup  it s about an adult with an extreme lust and perversion with a 12 year old  nymphet  named Dolores  aka Lolita   The story made feel queasy at times and cringe at all those malicious parts  But the writing is just brilliant and ingenious  I was amazed at how the author delighted me with the beauty of language  Nabakov made words jump through hoops that I never even knew existed  while he explores the deep and dark realms of lust  obsession  and longing Despite the narrator s  Humbert  sexual  affairs  with the young Lolita  he still made it clear that he showed unconditional love to her  He loves the way she does things  He loves the way she played in the tennis court  He loves her arms  toes  shoes  and her name  He described Lolita in beautiful  creative  and poetic ways  Like I said before  you will appreciate the English language even more after reading this book  Originally posted in my blog  Love Books   Blush Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov is a well known classic and is the archetype of a novel with an unreliable  unlikeable narrator  Humbert Humbert is a thirty something literature professor who believes his love of young girls stems from the death of his first love when he was a child  Humbert eventually meets a woman named Charlotte Haze and agrees to marry her simply to be close to Haze s twelve year old daughter  Dolores  Dolores  called Lolita by Humbert  is taken by Humbert on a road trip when an unfortunate circumstance occurs and Lolita becomes an orphan  She is used sexually for years by Humbert and loses her innocence and childhood Most people are familiar with the plot of Lolita and may decide not to read it because it is essentially a novel about a pedophile who uses a young girl for his sexual needs  I understand the sentiment  Humbert is an incredibly manipulative and evil person  He uses Lolita without any thought to how she is affected and the loss of her childhood  Humbert even claims that Lolita seduces him into sleeping with her  Readers must read between the lines of Humbert s perspective to fully comprehend what is truly taking place  Clearly  Humbert has a biased and tainted perspective  Lolita s plot is not something people will find pleasant or easily acceptable  but Nabokov s work is still interesting and worth a read Despite various reasons for people to dislike the book  Nabokov s Lolita is a classic for a reason  Nabokov s writing is beautiful  gorgeous  with wit and word play  The reader can t help but be drawn in by the language of the book  There are times you want to put down the book for its sordid content  but are once again lulled and coaxed into reaching for it again because of the language  It makes the reader forget the plot of the story and encourages one to immerse themselves in the words  the descriptions  the black humor  the stunning prose Another interesting thing about the book is how it ends  I won t spoil the story  but suffice it to say Humbert comes to terms with what he has done to Lolita  Humbert  who spends most of the book using dazzling prose to hide behind his actions  finally sees the decisions he made with Lolita in a different light  That doesn t mean Humbert should be cleansed of his sins or that he fully comprehends what he s done to her  He acknowledges that he s harmed Lolita  and this is the only bit of semi honest self reflection in the story I know that Lolita is a controversial book  but regardless  I believe it is a marvelous  fascinating work with exquisite language  I give the book a strong 5 5 despite its content  You don t have to believe or like a narrator to find merit in a work  You don t have to love the plot  That is the case for me and the Nabokov s novel  Nabokov paints a picture of a sociopath who uses an adolescent for sex  yet  as I reader I couldn t put the book down   Lolita  e um livro excessivo  exagerado  histerico  extatico  E dificil dizer qualquer coisa alem disso  e excelente  Nabokov escreve com um prazer infinito  e nos obriga a desejar uma historia tao perversa  Humbert Humbert  o narrador pedofilo  o estuprador  o vilao e suas palavras tao belas  tao absurdas  Compreende se o injustificavel erro de ler  Lolita  como uma historia de amor  nos prestamos mais atencao na paixao com que dizem as coisas do que nas coisas que estao sendo ditas  Nao nos enganemos  nao existe romance possivel nessas paginas  Tudo isso filtrado por um humor venenoso  tragico  melancolico  o livro parece um ocaso  uma ruina  E dificil dizer qualquer coisa  enfim  ja esta dito pelo proprio Nabokov no posfacio   As far as I can recall  the initial shiver of inspiration was somehow prompted by a newspaper story about an ape in the Jardin des Plantes  who  after months of coaxing by a scientist  produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal  this sketch showed the bars of the poor creature s cage   If you are able to reduce a novel to a set of morals or to a short summarized paragraph  I would say that novel is a failure  I am glad that Lolita is far from being a failure  It gives a great reading experience  It is incredibly humourous and utterly complicated  The characters may seem simple at first but they are as complicated as we are in  reality   The language is amazing  The usage of some words are so good and so different that they can only be done by Nabokov and no one else  The novel stimulates different emotions throughout its course  The narration is unique and it is better experienced by reading than someone s explanation  I would recommend this novel  Anyone can tell you that Lolita is a staggering example of virtuosity with the English language  and honestly I d five star it just for that alone  but I ve read plenty of literary masterworks that I haven t capital L Loved like I love Lolita  Let s put aside the gorgeous  dazzling  mind bending

the one that got the most comments from stangers  And seriously  it s about obesssion  not sex  And moreover  it is a large scale metaphor for the damaging process  raping  that the adult world puts children through as  or before  they mature   Really   More on that later  though  For now   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul  Lo lee ta  the tip of the tounge taking a trip

She was Dolores on the dotted line  But in my arms she was always Lolita     Lo  Lee  Ta  Best  Beginning  Ever  Ce livre n en vaut pas la peine d etre lu   ce livre doit etre lu  Ce livre provoque une fascination  choque par instant et est delicieux en somme  Ce livre est une oeuvre d art ecrite poetiquement par l auteur et non en vu de faire reagir tous les psychanalystes sur le sujet mais pour voir ou ce personnage va amener l auteur  et va emmener nous meme  jusqu a quelle conclusion    Et ce qui est le plut tentant ce que la fin est imprevisible  tout comme notre pensee  Encore une decouverte sur un nouveau type d amour  de folie  de desespoir comme disait Rimbaud mais aussi de provocation     Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins   Merci Nabokov  Vraiment merci   A Russian novel of an American road trip  The unreliable narrator seeks to convince the reader that his sexual abuse of a child could be her fault  Many readers failed to note that his acts were seriously disturbed and took Nabokov s baiting of American society literally  A tour de force which released the writer from teaching which gave us ADA  Read Lolita without blaming the victim  Faszinierend und Verstorend zugleich nimmt Lolita uns mit auf eine Reise  nicht nur quer durch Europa und die USA  sondern auch durch die Abgrunde unserer Seele Nabokov ist ein Kunstler  Seine Sprache ist voller Eleganz  sie tanzt und umgarnt uns  so dass wir am Ende nicht mehr scharf zwischen gut und bose zu trennen vermogen Keine leichte Kost  aber eine  die sich lohnt  A true classic in every sense of the word  scholarly books have been written about this novel which are longer than the novel itself  The film adaptation is a cinematic classic that could probably not have been filmed today  The title has entered the lexicon as a sense of style and a psychological disorder  The story is one that makes a lot of people uncomfortable  It s a story about forbidden love  It s a story about loneliness and the bitter lengths some will go to to escape that loneliness  The greatest crime this book makes in the eyes of many of its critics is that the narrator is sympathetic  How can a pedophile be sympathetic  What yearnings and desires rise up in the heart of an adult that makes them yearn for the company of a prepubescent  The narrator tells us that his Lolita was not a virgin when she finally came to his bed  That she had already experimented with group sex while away at camp  However this does not absolve his crimes  The major problem with this kind of relationship is the imbalance of power  Here is a man who portrays himself as the protector of a youth  yet he is abusing this status for his own pleasure  He should be the guide that helps the young lady through the troubles of youth into the maturity of young adulthood and help her decide for herself what she wants  Rape is the theft of choice  It is the destruction of innocence  Although she did choose to give herself to him  it was not a true choice because of the power he held over her  We only have Humbert Humbert s words to go off that things went the way he said they did  If he is an unreliable narrator then we can never know the truth of the situation  In many ways  this story follows the lines of a Shakespearean tragedy  It is worth pointing out that many of the heroines and romantic love interests in Shakespeare s works were as young or younger than Lolita  At the beginning of the story she is 12 and a half years old  Juliet died at 13  Ophelia is thought to have been between 14 16 during the events of Hamlet  But this was in an age where living to 30 was quite difficult so people had to grow up a lot sooner  and the age gap between Romeo Juliet and Hamlet Ophelia was much less than Humbert Lolita  In any case  no one gets out of this story unscathed  Humbert tries to make up for his crimes in his own way  and can even be seen as a tragic hero SPOILERS by killing the debauched playwrite who steals Lolita from him and providing some monetary support for Lolita in her new life  None of this excuses his actions  But it does make it hard to hate him  pervert though he be  Best book ever  such an amusing book  just the perfect book if you want to read something out of normality  due to the fact that this is not a terrestrial book  HahaNabokov s writing style is quite unique  you can almost feel every words  flavour  his respect for English  as his respect for French are pretty amusing and then you are like  Hey  am I really using my own language in a proper way  because he is not American and knew how to speak English better than me   HahahaI get excited every time I hear about this novel  My favourite book ever  Why is Russian literature the best literature ever   Tolstoi  Dostoyevsky  Nabokov  Gogol  Pushkin  And several more Russian authors I can not recall right now  Quality of Writing  10 out of 10Pace  7 out of 10Plot Development  8 out

beginning of Part 2 for a while to read other novels  Lolita is really well written  The subject matter might be a bit risque and might make some people not want to read it  but I think Lolita is very worth it  It is a very good insight into the justification of devious actions and it s written from the antagonist s point of view  not the victim s  This is a really well written book  that is if you can stomach the first half of the novel  To be honesty there were time I wanted to stop reading Lolita  This is a novel with a sickly obsessed narrator where you feel like you need to beg him to shut up with his stupidity  Why should you read this then  Simple  it really well written  it s on the banned book list  and it s a classic Lolita not only has one of the most famous first lines in literature  it also has one of the most notorious plots  Humbert Humbert is a man close to his 40s who falls madly obsessed in love with a 12 year old girl named Dolores Haze  whom he names Lolita  The first half of the novel Nabokov does a great job explaining all of this to us  He makes it very clear that Humbert is in fact a pedophile  He not only like Lolita  but other girls as well  This is the part of the novel that is sickening to read As much as the novel creeps you out and makes you sick  it very addicting  I found that I couldn t stop thinking about it nor could I put it down  I think I liked the second part of the book better because I started to see why Updike has a review on the back of my edition  If you want to write an American classic  write a scene or more about driving  Actually with all the chaos that happens in Lolita  those parts were relaxing I m not sure how they made this into two movie and gave justice to the book  The age difference I understand with Lolita  yet it does change the meaning of the book  Humbert didn t just care for girl  but nymphets  Also  Humbert breaks the fourth wall several times and I wonder if the movies even make that attempt with keeping the seriousness of the novel  Going to watch the movies  but at the same time I know I won t like them as much There is so much going on in this novel and so much I can talk about  but a lot f it is spoilers for here  The ending makes me ask questions about Lolita and Hubert s actually relationship  Yet  I hope people do take the time and read the book  Yes t one of the most disturbing books I ve read  but that s why people need to read Lolita  After all it s  my sin  my soul   Ah  such gorgeous prose flows from the pen of Nabokov s repugnant psychopath narrator  Sometimes words are superfluous  and after having read this notorious book  I thought that it would be better if I abridged my review in one word  brilliant   Lolita  light of my life  fire of my loins  My sin  my soul   Lolita is essentially a confession  a man s perspective of his lustful and delinquent life  torn between his love for Lolita  a twelve year old  nymphet   and his carnal desires that constitute his personality  Nabokov excels in engaging the readers in this compelling piece of fiction with his vivid expressions and complex verbalism  Though a little intimidating at times  this novel is a must read for all literature enthusiasts  An amazing book  filled with rich prose  I had seen the movie version years ago and had always wanted to read this  and am glad that I did  The movie version abridges much of what makes this story so entertaining and fascinating  For example  Humbert is largely a misanthrope  hating pretty much everyone he meets except for Lolita  who detests him  The initial trip Humbert and Lolita take across America provides Nabokov with umpteen chances to skewer middle class America while also marvel at the amazing expanses of the American countryside  The move also neglects mentioning Humbert s formative years  where his love for a young girl his age is cut short  and leads to his lifelong obsession with nymphets This certainly must be the most enjoyable book written from the perspective of a pedophile  Humbert is so charming  cultured and well read  I couldn t help but enjoy his story in spite of what he does to Lolita  Interestingly enough  while Humbert is fully aware of what he is doing to Lolita  he can only bring himself to describe what he does using effusive metaphors and allegories  He even gets embarrassed when a headmistress at Lolita s school tries to discuss Lolita s sexual development  even though he had been taking advantage of her for years My interpretation of Nabokov s story is this  Humbert s tragedy is that he allowed his obsession with nymphets first and finally Lolita consume him  to the point that he believes he loves her  Of course  how many of us would be guilty of falling in love with our obsession  even if that obsession does not love us back in kind  This certainly is a male perspective on love  where men develop an image in their mind of what the perfect girl or woman is early in life  and spend the rest of their lives chasing that image in an attempt to possess it  As Humbert  and we  find out  time moves on  and the people we love change and grow older  and only faintly resemble the perfect image of what we thought would make us happy  We  as adults  must grow and adapt our love  or wind up alone with our idealized images of happiness to haunt our solitary nights I highly recommend reading this book with a computer or tablet handy  so that you can look up unfamiliar words and French verses  Be aware that Google Translate is horrible at translating anything beyond a few words  Nabokov has one of the greatest commands of the English language of anyone I have ever read  And the man was Russian  Lolita is a masterpiece  Nabokov s famous prose is in full effect here  effortlessly constructing passages that work on several levels  weaving bilingual puns with an unreliable narrator deconstructing the novel form itself  Lolita makes us sympathize with the narrator  Humbert  despite him having no business inspiring sympathy   Lolita is ultimate kind of girls that was a the Evidence for the writer to think about it  In fact that Little sexy girl has an influence over the writers head  It was a nice book that I read especially when he uses the style of remembering the Childhood of His Lolita  In fact it worth reading regardless of its ban  My copy proclaims this is a love story  Pardon me  but I had to cross that out  This is a story that operates based on delusion of both the narrator and the reader  So if you intend on reading it  beware  The editor of my copy was clearly deluded by Humbert  Nabokov forces us into the first person view of a pedophilic stepfather who has developed an obsession with  nymphettes  after an unfulfilled sexual encounter in his youth  Page after page we are thrust into masterful wordplay lush with torment  calculated deceit  and unreliability  One may be shocked by the book s subject matter  as one should be   The value added to society is the understanding of the beast  Further throwing us into the realm of the uncomfortable is the complete lack of moral redemption  and demise of the victims  showcasing the results of a demon existing undetected in society  As compelling a read it may be  the subject matter is not for the faint of heart  Such Humbert Humberts may be our very own neighbors  friends  or loved ones which makes this fictional tale all the more chilling  particularly in its cold denouement   Breathtaking  The subject matter is disgusting  offensive  and everything in between  but every sentence is beautiful  When Humbert Humbert was detailing his reasons for loving preteen girls  Nymphets  as he calls them  I found myself nodding my head along with the description  and promptly chided myself  The book is nothing short of gorgeous  5 5
