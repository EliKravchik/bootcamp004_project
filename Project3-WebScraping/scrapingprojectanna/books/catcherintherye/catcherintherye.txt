My Favorite book ever  Upon reading this book I knew that I liked it  but I did not know why  The protagonist is a self centered  whiny teenager  and I found myself wondering why I empathized so much with him  Upon delving deeper into the book and reading through it again you discover him not to be so much a whiny teenager but someone deeply disappointed with life  and what life is supposed to be  Everyone he sees seems to be happy with themselves  with their lives  with their jobs  their girlfriends  parents etc  But for Holden it seems nothing is going the way he wants  he isn t the winner of the race  or the highest score on the test  or the best son  or the most desirable suitor  It seems everything he tries he either fails at or does passably  but with an underlying twinge of mediocrity  Because of this he feels like everybody else has to be phony  there is no way they can be that happy with themselves and the way their lives are going  And in that  in his subtle yet completely overlying depression  he draws not only the empathy of myself  but of nearly every western teenager to walk the earth in the past century   It s one of the books that will make you wish that the author was one of your close friend and you could call him up at the middle of night and talk about the book  Going into this book I expected very little  I don t know why  I had to read it for class  and thought it would be less   relatable  By the second chapter  I couldn t put it down  and am very glad that it s a requirement in schools  because everyone needs to know that they are not along in their emotional experiences   It was quite an adventure being in the head of a 16 year old boy for 48 hours  Mr  Salinger created quite a character  Holden Caufield s stream of consciousness was very real  honest  funny and sad   if you want to know the truth  This is definitely a must read  if you have even thought about reading this at one time and never got around to it then do it  At the time when I was reading this  I could relate to Holden in some ways  especially being young and angry at so many things  I think it s a book that I will have to read in a couple of more years and see what has changed and if i still think it was just as good or even better  One of the greatest stories ever told  The main character Holden Caulfield  a school dropout  is a character you can definitely relate to  He speaks honestly about the world   I had to read Catcher In The Rye by J  D  Salinger in high school  For this reading I am a much older woman  This time I saw Holden differently  I got pass the word  phoney   Holden Caulfield isn t like other people  He s really different  I think he likes being different  I suppose this is why he wears that red hunting cap  I especially enjoyed reading about Robert Burns poem   The Catcher In The Rye   Holden misinterprets the poem while Phoebe  his younger sister  knows the correct interpretation of the poem  I think Holden s  wrong  interpretation of the poem tells about what he wants to do with his life  Holden can t stand change  the loss of innocence  tragedies  He wants to catch people  especially children  before they fall  He wants to be a catcher in the Rye  Really  the poem is about meeting a person as they walk through the Rye not catching the person  I haven t read the poem yet  Still looking for it  I know Robert Burns had a thick brogue  I hope an American will read it  Then  I will  catch  every word   review originally posted on my blog For years I ve heard mixed things about The Catcher in the Rye  There are many who hate the book and the select few who adore it  I was skeptical to read it for many years  for one reason I m not a huge fan of classic novels  But after watching numerous Vlogbrother videos on youtube and seeing young adult author John Green praise the book so highly I became curious  It wasn t until recently when I found out that my dad owned the book that I decided to read it  and I m so glad I did I fall into the latter category of readers  I adore The Catcher in the Rye  I read the book in a day in between quiet periods at work  True  the book is only 214 pages  but still I don t usually read a book in a day  Usually I need a break from the story  a chance to come back to reality  But this book kept me hooked I am so interested in Holden Caulfield  the narrator  He s unlike any literary character or narrator I ve read  The story itself is unlike one I ve ever read  Truly  there isn t much of a plot in the story  I would argue that there isn t necessarily I climax scene  there isn t a conclusion  it s just the story of Holden Caulfield  a strange sixteen year old boy who doesn t really know who he is or where he fits in I love how vague Holden is in the story  While the reader is given information about his family  his past schools  and friends Holden never goes into much detail  He doesn t want to  as he makes it clear in the first line of the story  He s mysterious  he s angry  and he doesn t like a lot of people But it s the little things  the things hidden in between the lines that make me love the story  The fact that Holden talks about his dead brother Allie who he was close too  It s the relationship between them we never see  the longing Holden has for his brother talking to him and asking for his guidance though he s dead  The fact that Holden cares deeply for his old neighbour Jane Gallagher and wants to call her several times but he doesn t because he  isn t in the mood   It s the fact that Holden drifts while all the people around his stay rooted in place  Holden is a true misfit who doesn t know where he belongs and doesn t know who he is and the fact that he is judged so harshly by others for who he is I find the story relatable  and that while Holden is a very difficult character to understand the reader can t help but sympathize with him and find similarities with him  Everyone has a bit of Holden Caulfield inside of them I am so happy I read this book I can t describe it  I think The Catcher in the Rye should be a book everyone reads at least once in their life  I made a promise to myself that I would finally read this book  Then  when J D  Salinger died this year  I felt I especially should keep my promise  I bought a paperback copy to take with me on a recent trip to Florida  I loved reading this book while traveling  After all  what better place to fall into Holden Caulfield s world than on an airplane  surrounded by phonies I frequently laughed at loud while reading this book  I totally  finally  understand why this book is such a classic  I loved Holden s description of his dorm mate clipping his toenails  his interactions with  old  Phoebe  and his cranky view of the world  I can t wait to read more J D  Salinger  I appreciate this book a lot for it s portrayal of mental illness and the accompanying defensive cynicism  and am blown away by how well crafted it is  though Holden is totally confused by what s going on  Salinger obviously has a handle on the complexities of plot  tone  and irony  Holden is whiny but  to my dismay  I understand him completely  the hypocrisy of simultaneously despising a superficial society and desperately craving a place within that society basically describes my teenage life  Maybe  hopefully  I ll grow out of it in time  Meanwhile  I personally think Catcher is an awesome book  one that surpassed my admittedly low expectations  Have you ever felt a deep sense of alienation from the world  Or have you ever felt when you were young the shaking fear of growing old  If you are at least human you will be able to relate to the infamous Holden Caulfield  the main character of the novel  Sure  this book doesn t have a true plot line  but that s the beauty of it  Holden s endless wandering through New York is reminiscent of the embittered thoughts of our youth  The detail in which the relatable and approachable  almost  stream of consciousness writing gives substance to every page and shows the true craft of JD Salinger  This book firmly sits on the throne of coming to age novels  if you like this book  you will also LOVE James Joyce s  A Portrait of an Artist  as a Young Man  which I felt was a bit more mature version of this novel   If you were ever young  ever human  this book will sit soundly in your heart  Don t read this book if you re a phoney bastard  Phoney bastards hate this book  they really do  I m not kidding  Oh god am I not kidding  Oh  and I really like this book  if you wanna know the truth   This novel is another classic case of society s way of judging literature   I don t like the protagonist  therefore  the book sucks   Not going to lie  the tone of this book is difficult to get into  but overall this is one of the greatest books I will probably ever read in my lifetime  Its content was revolutionary  Salinger addressed the struggles of growing up and the  phoniness  of the world in such a way that had uptight individuals on their heels in the 1950 s  Yet  so many people despise this book and I cannot understand why  Yes  Holden Caulfield is  in all honesty  an annoying  unstable  whiny  horny teenage boy  But he is meant to be that way in order for the novel to serve its purpose  People also fail to consider that while Holden is going through the extreme case of teenage angst  he also shows signs of some serious mental problems and has suicidal thoughts   of course he isn t going to be stable  Despite this  Holden shows signs of being incredibly observant of his surroundings  and makes some very valid assertions about society  which he just unfortunately  due to his immaturity  he delusionally applies to every individual he meets  leading to his inability to trust others  leaving him alone  which only deepens his depression and isolation  Now if I were Holden  I would probably be miserable as well  In fact  I don t exactly love his character either  and would probably avoid him if he were a real person  However  The Catcher in the Rye still remains one of my favorite books  Why  Because of what it stands for  Holden being the way he is allowed Salinger to create this message  If you find yourself hating the book simply because of its protagonist  I suggest you reread it in the way it is meant to be read   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do you start missing everybodyIt s one of those books that is either going to instantly repel you or tug at your heartstrings  I read it in the summer and had I written my review then  it would not have been an accurate rating  for I was a little undewhelmed after reading it after all the acclaim and gave it four stars  However  after dwelling on the story a little longer  I realised it is not so much what happens in Catcher but why such events take place  The novel is laced with such heavy symbolism  you can t not feel moved by such an intricately woven tale Holden is definitely on my list of characters I just want to hug  He is so tragic and lost and I just felt like a compassionate hug was all he needed to reassure him that everything was going to be okay  Although Holden is absolutely right in a way  Life is tragic but you have to learn to deal with such tragedy and only then can we truly fall in love with the idea of living  Voy a rescatar algo que mi profesor dijo sobre este libro y que me parecio de lo mas interesante      Todavia queda en pie el peligro de este texto  que nos hace pensar que cuando eramos adolescentes teniamos razon  que era correcta nuestra estricta escala de valores  nuestro repudio de lo falso  nuestro utopismo  nuestro idealismo  todo aquello que irremediablemente perdimos por una cuestion etaria  Porque el texto subraya  hiende en la herida  porque no hay manera de escapar  porque la vida misma  el mismo hecho de crecer nos subsume y arrastra en un cambio mental por el cual todo eso queda atras  Por eso Holden quiere estar ahi al borde del acantilado y cuidar esa especie de infancia eterna  Pensandolo asi el texto deja un regusto amargo  El deseo de Holden de ser el  catcher in the rye  es de lo mas comprensible pero tambien imposible  Es imposible escapar del crecimiento biologico y de adoptar cualidades como la materialidad  la superficialidad y la hipocresia que el mundo adulto conlleva  Eso es todo lo que Holden desprecia y enmascara con la palabra  phony   que repite todo el tiempo hasta el cansancio  Algun dia voy a tener que leer algo mas de Salinger  Vivo releyendo  A perfect day for bananafish  pero nunca lei ningun otro cuento  soy la peor fan de Salinger que existe D  What a beautiful  beautiful book As I read the first few chapters  I found myself wondering what the fuss was all about   why was this book considered a classic of American litterature And then  little by little  with each interaction with a new character and as he narrates his wanderings around New York  you get a sense of who Holden is and what he is going through   view spoiler  There s a an incredible amount of sadness in Holden that you don t see at first  I found it quite moving  and I am sure that most people can relate to his journey   just about everybody experiences at some point in their life that feeling of being lost and not fitting in the world around you    hide spoiler  This book is much richer than obvious at first and powerful in a very subtle way    gh wq n my khwy qDyh rw bshnwy   lbd wl chyzy khh my khwy bdwny ynh khh khj dny wmdh m w bchgy gndm chh jwry bwdh w pdr mdrm qbl dny wmdnm chykhr

without reading about someone else doing the same  However  after I pushed myself to read the first 100 pages  I started to find great quotes which I completely related to  Here are some of my favorite quotes  The trouble with girls is  if they like a boy  no matter how big a  jerk  he is  they ll say he has in inferiority complex  and if they don t like him  no matter how nice a guy he is  or how big an inferiority complex he has  they ll say he s conceited   pg  136   That definitely works for guys in the place of girls as well  I believe   The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one    pg  188  I like page 189 as well where Mr  Antolini discusses the fact that creativity is good  but it requires some learning in order for it to be well presented Edit  So I hadn t really thought about this but it makes perfect sense  Holden has PTSD from his brother s death and the suicide of a fellow schoolmate  For many I m sure that s obvious  but it wasn t to me and that bit of knowledge has completely doubled the meaning in the book  Wow   This is a story about Holden Caulfield  who has been expelled from his boarding school  Holden is a notorious liar and has been kicked out of many schools  However  he has not yet told his parents  It is the story of Holden going home and meeting different people  It is the journey from his school to his house  It is considered a book about the coming of age  This book does a great job of representing the teenage struggles and the issues that they experience  This book includes swear words and topics that may be a little controversial  For this reason  it is for young adults  This book s literature can be compared to different books that were created during the same time  since it is written in a very unique way  This book actually started as short stories in the New Yorker  and was then created into a book  For this reason  this book can also be introduced to the class to teach about the writing process Salinger  J D   1945   The Catcher in the Rye  New York  NY  Little  Brown and Company  a moving story of J D  Salinger that gives every youth a clearer view between their wants and needs  it is a very excellent piece of work that every Individual must read   You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   Holden If you want to know the truth  I don t know what I think about it  I m sorry I told so many people about it  About all I know is  I sort of miss everybody I told about  Even old Stradlater and Ackley  for instance  I think I even miss that goddam Maurice  It s funny  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   HoldenDEAR MR  SPENCER  he read out loud   That is all I know aboutthe Egyptians  I can t seem to get very interested in themalthough your lectures are very interesting  It is all rightwith me if you flunk me though as I am flunking everythingelse except English anyway Respectfully yours  HOLDEN CAULFIELD Very weird book though very interesting  orginal and informative story content  and characters   Didn t think a single minute somebody could be as psychologically different as Holden Caulfiel  Very different from what I usually read   Holden Caulfield is a total babe  Granted  he is a loser  and most likely mentally unstable  but Salinger did such an exquisite job of developing his character that made him endearing  the bit about being the catcher in the rye  I cried  despite his numerous flaws  There was something about his character that  for some reason  made him seem tangible  as if he were a real person I would meet on the street  and I really enjoyed that sense of genuineness that radiated from this novel  Although this novel essentially had no plot line  it wasn t really necessary  the novel was superb without it  and it was a nice break from authors trying so desperately to jam pack novels with plot twists and unrealistic events  This was honestly probably the most consistently funny book I have ever had the pleasure of reading  everything that Holden thought and said was almost always hilarious  and of course that made the novel more enjoyable  Despite the abundance of humor  the novel had it s deep moments too  and created a lovely balance of these two factors  resulting in one of the best books I have read  10 10 JD  I m on the hunt for more of your work   The famous book that was forbidden in the U S during the 1950 s and mysteriously the  bible  for some killers like Mark Chapman  is the only novel written by J D Salinger  whose destiny wasn t common  he left society and locked up in a house in the middle of the forest till his death  Despite all this   The Catcher in the Rye  is one of a kind  Holden Caulfield is a depressed and very frustrated teenager of a very wealthy family  he has 2 brothers  Alli  the youngest one died from cancer  and a young sister  his father is a successful lawyer   Due to the terrible event that the family goes through  Holden has become a very problematic boy who represents the enigma of angst and at the same time hope   Holden Caulfield is the embodiment of what we mean by the phrase  young adult    too young to be a grown up  but too wise to the world to be completely innocent  He s caught in the in between  and that in between is what all young adult authors write about      David LevithanThis book worth every minute you spend trying to find all the possible symbolisms of the monologue     The Catcher In The Rye   by J D  Salinger  was first released in 1951  as his first and only novel  Over the years it has gained much interest among young adults  and is even considered classic young adult literature  The story revolves around a young cynic  Holden Caufield  and his experience throughout a 48 hour excursion in 1950 s New York  The Catcher In The Rye is in fact a perceptive study of one individual s understanding of the human condition  After getting expelled  once again  from another boarding school  Caufield spends the weekend socializing with friends he doesn t enjoy very much  meeting a teacher he doesn t really like  and meeting ex girlfriends he doesn t have feelings for  Each encounter he has is a quest to find some sort of companionship  but his skepticism never allows him to truly relate to others  Salinger s use of sarcasm and satire  though often oversimplified  is extraordinary  He portrays Caufield as a young boy being forced to grow up and feeling quite alienated everywhere he goes  His resentment and disgust towards the  phonies  all around him  and truly the general phoniness of the entire adult world  may be what leads him to alienating himself  Through all his faults  evident as they are  Holden is still a character one can easily become close with   The Catcher in the Rye  gets two thumbs up from me   I have very different feelings toward this book  Normally  if I don t like the main character  I don t like the book  But in this case  I absolutely HATED the main character  but ended up loving the book  I m not afraid to say that the main character was the biggest  fattest  phoniest  pardon my french  but Holden curses WAY more bastard I ve ever read about in my entire life  He is hypocritical  contradics everything he says  and has the worst attitude problem in the state of New York  He is the most annoying  stereotypical teenage boy and doesn t give a crap about anything and doesn t care about anyone and he is the most detailed and finely shaped character I have ever met while reading a book  You see it s not the story that made Catcher in the Rye good  and it s certainly not the main character  Holden  But it was the fact that with every word J D  Salinger wrote  with every random paragraph  pointless rant  and seemingly unimportant thought that came out of Holden s dirty mouth described him so well  he became real  Everything that Holden did and said just added to his complex character  not neccessarily a polite or rational or nice character  but an extremely realistic one  That s what made the book genius  That s what made me love this book  Holden Caulfield is sick of people telling him what to do  his school  Pency Prep  and phonies  When he runs away from Pency  he will begin an adventure that will bring him throughout New York City and may change his views on life  love  and loneliness    What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though   Holden s right  that s a rare feeling  but I can say for sure that right now I m wishing I could call up Salinger It s funny  I tried reading this about 2 years ago and I couldn t get into it  however  this time I fell in love with it  Holden Caulfield killed me  He is such a beautifully intricate character  He s messy  honest  sarcastic and despite seeming apathetic at times  he cares so much  I found it inspiring to see how much he cared about the preservation and protection of innocence  it s something I can relate to a lot at this time of my life  The narrative is very stream of consciousness  but I found that refreshing  I loved how it was driven solely by Holden s thoughts and feelings  The imagery in this book is brilliant  especially  the catcher in the rye and the merry go round and gold ring at the end  When I read the  catcher in the rye  passage  where Holden is talking to Phoebe  it broke my heart  It was probably one of the saddest things I have ever read  I don t usually cry a lot when I read  but I burst into tears as I read that and I couldn t stop for the rest of the book I could go on and on about this book but I don t think anything I could write would sum up how brilliant and beautiful this book is  Holden Caulfield is a douche  But that s ok  Never having read  The Catcher in the Rye  as a teenager  I was actually surprised at how much I  perhaps subconsciously  emulated Caulfield when I was 17  or 18  Salinger was right on the money with that  No matter how far we are in to the future  there will always be a Holden Caulfield in every generation  in every country  and in every school  I actually read some reviews here on this site with people giving it a bad review because they found the main character to be so annoying and childish  That killed me  It really did  I m guessing they forgot how annoying  and self indulgent they were when they were trying to figure out who they were  Holden also has working against him the fact that he is of a wealthy family  That typically takes a few points off on the sympathy scale   I feel I should take a star away from the story itself  in which a lot happens  yet nothing happens  However  I could not put the book down  I liked it  I liked it because I felt no need to like  or sympathize  or root for the main character  as many stories do  Yet  I was hoping  till the very end that everything turned out well for old Holden  That sounds like effective storytelling as far as I can tell   a lot of people tend to hate on this book because of its plot structure  they say that the fact that this book has no specific climax makes it not a good book  while in my case  books don t have to have a strict plot structure to be considered good or amazing  it s the content or the message of the author to the readers that what matters the most all in all  this was a very good and relatable book for teens because it perfectly describes how teenagers feel  which i angst most of the time  and their desire to be innocent once more  and if you ve noticed  the word  kind of  is used a lot in the book  this symbolizes how teenagers are  most of the time  confused and don t really know what they want in life i recommend this for teenagers and possibly  people who are in their early twenties  enjoy   Wow  I m so glad I decided to re read this book because I hated it the first time and now I loved it  Perhaps I m a strange person for changing my opinion in this way  but now I get Holden Caufield  Back then  I found him annoying  All I can say is I really loved this book    I just don t have any other words   I loved it   The Catcher In the Rye  by J D  Salinger  tells the story of Holden Caulfield  a young man that was kicked out of school and decided to embark on a journey of guilt depression and lies  Holden  a fairly wealthy  Jewish young man  was a person to be known to constantly disregard important details  many times blowing off the dean and his teachers  But as he traveled through the somber days before Christmas  he would soon learn a lesson that would change him forever  The journey put him in contact with people from all walks of life  But all the people had nothing to live for  They d live oppressive  difficult lives  and seeing this threw Holden into a state of depression  essentially pushing him to smoke cigarettes and blow through money like a King  And the more time he spent only made him more depressed  simply because he had a loving  accepting family willing to help him  he had money and at least some education or at least a chance for one and nobody else had that or could even come close to that  And with Holden s interactions and the decisions he made  J D Salinger hints to the theme that life isn t about taking advantage of being privileged  but simply instead  knowing the world and prioritizing the things that matter the most  Great coming of age story  Every teenager should read this book  I really enjoyed Holden s narrative  which I found funny and raw  I read this for pleasure before reading it for school  which I found to be greatly beneficial to my understanding  This is definitely a book you can gain from by re reading  Many of my peers disliked it because of its lack of plot  I enjoy more character driven books rather than extreme plots  Holden s epiphany at the end of the novel was quite interesting  and it took two reads before I figured out the complexity of the carousel gold ring scene  At the beginning I seriously disliked Holden  A LOT  I found him annoying and whining  But as more of his character came out and we discovered more about him  I began to sympathize with Holden as a person and a character  By the end  I truly felt for Holden and to me  he is a classic character  His character growth is a bit slow  but by the end he becomes much more tolerable  Truly a great read  and a classic novel  Would 100  recommend   Que mais posso dizer alem de que e um classico  Posso recorrer ao cliche da frase mais citada deste livro  O que realmente me enche as medidas e um livro que  depois de acabarmos de o ler  nos faca desejar que o autor que o escreveu fosse um grande amigo nosso e pudessemos telefonar lhe sempre que nos desse para ai  dita pelo protagonista Holden Caulfield  Porque no fundo e apenas e so isto  Muito interessante como o livro comeca como uma simples narracao em primeira pessoa de um adolescente problematico  com pouco na cabeca  e se vai desembrulhando  conduzindo nos cada vez mais ate ao interior desta personagem  da forma como ele anti heroicamente ve o mundo  ao ponto de comecarmos a desenvolver uma forte empatia com ele  Sente se o livro vir ate nos  a meio ja o respiramos  no final estamos em casa  sabendo muito bem ler cada linha  como se tudo ali fosse muito nosso  muito claro  muito logico Um pequeno livro  uma pequena historia  mas tao grande prosa capaz de expressar tao relevantes sentimentos  Personally I found this book really good  The writing style is sometimesconfusing and repetitive but very easy to read  The story itself is interesting and is impossible to not identify with the main character  What I liked the most about this book is Holden  He s one of the most human  realistic characters I ve ever read  He has so many flaws and sometimes he acts like a little kid  He s impulsive and a compulsive liar  but he has good qualities to redeem himself  This book really catches what it s like to be a teenager  the feeling of endless energy and resolution and the loneliness  sadness and emptiness that teenagers feel sometimes  There s only two reasons for me to give a book 5 5 stars  if it s amazingly well written  with a brilliant story and characters with a well developed plot  or if it s a book that  even if it lacks of these things  leaves me nostalgic when I finish it and during it s reading makes me feel a lot of emotions and inspires me  The Catcher in the Rye is one of these books  I feel like a little of Holden stayed with me afterwars and will stay with me for a long time  Though I believe that this book likely helped spawn a whole bunch of hippy  depression is cool nonsense throughout the seventies  who can deny it is a classic  If taken as a sequel to Huck Finn  which is certainly Rye s predecessor  the book is quite delightful  despite the constant crassness  The flippant  colloquial style is incredibly hard to pull off well  yet Salinger somehow does it  The moments when Holden or Phoebe sacrifice for each other are really transcendent  and that relationship is one of the most beautiful I ve read of in fiction  Also  the book is laugh out loud funny   a rarity The irony of the book is that while Holden wishes to save children from the depression he s facing  Catcher in the Rye likely leads most young teenagers who read it only towards depression and angst  I mean  Holden is so  authentic  that I can see how a young reader would be duped into following his  me against the world  attitude and how they might just complain about how  phony  adults can be after reading it  Holden s a horrible role model and if young readers don t realize how unreliable he is as a narrator  and I would guess many don t  spending time with him will mess up their lives  however slightly  The focal points are the moments when Holden and Phoebe sacrifice for each other  but I fear that most young readers  I know I would have  only see sex and swearing and Holden s  authenticity   Speaking of morals  the book works for readers who can see through all the hollowness of Holden and realize that they  like me  might do more to make real sacrifices for dear ones  Speaking of aesthetics  the book is a wonder  filled with the most interesting sentences  It took a few chapters for me to be absorbed in this book  but it ended up being one I could not put down  Some readers will  as you will see from other reviews  be put off by controversial elements  Others will find the lack of action in the book confusing  But those who read this book with an honest and open mind  will realize that Holden teaches readers some truths As Holden tries to come to terms with moving from childhood to adulthood  he lives with the stress and the struggle of living in the  in between  years  In some ways  he wants to move past the phony world of high school and be done with it  In other ways  he wants to preserve the simplicity of childhood  Holden says   Certain things  they should stay the way they are  You ought to be able to able to stick them in one of those glass cases and just leave them alone  I know that s impossible  but it s too bad anyway   He is pulled strongly between seeking the independence of adulthood and the ease of childhood  As he is pulled tightly in both directions  he eventually breaks Growing up is not pretty or neat  In Holden s experience  elements like profanity  alcohol and even prostitution come into play  These elements are easy to criticize  but they are part of what makes his story authentic and powerful In my opinion  it is ignorant to say that this book should be banned  Some people fail to recognize that taking away the challenging aspects of this book will take away from the truthfulness and legitimacy of the book Anyone who has lived through high school will understand elements of truth in his observations  especially about phony people and the stress of growing up  They will also understand  if being honest  that most 17 year old boys use profanity on some level  and most have been tempted by  or have abused alcohol The Catcher in the Rye may catch you off guard and make you uncomfortable  but it will give you an honest look into the mind of a struggling adolescent  And let s face it  we have all  at some point  been a Holden Caulfield  J D  Salinger s Catcher in the Rye wasn t the first young adult novel ever written  but to me  it feels like the original  the model for all YA Lit that followed  First published in the 1950s  Salinger s novel dared to be honest about so many of the emotions that people didn t want to talk about back then   and still aren t quite sure how to talk about now  It s all about teenage angst  and it communicates the pain of adolescence in such understated language that the novel is far more effective than some of the drivel that it has spawned  Of course  there are many contemporary novels that deal with the subjects of depression and anxiety in very sophisticated  impressive ways  I really appreciate the novel It s Kind of A Funny Story by Ned Vizzini  for example  and I think that the two books share certain qualities and themes  But for me  even the best  most well written contemporary novels can t hold a candle to Salinger s classic novel Maybe I adore the novel so much because I discovered Catcher when I was a senior in high school and I was starting to see society as a bunch of hypocrites and jerks  just like Salinger s main character Holden Caulfield  Maybe this is one of my favorite novels of all time because when I first read it  I was in love with a boy that shared Holden s disillusionment with the world and reacted in many of the same ways  According to Wikipedia  Catcher has  become popular with adolescent readers for its themes of teenage confusion  angst  alienation  language  and rebellion     and  the novel s protagonist and antihero  Holden Caulfield  has become an icon for teenage rebellion  But forgive me if I disagree with such a venerable source as Wikipedia  I don t think Catcher is about rebellion at all  Holden isn t trying to rebel  He s just so disillusioned with the world around him that he can t seem to get himself to tow the party line any more  Everyone wants him to fit in   go to school  get good grades  decide  where he wants to go  and get to work on getting himself there  But Holden sees all the people around him for what they really are   a bunch of  phonies    and can t bring himself to care about school  jobs and Cadillacs  This doesn t make him a rebel  though   since when are depression and apathy the same as rebellion  In the midst of his depression  Holden is too passive to be a rebel But while he remains passive  Holden is also the ultimate good guy stuck in a nightmare reality  the Humphrey Bogart of adolescent literature  the idealist turned cynic in a rotten world  He doesn t believe that there s much worth saving in adult society  but he desperately still wants to believe that children are good and innocent  That s why he treasures the memory of his younger brother Allie and respects his little sister Phoebe more than just about anyone else  That s why he wants to become the  Catcher in the Rye   He explains to Phoebe  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobyd s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean  if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  In other words  Holden wants to be a hero   but his depression has immobilized him to the point that all he can do is fantasize  he can only think about saving people in an imaginary context  He remains passive  more or less absorbing other people s speeches and insults  he has flunked out of yet another prep school and just sort of drifts back to New York City before his family is expecting him home   and that  in fact  is the entire plot of the book in a nutshell  He drifts around the city  trying to find a place to stay and things to do for a few days until his parents expect him home for Christmas vacation   but everything that happens to him just depresses him further  And so as his nightmare continues to deepen  he becomes more and more cynical  more and more frozen Ultimately  I think if Holden Caulfield is an  icon of rebellion   it s not because he s a rebel   it s because teenagers can read this book and see what will happen to them if they don t take some kind of action  Depression can just eat away at you until you become a hollow shell  a helpless pawn   and while some teenagers will shut down like Holden  others will be inspired by his misery to actively choose things that they know will upset their parents and teachers  Either way  this novel could be seen as dangerous because the main character is so vehemently opposed to the capitalistic   phony  nature of American society  But what is far more dangerous is misunderstanding or flat out ignoring the kind of frustration and depression experienced by Holden and so many teenagers in real life  This is an amazing  powerful novel because even though it doesn t provide any answers  it demands that as a society  we start looking for some  This book is great for teenagers so it would be likely used in high school  it is a good book becasue students can learn from the consequences of the main character and how he deals with it and they explain what they could and should of done differently   Here s what he  Wilhelm Stekel  said  The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   I m not trying to tell you that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world  It s not so  But I do say that educated and scholarly men  if they re brilliant and creative to begin with    tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative  They tend to express themselves more clearly  and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end  And    most important    nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker  I think it s a good reading requirement for high school students as it tackles teenage angst  confusion  and rebellion  It d be a good springboard for teachers to share his her thoughts on family values  morality  maturity  etc and a chance for students to share and explain their side  I have always enjoyed a healthy class interaction discussion and I think students of today still do You ll enjoy reading it because it s easy to read  It s graphic  It s funny  Well I think sarcasm and pessimism is funny  And it s on the list of  notoriously  controversial books  lol  Re reading after 19 years  Have to increase my stars   Fabulous  Couldn t put it down  This is a sensitive and delicate portrayal of a young man  Holden Caulfield  full of outward youthful cynicism  but inwardly in spiritual pain It begins lightly and skilfully  very witty and full of dry humour  but gradually and quite subtly you start to feel Holden s loneliness and sorrow  It unfolds very gently  the author induces the suggestion of it  well before the explicit realisation  He s a very sympathetic character  likeable  his cheeky charm leaps off the page  By the time the realisation of the depth of his unhappiness had become acute  I had a lump in my throat and an ache in my heart  And when his little sister cried for him  I cried for him  too Nevertheless  Holden is a strong character  I finished the book with a lot of admiration for him  and for JD Salinger s ability to bring him to life This is a prescribed book in high school  so for years I had wrongly looked down on it as a  kid s book   but it s really a very skilful and rewarding piece of 20th Century literature that I will no doubt read again  It s a good book for young people  explaining them to themselves  as it does  but it s also an excellent novel for those of us who may have forgotten what it was to be young  In our envy of the young  the old often overlook how much hurt  as well as strength  lies in tender young hearts  There are some great moments in here When his girlfriend s single tear falls on a square on the checker board His rage at the  Fuck You  graffitti at his sister s school  Hilarious and true All I ever hear about this book is either  Over rated   Holden is spoiled  I hate that character   I still need to read that  I mean  this book is very modest and subtle  The lead character is often vain and self important  but that is Salinger s honesty  the character is compassionate and naive as well  It is a special read  and nothing quite like it existed when it was published  If there is one thing I ve learned from reading this novel and then hearing other opinions  it s that there is no middle ground in the liking of the book  People either love it and think its a great book and Holden is an awesome character  or hate it completely thinking it s overrated and that Holden is the most irritating character ever created  I think both opinions hold merit I read this novel in high school when I was 17 and loved it from the moment I started reading it  I thought Holden s character and his general representation as a boy resisting growing up was well thought out because you could look around you and see people who acted just like him  His obsession with phonies is a side effect of seeing all these people growing up and beginning to define themselves when he is content to remain immature  However  his character is ridiculously irritating because you want to scream at him for most of the book because of his behaviour and demeanor through most of it  I think because his character is one that you both love and hate with the passion of a thousand suns is what makes him so memorable and what makes Salinger s writing so effective towards his audience I ve also discovered that the opinion of the book is often dependent on the time in your life that you read it  Most times  people who enjoy this book are those who have read it when it applies to their lives the most  perhaps the reason why it remains in High School lit  programs  and those who read it when everything is pretty stable and they re pretty well content and are only doing so because of recommendations are the ones who find Holden irritating without cause  Personally  I do think there is a little bit of Holden in all of us  Who hasn t felt frustrations about growing up and dealing with all of the  posers  in today s life  Though this may be an extreme representation  it s pretty well impossible to read through this book and not relate at least one thing that Holden goes through to your own life   Tretie perechituvannia knigi bulo varte togo  Iz original nogo vidannia  angliis koiu movoiu  bulo

get tired of   The Catcher in the Rye  is not a regular book  It s one of those rare books which will toy with your reading aptitude  chucking your mind all around the place  too full with observation and remarks that not only startle you but make you keep the book down and think about the printed words  It s a book that does not start or end perceptibly  for all I know  it could go on forever  J D  Salinger dissects human behaviour with surgical precision  and shows us how human nature is eternally sickening  and how in the most unexpected places you can discover secret troves of happiness  the only strings that connect you to the world  through the eyes of his perfectly bemused protagonist  Holden Caulfield  There s something very very very unique about this book  and strangely I cannot put a finger on it  Maybe that is why this book will remain a timeless experience  My review can be summarized to one sentence  not exciting  but very thought provoking book  I enjoyed reading this book by Salinger  however  it was true that the story had not much exciting and vivid scenario  It could be described as a boring unrealistic story  Yet  I truly enjoyed the book Holden meets all kinds of people  and I am pretty sure that any one will find similarity with at least one of the character  It might be Holden himself  one of the teachers  or maybe the mob that Holden describes  Holden looks down on everyone around him  and only person who he can love is his dead brother  He found nothing enjoyable  and he found flaws to everything  I have went through that period  and I felt something close to Holden as well as those teachers who tries to teach a lesson to him My favorite scene in this book is when Phoebe asks Holden what he wants to be when he grows up  Of course  he says  the catcher in the rye and all  which you can see that from the title  He wants to stand at the cliff s edge and grab children who don t know what they are doing and running to the cliff  he wants to save children from adult s evil doings  As a reader  we also know that Holden himself is one of the running children in the rye and who he really wants to save is he himself By reading this book  it points out to the reality and make me realize that I have no rights to look down on anyone  I don t know what will happen until I try  I might hate someone  but I might miss him or her someday  Holden is a 16 years old boy who is drinking and smoking  running away from school and family  failed 4 out of 5 classes and dropped out from three high schools  However  he used so much more time than us to think about life  He learned a lesson in a hard way  but faster way Lastly  I love the quote which Mr  Antolini brings up   wishing to die for a noble cause is the mark of the immature man  whilst it is the mark of the mature man to aspire to live humbly for one  Just I reread this book for the first time in about sixteen years  Prior to that I read it about once a year between the ages of fourteen and twenty one  Back then I loved the book for the more obvious reasons  hey  it was the early nineties the first time I read this and this book is like a  how to guide  for the Grunge Era  haha  I was uncertain as to how I d feel about it now as an adult The novel holds up  The writing is strong and Holden is still an interesting character  While I don t know that I need to read the novel again in my lifetime  I m glad that I ve had the pleasure of being able to return to it numerous times  It is rare that a book with such social significance and impact comes along  Although this book is now a classic  crafted 1951   it s message and importance is still relevant to this day  The Catcher in the Rye is the story of 16 year old Holden Caulfield  an alienated teenager searching for meaning in life  Holden s troubles range from his poor school performance to the almost maddening feelings of disgust he has toward the plethora of phony individuals that he must deal with during the course of his day to day life  The story  told from Holden s point of view  takes us through Holden s mind  as well as the locations he visits on his quest to find the meaning of his existentialist purgatory  A superbly written  concise account of the life of an outcast teen  The Catcher in the Rye  in addition to entertaining us  inspires us to think  to question our own existence and encourage ourselves to be better people through compassion and understanding of the human condition  This book is a must read  especially for teenagers  as you WILL find something in this novel that you can incorporate into your own personality  something that you can make a part of you   I reread this more than 25 years after I first read it  While it was an amazing book back in the day  reading it now through adult eyes  I was stunned how much I had clearly missed reading it when I was younger  While I think it resonates with the pre teen teenagers because of Holden s situation and feeling disengaged from school  adrift in life  without a home  I think it s only as an adult can really grasp the mental anguish he was feeling and how that could occur  I re read this because my son is reading it for school and I knew it was time to take another look at it  I m glad that I did  It s a powerful book that stays with you  I am currently thirteen years old  and I just finished reading The Catcher in the Rye last week  I really did  Recently I was asked if i wasn t a bit too young to read that book  I replied that I probably was  but that wouldn t stop me from loving it  And it won t  by the way  The Catcher in the Rye  is my new favorite book  eclipsing past favorites such as Watchmen  To Kill a Mockingbird  and The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  While I am in love with J D  Salinger s masterpiece  I find myself asking why I loved it  I think the answer is  because it feel so small  While other books try to have enormous climaxes  and clever twists  this one is content with being quiet and contemplative  Perhaps my opinion of this book will change over time  but as for now  I love this book  and there is nothing phony about that  The brilliance of this book lies in its simplicity  Since you did not write it salinger wrote it  Thats why its a masterpiece I have read this book a countless number of times  the first time reading it being the summer going into seventh grade  I originally read this because a cute boy on tumblr got a tattoo of a quote from the book  maybe I m not all yellow    What a stupid reason  I know   I don t know why that quote made me want to read this book  Maybe I thought if I read it because he liked it he d like me or something which doesn t make sense cause I don t even know him but whatever  For some reason it just did and I m so thankful for the hot tumblr boy with that tattoo  The first time reading this book I didn t understand it at all and I was so confused  I still don t think there is some kind of hidden message or moral to this book  It s basically just a story about a rotten boy named Holden who hates every phony person on this earth  and for some reason I just love this book and I have no clue why   There s a reason Cather in the Rye is the book by Salinger that everyone has read  This is easily the best of J D  Salinger s published books  It is a tour de force on at least two levels  In terms of style  the sustained  unbroken first person monologue as Holden recounts the events of his very long weekend is a masterpiece of authorial control  In terms of character creation  Holden Caulfield comes to life so memorably that many people think of him as their favorite character in literature  Salinger presents an entirely credible account of that period in the lives of many young adults when they begin to realize that most people build their lives on a foundation compounded of lies  triviality  and hipocracy  Holden s breakdown is a result of his not being able to get past this realization  Now  perhaps unfortunately  this is a theme that runs through a great deal of Salinger s small fund of published fiction  It s the same theme that the stories Franny and Zooey are built upon  It s a theme that at least underlies a lot of the short stories  Raise High the Roof Beam  Carpenters  and Seymour  An Introduction  Related to this is the way young siblings are so deeply teasured in Salinger s fiction  In Salinger s view  children still retain a purity and honesty  it seems  that are lost as we become adults  The teenager    the young adult    stands at the nexus of this transformation  At his worst  Salinger virtually deifies the child  Well  in Teddy that deification becomes literal Salinger has his shortcomings  but in Catcher he is hitting on all cylinders  writing at the top of his form  It s a magnificient achievement  I was a bit apprehensive when I first started reading the novel  Now  I can t quite write down how I feel about it  but I just know I really liked it  Trust me After looking into the analysis behind the text and the important themes such as childhood and innocence  and the symbolism of Holden s hat  I have really enjoyed discovering the deeper meaning of the text which Salinger has crafted so well  Definitely going to read again  This book has a very simple  but interesting plot  A guy named Holden was kicked out of his school  and he tries to keep it a secret from his parents by living in the streets of New York until he was supposed to head home  He was already planning on going home  and his parents knew that he was going to be home a certain day  but Holden was kicked out a few days before  so that s why he had to wait  so his parents wouldn t find out  During his stay in New York  he meets many interesting characters  such as a pimp in a hotel  and nuns at the station  Also  the reader get a view of the world from Holden s eyes as he analyzes and judges almost every person he sees  Anyone that lives a plain lifestyle and doesn t have much to care about woul like this book  Holden seems to hate everything  and he s driven crazy by the smallest characteristics of a person or place  If you re interested in a relaxed book about nothing but the adventures of a college student in the streets of New York  this is a good read   Books  especially   classic  books  are like Rorschach tests  They often reveal as much about the reader as they do the characters  I read this book shortly after my 16th birthday and I thoroughly enjoyed it  It wasn t until a decade later that I realized I was in a dwindling group of readers  I loved Holden and I loved spending time in his head  I laughed until my sides hurt at his thoughts and his antics  It never occurred to me  African American teenaged girl living in a red  square flyover  that this book could be anything but a dark comedy  I knew boys like this  The ones whose personal issues made them believe they were jaded and entitled them to be pissed off at the world  Theirs is a story often told  but this one didn t seem to take itself too seriously  yep  I thought that  I understood his sense of abandonment  his grief but those issues  I thought  made him relatable to a wider audience  ie women and minorities  lol   He was only slightly older than me  so his naivety and lack of self awareness felt like it had to be by design  He was so hilariously self absorbed and maybe a tad crazy  And his being caught up in and blinded by his privilege just felt honest  I thought it was rather nice of Salinger  who had probably been there  done that  to be a bit sympathetic in his gentle derision    making it clear that Holden was still firmly in his  coming of age  moment  Apparently  not   I still count it as a favorite  even if I had a wildly different experience from the one the author set out to provide  The Cather in the Rye by J D Salinger was the best book I ever read  In the novel it tells the story of a teenage boy  Holden Caulfield  who essentially has a mental breakdown in New York City  Holden has much baggage in his life  he is constantly being kicked out of school and moved to the next  and is still suffering from the death of his younger brother which is the catalyst to all of Holden s troubles   Holden often tries to act like an adult  but throughout the novel we can see the idea of growing up and facing change actually terrifies him  he wishes he could keep children innocent and prevent them from falling into adulthood  which is a repeated theme in the story  As Holden spontaneously travels to New York he visits and encounters many people including Sally Hayes  a girl whom he dated  Sunny  a young prostitute  his sister  Phoebe  and Mr  Antolini  one of his old teachers from a school he was kicked out of  This was a five star book in my opinion   My favorite book of all time by far as of now  I loved how J D Salinger was able to create so much symbolism throughout the whole novel  from the color red  to the idea of falling  and the ducks in the park  Each of these symbols by themselves make some sense but when you look at the book as a whole you begin to see how beautifully written and articulated this novel is because the author was able to intertwine many symbols to overarch the meaning of this book  I also loved the characters in this book  I love  love  love Holden as a character because deep down inside we can see how caring of a person he is even though he tries to suppress that side of him  I also loved his sister Phoebe as a character  This will always be a book that I remember  because it was the first book were I could understand and appreciate the work of the author    When you re a teenager  you are emotionally and physically unstable  with changes in your hormone levels and changes in your body making you cranky one day and super happy another day  You are given more responsibilities and you start to see the hidden sides of society and must prepare to accept the changes  Not many teens and even adults can cope with all the changes happening to and around them  Myself being a teen unable to cope with all the changes  I can really understand how Holden feels to an extent  However  I felt as though he was a rare case like Peter Pan where he is so unwilling to grow up and accept the changes  that he is critical of the world  The tension between innocence and experience caused by adolescence is too much to handle for him and he thinks the world and everyone in it is fake and phony  The Catcher in the Rye deals with a teenager s fears and alienation from society told from a teen s point of view and I believe it is a great book to read as a teenager as you can compare your life to Holden s  When I started reading The Catcher in the Rye  I immediately felt that Holden Caulfield was an extremely honest teen  writing openly about what he feels and spilling his personal life to us as if he needs to tell people his story  His sarcasm and the way he revealed all the  fakeness  in society really entertained me as a reader  Holden s very frustrated and critical tone suggests his struggle as a teenager  faced with many changes and the loss of his innocence due to becoming an adult  From the first page he reveals he is not happy with his brother D B  who became a screenwriter in Hollywood for the money  and labels him as  being a prostitute    pg 2  I agree that the real world is filled with corruption driven by money  power  and conspiracy but we must all grow up and mature  as we become the leaders of the future  Another theme of this book is alienation  Holden had isolated himself in an attempt to be his own savior  but as he gains his independence he gains a great need to talk to someone and have them listen to him  On page 71  Holden dances with a blonde girl older than him  but she doesn t take him seriously   What  she said  She wasn t even listening to me  She was looking all around the place   The red hunting cap Holden got for a dollar is a security blanket and a mark of individuality and independence  The red cap is the same color as his dead brother Allie s hair so Holden feels a sense of comfort and clinginess towards the cap  He wears it for protecting himself from the pains of the world and doesn t take it off even at the end of the book  Holden s fear of change is evident in his incident at the Museum of Natural History  On page 121 Holden writes   The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move        The only thing that would be different would be you   The museum presents him with a vision of life he loves  simple  idealistic and always the same  It troubles him that each time he returns to the museum he is different  while the museum remains unchanged  In his dreams Holden sees himself as the hero who saves children from falling into the corrupt world of adults  just like Peter Pan  He said to Phoebe his younger sister   I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all   As the book takes its title from this passage  this is the most important theme of the book  Holden wants to be the protector of innocence as he lost his innocence already and he doesn t wanna deal with the complexities of the world around him  His catcher in the rye fantasy reflects his innocence but on the other hand  it represents his naive vision and disconnection from reality  proving he is still immature  The Catcher in the Rye is a phenomenal book filled with a teens struggle to face the adult world and become mature  and I feel like it is a book everyone should read  especially young adults   khtb khyly khwby bwd b trjmh y khyly khwb  wq  bh aqy njfy tbrykh mygm

wqty z hmh wnyy khh zndh n hzr brm bhtrh  Catcher In The Rye   is probably the most beautiful book I ve ever read  because it s not like reading a book at all but a journal you find on a streetcorner of the craziest weekend of a yound kid s life  on the verge of a nervous breakdown  I don t think there d ever been a character as sensitive as Holden Caulfield in American literature  and probably never will be again  because he s only Sixteen or so  but seems like an old man  and even talks about having gray hairs on his crew cut head  that he hides with his hunting cap  out on a mission  He s a beautifully intellectual goofball with no pretense that he s writing a novel  and would probably hate novels for what they represented  and then hate himself for hating them  and that s what makes Holden so lovable  or detestable  because I have a feeling each succeeding generation will have a different feeling about him than I do today  but he was everything to me  But I didn t like him at first and thought Holden was either too old school  or unrelatable  to want to understand  his break down not big enought  And yet the book was a challenge and it s romantic sadness was so overwhelming at watching childhood disappear in a state of euphoria and despair  was really wild to witness in an almost journal like story  and yet the novel was too well constructed to actually be someone s journal  and Salinger managed to be Holden for over 200 pages  following his romantic despair and holy moments of knowing   How did I make Holden do so much in a night   I read Salinger saying  and it s true that he gets into an awful lot of trouble in one night  thus compacting time  and I guess that s part of the novel s genius  and what Salinger was never able to capture again  Like Joyce made Ulysses take place in a day  Salinger makes  The Catcher In The Rye   take place in a weekend  but it s such a crazy weekend  that you can t really believe it s happening  so you could say it s an action packed novel  even though nothing really happens  save someone gets kicked out of school  and has to tell their parents  an anxiety ridden event  no doubt  but Holden was already so over his hunting cap at 16 years  tears  old  that it was already par for the course I don t want to go through a list but the language of  The Catcher In The Rye   was so new and unimitable  that it makes Salinger s later work look not so good  I know the Glass Family saga of two short books   Franny and Zooey   and  Raise High The Roof Beam  Carpenters  and Seymour   are classics and I actually really enjoyed them  as a strange kind of precussor to Hesse and the Sixties spiritualists  but they are really not Holden s voice  and I don t think Salinger ever got that voice again  and I read everything by him  not much but enough  kind of like Nirvana  and no one ever sounded like Holden or had his specific anxiety without any solution  religiouis or otherwise  It might be a critical cliche but Salinger s books get much more spiritually inclined after  The Catcher In The Rye   not that Holden isn t a Saint  because he is  but he s too young to be anything  and that s his beauty  knowing that he s too young to be anything  and wanting to stay that way forever  kind of like a Peter Pan story  I read this book with the burgundy cover  and the ochre letters spelling out  The Catcher In The Rye   first in 8th grade  and then in 10th grade  and liked it much more in 10th girade  but I wanted to desperately understand it in 8th grade because my Stepdad reccomended it to me as some kind of test thinkijng I d love it and that was quite an expectation  since I didn t even read back then  plus I knew it was considered an important book  and I woiuld say when I read it for Katherine McGovern  it was the most closely I d ever read anything  and when I got to the end of him at the merry ground  it was such a pure beatiful lyric I just let it be  and I remember Holden saying   Don t ever tell anyone anything  The thing is you start missing everyone  even Old Maurice  or Stradlater      or something like that  and Holden s sadness at just getting older and having to leave childhoold behind is painfully poetically profound  because he s in a lot of pain  and I really felt for him  but Holden was fictional  so I wanted to feel like him  and be him  in a way I never have with another character in literature  He was me  and I was him  and I had to understand him to understand me  not that he d make me smarter  but he was my reflection  sent to be me  in all my most private pain and humor  like a journal  and yet      Holden s story is just too complex to find in central park  left by the water fountain  I just read a critic who shrunk this book down to Salinger s war experience  and that Holden was nothing but a sublimation of Salinger s trauma from D Day  and the smell of  rotting fles that never leaves you   and I ll admit it s an interesting conceit to imagine that Salinger was clever enough to realize that the World War II novel was already a cliche  and there were only one or two great ones  and lots of mediocritites  and he s certainly been changed by the war  and this is often overlookes when looking at his life  because he was from a wealthy family on the upper west side  like the Glass characters he was later to write about  and that Holden is  but Holden Caulfield is so much rawer than that Glass characters  it s hard to compare  It s almost like Salinger had set off his own nuclear bomb with Holden s anxiety and love  and had to off set it with a more structured religious path to be found in his later works  and in light of Holden  this makes snese  because Holden Caulfield was his own kind of nuclear bomb  setting off explosions in young men for generations to follow  and a couple of big assasins even claiming that they were inspired by the book to kill John Lennon  and someone else I can t remember right now  Reagan   but in a way it makes sense  because everyone was a phony to Holden  and what he feared the most was becoming the phony he hated  so he was kind of saving himself in his  catcher in the rye  Robert Burns fantasy of literally being a  catcher in the rye  running around and catching the lost souls  like an outfielder with a big mitt catching pop up after pop up  I m not sure what to say about the book and I don t really feel like breking it down structurally  because I not only read it twice in high school  but got so familiar with the novel  that the cliff note s version had its own kind of charm  believe it or not  and poetry though Holden would ve hated that  I d like to think I was like Holden Caulfield  or that I did as much as him in a night  compacting time in a 200 page novel  with dreams and action  yet nothing happens  except that Holden finally goes home but the apartment is dark and his parents are either sleeping or they are out  and again he feels like a strangerin his hometown  uncomfortable and foreign in his own home  a great scene  but more than that he feels himself changing and this is what scares him the most  because he doesn t want anything to change  He hung out with his sister  Phoebe  who he loves more than anything in the world and has a horrible fear for her corruption and then the book basically ends but he meets pimps  nuns  and prostitutes  and has a date with a girl he hates and simutltaneoulsy wants to marry and take away from New York City  I just read a biography of Salinger and I d say what partly makes the book is that he finished it at thirty and it was his great send off to his youth  like my novella is  but not as good as Holden  Nothing will ever be as good as Holden  and his shaky voice and vernacular and what it meant on July 16th  1951  when it was published  and Holden Caulfield was born  He literally created the word  phony   and I think  lousy   Holden Caulfield was the great unrealized artist in every upper middle class lost American youth in all his blazing glory  and God rest his soul   there will never be another  Catcher In The Rye   and I m gald they haven t made a movie of it  and I m such an asshole I m the guy that usually likes the movie better than the book  but not this time  it just wouldn t be possible  though they could make a good movie  like they just finally did for  On The Road   but the whole book is in Holden s head and he s not romanticizing anyone like Keroauc is with Dean Moriarty in  On The Road   plus the characters in  On The Road   are way past Holden s age  young men out of the house  not failing out of boarding school  and capturing a snapshot of the moment  I m not so sure Holden s monolugue literally has the Catholic priest feeling of Kerouac s  though both stories have a lot of action  and a sense of compacted time  but the  Catcher  more self consciously so  because the book was unabashedly fiction  just a new kind that was borrowing on themes of the day  but popularizing them  Kerouac admits at the beginning of  On The Road  that he is remembering his life  and what happened to him to lead him to the gloomy death feeling of his divorce  a very adult moment  even if a young adult  and Holden was a teenager Stylistically  I d like to say a book had never been constructed like it before because it was kind of like a dream  even though it was real  and a very bad dream because the dean of Holden s school tells him  he s in for a very bad fall   and this always haunted me  and made me fear for Holden  and what makes him so special is that even though he s going throuigh a routine crisis failing out of school  he s doing it in sort of an exalted manner  because no one thinks he s failing out because he s stupid  and no one really understands why it s happening  least of all Holden  I want to say a voice like Holden s had never existed in American literature  because it was first person confessional autobiographical  but Salinger made up the scneario  I m pretty sure   and changed Holden s name from his  and both of these acts were defiant acts of the fiction writer  but still it had the feeling that you were reading a journal  and not many works have this      I think Rimbaud s  Season In Hell   may have had this feeling  but that was a prose poem  and then years later  The Basketball Diaries   almost felt like the  Catcher In The Rye   but that was a rare example of the journal that could ve been Holden s journal of his epic sadness and fear at the onlslaught of adulthood that somehow Jim Carroll wrote and that he could never repeat  because I don t even think he knew what he was doing  and this makes  The Basketball Diaries   a rare accidental work of genius without any pretense  save that Carroll may have thought it would be  groovy  to have his journal found when he had a needle in his arm and to be a literary star since he was conscious of his talent  but I m supposing  and don t know  I don t think anyone had ever spoken in Holden s gutteral yet intellectual way until Holden  and been so proudly anti social but still in love with the world in a way that it would take a poet to explain because he saw time slipping away from him and not everything could stay frozen like he wanted the trip to the natural history museum to be  always the same as when he was 12 and it was perfect  because in the compacted space of a weekend Holden goes on a journey through his past  and this becomes as much of the story as his present  and in this way Salinger compacts time  It all makes sense too because he s kiicked out of boarding school and forced to go home as a stranger  and thus sees the City from a stranger s perspective  and yet Holden is anything but a stranger to the City  and this gives the novel a uniquely alienating quality that his other work was missing  however well written and moving  Holden is literally a stranger in a strange land in the story  and yet he s home  and should feel welcome  but he s seeing a side of New York he never saw in the security and comfort of childhood  almost taking a  walk on the wild side   in the words of Lou Reed  It s also this feeling that gives Holden s reflections into his past a particularly eerie feeling  because he s as much of a stranger to it as he is to the present  only empahsizing what an outsider he has become  even to his own memories   This is a brilliant novel from the 50s because the story is so honest and believable  Every man can relate to the young adolescent Holden  a drop out from school who is depressed and swearing all the time because we too went through our turbulent years of adolescence when we experienced our first loves and heart breaks and seeking direction in our directionless life  We follow Holden s adventures while he loiters around New York City for a few days and become more drawn in by his character as we got to know him  While he may have flunk school  and has no ambition to be a successful lawyer or doctor  he has something more important   a good heart  He is compassionate to people like nuns on the street and his teachers and he cares for children and unfortunate school mates  He loves his siblings and will do anything to protect them  His dreams of a field of rye where there are many kids playing amongst the rye  Holden stands on the edge of the rye field so that he can catch any kids running towards the cliff on the edge of the field of rye so that they don t fall off  It is refreshing to read about people who don t dream of making quick money on Wall Street  drive fast cars and score on women  Don t die for the cause  but live humbly for the cause  This is the awesome parting advice from an ex teacher of Holden whom he thinks is the teacher is a stilt  I LOVED this book  It was right up my alley  basically Salinger sums up tha way I feel about adolescence  but also refers to many unanswered questions I have about growing up  What made me like this book so much was the fact that Holden was as lost as I am  so it made me feel like I m not alone  It also sparked many conversations among my friends and me  which made me realise that some of them were feeling the same way as well  But obviously some of them hated it  which I kind of understand  I mean  not everybody feels the same way about their teenage years  You either hate this book  or you love it  I m definitely reading this again in a couple of years or so  J D  Salinger s novel The Catcher in the Rye is narrated entirely from the point of view of sixteen year old Holden Caulfield  a 16 year old by who is trying to find his way in the world of adults after being kicked out of boarding school  Holden s fear about becoming a man is visible from the beginning  He is a cynical  immature teenager who is full of angst  The novel begins when Holden is kicked out of an expensive boarding school and takes place for about four days as he takes the train back to his home in New York City and encounters other characters  Holden Caulfield is not likable   he is pessimistic  smokes frequently  and uses foul language in nearly every sentence  He is also an unreliable narrator  Holden is arrogant  self centered  and blames the world for his mistakes Salinger really makes the novel interesting because whatever is on Holden s mind comest out in the story  This makes it more realistic and easy to relate to how Holden is feeling  The author voice also helps visualize Holden  other characters  and the environment around him  The Catcher in the Rye is a great book because besides just telling about the life of Holden  we also learn life lessons from it  For example   You don t know what you got until it s gone   After being expelled  Holden finds himself missing the company his two roommates  Ackley and Stradlater  who he despised back in boarding school  Overall  The Catcher in the Rye is a classic that is great for its style of writing  Salinger s voice  and the way you can easily relate to the book  I give the book 4 5 5   The first time I got my hands on this book  I read it all in one sitting  This time  though  I made sure to take my time on really immersing myself into Holden s world and actually understanding what he s saying  It wasn t at all difficult though  I actually find it really weird how the first time  I didn t really connect much to this book  I liked it  but I was sort of isolated from it in some way  Maybe it helped that I have become utterly lost myself  I still am  to be honest  although I like to think I m on my way out  finally  I highlighted the hell out of Mr  Antolini s advice   view spoiler  It bummed me out how Salinger just had to spoil his character  though     hide spoiler  I gave it five stars the first time  I must have liked it a lot  Years later and I still think The Catcher in the Rye deserves no less than a perfect rating  Heck  I would give it six stars if I could  This book is definitely one of my favorites  even if a lot of people think it s a phony thing to say  Words are not enough to describe how good this book is  Truly deserves to be called a classic  The book is just two days of a high school kid s life  And Salinger captures at least one incident from every reader s life  All the confusion  all the hasty decisions a high school kid takes  his way of thinking  his frivolous nature is capture and beautifully put in one book  A must read   Smashed through this book  never wanted to put it down I find it comforting when a book makes you feel less isolated  It s easy to see why this book is consider required reading If you ever felt like you were born to go against the grain  you will feel right at home in Holden s world   One day while staying with my mom I picked up this book off her shelf and just started reading  It blew me away how good this book is  Who hasn t felt how the characters feel    I really loved this book    like alot  It was really quirky and I thought Holden Caulfield was the perfect character  At first when I was reading it  I kind of was  in his mind   thinking the way he was in certain situations he ran into without questioning what he thought his actions  But near the end I realized that honestly  if he was my roomate or I went to school with him he would be as annoying as heck  He s practically that other egotistical  full of themselves person you know  or if your older  new  in your youth  He thinks he s a genius but he has no perception whatsoever   Highly recommend  R I P  JD Salinger  P S   Before he died  I asked my dad if he was still alive  He said   Yep  91 and still suing people for using unauthorized quotes of his work   From the reviews I ve read thus far  it seems that there are two general schools of thought on Holden  which affect the readers  views on Salinger and the validity of TCITR in the american literary canon  Some readers seem to see Holden as either a hero  agreeing with his thoughts and views of people and the world  The other group finds him to be an adolescent with no valid thoughts who eventually ends up in a mental hospital as a way to escape his transformation to adulthood Both schools of thought ignore the fact that Holden Caulfield is incredibly insane  He does not suddenly find himself in a mental institution  The story is such a straight line progression to the point of absolute madness that I could not predict anything else for the ending except for suicide Holden is lost in his mind  He has all these thoughts about people and the world  many of which ARE absurd or adolescent  but cannot relate any of those thoughts to the people with whom he interacts  When more mature characters bring up subjects which Holden had been contemplating to himself previously in the story  He can not relate any of his thoughts to those individuals  If he had  they could have discussed the subjects  and his skewed views could have been straightened over the course of time  Instead  he reverts to immature subjects  never touching on society  the subject he most contemplates in his own mind  Because He has no feedback on his most contemplated subject  his ideas about that subject become more and more jaded  By the end of the story  he is so far removed from what is real that he has become like a child and can only relate to a child  His world then becomes almost like a dream world The instance where the teacher wakes him up in the middle of the night NEVER EVEN HAPPENED  The scene before he goes to bed is a kind of moral of the story this is where you are so far  Read that part again then try to open your mind and start this from the beginning To get a good hold on this book  I think its necessary to read it in one sitting  That way  you can t escape Holden s mind  You are stuck there with nowhere to go but crazy  Enjoy  It s a fun trip  This book is not phony  Although after finishing this novel  I felt incomplete  blank  All the feelings I empathized with Holden were so raw and close to what I felt  when it ended with  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody  WHAT IS THIS  I CAN T TALK TO ANYONE  I JUST HAVE TO LIVE OUT MY LIFE ALONE    I MEAN THE INTERNET HAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER MY LIFE NOW I CAN T EVEN CONTACT OTHER BEINGS Life is hard   Then again    All these contradictions  loneliness and  phoniness  that Holden observes in the world are simply elements of life  I think because this novel is so honest it made me cringe  But a cringe worthy book to read Like Holden  I have no fucking clue what I want to do in the future  So I guess    I will also be the  catcher in the rye  to hopefully inspire and influence others around me  Ah  the aspirations of an artist   I apologize for the corny review    hych wqt bh hychgy chyzy ngw gh bgy dlt br hmh tng myshhb d yh df h Hss wHshtnkhy bhm dst dd hr wqt khh my rsydm sr yh chh rh w pm rw my gdhshtm tw

but I really think reading this as a senior in high school would have been awesome  Why wasn t this assigned in high school  Such a shame  Poor  poor Holden Caulfield  That kid has a lot of things to sort through  I felt bad for him and I even understood some of his angsty teenage thoughts  The parts that resonated most with me were the ones that involved memories of Allie  I loved the descriptions of his baseball glove  I really enjoyed this book  I feel like there is a lot of depth to it and I bet I will be thinking about it for a long time  I adore this book  everything about it  I ve read it so many times and it s always relevant  I especially love the stylistics of the writing  the minimization of language  use of passive voice  the occasional present tense sentences    He s dead now  is such a gut puncher  That present tense  he hasn t passed away or he didn t die he IS dead  The writing is amazing  The incorrect comma that feels oddly correct is brilliant   The Cather in the Rye is a story of a boy named Holden Caulfield when he drops out Pencey prep school in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  He leaves and goes on an adventure and talks a lot of shit about people  One of the things I love most about Holden is the fact that he is straight forwarded  sarcastic and makes me laugh while I read   That s a HUGE thing   Holden doesn t really do anything productive and is  the bad seed  of the family  His parents are rich  his older brother writes children s book and his little sister Phoebe who he is really close to is still in school  In the end of all the booze  and drugs Holden finds himself stuck in a place he can t get out of   My favorite part on the book  honestly  was when Holden was walking past the curbs on the streets and hoping that he would still live after passing them Something about that seems kinda relatable  in a way  The whole book itself was kind of relatable  if you ask me  When Holden kept saying that a lot people were a bunch of phonies  I have to say I felt the same way IDK  It just feels so heart warming    I guess  And I liked it a lot  I may be in love with Holden Caulfield   Or I may be his twin  Haven t figured it out yet  but it is definitely one of the two  I see Salinger s novel as one of the most honest books I ve ever read  It s how I feel a lot  just like Holden  People may say that is immature or that he is just a complainer  but the problem is is that Holden is just afraid to grow up  Who isn t  Besides  my life being like his in some aspects  I can see why  Don t you ever wanna run away sometimes  That s all Holden wants  He wants to be himself and do what he wants and not have everyone expecting so goddam much from him  I think this is a masterpiece  J D  gets it  I tried to read all the classics of modern literature before I graduated high school  Of course  I felt strongly for poor depressed Holden  It s hard to imagine him making it into adulthood  isn t it  Well  then  Now an SSRI and some focused counseling should get him through his grief and back to a point where every single thing in life isn t spoiled  Great coming of age story with lots of symbolism  I love it and have read it over and over again  My daughter read it and didn t care for it though  My thinking on this is that the character probably appeals more to males than females  I am sure I will read it again sometime though  The literary precursor to Southpark   When Holden cracked the piano  beer began to bleed and a darling star burst a high ball rolling through the blind eyes of a transvestite catching the rear window of a lost soul running away from commitments through all the fields of grain   This was a book that has gotten me through some bad times  I think I loved Holden for being utterly unlike me in personality  but for still having a hopelessly sympathetic character  I could relate to the disappointment   confusion he feels as adults try    fail  to excite   engage him  if not by their stuffy   sober adult demeanor then certainly by revealing the secrets   fallacies of adult life  whether intentionally or not  I took this book from my school once  a battered  decaying copy    read it a lot as a kid  I once scribbled a dangerous note on the inside of that very same copy years later as an adult  slipped it under the eyes of authority to a loved one in an extremely harrowing moment  code inside the words on the yellowed pages   I decided to re read this book being that it was one of my favorites in high school  I m about 2 3 of the way through now and it s funny how a few years can totally change your perspective on something  First of all  I ve read more and seen more classic movies so this time I around I understand a lot more of the references to popular culture in the late 1940s as well as the popular literature references  I m also finding Holden s obsession with phony s really interesting  He s obviously rejecting the world he comes from  yet at the same time doesn t want to be  poor   I do agree with Holden about A Farewell to Arms  something did ring  phony  about that book in my opinion  unlike Hemingway s other novels  As Mr  Antolini points out  Holden is just disgusted with human behavior  but contrary to his belief  he is reacting to it in an immature manner At the end of the book I don t think we ve ever really learned if he has learned how to deal with it better  This book only became my favorite after several re readings and after reading most of Salinger s other stories  Salinger s other work heightens the importance of The Catcher in the Rye as you realize which of his family members this book is about  I would highly recommend reading Franny   Zooey  Raise High the Roof Beams  Carpenters  and Seymore and even the Bhagavad Gita after reading Catcher the 1st time and right before reading it the 2nd time  Doing this offers tremendous insight into the character of Holden Caulfield and  I think  enriches the messages that Salinger is trying to convey  This book in particular reminds me of The Metamorphosis in that you realize at the end that perhaps it s more about protecting the innocence of   coming of age of the central character s sister than the central character himself  I also think that this book is the link between the movie The Graduate and the choice of its Simon   Garfunkle soundtrack  and I m fairly certain that Sounds of Silence alludes strongly to Holden and the book and highlights their common theme  I love this book  and here s one of the reason s why Holden is initially an extremely obnoxious and whiny character  Then he keeps slipping things from his past into his narrative  Oh  by the way  this horrible thing happened to me once   story story story  Oh  and yeah  this one time  this OTHER horrible thing happened to me   Until finally  you re thinking to yourself   Why the heck did I judge him so harshly before   and you want to go out and hug everyone who has ever annoyed you ever It s pretty heavy and depressing  but it s really beautiful and relevant and true  Love it  Many think the book has no true purpose but personally I found the book very relatable and deeply symbolic  To me  it was a story about trying to find your place in the world which is something that everyone has gone through at some point  I found myself loving the quote  The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one  and in the end  I think that s the significance of the story  It wasn t about the ending  it was about the journey there  For most of the book  you see Holden depressed and crying out for help  He wants to run away and isolate himself from the world  Watching Phoebe ride around in that carousel  Holden found a reason  a cause to live for  He grew up  His wanting to protect Phoebe  save the children on the cliff of rye  that was his purpose   Reread Funny the things that push you into doing the things that you always had the intention of doing but kept putting off  When I heard of J D  Salinger s death  I was very much affected and could think of nothing else but picking up Catcher for a reread  After 12 years of sitting here since my first reading  it was long overdue to be picked up I could list a million things that I picked up on my reread that were ironic  tragic  fitting   you name it  in light of Salinger s death  but it seems that most people beat me to the postmortem punch  I ll just say that even though I was deeply saddened by the loss of a literary icon  I was very much grateful to have the excuse  however morbid  of curling up with one of my favorite books   and what may just be the quintessential Great American Novel Viva la Holden 1st Reading  Fall 19972nd Reading  January 30  2010  Holden commences the book at the end of his school year  The year has concluded and they have made if evident that Holden is not desired on the campus any longer  It seems as if he becomes a lost soul that yearns for nothing and wishes to do nothing with the remaining years of his existence  It takes a lovely little girl to sway his perception and realize that one should live their lives  Live their lives to the fullest extent   The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move        Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   This particular quote from the book quickly obtained my attention  It implies and infers so much of Holden s characteristics  He highly appreciates the museum due to the fact that it remains frozen  silent  and remains just as it always has been and always will be  The fact that he appreciates these attributes show he is not fond of change  or the confusion presented in the worldOverall this was an amazing book  It underlines the negativity that many feel and show that to live your life one must possess a grand perception and suggests a message that all have not and never will receive  life is what you make of it  Anything you want is there  and is for your taking  I gave this book five stars due to the fact that the message imbedded within is uplifting and vital   The type of book that you wish were a person so you could marry it and live the rest of your life with  Every detail of this book is relatable  The protagonist is someone you can t help but falling in love with  A must read for every single person I highly recommend it   I absolutely loved this book  It s one of my favorites  and one of the best I ve ever read  I loved how even when there s not much action in it  Holden s thoughts are interesting and really make the story become alive  He has a very realistic yet unintentionally hilarious way of speaking  so I didn t think it was a pretentious book  unlike many other  classics  I ve read   I found I could relate to Holden very much  And not because I thought he was the same as I am  but because I saw in myself some of his traits  He s not a hero   at least not the typical hero anyway   because he s a more realistic kind of person  We don t have to have lived everything he did to find him relatable  so that s why I think everyone finds at least one thing they can relate to  And maybe this one thing is not a good thing  so that s what brings people to hate Holden and consequently hate the book  which is the same that happens with Holden  He hates things in others that he finds in himself  whether conscious or unconsciously   such as phoniness I was very reluctant to reading this book at first because I thought it would be a pretentious story about a pretentious teenager with emotional problems  very much like  The Perks of Being a Wallflower   which I absolutely hated  I found it to be quite the opposite  I do think  though  that you have to read it when you re the appropriate age to enjoy it and understand it  I don t mean  understand it  as in finding an occult meaning and symbols to things  I don t believe in that  No  understand it as in knowing that all the cursing isn t the core of the book  knowing the thoughts and emotions he s going through  and having been though that and having done the whole process of reflecting on those things  Only after that do you really get Holden and start to see him in yourself The story is wonderful and it does you good when you finish reading it  It makes you think  not only about the story  but also about your life  and you learn valuable life lessons from Holden s experiences  Without the book s intention being that of a self help book  I give it 6 out of 5 stars     I can t believe I waited so long to read this book   It was GREAT  I never knew what it was about either so I dove into it blindly  never had to read it in High School like many people  This 17y o guy Holden is hilarious and created a laugh out loud moment for me on nearly every page  He makes complete sense during most of his rants but tells his story while in the looney bin  Im guessing no one else agrees with me on that  The book is written over about a 4 or 5 day period of time while Holden waits to show up at home and tell his parents that he has been kicked out of school AGAIN  Fabulous book  and if you read it in HS  read it again  I am certain you will love it now   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   Salinger makes you feel like you are having a conversation with Holden  and that he is a young friend of yours  I laughed all the way through this novel  Perfect   The first time I read this I was 14 or 15  probably 14 going on 15  We had just moved to this super small town in a midwestern state that seemed to be miles from civilization  One afternoon I went to their local  library   which was really just a house  and I found J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye and immediately wanted to check it out  The librarian  a tiny  ancient looking woman in a floral dress  refused to let me check it out   on account of the swear words and mentions of unmentionale things  sex  prostitution  pimps  suicide  etc    I assured her that my mom didn t really care what I did  let alone what I read and it would be fine  She begrudgingly handed it over and I took it home and read it  And then I read it again  And then I read it again  because Holden Caufield knew exactly  exactly  what I was feeling  I mean  I had just moved to this 4 H town full of phonies who thought they were so smart and cool and who really drove me crazy  I was the only kid in my class who didn t have a curfew  seriously  my mom didn t care about me at all   so many of my nights went as Holden s did   me trying to find someone to hang out with or someplace to go or just something to do so that I wouldn t have to go home  Man  the only time ol  Holden got on my nerves was when he d complain about living in New York  Try living out here in the middle of nowhere  Holden  This book meant so much to me then that I copied an entire paragraph out of it for a handwriting analysis a teacher did for me   A teacher taking time during the day to do a personality test via my handwriting  That in itself blew me away   then and now  This is the crazy place we moved to   When I received the results  I knew she was a phony because everything she wrote condradicted itself  When I showed the results to a boy I loved  he was gracious and overwhleming and wanted to know where the paragraph came from  No one in that town read  God I hated the town  The people there just drove me crazy I just finished re reading this  I am 30  years old now and I can remember exactly  exactly  how I was feeling when I read this so long ago  This time  I found myself wavering between fond recollections of my first reading and my near annoyance with Holden   I swear I m getting closer and closer to that  get off my lawn  stage in life   And  wow  just wow  what must that little old librarian thought of me after I strong armed this book away from her and into my pubescent hands But really  J D  Salinger captured perfectly  perfectly  that arrogance of youth and the absolute self absorption of teenagers  It s such a great book  I think because Holden is growing up and he s realizing it  and trying to come to terms with it and that  that is the best time to read this    Sa le anitre che stanno in quello stagno vicino a Central Park South  Quel laghetto  Mi saprebbe dire per caso dove vanno le anitre quando il lago gela  Lo sa  per caso   E noi  Dove possiamo rifugiarci noi  quando una raggelante incomunicabilita ci rivela estranei a tutto e tutti e ci consegna a un intensissima nostalgia per un mondo che ormai ci appare inabitabile  come un lago ghiacciato  Non so se esista un rifugio per gli inverni dell esistenza  Ma se ci fosse  so che mi piacerebbe  almeno li  poter scambiare due parole con un tipo come Holden Caulfield  E mi piacerebbe da matti incontrarvi la piccola  immensa  Phoebe  E mi raccomando  Phoebe  se ricordando una poesia  o una canzone  dovessi sbagliare una parola  anche soltanto una parola  tu dimmelo Poi magari facciamo finta di niente  Ma tu dimmelo  Che la bellezza va custodita  Soprattutto in certi inverni     I pesci non vanno in nessun posto  Restano dove sono  i pesci  Proprio in quel dannato lago    Ma i pesci    e un altra cosa  I pesci sono un altra cosa  Io sto parlando delle anitre    lG

khms njwm     People say that one gleans a different meaning from The Catcher in the Rye in subsequent re readings over the years  Not having read it before I can t say that I ve experienced this effect  however  I can see why this might happen  While I was reading I was actually a bit suspicious that Salinger was actually aiming to make his book universally relatable  He seems to cover everything  depression  school  jealousy  self esteem  alcohol  first literary drunk dialing    sex  relationships  the military  religion  family  enough that anyone can find some subject with which they can connect  It doesn t detract from the story  because our protagonist  Holden Caulfield  seems to just stumble across each topic In fact  one of the reasons I enjoyed the book so much is because I was just following behind Holden as he  sometimes painfully  went about his life  While Salinger undoubtedly had an agenda  I feel like the story was influenced by Holden more than the other way around  like he created the character and let the novel revolve around him  Now  I will say that if you haven t had extensive experience with depression either with yourself or someone close to you some of Holden s reactions will seem contrived by Salinger  but I promise you  his abrupt  drastic mood swings and confusion are very true to life I don t know if there s any reason for the prominence of his physical sickness near the end of the story from a thematic viewpoint  but I suppose it does add to his list of misfortunes and the suspense of what he ll do in response to them  I was a little surprised by how quickly the book ended  but I don t think it was a bad ending  And in that spirit  I think I m done here  After all  I don t want to risk being an intellectual phony  now do I  Every time I read this book  I talk like Holden for a week or so   It was hard to get into in the beginning  he just came off as an over privileged brat  I almost couldn t stand all the angst and professed to my husband once as I read this  thank God I m not a teenager anymore   He seemed snooty  but actively condemned others for their own superficiality  Slowly layers and patterns pointed to a lonely boy on the cusp of adulthood  which is beautifully portrayed by Holdens character  I almost cried for Holden when he described himself as a catcher in the rye  essentially saving children from adulthood and  phoniness   a world that Holden wants desperately to alienate himself from  I appreciated thoroughly that  in the end  his problems were dealt with in a serious matter  my heart would have broken for him had such a smart and scared boy been swept under the rug and passed onto a different school  again  I think everyone should give this book a try  you might hate it  but  as I told my husband when he asked why I was reading something that I didn t seem to enjoy in the beginning  I won t know if I like it until the end    I sort of loved it  It really reminded me of The Fault in Our Stars and To Kill a Mockingbird and also Perks of Being a Wallflower  I like to read intimate stories by children  youngsters  Basically something very true  honest  unspoiled    Although I did not read it for a class  I consider this to be my favorite book I read in high school  I m not sure that I m very alike Holden  but I know that I definitely found a friend in him during my senior year  At first you would be forgiven for thinking that you had to be the same age as Holden Caulfield to be able to relate to this book   perhaps this is why it is on so many school reading lists  This would be a mistake though  Everyone will be able to have a relationship with Holden regardless of whether or not they can relate directly with his situation  For me  I read the book from the point of view of a parent and my overwhelming feeling was one of sadness for this child who was so desperate  Had my sixteen year old self been reading it then my relationship would have been completely different  I would recommend everyone to read this book as it is bound to provoke a reaction  You shouldn t expect to empathise with Holden  although of course you might  but you can t escape being affected by his narrative and learning something of what it is like to be a teenager trying to find their way in a big and confusing world  It is as powerful now as it was when first published over 50 years ago  Though  The Catcher in the Rye  had been on my to read list for a long time  it was having it as an option for a coursework text that pushed me into finally getting round to reading it  and I m so glad I did  The comparison essay I had to do was a blessing to this novel  allowing me to explore in depth the themes  symbols and emotions Salinger writes about  Many of my friends have criticized its lack of proper storyline  but to me the novel is about so much more than that  My heart broke for Holden and while he irritated me at times  that is the sign of a well developed and life like character The novel is a classic  exploring timeless themes like growing up and childhood innocence It also deals with the affects grief can have on the child  The impact of of death on those left behind  The consequences of war both for the soldiers and those at home  The American Dream  Isolation and conforming to the lives society has dictated  Living with the constant threat of not just danger  but mutually assured destruction   I feel like any review I write won t do Salinger or his book justice  And I know that those who ve already read it and disliked it won t be convinced otherwise by me  I don t identify with Holden  But I do feel this book is about so much more than just the visible storyline  There is more to the text than what is written on the page  and the novel isn t just a classic because it is provides understanding of the literature  and the culture  and the lives of post War Americans  It s the stuff between the lines that makes it a novel worth reading  And that stuff there  in my opinion  is pure gold dust  great book  like haddon mark s This was a book I read for school and it has quickly become an old stand by  It helps my rebellious side that this in now a banned book too   D In any case  this is a story about mental illness in a time when such a thing was bound to end up with a person put in a sanitarium  It has some of the best quotes in literature and some of the funniest situations  all while dealing with a very serious topic  It sucks you in so well  that you don t even realize until after finishing the novel the first time what the message was  It comes from left field  It s another one of those novels that has you so fooled during the reading of it that you don t even realize that there is something wrong with the character you identify with until the last page  An incredible  amazing book that everyone needs to put on their list of books to read before they die   Mengapa buku ini disukai para pembunuh   Tulisan ini terpapang di cover belakang buku The Cathcer in the Rye terjemahan bahasa Indonesia  cetakan yang terakhir  Yap  kita semua tau Mark David Chapman telah membunuh John Lennon beberapa saat setelah ia meminta sang idola untuk menandatangi buku ini  begitu pula John Hinckley  Jr  yang membunuh President Ronald Reagan karena terinspirasi dari buku tersebut  The Catcher in The Rye tidak eksplisit mengajarkan bagaimana cara cara membunuh  Bahkan memotivasi pun tidak  namun saya percaya orang orang itu semua dirasuki Emosi berlebihan yang secara tidak langsung di hantarkan lewat buku ini  Untuk menjadi Pemarah bacalah buku ini   7 years ago when I read this book  I was more taken by the unfiltered cussing in its pages  Then I thought  hey this author s cool Seeing it again now  I am struck by its message of purpose  I want to be a catcher in the rye  What rye is to me  is my purpose in life In JD Salinger s words  Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   I read this years ago when I was a teenager and thought I would check in and see my old pal Holden Caulfield now that I am 55  It is really astonishing to me to read the reviews for this book and see other people who loved this book when they were in their teens and feeling as mixed up and confused as Holden but when they get older and re read it  they sharply criticize him for being immature and mixed up  wondering why he isn t seriously academic and sure of what he wants for his future  making plans for a career  and working already  They want this 17 year old to be as mature as they are now  conveniently forgetting that they weren t so sure of themselves nor mature when they were 17  Fortunately  I have kept in touch with the reality of adolescence by working with kids of this age as well as being a mother  I can cut Holden some slack because I have come to understand him even better now than I did when I was his age  I feel for him and    I like him What do I like about Holden Caulfield  I like quite a few things  Here are a few of them  1  He loves books and loves to read quality writing  As a bookish teen who loved to read good literature and write creatively  I appreciate a teenaged boy who loves the same  In fact  while he was flunking everything else at his exclusive private school  where he was bored   he was an A student in English  About good books Holden said   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   Exactly   2  He feels a deep love for his family and can be vulnerable about them  His brother Allie  two years younger than him but  fifty times as intelligent  died of leukemia when Holden was 13  As a boy raised in mid 20th century America  Holden was expected to be tough and not cry  Instead  he went to the garage and broke out the windows with his bare fist  broke his hand  and cried himself to sleep  He responded with pain and rage at the loss of his beloved brother and now 4 years later at private school  he had Allie s left handed fielder s mitt that had poems written all over it with him as a way of keeping a part of his little brother with him and even wrote a touching essay about the glove  He adores his 10 year old sister Phoebe and respects her  All of his many descriptions about her make her sound wonderful  When he ran away from school after being told they were expelling him  he made a point of wanting to see Phoebe and going to visit her  When she lent him her last  8 which was for buying Christmas presents  he sat down and cried at the generosity of a 10 year old sister who would lovingly give him her last dollar so he could stay somewhere until he could return home  He doesn t just love Phoebe  he respects her  That is not something you always see in a teenaged boy  3  He cannot and will not have sex with a girl unless he feels love for her  He even turned down a hooker for this reason and didn t have sex with girls he could have slept with  Clearly the boy has morals and standards  4  His morals and respect for girls extend to girls he doesn t know  When Holden met with a guy he used to go to private school with for a drink  he inquired about the guy s old girlfriend and what she was doing now  When the guy said she was  the whore of New Hampshire   Holden got angry and said   That isn t nice  If she was decent and nice enough to let you get sexy with her  you at least shouldn t talk about her that way   Most boys would just snicker and go along with what he said and maybe make a snarky remark about her too but not our Holden  For girls he does know  he stands up to disrespect for them  He had known a girl named Jane and hated it that his roommate Stradlater was taking her out on a blind date  She had lived a hard life with an abusive stepfather and Holden had comforted her when she cried and played checkers with her  He feared Stradlater  known for having sex with girls and using them  would use Jane  When he returned from the date  Stradlater acts as if he tried with Jane and Holden physically jumps him  screaming  You don t even know if her first name is Jane or Jean  ya goddamn moron    Stradlater called her Jean    5  His observational skills and and wit are that of a future professional writer  For example  his school roommate Stradlater was preening in a mirror as he shaved and Holden said   The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself   He makes a lot of witty comments the rich  guys  girls  and life in general   6  He is honest  he is 17 and on the cusp of adulthood  trying to maneuver through adolescence  and admits he does not have all the answers  he is unsure of what path he wants to follow  and freely admits that on some days he feels 12 or 13 and just wants to be a carefree kid again  I really enjoyed my time with Holden again and think it won t be so many years before I get together with him again  Don t be so hard on the kid  He is trying to grow up and it is hard to be caught between childhood and adulthood with new expectations thrown at you and trying to figure out life  sex  relationships  and what you want to do and be for the rest of your life  You were once in his shoes  Have you forgotten what it was like   It s my first time to write a ACTUAL book review If you want me to review this in Holden s way  I can tell you that this story is goddamn terrific  Oh boy  I like Holden  He is so funny  In the story when he introduces himself  I know that I like this guy  I like the way he talks  Reading this book  I feel that I can somehow relate to him  I mean  I can almost see what he can see  I don t think this is a terrible book with lots of dirty slangs  I can understand Holden s thoughts  I guess a part of me is like him  I can also reflect to some people around me when he talks about the other characters  There must be some characters in this story that you have seen in your life  I bet  Holden is not bad  He just only care about things he wants to care  He is actually rather kind hearted although he has lots of bad habits I like the part when he is watching a pianist s performance  The terrific description of that pianist is so true that I can almost picture that pianist and those stupid audience s appearance  how he plays and how he act like he s a humble guy but actually he s not and how those audience applause but actually they don t even know how to appreciate the music  I laugh so many times when I read this part The story and the boy are very honest  It s just like reading the experiences of someone around you or even yours  The honesty of this book fascinates me  I list it as my favorite book of all time  I ve learned a lot from that book  It s really gripping and still useful for the youngsters of the 21th century though it was written in the 1950 s  Salinger tells us about a teenager willing to get rid of the rules the society want him to follow   Too long ago to review   I liked From Esme with Love and Squalour better   In suppose that last word in the title should be spelt American but I get so irritated by Goodread s or Facebook s  correcting  British I m just going to leave it    I dont know  maybe you find yourself is a sinism and sceptic with loud harsh though and mouth keep shut  You are Caulfield or you aren t  You may like it  if u find Caulfield in yourself  or you just a regular flamboyant man with a sharp mind and bright shinefull life you probably think that what Caulfield do and think is a full a crap or something useless  For me  Caulfield is a liberation  Prior to reading this book  I had no idea whatsoever about what the book was actually about  After reading it  I m still not sure  haha Despite the story not really having a plot  I was completely entranced by this book  I LOVED the way Holden spoke  how Salinger wrote  just everything  Hell  he made the whole experience with the prostitute sound eloquent and classy  How many authors can write ELOQUENTLY about a PROSTITUTE    I ll give you a hint  not many  Also  the main character  Holden  particularly stuck with me  Despite him being extremely pretentious and a bit narcissistic  I found him extremely relatable with his  what seemed like to me  depression  And also his immense distaste for the world around him  He was a very negative character  but I liked that  It made him stick out from any other book I ve read  And  despite the nonexistent plot line  it was some sort of an adventure    him wandering around New York  getting drunk and smoking  Teenager s dream  eh Anyway  I enjoyed reading this book so much   I m also depressed by the authenticity we lose on the prescribed road to adulthood   I m always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all  glad I met If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though Favorite passages include  1    It s not too bad when the sun s out  but the sun only comes out when it feels like coming out   2    I have a feeling that you re riding some kind of a terrible  terrible fall  But I don t honestly know what kind   Are you listening to me    It may be the kind where  at age thirty  you sit in some bar hating everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college  Then again  you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say   It s a secret between he and I   Or you may end up in some business office  throwing paper clips at the nearest stenographer   This fall I think you re riding for  it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement is designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  So they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even got started  3    I mean how do you know what you re going to do till you  do it  The answer is  you don t  I thinkI am  but how do I know  But  of course  self awareness suggests we know the life patterns we weave at some level   don t we  I originally read this book when I was around the same age as the main character  Holden Caulfield  This is probably part of the reason I love this book so much  Salinger does an exceptional job at capturing the essence of being a teenager  the feeling of being confined and restricted by your family and school  not relating well to your peers  and awkward encounters with the opposite sex  These very relatable happenings and feelings that Holden describes draw in the reader  and the rogue ish character he embodies is universally enjoyed by all readers  In my own writing  I hope to be successful in creating feelings and situations that readers are familiar with so they can relate well to my characters  The Catcher in the Rye overall  was a delightful read  I enjoyed reading this book  and read it in short time because of the intriguing story  One reason I believe I enjoyed it is because I could relate myself to the main character  Holden  I couldn t relate myself directly though  I have not done the things he has done  like prostitution  running away from school  and more  but I understand why he did it  I guess he was just tired with his boring life  and wanted more of it  I could relate in that sense  which is why I enjoyed going on this adventure of rebelliousness  It felt like I was on this adventure with him  In order to read this book though  you must have the right frame of mind  If you do not put yourself into the view of this young adult  he might just seem like a really spoiled white kid  but to another teen  he might seem like a kid brave enough to go on the adventure he could never dream of going on  Holden now seems like a hero  You must also be patient though  because this book moves relatively slow  There is a lot of detail  setting  and character development  With all this mind  I think it would be safe to say that The Catcher in the Rye is an outstanding read  It would t be a classic if it wasn t  I highly recommend this book  to teens and preteens especially  Thank you for taking the time to consider my review   I read this book for the first time  at the age of 32  This seems to be relevant because most folks read this in highschool  when they were about the same age as the main character I found this to be a great book  a masterpiece even  not because of the story itself but rather because of the writing style  I don t think anyone can fully identify with Holden  the main character  but I don t think that s the intent  The story gives an insight into the character s psyche  as irrational as it may be  It is written from that perspective to further highlight his bizarre way of thinking  an exagerated  tortured youth  way of thinking  It certainly covers themes regarding how artificial people and society can be  but I don t think we re suppose to really agree with Holden s thoughts on those matters  at least not to the degree that he takes them  Some of his thoughts on life are certainly true  and you find yourself agreeing with some things  but we can also see how damaging it can be to allow those thoughts to dictate your actions The people who hate this book  and are giving it bad reviews because they don t identify with the character  are completely missing the point and the genius of this book When I first began reading this book  I wasn t sure that I d make it through  The writing style was so random  it mostly seemed to be the ramblings of a dilusional teenager  But then I realized how difficult it would be to write in that style  and I was able to enjoy and appreciate the book much more  The interest wasn t in the plot  or what Holden was doing next  it was about what he was thinking and his crazy thoughts on random things  So  like just about every other american high schooler  I had to read this for an english class  I remembered not hating it  but not exactly loving it either  which doesn t surprise me because I was one of those people who hated being told I HAD to read something  This summer  I spent some time reading a few of the classic novels that I had somehow managed to miss out on reading in school  One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  Fahrenheit 451  Bell Jar  and I decided to add this one to the re read pile  I swear  books like these are always best when you read them willingly  When you read them as a more mature  better read person  Holden is one of those unique characters that can never be re written  but seems to get better when re read  He is so full of rage and anger and hatred    He has this awesomely genuine DISLIKE of everything  And yet  even though he is miserable and unhappy and trudging through his days and nights with a scowl on his face  he takes the time to tell us what its like to hold hands with a special girl  how their hands were made to hold each other s  and you get to see that there this highly guarded tenderness to him as well I am really glad that I decided to pick this back up again  I definitely recommend it to anyone who was forced to read it for school  because  like me  you were most likely not prepared for what Salinger and Holden had to tell you   This was an amazing read  a funny one if you want to know the truth  That part about D B hating war and liking A Farewell to Arms nearly killed me  maybe because i hated that novel  it made me feel depressed and all  Too bad this book was a little bit short  but i enjoyed it  boy  it was a nice rideAlso     An extremely humorous and more relatable story than most would give it credit for  Holden Caulfield is difficult to like and mostly unpleasant  it s understandable why most of us would never want to compare ourselves to this character  and it s easier to compare those around us  but his constantly contradictory nature and harsh judgement of those around him  along with his inability to accept responsibility for anything brings us closer to him than we d like to admit  The Catcher in the Rye is not particularly popular with its readers  mainly the students who have to read it for school  but that isn t to say it s not perfectly written and wiser than it seems  I believe you either love this book or you hate it  I really loved it because I could relate to it on several different levels  I loved how it was written in stream of consciousness  The things Holden Caulfield said made me laugh  cry and nod in agreement all the time   This book it my favorite of all time  Holden is a character that has great development  Instead of growing old like all the other people Holden wants to stay 17 forever  He does not want to loose his innocence  Throughout the story we are being shown a story of how you have to accept growing up and he does not realize at first but throughout the story he begins transitioning and noticing little thing here and there  Excpecially about his sister Phoebe which is not growing up  Before I actually read this novel  I was disgusted by it I only had read the part about the prostitute and I was so  disgusted  by it  I never wanted to see that book again However  years later  I decided to read it This book was beautifully written  No  it does not contain beautiful  long sentences or complex words  but it is  raw   It is not afraid to be raw and crude and it truly feels as if Holden is talking to you  the reader  Few books have ever done that Holden is an incredibly character  He is a child  who like any child  believe he knows everything  He believes himself to be a Christ figure and has a superiority complex Perhaps I like Holden because he reminds me of myself  I developed a superiority complex as a teenager and it has continued throughout the years  I felt Holden s pain and I like him  fell into an incredible depression during my high school years  I felt like I had a friend in Holden  This review is based on my personal view of the book and how much it helped me get through my depression  No  this is not an unbiased analysis of this book But I don t care I only care that this book helped me so much during my high school years and how much I related to Holden I apologize for this completely biased review  but this book is incredibly important to me  LOVED this book  It was my first introduction to stream of consciousness  and I LOVED it  Loved the style  Loved the writing  Just loved it It also wanted to make me cuss like a sailor  which I would have had more of a problem with had it taken me even longer to read  Fortunately  because I ate it up  it only took me 2 days to read  and I stopped feeling like cussing at everyone I saw  Who knew  bastard  was an affectionate term I don t get this book  by the way  My 5 stars is simply because of the writing and the style This book was required reading for another class in HS  but not mine  I read it anyway  because I wanted to  And I d read it again  If you really want to hear about it  this book killed me  It s much better than all those phoney books which are about three thousand pages long and they all have to have a sexy scene near the beginning and all  There s always some corny guy and some girl and they re practically driven mad with lust for each other   And on the back there s a black and white photograph of the author and underneath they give you a lot of horse manure    But I don t feel like going into it  I m not saying I have no time for books like that  I like books like that as much as anyone  I really do   But in some ways I just find those books kind of phoney as hell  The reason I liked this book  I just wanted to read one page after the next and all the time I was sort of chuckling to myself   This guy just killed me  Another thing  I was thinking about my German friends in the 1980s and how they had to read it for school and one of them had even drawn a little pencil drawing at the front of his book  a real nice drawing in pencil I swear to God  of a man running along with a big butterfly net in a field of rye  like he was going to catch something  In German the word for rye is Roggen  if you wanted to know that  I bet you wanted to know that  That really knocked me out The reason I love this book  when I got to the bit about  If a body catch a body coming through the rye   I thought it was terrific  and it s not even like he got the rhyme right  even though it s the title of the goddam book  That knocked me out  I liked the fact that he chose this song  and that it showed him what he really wanted to be in life  and he didn t even remember the song quite right  but that didn t matter at all  It made me feel really sad and happy at the same time  if you want to know the truth  I know this sounds phoney as hell  but I guess why this book is really important and all  and why presidents are all supposed to read it or not supposed to read it  is because it has a terrific human honesty  I swear to God  and that really knocked me out  The Catcher in the Rye is intensely personal to me  I relate to him because the narrative gets me to feel his  largely self inflicted  emotional pain  It is basically a too close for comfort depiction of an emotional meltdown triggered by self alienation and bottled grief  I experienced the meltdown for myself when reading And  my God  look at his relationships with his siblings  Especially Phoebe  He is neither a purely good brother nor a purely bad brother    that is not what the book is about    but a brother who deeply needs his siblings for companionship and emotional support  His attachment to his red hat because it reminds him of his late brother s red hair is    adorable  childlike  pathetic    either way  it helps to make him a profoundly human character  And look at his conversations with Phoebe  both in her room and out in the city  Especially when she wants to come with him to live in the cabin about which he fantasizes  and when I realized that he needs her more than she needs him  and she knows that The tenderness and humanity of this story contribute to its profound achievement of drawing my undivided empathy for a character as broken and bitter as Holden  Which is ironic  since it is so much more infamous for its edginess and supposed vulgarity than for its tenderness  I could be one of those no brain intellectual guys and say I identify with Mr  Caufield because  Holden  is Australia s national car and The  Caulfield  Cup is a prominent ponyrace in Australia and and anddd       horsies are a motif within the novel    But that would be phoney  and the one thing old J D made patently clear is that you never want to be phoney  So I ll try to be genuine  Meet frank    Trying to articulate why I like something has always been   trying  I mean I either like something or I don t  writing an overblown  pompous dissertation on  how this particular work made my left ear lobe feel  holds no appeal to me  But I m gonna have to start putting pen to paper soon for Uni and I do have some thoughts to share on Catcher so here goes   DIGRESSION    I m not saying that Salinger tapped into my mind when he wrote this but   who am I kidding I share the same opinion as Caulfield on everything  I sort of idolise him  It s funny to say that because he s got that whole clay feet  flawed  he s writing this from a psyche ward  he s a fictional character thing going on but honest to god 99 83  of the time I agree with Holden  He likes books that make you laugh  I like books that make you laugh  Money makes Holden blue as hell  money makes me blue as hell  Holden likes a girl that keeps her kings in the backrow  I m yet to meet her but I m sure I too prefer a Gallagher gal to a Hayes honey  So yeah me and Holden think similar but there s more    The thing that kills me in this novel is Holden s expression  Some call it his voice  others would say the prose  Whatever  The way Holden describes a thing  anything  is simply the best no Tina Turner   He makes you chuckle      kind of phoney that has to give themselves room when they answer somebody s question     I m quite illiterate but I read a lot     Women kill me  They really do  I don t mean I m oversexed or anything like that  although I am quite sexy  I just like them  I mean  They re always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle   He makes you nod your noggin       People never  ad infinite    That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are  Girls  Jesus Christ  They can drive you crazy  They really can      If a girl looks swell when she meets you who gives a darn if she s late  And finally he makes those ducts tear      I know he s dead  Don t you think I know that  I can still like him  though  can t I  Just because somebody s dead  you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake   especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all      old James Castle  And you should ve seen him  He was a skinny little weak looking guy  with wrists about as big as pencils  Finally  what he did  instead of taking back what he said  he jumped out the window  I was in the shower and all  and even I could hear him land outside   So yeah this is my favourite book  Salinger exposes injustice  shines a beacon on the inequity that exists on Earth  Instead of brooding like Holden when I witness this I think I ll just cringe  shake my head and then smile  delighted in the knowledge that I ain t no phoney   I read Catcher in the Rye for my A Level in English Literature  and I loved it almost from the moment that I opened the book  Needless to say  I got my best grade out of an essay from this book I love the innocence  and ignorance  of the the main protagonist Holden Caulfield  and the way he wants to protect people from growing up  because once you do you become a  phony  as Caulfield liked to put it  Most of all I love the idea that you can never really trust Caulfield  and you never really know if he is being honest with his accounts  or if he is making it all up as he goes along  he certainly admits to being a liar incredibly early on  I also love the idea that Caulfield is easily the biggest phony in the book  he is everything that he hates in the world  mainly rich and a little stuck up   but I think that this makes him so easy to relate to  Because no matter how much we deny it to ourselves  quite often we are the things that we dislike in others  and we use our  attack  on these things as a kind of defence mechanism So  I think it s fair to say that I learnt a lot about myself from this book  and it taught me that I am normal  First off I loved this book  The stream of consciousness writing style was easy to read  while thought provoking and insightful  I found Holden to be an unflinchingly honest narrator  and his unique view of the world made for a beautiful and memorable read  Although at every mention of  Catcher in the Rye  I find Holden is pegged as the epitome of teenage angst and rebellion  I found Holden to be a supremely moral character  When faced with the superficial Holden refuses to comply and do what is expected of him  preferring to allow his future to slip away then become just another functioning member of the drone like high society he was born into  Holden s thoughts reveal every facet of human superficiality  and Holden becomes more and more depressed over the grimy and phony aspects of human life  Although I found most of the book to be a sort of expose  bringing to light the human behaviors that disgust and depress Holden  there were also certain sections that were unquestionably beautiful  For instance  when Holden first discusses his brother Allie  who died young of leukemia  and when Holden describes to Phoebe how he wants to be a catcher inn the rye when he grows up  the reader is conversely reminded of the beautiful aspects of life  All and all a quick  easy and worthwhile read I would recommend to all   One of my favorite books  I found Holden Caulfields whiny  babbling  hateful attitude slightly endearing  For this reason he is a memorable character he has so many quirks  He had no problem expressing his hatred toward the world and everyone in it  Something that you rarely hear from a character because the rest are all so phony  The best part of the book for me is easily when Holden explains what he wants his job to be   a catcher in the rye  4 5 The Catcher in The Rye first struck me as a very desired book because it had been one of the best books that this century had beside The Great Gatsby and How to Kill a Mockingbird  Naturally  I seized this copy relentlessly upon finding it and it somehow was destiny that its price range was exactly under my possible finances that day  The cover and the back of the book had nothing to describe the book and I am an uneducated brat so I just got it and called it the mysterious book  My friend read it first  because she was so goddam curious about the  b  mysterious book so I let her  I had a couple on my hands and had to go through them before them anyway I started this hardly the last week  surely I might have gotten to finish it in a quicker pace if it wasn t for school but again  I am glad I didn t go through it in the speed of a bastard  probably ruining the entire reading experience  I didn t have many expectations because I caught my friend looking a tad disappointed in the book  So  I braced myself and tried to put it all behind me about classics  Just because millions others thought they were AMAZING   mind blowing and great  doesn t mean I have to build an air castle and simple blow it out when I end up getting disappointed  Throughout the beginning I enjoyed Holden s style of writing so much that I simply somehow forgot that this was his life he talked about and not a made up story  sure  the most part of that story s parts are full of his lies   but it struck me as sad about how he perceived all of those people around him  How easily he got into a fight with a roommate  I was shocked and slightly sad for him I found myself getting angry when he got so goddam depressed and realized that his usage of the words depression depressed depresses happened too often to overlook it as misusage of vocabulary  I began to think  what if Holden was suffering from the great ole depression and no one knew  It made me feel very sad but also very angry The phonies in this book ticked me off  I am not known for being that obvious about my dislike about other people s phoniness  I tend to ignore them and simply get on with my life  but the phonies in this book just struck me as stupid  I wanted to crush their bones and all that grotesque things you read about in Games of Thrones  But there were moments where I realized I felt so goddam happy for Holden when he felt happiness I realize he must have had thousands of ideas of running away  live on a farm  build a cabin and live them till he s thirty five because it s easy for young people to think of running away from their problems  Holden s biggest issue in my opinion was his not fitting in  a pretty common emotion among people his age and my age  I m 17  It s tricky  to find a footing in this life  to find a reason to hang on  to stay and simply be  Sometimes some of us choose to recoil into a cocoon of anti social behavior and that probably works out right for them  Some of us choose to fight for their lives  I happen to be a fighter who had not belonged  I didn t feel fitted in among my phony friends  But  did I run away  Boy  I wanted to run and run hard and fast  I wanted to find real friends  people I could share my anger  my joy  my GREAT moments before I turn into a responsible adult and I DID  I found this bunch of friends  I was glad with the ending of this book  It set things right  It spoke of a message to me  not to run away  and always seek out the help of your family  Holden struck me as a deserter type of guy but in the end  he stayed  He stayed for his sister if not for his own measurement of brain  I adored his family  The way Pheobe kills him at times  I enjoyed that a lot This book was a joy wholly  It grows on you  just like the grey hair infesting Holden s head  I quite enjoyed his grey hair and his panicking moods about his health and his smoking habits and his horsing around  even at the wrong times  and his inability to move on from his own brother s death  It spoke to me on levels beyond him being an annoying teen  but a soulful character  It was quite easy to admit things when reading this book  Admitting you re not that happy  not that great  in a world that s not that gorgeous  It was okay  because in the end you had to stick around for the better parts of life to start kicking in  The most poetic modern day lament delivered in the most prosaic of prose styles  Delightful  Makes you laugh  makes you sigh  makes you cry  makes you hope       I think some books just remain  no matter when you read them  It doesn t matter  They are beyond time perhaps  For me  The Catcher in the Rye is one such book  I have heard a lot of people say a lot of things  about it  however to me it still remains special  Why  you ask  Maybe because I read it at sixteen  Maybe because I read it when I was away from my family   the plot had some perspective I think  I didn t want to be Holden  but certainly thoughts drifted in the manner he thought  J D  Salinger knew what he was doing I think while writing this novel  What he didn t know was the reaction or strings of actions would be created by this book Mark David Chapman shot John Lennon and had The Catcher in the Rye in his hand  John Hinckley Jr  attempted an assassination on Ronald Reagan in 1981 and one of the books owned by him was the one written by Salinger  There are several movie and television references to the novel as well  What is it about this book that evokes such reactions  Why  To my sixteen year old mind  unwell and in bed  it was just another novel lent to me by my uncle and I had to read it  I read it  I loved it and that was it The Catcher in the Rye is not just another novel then  It is the voice of several generations of teenagers in the sense of the world  It is the world of angst and no sense of direction  Or maybe it is the voice of intellectualizing everything or trivializing it all  Holden Caulfield is more than an icon  He is someone who is trying to make sense of his life and life around him  It might appear to be as simple as this  when it is not or may be it is  He encounters people   different people as he takes off from his fancy school Pencey Prep and takes on his journey in New York City  This is where it all begins or almost The book was banned in most schools in the US of A  It is because of its vulgar language  which honestly I did not have a problem with then or now  To me the writing is just surreal  even after rereading it after fourteen years  It just manages to evoke the same sentiments in me and that is why I call it timeless  It talks about adolescence and its struggle like no other book  The Catcher in the Rye in that sense of the word is truly a classic and will be for years to come  I am glad I reread it  Thanks to my The Novel Cure Reading Challenge  It is guaranteed to cure angst of adolescence  I made a reading room out of my back room the other day  I put that big old chair that s been getting decimated by the weather these past two years inside  and a blanket over it  and a light over it  and the first book I read in there was Catcher in the Rye  The same copy with the 1985 cover  you know  the maroon one with the yellow title  I got it from my family and now the pages are yellow and the cover fell off a long time ago and I pinned it to my wall behind my desk  I like to think my dad gave it to me in a really gorgeous way  like he told me some kinda sentimental thing with his eyes gone watery  I know that s not really how it happened  though  because that s what he did with his copy of Nine Stories  I d rather he gave me Catcher than Nine Stories  Even if I liked eight of them  I don t even know I still have Nine Stories  anyway  if you know what I mean  I think I may have just seen Catcher on his book shelf and just wanted it so bad I just took it  Stole it from my dad  Really madman  I feel so honored that Holden Caufield shared his thoughts with me  I would never go and kill anybody and blame it on the book  How come so many people did that  Way back before it was published  JD Salinger went to New York and read his book to an editor there  Up in some skyscraper office  He got so upset when the guy told him Holden was really crazy and they could not publish a goddam book with a goddam crazy narrator  They say he ran out of the office and was crying  They say that s because Salinger was Holden  That s what they say  People have a funny way of saying things as though they were truth  when it s really guesswork    anyway  I know I m talking about things you probably could care less about  You know what happens when I get to talking  I want you to know I thought of you today  Only for a little while  you know what can happen when I think for too long  I wanted all the thoughts to be good ones  but some of the not so good ones approached me too  I told them go away  They sorta edged up and stayed  and I realized I would be wrong to tell them go away when they had a right to be there  too  But I think you should read this book  It might not make you feel better  but it s will make you feel  I think it s very honest  I know it took me a long time to get there  But I got there  didn t I  Everybody has got a book that changed their lives  well  this is the one which changed mine I ll never be able to thank Salinger enough for his ability to create a character who accurately represents the uncertainty and the fears of an entire generation  It is probably silly rating or even commenting on this book    if any text  speaks for itself   this is it  Certainly the main character  and probably Sallinger too  would find it  phony   This said  I rather randomly picked this off my bookshelf two days ago  having not read it for close to 25 years  It is as pointed and painful as it was then  and I am glad that I can still feel it so deeply  Perhaps I should be frightened that some of Holden Caulfield s comments were ones I can remember making just two or three days ago  but I am not  I do not know if I formed some solid opinion of the novel when I was a teenager  but now I think I see something more solid  and terrifying  that Holden was learning here  Living is a process of disappearing  There is no reversing this gradual disappearance  into the crowds of people  ideas  wars  loves  and so on  that is not violent and desperate and  ultimately  a losing battle  But there can and should be beauty  dignity  and meaning in one s disappearance that spreads to sooth others  suffering as they share this process  in their own ways This is the wave that hit me once I put the finished book down  I realize this interpretation is incomplete and insufficient  but then again  so is this novel  Its brilliance lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything more  Silly and  probably  phony stuff  here  But I am very happy to have this novel close to me again

test  Funny  Intelligent  Well written  Tragic  with flying colours  It s a pity it has been adopted by a couple of publicity seeking assassination crazies  especially as old Holden Caulfield is at heart a gentle soul  A remarkable piece of writing  Really I recently listened to the audiobook  It s hard to find  but if you can get it  get it  The narration is outstanding  Wow  What a book  ok  it has that language of an angry teenager  but I didn t mind really In any case  I think that it is splendidly written  he is the king of not sticking to the point and keeping us interested in every new subject that pops out so often It was so amusing  I loved it    I can only recommend it with five stars to everyone looking for a great book  The first time I read it  I felt clueless and hated the book  plus I was a sophomore    The second time I read it was during this summer  and it became one of my favorites  I had to take AP U S  History to know that during the 50 s there was this conformity with Americans  This background knowledge made it easier to understand Holden or better yet  J D  Salinger  This book has such a bitter feel to it which makes it unique and funny in a way  I loved how Salinger used Holden all the time to criticize people and their behavior  For some reason I found this book to be beautiful in its own nature  I guess it is that uniqueness that I am talking about  I recommend it  but I am not sure if you ll like it  I did   mot trong nhung cuon dau tien minh doc  thoi con mua sach lang dang chu khong dai tra nhu luc nay     nho doc mot bai cam

novel that gets forced down the throats of high schoolers everywhere  I actually like this book  Salinger tells the tale of Holden Caulfield  a boy seemingly beyond his years in wisdom who drops out of school and ultimately has a nervous breakdown in New York  I think a lot of people don t like this book because they think Holden is a cynic  or as he d say  a  phony   Honestly though I think a lot of those people are cynics themselves  Salinger s writing captures the raw emotions of adolescence perfectly  Holden thinks everyone is a phony  he feels like he s different from his peers  and he feels lost and overwhelmed by life  In short  he s every 16 year old ever  Salinger brings readers in with humor and a relatable character who tells it like he sees it  That combined with the casual narrative style makes the book an easy read  I feel like people who don t like this book either don t remember what it felt like to be a teenager or are just too uptight to admit they related to the

felt your pain somewhat  I understood  phonies  in my own sense  which probably differed a bit from your vision  but the frustration with  others  was certainly something that I could relate to  Now as an adult  I think my reaction was mostly a desire to tell you that your sensitivity and perceptiveness would help you in years to come  if you can learn to channel it more appropriately  Also  I couldn t help but shake my head at how you could simultaneously be so perceptive and also completely clueless about the consequences of your own choices and actions  I guess as a mom  I wanted to hug you AND slap you What more could be said about Salinger s iconic representation of the disaffected adolescent voice that hasn t been articulated for the last 60 years  I certainly can t add anything new to it  even if you really wanted to hear about it  anyway  Adored this book as a h s  student in the 60 s and am re reading it for our September Moveable Feast Book Club discussion  Interesting how one s perspectives and interpretations shift over time    I suggest a re read for previous readers of this classic  i am amazed how very different my response to Holden Caulfield is  and to the characters who touch his life  Moving from teen reader relating to Holden s angst to adult reader seeing a totally different view of this character has been a fascinating self study as well  HC is one of the best known and recognized names in 20th century literature and Catcher in the Rye one of the celebrated  banned  books which I think every kid  every parent should read  and reread   It will probably continue to be listed on the annual banned book lists this year     check it out     some of the best books ever written will be on it  I come back to this book time and time again and still wonder whether good ol  Holden will be okay and whether he ll figure out where the ducks go in winter  The Catcher in the Rye is considered the very first YA novel and was revolutionary in its time because it dealt with adult topics  drugs  alcohol  depression  hookers  death  etc  from a teenage perspective  Salinger opened the door to writing honestly about the angst of growing up  which changed the possiblities of coming of age stories  No longer did such stories need to assume that teenage drama was artificial or could be explained away by the expected surge of hormones  Salinger recognized that teenagers feel the complexities of loss and grief just as deeply as adults and that their struggle to cope with life s difficulties must be acknowledged This is one of my absolute favorite books  nmy khwhm rwyy zndgy r b khwd bh gwr bbrm   Hs mykhnm khyly shbyh hwldn khlfyld hstm wn rwyy zndgysh rw b khwdsh bh gwr brd chwn mjbwr shd rng jm h sh rw bgyrh dr Hlykhh zwn rng nfrt

in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of the adult world while attempting to deal with the death of his younger brother  an overwhelming compulsion to lie and troubling sexual experiences Salinger  whose characters are among the best and most developed in all of literature has captured the eternal angst of growing into adulthood in the person of Holden Caulfield  Anyone who has reached the age of sixteen will be able to identify with this unique and yet universal character  for Holden contains bits and pieces of all of us  It is for this very reason that The Catcher in the Rye has become one of the most beloved and enduring works in world literature As always  Salinger s writing is so brilliant  his characters so real  that he need not employ artifice of any kind  This is a study of the complex problems haunting all adolescents as they mature into adulthood and Salinger wisely chooses to keep his narrative and prose straightforward and simple This is not to say that The Catcher in the Rye is a straightforward and simple book  It is anything but  In it we are privy to Salinger s genius and originality in portraying universal problems in a unique manner  The Catcher in the Rye is a book that can be loved and understood on many different levels of comprehension and each reader who experiences it will come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live A work of true genius  images of a catcher in the rye are abundantly apparent throughout this book  I reread Catcher in the Rye a couple of years ago  I read it as a high school student  but had forgotten most of it  The stimulus to rearead it was and exchange of emails with a Ukrainian student I know who was studying the book and who had to write a paper on existentialism  I enjoyed coming across one of my emails recently Beyond this  previous email   I do find a lot of hopefulness in his character  Although he finds most of the world phony  he found the two nuns to be authentic  and he respected them  And he seems to really love kids  His beautiful image of many kids in a field of rye and his desire to save them from falling off the cliff  thus  the title the catcher in the rye   shows how he actually finds value in life and wants to be a rescuer  The teenage years are always hard and usually very narcissistic  He will grow up though  and my guess is his tenderness about children  including his younger sister   and eventually coming to terms with the loss of his brother could be the seeds of something good By the way  there are some Christian Existentialists who are not nearly so fatalastic as many other existentialist philosophers  One important one is Kierkegaard  He is a favorite author of mine  when I can understand him   He fights against many religious structures that he finds  phony   too  But he also believes that those with a pure heart will seek and find God in their own way  and will find that His will is the only thing worth seeking   I think i ve fallen in love with Holden Caulfield  The angst and crap that Holden goes through is common in any teenager s life and I don t know about you  but wandering around New York the way Holden does seems utterly perfect Of course  if i were to actually to venture into any city alone  i would be constantly terrified  anxious and self conscious but this this is why the book is so good  Despite all of Holden s faults  which he readily admits throughout the book  he is free and exploring in a way that most people will only ever dream about  Holden s voice is constantly drawing you to want to continue reading  I rarely hesitate to put down a book once I ve had enough of reading or it is late at night but The Catcher in the Rye was the exception  the voice seems so natural and honest that you feel as though you are reading one of your own  forgotten diary entries which immerse you in your own memories  The book perfectly conveys the thoughts of a teenager encountering the adult world  the only difference being that Holden Caulfield is not afraid to say what he is thinking  Holden is a chasm between his innocence and maturity and the story is about what he finds and how he deals with it  Finished rereading  Possibly enjoyed it more this time  My five star rating still stands  Yep    Nad propast iu vo rzhi    v drugom perevode      Lovets na khlebnom pole    angl  The Catcher in the Rye

hanet erotetaan huonon koulumenestyksen takia opinahjostaan ja han palaa kotikaupunkiinsa New Yorkiin  muttei kuitenkaan halua menna kotiin ja kohdata vanhempiaan  Paamaaraton ajelehtiminen ja Holdenin impulsiivinen kaytos tuovat tarinaan seikkailullisen pohjavireen  mutta erityisen viihdyttavaksi teoksen tekee Holdenin sisainen maailma ja analyyttiset nakemykset kanssaihmisista ja elamasta yleensakin  mitka yleisesti asettavat inhimillisen toiminnan naurunalaiseksi  Teksti on lennokasta ja Holdenin armottomat piikit ovat yksinkertaisesti hulvattomia  Holden on kuitenkin hahmona myos sikali kiinnostava  etta kyseessa on ilmeisen herkka tapaus  mika on jatkuvassa ristiriidassa sen kanssa  miten han itseaan ilmentaa   my favourite book of all     THE coming of age novel  Holden is such a complete character  Salinger really tapped into the full spectrum of human emotions and what it feels like to be a misfit  Its a sad story  Its relatable  When I first read it  I felt what Holden was going through   He became a part of me and he still is  When a character manages to do that you know the author is amazing and that particular novel is or will be of great importance in history  This book left its mark thanks to its literary credits but also on a sadder note because this book is the book that inspired the man who killed John Lennon  to do so  I wish this history could be erased from the books fame or rather infamy   Probably the best and most misunderstood book of the last half of the 20th century  Sparkling prose  Singular voice  Brilliant narrative line  But it is NOT a book about Teenage angst  Or Early 1950 s ennui  Or a snotty Rebel Without a Cause  All the things it is generally said to be  Catcher is  at it s core  the story of a young man struggling to overcome the death of his beloved brother  It is a book about depression and it ravaging effects  If you didn t like Catcher or can t understand why all the hoopla concerning this book  read it through the lens of a young man s struggle with disabling depression  It will come alive in a new way  And it will touch you ways you never thought possible  Catcher is a true triumph of modern literature and a book written well before it s time  Salinger caught lightning in a bottle only once  He could never reproduce the magic of Catcher nor could anyone else until  perhaps  Harry Potter  Enjoy Catcher in the Rye for the first time  Again  Thanx The Paradox  A book about isolation and alienation that everyone and their dog identifies with  Seems to me in this great big world of strangers  we re all half Holden Caulfield  half big fat phonies   I can see why some who haven t read the book would see the lead character  Holden Caulfield  who narrates as if retelling the story to someone he knows rather well  as some sort of hero of the disillusioned at first glance  But he s anything but  Holden is just a lost Teen that thinks that the world has given up on him  when in truth  the main one that has given up on him is himself Holden blames absolutely everyone but himself for his problems  and completely ignores the actually sage advice of those who quite obviously care for him  He does become redeemed through  after deciding to run away  realising the things he really cares for are his family  and that he should try harder to better himself rather than run away The book ends rather abruptly with Holden basically saying that he thinks he s learned from the experience he had  But that he doesn t really know  Written by J D Salinger and published July 16 1951  Catcher in the Rye was Slinger s first novel  Salinger was the youngest of two children born to Sol Salinger  the son of a rabbi and Miriam  Sol s Scottish born wife  At a time mixed marriages were disdained though Miriam s non Jewish background was well hidden  Surprisingly  Salinger wasn t exactly the perfect student  He managed to flunk out of McBurney School and was shipped off by his parents to Valley Forge Military Academy  After graduating Valle Forge  Salinger returned to his hometown and attended New York University for a year before heading off to Europe  to learn another language and learn more about the import business though he was much more interested in the language than business  When he returned home he made another attempt at college at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania  before returning to New York and taking night classes at Columbia University  Salinger met a Professor Whit Burnett  who would change his life  Catcher in the Rye  created a new course for literature in post WWII America  The book would fit into the Bildungsroman genre or Coming of Age  meaning the coming of age of a young protagonist  Holden expresses common teen angst and a teens dramatic struggle between life and death  Holden as a character is really similar to Salinger in real life as Salinger was also known for his solitary nature and like Salinger  Holden wasn t at all the perfect student  The book introduces him during the following days of his expulsion from Pencey Prep  a private school  Holden differs from other teens as he has no interest of being social or popular  or feeling the need to gain approval from his peers  He shares with the reader his personal life and informs the reader of his frustration with the world  describing it as phony  Instead he is interested in finding what is real and genuine  which may even create an image of depression  This book was actually assigned to my class  10th grade though i never had the chance to read the book  It wasn t until later a friend recommended me the book  i remembered my interest in the book  This book would more likely relate to younger audiences or teens as it expresses a lot angst similarly shared by teens  Innocence  death  authentic versus artificial  sexual confusion are major themes used to describe the book  Though the book does contain talk about drinking  sex  and foul language  the mature content is not something to discourage the reader from reading the book  Honestly  reading this book  i was so surprised as to how much i could relate to Holden  Reading the book  it often made me wonder about interaction between human and the world and just taught me to look at the world a little bit differently  This book is highly recommended  I m obsessed with Holden Caulfield  I know that sounds creepy but I really am  I would love to go to lunch with him  and chit chat  I would probably laugh my butt off as I did the majority of this novel  The voice in this novel is so realistic and I feel like he is sitting next to me talking to me wherever I am reading  I hear his voice so distinctly  Every voice in this novel I have a clear picture of what they sound like  Pheobe is another one of my favorite characters  Their relationship reminds me a lot about my oldest brother and I s when I was little  Were ten years apart  and I loved how Holden and Pheobe interacted and knew each other so well  When they danced together   that was my favorite part    I love the way that Holden talked saying things like   I liked it   I really did   haha This book makes me want to go back to NYC and I ll think of Holden walking down the street with good old Pheobe   maybe I ll see them      Good book  One of my favourites because I can relate to Holden Caulfield  It is a story about an adolescent who is unsure of himself and jumping around from school to school  He is struggling to fit in and find his place in life  But the main reason I relate to Holden is because he seems almost ADD  He can t concentrate on anything for longer than two seconds his mind is always wondering and he gets bored with everything  Another great thing about this book is the sense of humor  Also the redundant phrases  It reminds me of all the silly things I say all the time    khtb khh tmwm shd tnh Hsy khh dshtm yn bwd khh dwst ndshtm shkhSyt hwldn hych wqt tGyyr khnh w shbyh ykhy z wn mtqlbh

com gp search ref s    This is my favorite book of all time  I read it while in a mental facility  and when I finally figured out where Holden was writing from  I was amazed and happy to know that someone else felt like I did  While some see it as just a book about a kid dicking around New York  I prefer to see Holden s perspective on things  How he sees women  how he sees men  and what exactly is it that makes him crazy about little kids  He loves them more than anything   From what I ve heard  most americans read this book one time or another  from what I hear this piece is  classic  in american literature  But I was never encouraged to read this book  No body ever mentioned it directly to me  No one gave it to me  I was simply drawn to it  The truth is  I m no Holden Caulfield  I can t really relate much to the character  and I can t really relate to the events that happen to this guy  even though pretty much nothing happens at all     I couldn t even pick up the literary aspects  I was on summer break  and there was no way that I was going to be searching for masked symbolism in Holden s hunting hat  or anything along those lines So why did I rate it so high This is really the first book that I ve enjoyed reading simply because of the way it is written  It s the phenomenal voice that talks you as if in a one to one conversation throughout the entire book  this very casual  very human voice that never breaks or skips a beat  I couldn t relate to the character  but it was weird   because I related with the voice  I sometimes ended up agreeing with it The book is not much of a roller coaster  but the feeling you get after finishing the book  is unlike any other  A definite must read  The best coming of age story I have ever read  No wonder  John Lennon was shot  Such a great story and the world s best cursing lesson  I wish I could swear like that   2015 in Ilk Kitap Yorumu Yayinda  Hem de harika bir kitap  Cavdar Tarlasinda Cocuklar yorumu blogta

us never grow out of it  This book was a great reminder to me how much I use to hate that fact even myself  Especially in this respect  I think this book was a fantastic representation of that so very rare period of time in everyones life   adolescence  It s so brief  but it impacts us and shapes us for the rest of our lives  I think Holden Caulfield  though a pretty extreme character in his actions  could have been some many of us   especially those of us that felt so disgusted at the things and people we saw around us growing up  Holden is obviously intelligent  there is no question about that  He is the ultimate portrait of an artistic  disillusioned brilliant youth  It might seem a bit of a strecth  but I think there is a comparison to be made between his character and Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man  Joyce   The extremes in emotions  the self isolation type behavior  the trouble with girls women love  the concern for art and feeling fear of being unoriginal   I wouldn t be too hestitant in saying this work could function as a modern Portrait  Holden  besides this does come with his fair share of baggage in the form of his psychological problems   and what is more modern than that  I definitely enjoyed reading this book and I think it is definitely worthwhile  These are just my first impressions  but I anticipate it being the sort of book that you learn more about everytime you read it   I m always shocked by how many readers detest this book and its main charcter I reread this book over   over when I was 14   15  Maybe it takes a self absorbed  unhappy and disaffected adolescent to appreciate and enjoy another such adolescent However  what I took from Holden was that he was grieving for his beloved dead brother Allie  hey critical readers  feel some compassion for him   and how much he loved his sister Phoebe  I liked the kid  a lot I haven t read this book since I graduated from high school and I do wonder how I d feel about it as an adult  or as even an adolescent of today and not one from the sixties  Most of my reading friends loved this book too  Maybe it s a sixties thing  Phoniness was a huge concern among the young back then  and I remember identifying with Holden and his angst I don t think I want to disturb my fond memories by rereading this as an adult so I m going to keep my memories  I think  I do still have my old paperback copy so I might change my mind someday   Moderated spoil No se porque me tomo tanto tempo hasta decidir leer  Catcher in the Rye   Talvez por el titulo  no le entendia muy bien  Me demore a acostumbrarme con el lenguaje de Holden  Estamos tan acostumbrados a plots y al drama que me parecio que el libro no te llevaba a ningun lado  Y esta es justamente la riqueza de este libro  Es el flujo natural del pensamiento en tiempo real  Holden es cinico y sincero  Por la mitad del libro estaba enamorada de el  y sus cuestionamientos juveniles no son muy diferentes de los de todos nostros  Ni siquiera si siente el gap temporal  Muy contemporaneo para un libro que fue escrito en 1951  La escena del carrossel  cuando Holden se da cuenta que las cosas no son permanentes y que cambiar es invitable  es seguramente una de las mas bellas escenas de la literatura del siglo XX   Once that I read the Catcher in the Rye  I had many mixed emotions  although they were primarily positive  The book gave me a feeling of depression after reading  but that may have been the intended goal  The plot and characters all fit quite well with very strong sensual adjectives to describe the New York scene  I thoroughly enjoyed the story overall  I once turned down a newspaper internship summer job in favor of doing a stint of lower paying manual labor for the local parks department  I m not sure why  whether I believed there might be some inherently romantic aspect to getting my hands dirty and working alongside the salt of the earth  Perhaps I unconsciously felt it might provide valuable life lessons or result in jocular anecdotes I could later share with Goodreads pals  Or maybe I was just afraid to commit to the journalistic field at that point Whatever the case  my three months at the parks department was hell  For some reason  I always had a magnetic pull that ensured that every bully  homophobe  half breed sociopathic psycho  etc   would latch onto me and torment me for being a sensitive  nonconforming youth  I say homophobe because for some reason every cornfed ogre in this neck of the woods tended to confuse my bookishness with homosexuality  And once they brand you as that  not  as Seinfeld would say  that there is anything wrong with that  then you might as well mince about and go with the flow and feed their idiotic bashing fantasies  I was pretty much dead meat there when I refused to partake in sharing the fun of looking at the hardcore porn magazines that spilled from the garage break room locker onto the picnic tables  and instead preferred to keep my nose buried in a hardcover copy of Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye  Whatcha readin  there  college boy   Yes  from that you can imagine how my life was in that den of hillbilly vacuousness for the rest of the summer Under such circumstances how was I not going to adore everything that Holden Caufield had to say to me or cherish everything he stood for So  really  what can I substantively say about this most revered novel that has not been said  It was the right read at the right time  I was still a youth and still had naive ideas about the world  and  in retrospect  I think I ve become more like my park worker tormentors with age  apart from the homophobia   I would doubtlessly enjoy those hardcore porn magazines now Perhaps Caulfied helped fuel a certain rebellion in me at the time  because after a summer of enduring the idiocies of my co workers I told all the other summer interns on the last day of work to take their weed whackers and beat them on the stones  We did and the sharp tools broke and the supervisor was apoplectic Ah  sweet memories  A complex  complicated story full of inference and symbolism that is nonetheless easily readable and engrossing  Holden is the classic tortured protagonist who is often his own worst enemy  He s a product of his time and class  but he could so easily be a teen today  If anybody recommends the marvelous Dr  Seuss books      Catcher in the Rye  comes as the BEST DUDE book for anyone who finds  dudespeak  very INTERESTING Yes  this really is a page turner   due to the fact that there ain t NO hype  no complicated  I need a Thesaurus  to understand this entire novel This was written light years away   even when those great  dudes named  BILL   TED   Excellent Adventures  Bogus Journey films  engaged in dudes  lingo   so consider this a GODSEND for those looking for references of terms like  y know  sweet WHOAAA and many more     I really read this book REAL FAST    and its DAMN EXCELLENT  Why bother with Harry Potter refuse     Catcher in the Rye  makes dudes PROUD of their existence and J D  Salinger really hit me home   I enjoyed this book very much  It had an interesting structure  in that it was over a very short period of time  only a few days  and it never really had an obvious conflict  It seemed that the antagonist was actually society  while Holden was fighting against it  Holden  the main character  didn t like school very much  He seemed like a slacker  and it was revealed that he had flunked out of a couple different schools  However  he s actually smart  he just doesn t like the way teachers act  or what the class is about   He gets upset about very small things that other people wouldn t even notice  or not care about  However  it s the small things  or details that make him truly happy  For example  seeing a curse word carved into the wall in an elementary school  made him very depressed  even though it was small  and hardly noticeable  Also  he remembers strange and small details about people that become very important to how he thinks about them  Overall  this book was very interesting  and the characters were relatable to  yet somewhat strange and unusual    Certain things they should stay the way they are  You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone  I know that s impossible  but it s too bad anyway  This book did seem phony to me at the start  well for the first six chapters  But I got along with it alright  It was getting crony every other chapter Old Phoebe just killed me  too It just gave me immense pleasure reading this book  It substituted my left hand for a day  it was with me in my car  dinner table  bathroom  bed   It just nearly killed me  It nearly did   I thought it was  If a body catch a body    I said   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy    He damn near broke my heart  One of the best books I have ever read  It s so honest and genuine  J D  Salinger is an awesome author  his book has awesome mood to it  Holden is such a unique character  he is real  I love this book   I read this book when  like Holden  I was struggling with adolescence and purpose  I did not understand others around me and thought they were all superficial  I was lonely and seeking something  but did not know what  It was a hard time  the assassination of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King just a year and a half before  little to no contact with my mom    and I felt more rejected in high school  where I had dreamed I would find friends  than I had in junior high  No wonder I related so strongly to this novel  Interesting  I always felt that Holden would grow up okay  He told me that I was not alone    that we both would catch the children and not allow them to hurt  I am okay  too  Actually  I am quite a success as an adult and better for my years with  The Catcher in the Rye   This book is a must read  especially for teenagers and young people  When I read it I was a young university student fed up with lots of the values of my society and feeling like nobody would ever understand me  Then I found Holden and shared all his feelings and sufferings and grew up with him  as a result  my attitude changed  There are lots of scences which I love in this book  One of them is when he asks the taxi driver about the ducks in the lake  All his encounters with Phoebe are moving  I lived with this book  Anyone can be like Holden  an angry young man defying his society  Reading this book helps him to see he is not alone and it helps him to find some positive points to hold onto   Hace algunos anos escuche como anecdota  que varios de los mas famosos asesinos de la historia americana  tenian en comun que en su biblioteca estaba El Guardian entre el centeno  Ejemplos como Mark David Chapman  Charles Manson  Lee Harvey Oswald John Hinckley Jr  Sirhan B  Sirhan  Robert John Bardo o como instrumento de ensayo de la CIA en su proyecto MK Ultra Ahora entrando en el analisis del libro  solo puedo decir que seguramente sea el vivo retrato de muchos de los adolescentes del mundo que alguna vez han sentido lo mismo  pero que por necesidades de un destino que algunos creeran que nos viene marcado u otros que consideraran que lo vamos forjando  nos entregara un devenir u otro  Llegar a pensar que el libro puede afectar a la persona que lo lea para acabar de desequilibrarlo es excesivo  pero si da pie a reflexionar sobre tus acciones y las posibles consecuencias Desde el principio el libro me ha embaucado con una prosa sencilla  sin alardes  muy cercana y que para muchos pueda parecer un libro simple  sin sustancia  pero para mi ha sido todo lo contrario y me ha retraido a recuerdos de adolescente que hubiese preferido mantener en el olvido Sin duda ocupara un lugar entre los grandes de mi corta biblioteca leida P D   Despues de haber leido las criticas del resto  me encontraba en lo cierto  que este libro es tonica  o te encanta o lo aborreces  You know I expected something extremely scandalous in this book with all the supposed bad things it brings about  I very seriously doubt if this book was released today it would be so quickly banned for reading  but I understand why it was  Of all the characters I ve ever read about or saw in books and television Holden is without a doubt my favorite  His childish contradictions really hit home to me in more than one way and his constant over the top exaggerations gave me some great chuckles and kept me reading just for the sheer joy of being able to smile at his in your face sarcasm  I wish the story was more developed I want more to understand Holden and why he is the way he is  It seemed simply to cut off to quickly when I saw the story really begin to get going two pages later it was over  I enjoyed the book and would say everyone  especially younger males  should pick it up and have a not to serious mindset when they read it  No clue how this book lead to the shooting of John Lennon  unless the guy thought Lennon was a  fat ass phony   So anyone know more about that event care to explain  z wn khtbyy khh b yn khh 100 drSd nyst m yh chshny dry twsh khh nmy twnm khmtr z 5

teenage children friends nieces etc  a copy  The book s themes are actually harmless  maybe that s an exaggeration since there is sex and drugs but they re far from the main attraction   Salinger captures the restless nature of youth perfectly   that s kind of all you need to know about the book  Strangely  I finished the book on the morning of my 18th birthday and the hollowness felt by Holden resonated deeply with me  I then went to celebrate my birthday in a pub named  The Catcher in The Rye   Just read it  only a few individuals are left disappointed with it   I must confess   again    I didn t expect I d love this book that much  The catcher in the rye was more than a book to me  It was something mainly like a real experience than anything else  I think I am an emotionally intense person  but not in a scary way  well  I hope so   which may justify my reactions towards the books I cherish  like this one  So The catcher in the rye is set in New York  1949  It s all about two days in the cold December of this teenager  Holden Caulfield  A name I m not sure one day I can forget  This is the kind of books when you can t allow yourself to anticipate the sequence of the story because  properly speaking  there is no story  It s all in the mind of Caulfield  From the beginning  J  D  Salinger puts us into the personal life of Holden and you easily see that he s unlike kids his age  He is intelligent but not interested to succeed in the way  normal people  conceive success  He is totally allergic to phony people and thinks that his brother  D B   wasted his writing talent when accepting to work in Hollywood  I mostly felt like he was hiding his real him even to himself  but his actions kept betraying him and you get to realize how generous  nice and sensitive he is  It s just hard to stay aloof  at least I couldn t  He is a character who is confused  desperate and depressed but mainly a teenager struggling with growing up and for whom adulthood is just a world of fake people and nonsense  I got mostly touched by his unbearable loneliness and boredom so much that while I was reading the book I kept saying to myself if only I could ve been there with him to talk  I mean  just for the hell of it  But thanks God there was old Phoebe  the sweet old Phoebe  She s the baby sister of Holden and she had a huge influence on him  Throughout the book he talks about her with high regards and you just can t stay indifferent to her  I think the writing style of J  D  Salinger has a touch of genius  The book was written in the fifties but once you read it you get this feeling that it s a contemporary work  Not because it deals with the angst of teenagers or sexuality or whatsoever  the writing style in itself is intriguing  The catcher in the rye has definitely been an inspiration for writing The perks of being a wallflower by Stephen Chbosky  you can easily apprehend this cultural influence  No wonder why the favorite book of Charlie was The catcher in the rye  For those who read and loved The perks of being a wallflower  I can t highly recommend this one to you   Wow Holden is funny kid  He is very judgmental  stubborn  doesn t thank people  and doesn t care about future but he is very unique kid  This was very easy to read and had a lot of details  Also how the ending doesn t have much of a conclusion so it really made me think what he had done after that  I was guessing he would go back to school and do some charity work because he is very generous and nice to people Holden looks and sound lile a jerk but deep inside he is great good boy  Holden lost his brother and he talked about him multiple times and showed his love toward him  Also treated him like he is alive  I was very impressed and it was super touchy  The ultimate rebel novel  I laughed at almost all the pages I read    Witty  sarcastic  funny and changes your entire view of life to grayscale  All the  phony bas    s   beware  I only bought this book because Alan Rickman  favourite actor  R I P    said it was one of his favourite books  I didn t know what the book was about until I started reading it It is about a teenage boy called Holden Caulfield and he has just flunked out of school once again  only passing one subject and that is English That is how the book starts and there are many twists and turns in this book  It is a short book as well  The twists and turns are not all together  they are evenly spaced I fell in love with this book on page one If you want a book to read during your commute or just a short read  this is the book for you  Please give it a go  10 10 from me  Read as part of my college AS English Lit and Lang course  I m glad we read it as a class as some discussions that we had really helped me to understand key elements and subtleties scattered throughout the book      you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  This book is every teenager s novel  Holden s frustrations  sadness  depression is typical for every 14 18ish year old youngster  At this age you don t know what you want to do  where to go  or what you truly are  Exactly like him  He is only a confused boy in a rushing world  And the ending was perfect  I appreciated that it was not spectacular nor amazing nor different  It ended perfectly  Holden didn t change much  He knew that he s still a confused teenager  I recollected myself in every piece of the main character  I mean  I am not really like Holden  I don t give up on every school  or something  but his feelings   I understood him and what he wanted to express Just perfect   3 I think this is one of those books which has more than one layer  It is a complicated book  so I really want to re read it  probably even more than once  It is not your normal ya fiction  that s true  and watching John Greens analysis definitely helped  I think I will listen to the audiobook when I m on the train  preferably in English  It s harder to read  but it s totally worth it  the people who translate books work hard and carefully translated this masterpiece  but you just can t translate a book in which the author has placed his soul  thought about every single word he would use to complete his story  in any other language than the original one   iamar skhan geech     I read this book probably almost 40 years ago and I was blown away this time  I liked it then  but in my teens probably didn t understand it as much  although I was probably going through some female Holden Caulfield experiences myself  This book could have EASILY been written today  With the exception of the lingo  this is a universal theme of young people diametrically opposed in philosophy to the adults around them  i can see why this book was banned and love it for that fact because J  D  Salinger wrote a masterpiece that was almost uncomparable to anything in his day  I grew up in the 60 s and of course  I always thought  don t trust anyone over 30  was a creed only our generation employed  All though the ages  have phonies been around  adults as well as the peers of angst filled teens  At that age  you feel different in your own feelings from everyone you meet and experience emotions that will continue  but that you will learn to deal with  This book is in my top 5 of all time  Thanks  J  D  Salinger  I think 10th grade students should read The Catcher in the Rye   For example  if the teacher just assigns a student the book without explaining the book the student will get confused  If you guide a student through a tough book  they will gain more knowledge reading these types of books  Teachers are worried more about what the parents think rather then there student  My vocabulary has expanded  Catcher in the Rye also helps your reading skills increase  There are a lot of connections between this book and real life  It s appropriate  We ve already heard or learned about sex  drugs  violence and cursing  So  we should not take offence to the vulgar language that is in the book   The Catcher in the Rye is an incredible tale of teenage isolation and lost innocence  The main character  Holden  represents all things base and divine in teenage nature  He distorts the truth  sometimes causes trouble  has a laundry list of bad unhealthy habits  often dislikes others for their insincerity or  phoniness   oscillates between loving and hating himself  he s also selfish and completely selfless at times  Teens will be automatically drawn to the text  Maybe it could be studied in school  but it could never be read aloud  The language is far too naughty and profane  This novel is timeless and moving  It s often on lists for the 100 greatest books of all time and for good reason   A timeless classic so beautifully woven that it s clear in its themes yet open for interpretation  Controversial  culture defining and an artifact of literature  this is required reading  It s a shame Salinger walked away from publicly sharing his work after this tour de force  It s been a while  since I ve read a book where I feel completely immersed in the text  not that I don t enjoy less immersive novels  I just prefer the other ones   but after so much recommendation and people telling me of reading this in high school  I finally realized what makes this book so special  And it s definitely one of the best books I ve read this year  Holden is such a negative young mind  it reminds me a lot of when I was his age and how I saw the world during my senior year  and how much I hated it  But he has some good points to him as well  So many characters  beyond the stock characters  are very well rounded  and characterized well  especially Holden  The novel is filled with themes of impression on the youth  the destiny of the next generation  the world this generation is living in  it s a coming of age story with the underlying themes focusing on    coming of age  And it s portrayed so well  I couldn t put this book down  and whenever I did  I couldn t stop thinking about it  And I still can t now    Shana  The  Catcher in the Rye teaches teenagers how to get through life challenges  The book Is a great challenge for high school students  There are some boring parts in this book where Holden is trying to decide who to call at the train station when he leaves Pencey  It is a great challenge to finish the book  with some of the boring content  I know it was a challenge for me to finish the book because of some of the boring content Teens could relate to this book because Holden faces many tough times that teens have to face  Holden calls many people in the book a  phony   We teens do call people fake because of the way people act  Holden calls people  phonies  because he doesn t like those people  The whole Holden complains about his life and as teens we also complain with what going on in our life  The  Catcher in the Rye  is good book to read because Holden faces topics that teens face everyday it also help students to read harder books  I recommend this book for teens who like a challenge   Holden Caulfield s emotional breakdown is as captivating now as it was when I first read it several years ago  It s the kind of book that s fascinating to read as a historical snapshot of New York  a psychological study of a troubled teen  and a cultural touchstone for Americans over the past sixty years  Part of the mystique of the book is how it has been received and how it has remained static while still being relevant to each generation  It really was the first of its kind  and it still stands out despite the significant number of successors in its genre  It is best read in a short time   certainly no longer than the amount of time in which the events of the story take place   and it is a book that I wish to teach someday  or  at the very least  to host an extracurricular book study for students who choose to enter Salinger s carefully constructed world  One of the most iconic novels ever when it came to American literature  And for a good reason too When my father  a fellow lover of the classics  told me that The Catcher In The Rye was his favorite book growing up  of course I had to pick it up  At that age  I was starting to get into other classic literature written by icons such as Fitzgerald and Hemingway  whose tone in language was quite formal and  what I found to be  simple and plain at times  especially Hemingway   I was mesmerized by the quirky use of language Salinger implements and how dreadfully blunt Holden can be  As a 14 year old  it was an absolute gem and was so remarkably contrastive linguistically to the novels I adored such as The Great Gatsby  I would say one of the highlights of the book is the first line of the novel  If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  an what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  I was absolutely immersed by the end of that first sentence  I devoured the novel with adoration in my eyes  oh  what a blissful feeling it is to enjoy a book that much   I recall reading this book under my school desk during my freshman year spanish class because I couldn t put it down  which resulted in my spanish teacher reprimanding me for not paying attention and taking away my book for the day  which I am still a bit resentful about  even though I really should ve been paying attention  A good friend of mine decided to read the novel recently  in which I finally made the decision to reread again as a 17 year old  She absolutely loathed the novel as a whole and gave me about a 15 minute hate filled rant about how whiny and pretentious Holden was and how there was no plot whatsoever  First of all  I found Holden downright hilarious most times  my friend then replies it s because I am equally as pretentious as Holden  Thanks Brooke   However  I also sympathized with him as well  Holden is definitely flawed and lost  and just like me  he s at a particular time of his life where he s not a child  yet not an adult  He realizes the beauty of the carefree minds of children towards the end of the novel when he is with Phoebe  and knows that the children will eventually end up just like all of the  phony  predictable adults he criticizes throughout the book  which is something he fears  As the reader  you experience the struggle of entering adulthood with Holden  which is something most people identify with at one point of their life  As far as the story having no real plot  I find that s the beauty of it  The language behind the novel is what truly makes it magnificent  Which is also why The Catcher In The Rye wouldn t make a very good film adaptation as it s such a language heavy novel Of course  I still love the novel as much as I did when I was younger  But for a different reason  When I was 14  I just found the book hilarious and entertaining and unique  However  between the ages of 14 and 17  I discovered other writers of that same era  such as Kerouac and Ginsberg  who also took part in the more casual and at times  crude way of writing  So rereading it again as a 17 year old wasn t just about how informal and just downright  cool  The Catcher In The Rye was  but how much more I related to Holden and the particularly peculiar struggle we  and many lovers of the novel  connect with  I wonder what message I would get out of the book the next time I read it as an adult  It kills me just thinking about it  I finished this book ages ago  but I truly never gave it a review  Most people I know hate this book  I personally love it  It took me a while to get into it  but once I did  I was sucked into it immediately  And I ll tell you why  He s the reason most people either hate or love this book HOLDEN  HOLDEN  HOLDEN He s the heart and soul of this book  Most people hate Holden because he s whiny  judgmental  and the biggest hypocrit ever  That s the point of the book  Seeing the world from his point of view is fascinating  he s very cynical but naive  There parts where you just want to hit him  and others were you just want to hug him and cry along with him  He s very human  though  Especially around his siblings and his neighbor   It was terrific to read this book again after around 4 years and all  To tell you the truth  it killed me this time as well  even after all those crazy years  which is funny in a way  More than everything else  what kills me about The Catcher in the Rye is old Phoebe  I totally wish to be there every single time Holden says  I wish you could see old Phoebe   i m not kidding  Imagining her dragging the big suitcase and asking Holden to take her with him almost made me cry  it really did  I mean there are all those phony novels and movies in which siblings talk to each other in sentences that I swear no real brother or sister would ever use  And then there are Holden and Phoebe  Wish I could write more but it won t really matter  you know  You have to read the book to understand why it won t matter  But then maybe you won t understand  One can never be sure about these kind of things  One can never be sure about anything at all   I just re read this book for the first time as an adult  which has been a totally interesting experience in that a  i still loved it  b  it still held for me as a snapshot of the loner life  c  it made me realize how much i ve changed and how much i haven t  When I first read this book at  11 years old  I thought of Holden Caulfield as an idol  I agreed with him on everything  thought he was funny and charming  and saw beauty in his impulsiveness and strong opinions  And I continued to re read it about a million times through my teenage years feeling the same way every time  As an adult re reading this  I felt like Holden was giving up in so many ways  that it s a story about being truly lost and unable to adapt It gives me major teenage nostalgia for feeling like there s something better different for me and my life out there  but not knowing what it is  and throwing wild punches to figure it all out  Not sure I ve read another book that captures the lonely teenage life so accurately for me as this  Definitely my favorite book and for selfish reasons  like Holden I have read no other book that effectively translates the male adolescent anger  resentment  and rage that I felt as a youngster  Holden Caufield is a manifestation of many of my confusions  sufferings  and mixed emotions growing up and Salinger is one of my heroes for capturing so effectively this state for all to read and acknowledge the common ness of this turmoil  Almost all of his actions were easily justifiable for me and thus the central character became immediately sympathetic for me  Perhaps that is why I love the book so much and yet so many are perplexed by its popularity  Fight the power  I m with ya Holden  I was absolutely intrigued by the way Holden Caulfield perceives things  I really liked his character for he always remains true to himself  In fact  I think many of the teenagers can somewhat relate to the various scenes from this book  I think it s safe to say as a teenager  most of us feel lost sometimes and somewhere  having no clue about our future thus reading this book helps us to understand that we should stay hopeful and not to be so hard on ourselves at times  Read this for the first time when I was in Sophmore English Class with Mr  Hippy guy   can t remember his name  But loved it and loved it  I love his style of writing  it is as if he is either incredibly observant or hypervigilant or the most descriptive writer in the world  When I read this book I felt like Holden Caulfield and could feel his pain and torment   as life for a teenage boy about to be a man would experience  It is just such a classic book that everyone should read  I of course loved teh analogy wiht teh ducks on ponds in central park  Who takes care of those ducks I wonder  Great about flying on your own into the real world and into your freedom as an adult  Wonderful  I  3 you JD Salinger for writing so beatuifully as if I can read your mind   Obviously love it  Loved it long time  This is probably my seventh read or something  Maybe fifth  Maybe even just my fourth  It s really great though  I guess there isn t much to say of it  I already know how I feel of it  I reread it to write a unit plan on it  I have some decent ideas  I basically want to focus on putting the kids in Holden s shoes  Give them a sense of the times and of the mentality and just really make the read enjoyable I remember Professor Wenska tried to pitch this as a modernist text  not a coming of age  I definitely caught on to that nearer the end  I didn t have a pen with me on the metro so I didn t mark the spot that made me think of that  Holden said something specific near the end But yeah I was on the metro reading it  I was trying to meet with a girl from ODU and see some sights  I just broke up with Kate so I was feeling kind of fresh  Got to the city too late and tried to call Kristina to see if she d go on a date with me  She didn t answer so I got some dinner with Laura and then met up with Cookie  It was a fucking rad night  And definitely a good sitch to read Catcher  I remember reading it in Pittsburgh during Christmas  That was a damn fine time to read it  I might have been dating Laura at the time  Good person to date while you read it  I thought today   Man  maybe I ll give old Laura a buzz   Then old Kristina  I thought at dinner with Laura like she was Sally Hayes or something  I was going to say something rotten  but instead we had a good conversation I was furoiusly reading Mr  Antolini s advice while waiting for Michelle in the metro  It was all really good advice  and I ve already taken it  He was right about what he d said  I wanted to cry about having gotten here  having    just getting here I almost gave the book to a homeless woman at the Roslyn station  I was on the last page  literally  and I was going to give it to her  but then Laura rolled up and I needed to finish it so I took it with me  It s that one page chapter 26 As you near the end of the book you see a lot of frame structures  It s like the damned Wizard of Oz really  Wizard of 40 Oz I might add a comment if I look up the modernist selection I was talking about Damn fine day to read this goddamn book   Non ho nessuna voglia di mettermi a raccontare tutta la mia dannata autobiografia e compagnia bella    vi raccontero soltanto le cose da matti che mi sono capitate verso Natale  prima di ridurmi cosi a terra da dovermene venire qui a grattarmi la pancia  Irriverente  cominco  cinico  commovente  sfrontato  incomprensibile  incompreso  Holden Caulfield e l eroe eponimo di una intera generazione Scritto negli anni cinquanta  diviene libro di culto un decennio dopo  per poi legarsi alla generazione sessantottiana e diventarne punto di riferimento assoluto  Il giovane Holden  e forse uno dei primi romanzi che dipingono ed affermano prepotentemente il mondo adolescenziale come un mondo a se  rompendo inevitabilmente e irreversibilmente gli schemi  Straordinaria narrazione in prima persona  straordinaria prova di letteratura sempre innegabilmente attuale  I read this in high school and reread it for my book club  Within the first 50 pages I thought that this is indeed a great book  Love it and it is so interesting rereading it after 45 years   When I was 14 I used to hang out with a girl from the same school as me  She was a spoilt rich kid whose parents were too busy enjoying their own lives to bother much with her  She was a bit of a pain in the ass but totally great for hanging out in a huge house with unlimited access to computer games  food and booze  She also lent me this book   I didn t notice any similarities at the time   It struck a chord with the quiet disaffected rebel deep inside  Almost 20 years later  it still does  I m not going to analyse that too much    Term 3 QuestionsPlot Summary Catcher in the Rye is a narrated book by a fiction character Holden Caulfield  He tells of the time he left his school and had a bit of an adventure in New York City  He talks about life and the struggles that come along with it  The book has some humor in it but mostly just deals with questions about life  the good things and the things that have changed the world for the worse  Holden starts the story at a time in his life where he is getting kicked out of his school and this seems to be causing a little tension or stress in his life so he leaves for a little vacation downtown New York  We go through the two or three days of his adventures meeting people  going out and his thoughts throughout these experiences  Personal Response I enjoyed reading this book very much because of a couple reasons  One is that I am experiencing the same thoughts and experiences as what Holden talks about  He is ending his high school career and has to think ahead to what will become of him and therefore it is interesting for me to read this  Another reason is the topic of the book  I found myself laughing out loud  on the train  a number of times just because of the situations he got himself in   that killed me  and the way the book was written using a lot of 1950 s slang  The personality of Holden is also something I enjoyed and thought was a bit funny  he was described very in depth through his thoughts and actions which was good writing Analysis According to Worldview This book is written in first person  we can only hear the thoughts one person Holden Caulfield and therefore we as readers get a very good knowledge of his worldview  Holden is not the athletic type of guy in fact in the beginning he comes back from a fencing event and since he is the manger of the team  which he jokes sarcastically about  he was responsible for all the stuff but he left all the equipment on the train  This is a good example of the humor in the book  I say this because in the book you can tell that he is not totally stable in life yet  he does not know who he is  He is not a ladies  man like his roommate Stradlater and although he was good at English he wasn t a scholar  So through the book the reader learns more about him and we walk along with the narrator  Holden  to find out who he is One strong point about Holden is that he loves to converse with people  No matter how  phony  he thinks they are  he will always talk to them and enjoy a conversation  One example is when he phoned up an old buddy  Luce  from his old school just to talk to him because Luce is  a good conversationalist   By this you can tell that Holden s worldview does not consist of materialistic things like sports but he values relationships  Another strong point of Holden s worldview is that he loves his family  He does talk a bit of trash about his parents but he does still respects them and all his siblings as well  When he is down the most in the book he always thinks back to his sister Phoebe and we can tell that he finds comfort in her  she is also the reason he stays   Our rating  Outstanding Read the full review at  Lost In PagesReview by Poorna M The Catcher in the Rye by J  D  Salinger is a book that I think will always be relatable  A timeless sense of hopelessness pervades its pages  engulfing the reader in a void of despair and disillusionment that is the mind of the narrator and protagonist  seventeen year old Holden Caulfield Holden is not a child but not yet a grown up either  This is a period of time that everyone has experienced  and to an extent  never stops experiencing  For me  this is what made Holden s  story  memorable  It simply follows his rather spontaneous  and often drunken  escapades over the course of three days  after he is expelled from his boarding school  His observations and perceptions expose the banality of the real world  and of adult life  serving as a very astute commentary on the  phony  nature of everyday human affairs  I especially enjoy the stream of consciousness style of fiction  but even for those who don t  this novel isn t short of dialogue or action  There is an awkward incident with a prostitute  a confrontation with a pimp  and several other encounters with different types of people  The persisting feelings of alienation and isolation  rather than making Catcher a depressing read  force us to see the astonishing beauty in moments of innocence  I felt so happy all of a sudden  the way old Phoebe kept going around and around  I was damn near bawling  I felt so damn happy  if you want to know the truth  Holden s attitude remains unchanged at the story s end  differentiating the novel from other young adult fiction  If there is an overriding message to be understood  it is vague and unclear  but again  this is what makes the book so special  I was thoroughly content at the ending  and was grateful for the lack of dramatic character epiphanies or revelations  There s no  Hollywood like  element to the story  Holden by his own admission hates Hollywood   and no real purpose to his adventures  It is simply just an account of something that happened to a lonely teenage boy Read the full review at  Lost In Pages I found the book depressing  yet somehow up lifting in the end  I could actually feel every feeling Houlden had  all his hatred  frustration  annoyance  contempt  qualm he had  I could feel them all even though I am much of an optimist  Salinger s style is a mixture of depressing emotions and  amusing expressions  His free language  full of slang  his natural way of narrating a story and his sarcasm make you want to giggle and laugh at times  Nonetheless  if you look carefully into Holden s mind it will depress you  He is nothing more but a misfit teenager  who can t adapt to the enviroment and does not want to make any compromises  He hates phony people  he doesn t actually like anything  I think this hatred on everybody is a echo of the hatred on himself  Allye is haunting him because he is the replication of good memories  of a time when he was happy  among the people he loved and Pheobe reminds him of Alley  this is why he likes her so much  Pheobe is innocent  simple  she doesn t pretend to be what she is not and this is what he looks for in the human nature  that s the reason he likes Sally  she is also a ghost of a good time in his life  Not only is Holden confused  but also he doesn t try to make his life easier  He is sick of all this advice and all those people who seem to be a big shot or seem to know what has to be done in order to accomplish something  He doesn t have big dreams  no dreams for a career  all he wants is to be a deaf mute  to escape the need of communcationg to others  to live a humble life and get rid of all these worries and small things that are worth nothing to him  From where I stand  Holden s story is sad  He seeks some great happiness that is not provided by human relatonships or education  He is very confused and chaotic at times  He hires a prostitute and just talks to her because he feels sad  that is the point where I understood that Holden s nature is actually guided by heart and not by reason  It is depressing seeing a lonely teenager  seeking for happines and not being able to find it anywhere so he spits hate all around him  especially himself  It doesn t help at all  and he is conscious of it  this is why he just wants to run away  away from every thing that might make him sad  away from his past and everything  He can t help himslef and doesn t accept the help of people that are not in conformity with his standards I can relate to him in many ways  the confusion  the aggressiveness  the way he sees the world and the people  Every teenager can relate to him in certain ways  especially those that feel insecure  And  for everyone  being the catcher in the rye  is the representation of happiness  Muy buen libro  Lo volvere a leer en algun momento  El protagonista Holden a mi no me parecio negativo  solo estaba pensando mucho y eso es lo que hago yo tambien  Solo trato de no dejarme llevar por eso  Me identifique in monton  Me senti aliviada cuando termino     There is one thing about this book that everyone needs to know You either love it or you hate it For me  I loved it  Perhaps it s because I can easily identify with Holden  As well  there were many things I found intriguing about this book  like the way it was written so personally and intimate towards the reader  and also the mind set of Holden  where we see just how confused and stuck he is  I highlighted lines on almost every page in this book  There were so many great things and I would not recommend leaving this book on the shelf  If you are trying to decide whether to read it or not  the answer is simple  read it  You might just find that you love it  and if you don t  you haven t lost anything   I heard that when you read The Catcher in the Rye as an adult  it tends to disappoint  That wasn t the case for me  This is a very good book  When I was a teenager  I didn t relate to Holden  so as an adult  I wasn t disappointed to find him to be an immature teenager  That s how Salinger wrote him  Holden even admits he s immature several times  What impressed me was how Holden s voice got in my head  It was so vivid  I found myself imitating it in my own writing  That may be the real reason why so many people relate to Holden  Yes  he s having an existential crisis  and an adolescent one at that  but it s the strength of his voice that carries the book and makes you want to listen to him talk  Beyond that  the other characters are subtly and expertly drawn  emerging as whole people in just a few lines  It draws to mind another brilliant writer of characters  Dickens  When you consider that this book was written in the 1940s and that much of it is still relevant to life today  and certainly relevant to the 1960s  which this book owned  culturally speaking   there s no questioning that The Catcher in the Rye was way ahead of its time  It really was   lw  ny m lmst shy yshbhny fy hwldn lqlt  nh mryD wy ny mn

ktbh    Hsyt bHbT fj      This book talks about a 16 year old teenager who s sick and disgusted of how much people are fake in one way or another  and he s constantly thinking of escaping away to a place where no body knows him  I pretty much can see myself in that young man    The Catcher in the Rye is one of my all time favorite books  I read through the comments and I see that a lot of people think that Holden was a unthankful brat  I noticed that most of these people are adults  Adults just don t get it  I suppose that s understandable because a main theme of the book is that adults are phonies  I think that this is just a book that you have to read when you re a teenager  With most teenagers it just clicks  I feel like J D  Salinger wrote all my thoughts into a book  Holden is someone I can relate to  I honestly wish I could sit down and have a conversation with him  I ve heard a lot of people say that he is judgmental  but the fact is that he is completely honest about others  although he isn t completely honest to himself   He doesn t hold anything back and I respect that  It s like a breath of fresh air honestly  I love that it can still be a great story without much of a plot  It s so simple with out being simple at all  Every character and event is so complex  A writer could only hope to create characters like Salinger did  I suggest this book to every teenager in high school  And if your an adult reading it I hope that you will look at it with the mindset that you had as a teenager   Wow  I had tried reading this book before and couldn t really get into it  but this time around I froced myself through the first few chapters and Holden s story unfolded in all its simplicity and beauty  This book reminded me a lot of Alice in Wonderland in that the main character goes through a journey of seemingly unimportant events and at the end both the reader and the character feel very much changed  However I can see why a lot of people don t  get  it or just don t like it  Also I love Holden  He is one of my favorite characters  I love how in denial he is about so many things  he wants to be so independant because he feels like the world has failed him  but he cannot leave those he loves  I feel like Holden is in some ways the representation of the side of us society doesn t want to see  he doesn t want to please people he wants to be

courses in schools require the reading of this book  I think it s a classic  I became totally absorbed with the character who narrates the book  Fascinating   You can either absolutely love Holden Caulfield or want to freaking murder him  There s literally no between and I m still trying to figure out  after lots of re readings  which of them I feel This splendid and absolutely great book tell us the story of  as said before  Holden Caulfield  He just got expelled from highschool and he s trying to figure out what to do  Not much happens in this novel  but that s not important  The way to tell it is what makes this book what it is  With expresions like phony  flit  crumby and snowing and a peculiar way to tell the story  you can end up hating it or falling in love I read this book when I was 14 years old as a highschool assignment and it completely changed my mind  There is when started my interest in other kind of books than the  normal for my age  ones  Also  when I met my actual partner  we started talking about this book and now it has a lot more meaning to me Totally recommended for teenagers who don t wanna read the same exact stories labeled as  young novels   The fictional character of Holden Caulfield not important  his life is no where near dynamic enough to constitute a piece of literature  and the people with whom he interacts are ordinary and definable  Somehow  though  Salinger was able to produce a classic from what seems like nothing  This work is not about a gripping plot or taking some dramatic stance  it is about Holden Caulfield  The subtle exploration of this character s entire recollection creates a complex narrative that examines the fear  abandonment  pain  and isolation with which so many coexist  A Catcher in the Rye is a classic that captures the timeless struggles of growing up    Chang nghiem tuc khi anh muoi bay tuoi Dem tuyet voi  bo chanh da  la de Bo quan dong vui  den chum sang choi Nho cay xanh  tho than dao tren he

the RyeHolden Caulfield s transparent honesty makes him one of my favorite characters in all of literature  He doesn t care much about what other people think and lives as a comedic commentary on the absurd adult world  He cares deeply for his little sister  can t seem to figure out his emotions  and is torn about what he feels about growing up  He is changing  like the ducks in the park and unlike the artifacts at the museum  and he  like most of us when we are reading the book for the first or thirteenth time  isn t sure what he thinks about that either I think most of us can relate to the struggle for intimacy and the desire to be alone  the longing for community and the frustration when we are in it  Though his character is a young teenager  his comedy  innocence  and honesty is relateable at any age  I laughed out loud  and I can t wait to read it again A favorite quote  ch  17   If a girl looks swell when she meets you  who gives a damn if she s late  Nobody   Catcher in the Rye was a super quick read  Written in 1945 it shocked me with its uninhibited heavy themes  prostitution  homosexuality  alcoholism  depression  and suicide  It s easy to see why it was so controversial and even banned  Salinger creates a fantastic voice in young Holden  HIs voice is consistent throughout and reeks of teenage angst over human hypocrisies  I was surprised to enjoy such a negative story  One friend described Catcher in the Rye as  whiney   Yes  it is whiney but it serves a purpose and eventually you begin to understand and appreciate Holden s  whineyness   His character arch moves from a whiney schoolboy to an intelligent and highly sensitive adolescent  I loved Holden s relationship with his sister Phoebe  the one bright spot of the story  In their relationship  you recognize Holden s ability to love and have joy  Overall  this was a unique and terrific read  It is timeless in its depiction of the teenager  All teenagers should read Catcher in the Rye to feel they are never alone     not even in their darkest places  Awesome   I enjoyed this book  I decided to read it because I saw John Green s review videos and thought that it sounded good  It was slow at times for me  and I got annoyed with how whiny Holden was  I found the end to be conflicting  and I still can t decide if it was anticlimatic or not  I respect how it ended  but in a different point of view I feel like     TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT    WHY WOULD YOU STOP THE BOOK THERE     I think that is just my I need to know everything hardwiring in my brain  I look at the ending on both sides of the spectrum  and that makes me like the book more                                                                                                      After reading it a second time  I m definitely in a different frame of mind that I was two years ago when I read it for the first time  I love the ending and the realism of the book  When I first read the book  Holden annoyed me to no end  but now I feel more sympathetic towards him  He is left with basically nothing and keeps wanting to revert back to a time when things were simpler  when he was more naive  I suppose I am the sort of phony Holden Caulfield might disdain  since I read this book merely because it seems like one of those books one should be able to say they ve read  You know  to look cultured and well read and what not  But Holden thinks everyone is a phony anyway  so what are you gonna do I liked him  His cynical tone that rolled its eyes at everything matched my own jaded heart just enough that I was merrily amused  As he would say   It killed me   Sometimes I look at teenagers and they just have this dead inside look about them because everything is soooo dumb  and I just find it funny  Holden reminded me of that  Of course I could see he was a snotty little hypocrite  a lost little boy struggling with the fact that he had to grow up and be an adult  But that didn t make me dislike him  Because there was sadness there too  and a thoughtful  sweet boy beneath the cynicism Sometimes a rolling  wandering narrative dump like this can feel oh so pretentious and long winded  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  for example  which some have compared to this book   but Holden kept me caring  kept me smirking  I wanted to take care of him  Tell him to hush up now and come have a cookie  you  sonofabitch    What most people think of the book  and of Holden s character in particular  angers me  Apparently  Holden is either weak and foolish and whiny  or a hero  a reflection of the reader  depending on who picks up the book  In my experience with this book  I saw him as neither  I saw him as scared  and hurt  and pitiful  but certainly not weak  He was smart  and he did what he felt he had to  He was in over his head  whether you understand why  or even whether it was his own fault  or not  And for someone clearly dealing with some sort of psychological issues  anxiety  grief over his brother  he functions about as highly as expected  Better than expected  maybe  Holden Caulfield isn t an inspiration to me  He doesn t represent anything aspirational  But he is a very  very real character  Salinger s text reads like thoughts  or at least like my thoughts  capturing the patterns of a real teenager s brain  So please don t condemn Holden  What is he that s so offensive  Immature  Who wasn t young once  Scared  So what  Does that make him some kind of whiny bitch  Because if you think that  I think you re a bad person  The kid ends up institutionalized for gods sake  do you think that s a coincidence  He s sick  And if you admire him  remember that  He s sick  He thinks he knows what he wants but he doesn t  and he s scared of things he doesn t need to be and strays too close to what can really hurt him  Identify with him if you must  but don t try to be like him to make yourself better  Really  Holden doesn t get better over the course of this book  If you re in a place where you are depressed or grieving or anxious yourself  look to him as a symbol of what you could be  and be better  for you and for him   Gran bel libro  Descrive un ragazzo in fase adolescenziale  verso la fine dell adolescenza diciamo  che come molti a quell eta e insofferente verso tutto e tutti  Mi ci sono ritrovato abbastanza anche se ero meno irrequieto    waktu mula baca i was like haihh what is this book all about lah  diri sendiri pulak depressed bila baca haha  But then  lepas dah halfway n habis bcs  this book is really something  Like the author himself is trying to communicate with us thru this book  this phase  of being depressed an all  kita suma pernah lalui  its good to know how ones handle dia pya depression  Holden contohnya  and how its affects himself and people around him  last chapter buku ni i was wondering myself what d happen to Holden  but thinking abt it too much suddenly depressed me lol jki like this book  tho  dia mcm  lain dari y lain     What really knocks me out is a book that  when youre all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   From start to finish  this book used language  humor  and striking internal monologues to draw readers into the strange mind of Holden Caulfield in a way that few works can  His actions are rarely intriguing in and of themselves  but Salinger s ability to have Caulfield think about monotonous situations in intriguing and thought provoking ways will have readers constantly interested and excited to see what comes next  In addition to the innovative writing  this book also offers an interesting commentary on mental illness in adolescents  As the book progresses  it becomes more and more clear that Caulfield suffers from some form of bipolar disorder  and it seems that Salinger attributes his mental illness to his constant complaining and cynicism towards every person and event that he encounters  While many readers  such as myself  might not be able to really connect with the full extent of Caulfield s madness and bitterness  it is sure to send a resounding message to anyone who s gone through a phase of  teenage angst   and may even send a warning message to teens who find themselves set against the world  Took me until age 31 to finally read this book but I think I got more out of it now than I would have in high school  Great read   A classic in every sense  and one of my favorite books of all time  Salinger so perfectly captures the voice of Holden Caufield that it is easy to forgive his wallowing in self pity  In fact  on this read  I really wondered whether the book is more about Caufield dealing with the death of his brother  Allie  than a broader commentary on society  For sure  it seems to convey an  only the good die young  message  and his adoration for his little sister only adds to that point  But his grief underlies much of the narrative  and it is notable that the usual sources for answers   religion  medicine  etc    all make brief appearances that suggest no easy answers  Just like grief itself  I think   I think I was either a sophomore or a freshman when I first read this book  but it totally resonated  Holden Caulfield is an unlikely hero  since he indisputably is facing some issues  but I have a full fledged love for him  He is one of my favorite literary characters of all time  Mainly  felt Catcher in the Rye voiced the reality of being isolated in a socially exploding world  Holden knows people  he goes out to drinks with people  but that doesn t dispel his sense of aloneness  He has all kinds of crazy ideas  like moving to the mountains and pretending to be deaf  I d thought of moving to the mountains before   and the almost anticlimactic realization that he s being unreasonable has so much meaning  hint  it involves his lil sis   AWESOME   Catcher In The Rye written by J D Salinger is the novel that I m talking about  I think Salinger is one of those writers that I like to call him sometimes  As Holden said in the book about one of the provisions of a good writer In my mind a good book is one which you yearn to read it twice  but If you ve read Catcher In The Rye you thirst to read it over and over Holden Caulfield  the main character of this marchen is a sixteen years old rebel boy who have been fired and scaped of the high school  He strays in New York city for three nights  He experience a lot of things  The most important trait of Catcher In The Rye is the specific point of view of Holden Holden hates all of theostensive people in the converse head world Catcher In The Rye made me cry  but dont make a mistake   It s not a piteous opus  Catcher In The Rye is a masterpiece slunt that no opus can rival with it   I m not quite sure how many times I ve read this book  but at this point it s become a staple   my own personal safety book  Whenever I m mad or things aren t working out I can always turn to Holden Caulfield  Catcher in the Rye is a teen angst book  but it s the best teen angst book  It s not pretentious  it s not horribly depressing and the main character isn t struggling with his identity  Holden knows who he is and he s proud of it  The story revolves more around his waiting around for everyone around him to accept who is  And basically that s were all teen angst comes from  You accept who you are way before anyone else does  it s the period in which you re waiting around for them to catch up that s the hardest   After years of hearing about it  I wasn t sure what I d think about this book  As it turns out  I really enjoyed it  JD Salinger achieves one of the most vivid characterizations I have ever encountered  in the disaffected teenager Holden Caulfield  His use of vernacular and phrasing is unparalleled  creating an amazingly distinct and familiar seeming character  While this kid is very unlike me as a teen  and quite a piece of work if you want to know the truth  all the same I felt like I knew exactly where he was coming from at every step  In the end  this book made me laugh a lot  and it also caused me  in an indirect sort of way  to think about what is important in life  why we re here  and what we do with our time   While I was reading this book I was constantly thinking about why the American government considered this book a communist book in the 1950s  We discussed it in history class and the reason given was that the book depicted the failure of the  American dream   But really  I think this book tells it how it is  Holden Caufield is not a glorious protagonist but neither is he just a whiny self obsessed teenager  Really Holden s rather miserable view of the world is easy to understand once you ve read the book  We come across people and even ourselves being  phony  every day  It is difficult to review this book because there are so many different aspects to it  rebellion  mental illness  the language and comments on society etc  so I think I d really need to study it properly to form a clear thesis  In the end  I liked it because I could empathise with Holden  it was well written and the book took me straight to the 1950s while at the same time it gave a sense of timelessness  You can see why it s a classic and why it will continue to be so   The relationship between Holden and Phoebe is the best one I ve ever read  Oh  such a beautiful book that tells the story of life and adulthood  Might not be for anyone  but if anyone who understands the loneliness in life  they are teenagers   A very innocent one  You will surely laugh at many stuff  Somehow  you ll be lost in the character alone  Even if  let s say you re the nice guy or anything  you ll find yourself stuck on his body  It is one of a kind journey about finding one s self  Jess wrote   Kira wrote   Jess wrote   YOU ARE WRONG THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING YOU HAVE NO TASTE FOR CLASSICS Just because it s a classic doesn t mean it s good  Well tbh I was going to say  no taste  but I figured that d be mean  And this book was good  it was well written and you can t just say it s bad because you don t like the narrator  This book is amazing and thought provoking in a strange way  I absolutely adore it  Easily my favourite book and I would recommend it without a moments hesitation  This is definitely and iconic book that will stay with me forever  Absolutely amazing   Its not really like stories with high expectations of sudden rise or fall  I loved the flow  the causality which shapes it more natural in fact  Its about happiness which rose out of innocence of little girl which filled his heart with joy  and that was it  that s all he wanted to tell  Simple and Beautiful La primera vez que lei este libro  me identifique mucho con Holden Caulfield  Ahora que lo relei  debo confesar que me cayo un poco mal  pero aun asi me parece un muy buen libro Aqui esta mi comentario en Youtube http   youtu be 6o5pNvULaA8  Jo  me ha dejado sin habla   Esto es lo que yo opino de este libro De verdad que fantastico  hacia tiempo que no devoraba un libro en dos dias por la facilidad de leer  las sonrisas que me sacaba  y lo interesante de la trama  si bien me esperaba que abarcara un espacio temporal mayor  No me ha decepcionado en absoluto  Aunque  entiendo que haya quienes lo detesten  No se por que  no coincido en absoluto con ellos pero creo que es uno de esos libros que o amas o odias  sin punto medio Yo lo adoro a partir de ahora    What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff    I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy     Holden CaulfieldIf you haven t read this novel  and you should now of all times  in honor of the late J D  Salinger   do yourself and dismiss all of the criticism that seems to be en vogue  Some readers now see Holden as a whiny kid  never content with his station  From my perspective   more than ten years older than Holden and more than ten years removed from my first reading of the novel   he is a pioneer  He changed the way I consider the act of growing up  just as this novel may well have changed literature as we know it   wmn byn l shy lty swf tktshfh  nk lst lnsn lwHyd fy ltrykh ldhy khtlT  lyh l mr wrt b bl wtqzz mn lslwk lnsny  lst wHdk ldhy t ny mn hdh lsh wr  wswf yzdd Hmsk wtkbr

 Believe it or not  this isn t the first school he s been kicked out of  Holden ends up going to New York and goes on adventures and gets himself into massive messes  Holden is constantly trying to preserve the innocence of the world  but fails all the time  Holden is not used to receiving affection from anyone  even his own family       he was sort of petting me or patting me on the goddam head   211   He ends up fleeing at the sight of affection   I have to go  anyway   212   When Holden goes to visit Phoebe  he is in need of money and Phoebe ends up giving him her Christmas money and he starts crying  I throughly enjoyed the book and loved the amount of sarcasm Holden used  He uses sarcasm  hyperbole  paradox  and apostrophes a lot  I would like to say that I will go back and read this book and take it word by word when I have time   Don t ever tell anybody anything  IF you do  you start missing everybody   234    I tried to read this book a few years ago  but I couldn t finish it after a few chapters  So when I decided to give this book a second chance  honestly  I was a little dubious  Holden Caulfield is my new best friend  The soul mate kind of friend  I feel so related  so connected to him in many ways  I truly understand every word he says  I can see the phoniness  the ugly side of people  but I don t hate them and I m not mean  I think  P  I m tired of school  of phony education that I have to endure everyday  But most of all  like Holden and a normal teenager  I feel lost sometimes  like you don t know the right way to go  what to do with your life  Since reading this story  I m not afraid anymore    Another thing I like about Holden is that he has a good sense of humor  Trust me  it makes me laugh out loud so many times  I don t know why I used to think the book was boring  maybe it s just the matter of timing   view spoiler   It wasn t mentioned in the book  but I think Holden will be a teacher  because he has a loving heart  he s good with children  and isn t that he wants to be The catcher in the rye    hide spoiler   Such a deep beautifully written book  but in a simplistic manner    Catcher in the rye is perfect for anyone looking for a interesting and not at all monotonous classic   This book is really really good  It takes place in the early 1920 s about a boy who got kicked out of prep school  It s a really depressing book  but it s funny so thats what makes the book interesting  The main character  Holden Caufield  he gives a really hateful and hilarious perspective on the world and kind of those 1920 cliches and stereotypes that he experiences  It s really wierd because it teaches you that the world can be a cold cold place and it can lead you to becoming something you re not  and the main character takes every detail and experience he deals with in the book into perspective and dissects it like it  s under a microscope  When you re feeling lonely and sad  read this book  It will make you feel better  Snachala na russkom prochitala knigu  kotoraia prinadlezhala Dime  a potom cherez god prochla v originale  potomu chto ne byla uverena v svoikh oshchushcheniia i vpechatleniiakh posle prochteniia v pervyi raz   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   God I love this book First of all it s kind of hard to explain why I love Catcher in the Rye since my reasons are highly personal and I was not even in the mood explaining some of my past life experiences just for you to understand why I felt such great connection and empathy with Holden Caufield  Just put it this way that once in my teenage life I ve experienced alienation and depression  It was painful and it really made me sad and depressed that through this novel I was able to remember those things that I really don t want to even remember See I am depressed  This book made me depressed It just made me realized some things like when maybe sometime in the future you ll meet someone  a person who doesn t have anyone to talk to  it is important that you listen to them  just listen  and maybe that was enough for them  Sometimes this world and this life is such a sad place to live in but if you know that there is someone willing to stay with you or be your friend  it doesn t seem so sad anymore More Things I like about it 1  It was an easy read  even if it s a Classic book surprisingly it was very easy to read unlike Pride and Prejudice and The Great Gatsby  note  I didn t even finish these two books because my head exploded while I was reading them  2  It was very similar to The New Dress by Virginia Woolf and what a surprise they even have the same  stream of consciousness  style and the  non linear plot  style  Mind you I love The New Dress but Catcher in the Rye was way better 3  Symbolism   ducks  was actually Holden Caufield   When Holden Caufield was asking the cab driver what will happen to the ducks in the pond during Winter  What he was actually trying to say is that   What will happen to me during this winter   red hunting hat  security blanket when Holden says  You  in the narrative he actually means  I One Thing I Don t Like About It1  The book was very  Anti Girl  I just didn t like it that Holden says so many negative things about women and that he really generalizes women  Like for example he had an experience with this girl and he ll say something negative about it and then after that he will generalize it that  All girls are like that  and that was really way over the belt and that s just faulty generalization  I am a girl and all the negative things mention in this book about  girls in general  were highly ridiculous and so not true Book Reviews by John Green  themissingn and 60 second recap    I recommend you to watch these if you wanna

Caulfield  the gray haired sixteen year old who tells this story  As far as a storyline goes  this one isn t the best   Not much happens  actually   But it shows the complexity of character  how condescending and ironic we all can be  but specifically it is shown in Holden  who loathes phonies but says  I m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life   He s so blunt though  you re likely to start envying him a little  because he has such a strong view on absolutely everything  They re not profound in any way  so don t get your hopes up  but they re funny as hell  It s an easy read and entertaining in the least  Honestly it will have more of an appeal to a younger audience because of its rather rebellious nature  and the simple fact that it s basically a teenaged boy rambling on about his views in life  but he embraces his eccentricities and idiosyncrasies  and I think that s something that about every age group can appreciate  This book isn t for everyone  I ve told friends to read it and they  didn t get it   but as far as being a book without a beginning or end  you will never find another book with more voice than The Catcher in the Rye  It s immature but also captivating  evoking empathy  it s one of the funniest things I ve ever read but still managed to be a little sad  Holden is confused and unhappy  but it s caused by things that aren t expected  He decides he can t sleep with a prostitute because it s too depressing  and he feels sorry for her  Holden Caulfield is a character who feels  someone with a moral compass who screws up a lot too  The compassion he shows forces you to look at everyone you know differently  wondering about all that they think throughout a couple days  rwy   n mrhq  mryky nqm  l  lmjtm  w zyfh w qrfh slwb lrwy

character  cracked me up  I very much appreciated his use of the word  gorgeous  in an incredibly sarcastic manner   One guy kept saying to the other guy   Hold the sonuvatbitch up  Hold it up  for Chrissake   It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a Christmas tree   A teenager full of angst and assertiveness  Holden didn t achieve much in this book  but he did keep me eagerly coming back  His relationship to his sister was refreshing  because  as a reader  I was beginning to think that he cared for no one    or no thing  for that matter  I have always wondered what the title of this book meant  and I m happy to now know  It s a very telling moment when Holden explains the concept of the catcher in the rye  it reveals a lot about the seemingly cynical and angst filled teenager  He s actually just very pragmatic and innocent and idealistic  in my opinion I ve heard many people  including my husband  say   nothing happened in  The Catcher in the Rye   but I think nothing is sometimes the best thing   The original classic about a troubled teenager coming of age  So many have tried to imitate this one and so many have failed  The rest have misunderstood or even banned Salinger s novel  I first read this one in high school and have reread it several times since  Each time is a new experience  I always think about the part where Holden takes a snowball in a bus  When the driver chastises him  Holden replies that he is  just holding it   Classic  Perfect  Strange that such an anti social man would have such a handle on that most elusive of all species     the troubled young teen  It is more and more apparent to me how troubled Holden is each time that I read the book   this is especially true in light of all of my experiences with teenagers  He certainly shows all the signs of serious depression and the classic ability of troubled teenagers to deflect all of the real issues at hands  Mr  Antolini s advice to Holden towards the end of the book really hit home for me  as an older  wiser person  Made me think of all the misdirected  Holden  moments in my life  And that s what great literature does boys and girls   Read this after I graduated high school when I felt like I didn t read enough classics  btw still feel that way   I loved it  He is a perfect unreliable narrative  White man version of The Bell Jar  Feelings of loneliness and the  phoniness  is exactly how I felt during my depression    If they fall off they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   The Catcher in the Rye symbolizes a lot more then a kid going through hard times  This book talks all about the coming of age and turning into an adult  Holden obviously knows his struggles and what he is going through and does not want Phoebe to go through the same thing  In this book  we can conclude that Holdens red hat symbolizes him accepting Phoebe going through adolescents  Holdens red hat is actually a hunting hat  He wore this hat all the time and the hat did not exactly  fit in  in the city  This hat is a symbol for his character  and how Holden seperates himself from everyone else  When Holden gives Phoebe his red hat  we can conclude that this is him accepting Phoebe growing up  Another iteam that symbolizes adolescents is the golden ring  Near the end of the book  Phoebe is riding a carousel while Holden is watching  He watches it spin while all the kids are trying to reach the gold ring  Holden says how he was not sure if it was very safe and that it looked like it could break  Thats when Salinger said  If they fall off they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   This quote is not just talking about the carousel  but growing up in general  If parents guide there kids through everything  they are never going to learn  So sometimes parents need to let there  kids fall off  so they can learn for themselves  Many teenagers can relate to The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger because it focuses on situations and theme that all teenagers experience  Most kids hate to disapoint there parents  so did Holden  Thats why he roamed around New York for three days in the cold  He could not bear having to tell his parents he got kicked out of school  In multiple reviews  they all state that the book is banned because of the language and references used in this book  but with out it  it would not have as great as an impact  This book was written in the 1950 s  where words like  goddamn  and  phony  was looked down upon  Now of days  words like these can be heard all the time  I think if this book was reevaluated  it would get unbanned  The value of the book itself  is greater then the language used in it  This book is a very relateable and understandable book for teenagers  This doesnt mean all teenagers are getting with prostitues and smoking  but all kids go through adolesecnts  experience lonliness  and uderstand what its like being left out  The book was banned because of Holdens actions and language  but the value of what he learned through that is significant  As previously stated  I dont think this book should be banned  as it really has a great story line  When I first started reading this book  I did not like it  I thought there was unnesecary details and at first  did not really relate  As I continued to read the book  I realized that in many ways  teenagers can relate to Holden  He distances himself from people because he doesntt hink he will be accepted  He knows how that made him feel and wanted to save his sister from that feeling  After realizing why he is the way he is with Phoebe  I was able to connect with the book  I understand why he is protective over her  and feels the way he feels  When I finished the book  I enjoyed it a lot  Personally  I think all high school english classes should have to read it  Although some wont admit it  many teenagers will be able to relate to this book at one time or another  My overall response to this book was a positive one and I would reccomend it to any high schooler and even parents  So if your looking for a good read  this book may be the one for you   Brilliant    In the beginning it feels as if it isn t going anywhere and all of a sudden it hits you  That anger ridden angst  That feeling that nobody understand you  That ego that tells you that tells you they are not on your level  I love that it ends on the peak of the  fuck you  scene  That was just the cherry on the sundae  It damn near killed me    When I finally finished this book and sat down to rate it  I was unsure  I enjoyed the book as a cute little story  but I didn t understand why it was so great  There was nothing particularly remarkable about the story  No one got hit by a car or shot in the woods by their best friend  So due to the fact that I didn t understand it much  I gave it four stars  Then I remembered what someone  John Green  specifically  had said about the hunting hat  He said in a vlog that it was one of his favorite metaphors  I didn t understand the metaphor  so I decided to look it up  When I finally got it  my appreciation for this novel skyrocketed  There s just something about the role of the  catcher  and the exchange of roles that just excited me  I always get excited when I find a good metaphor in a novel  That s why I liked The Great Gatsby so much  I feel a sympathy for Holden for his  falling   and it has made me realize that I fell a long time ago  I guess I m going to be one of those people that just love this novel  I read this book first when I was maybe 15 years old  I remember liking it then  but I don t remember it ranking as a favourite book Upon rereading it now at 23 years old  I am firmly placing it in my favourites shelf  I was a bit worried I d find Holden insufferably annoying and teen angst y  as he is the poster boy for angst y pretentious teens  now that I m not also an annoying teenager  but more than anything I just found his observations hilarious  I don t know  maybe I like him because I m still a bit of a baby and a compulsive complainer and thus I can find a way to relate to the tiresome bullshit he s constantly spewing  I really think Salinger created a distinct  unforgettable  nuanced character in Holden Caulfield and if you hated his guts and wanted to smack him for being such a phony himself  that s kind of the point  Yes  he s a spoiled  shallow asshole much of the time  but there are redeeming subtleties in his character that come out in his endless diatribe against everything and anything  These subtleties are particularly apparent in his ponderings about the nuns he meets  about the infamous Jane Gallagher  and about his brother and sister  Honestly  I m surprised I like this book as much as I do since I generally loathe whiny  mopey YA protagonists  but there s just something about this book that works for me  It s something about the way Salinger writes  He s somehow managed to make me retain a fondness for this self centered  moody a hole  Also  all these goodreads reviews shaming people for liking this book are not a good look   Definitely one of my favorite writers  ever  His cynical  even humorous perception of the world and the life around him is exceptional  I remember when I was reading Franny and Zoey when he used three to five pages of pure simple monologue about the comprehension of the world s greatest questions and mysteries  and I remember falling in love with his writing right then and there  I only wish I could erase my memory and read it all over again  which I am planning on doing nonetheless  I am re reading classics that I haven t looked at since high school or college  I just finished this book last night  a masterpiece  Even better than the first time I read it  Older and wiser     now  I understood so much more  Although some minor details are out of date  like the way kids talk  their culture etc  this book was written in mid 1940s  Catcher in the Rye still says so much more about what it is like to leave childhood and join the world of grown ups   phonies   than any book I have ever read  Anyone trying to understand young people or any kid who feels utterly alone  bewildered by the process of growing up  should read this book  It is a beautiful  sad  wise book   I read Catcher in the Rye over the summer for AP English 3  The book was very interesting  but extremely depressing  The way the story was written really intrigued me in the sense that I constantly wanted to know more about Holden Caulfield  the main character  The book was almost addicting to me and I wasn t sure why while reading it  I finished the book in one sitting because I was really hooked  Though throughout the story everyone and everything was being harshly critiqued  being called phony and what not  the story was still grasping  I felt myself relating to Holden more than I originally did at the beginning of the book  Holden was just a boy stuck in the teen ages between a fun childhood and a more hard working adulthood  This is how I feel at times in life as well as other teens the same age   shkran jwny dyb   bsbb fnny lmfDl  rftu  n

a vivir humildemente por ella    Desde el principio supe que este libro me iba a terminar gustando mucho   Por que  Porque me senti plenamente identificada con Holden  en muchas formas y sentidos  Desde la primera frase pense  asi soy yo  y a medida que iba leyendo  yo senti eso alguna vez  Puede que muchas personas no le encuentren  la vuelta  a este libro  pero a mi me toco en distintos aspectos Estoy muy contenta de haber tomado la decision de leerlo en este momento  porque llego en el momento justo  Llego cuando mas lo necesitaba Desde que lo empece me parecio como si hubiera sido escrito este mismo ano  Tal vez por eso sea un clasico  porque cada a cada persona lo pueda adaptar a su propia vida  a sus propios sentimientos  y porque estoy segura que en cualquier epoca calzaria perfectamente Me gustaria expresar todo lo que senti leyendolo  pero es que quede maravillada  y toco tan hondo en mi que tal vez solo sienta eso que sintio Holden en algun momento de la historia   Hay cosas que no deberian cambiar  cosas que uno deberia poder meter en una de esas vitrinas de cristal y dejarlas alli tranquilas   Definitivamente este libro quedara guardada en un lugar muy dentro de mi  junto al lado mio mas Holden Caulfield que estoy segura que todos lo tenemos   Veras que no eres la primera persona a quien la conducta humana ha confundido  asustado  y hasta asqueado  Te alegrara y te animara saber que no estas solo en ese sentido  Son muchos los hombres que han sufrido moral y espiritualmente del mismo modo que tu  Felizmente  algunos de ellos han dejado constancia de su sufrimiento  Y de ellos aprenderas si lo deseas  Del mismo modo que alguien aprendera algun dia de ti si sabes dejar una huella  Se trata de un hermoso intercambio que no tiene nada que ver con la educacion  Es historia  Es poesia    I can t even explain how much I love this book  The conflicted teenager  Holden Caulfield  is a total pop culture icon in my opinion  I feel like he is the voice for all teenagers who are struggling to find out their true identity and who constantly has a inner battle with themselves  I ve had my own copy of this book since I was in 9th grade but never finished the book until we had to read it in 11th grade  New York City being the setting was also near and dear to my heart  I ve always taken summer vacations to the Big Apple for as long as I can remember and knowing the places that were mentioned in the book made me feel like I was really there at the moment that Holden was  This is a must read if you haven t  This was my second time reading  The Catcher in the Rye   Generally speaking  I never re read books  Hell  I ve never even repeated reading Harry Potter and I know a LOT of folks who make it like a yearly mission to do so  But anyways  yeah  I read this book for the first time simply for pleasure and I enjoyed the hell out of it  The second time  I read it for school  and once again  found myself really digging this classic Honestly  I don t know what it is that is so enjoyable about this novel  If you think about it  there aren t really that many redeeming qualities to be found anywhere within its pages  Holden is quite a pretentious prick  really  I mean all he does is bitch and complain throughout the entire book that he s better than everyone else  That everyone is either a  phony  a bastard  or a sonuvabitch   He doesn t like much of anything  and anything he does happen to like  he somehow still manages to find fault with  Not only that  but he s arrogant  spoiled  and a dirty rotten liar  Maybe that s why I liked him though  Salinger did an absolutely bang up job in writing from Holden s perspective  It s pretty much spot on for the mind of an adolescent boy  I remember those days  when I was a moody  emo teen who wanted nothing to do with my parents  or any of my classmates  or much of anything in general  because I was too  cool  for stuff  I hated my classmates and their  cliques  and everything they did  Far too often there are authors who think they can write about kids or teens and fail miserably   cough cough Dean Koontz   Salinger on the other hand was damn near perfect  I also could identify with the dry  sarcastic wit of Holden  I found this book funny before  but on a second inspection  there really is a lot of satirical  funny  and sarcastic observations from the mind of a restless teen  His description of sex is hilarious  as is his hatred for jocks and popular kids  It s a smart kind of humor  a bit highbrow  though I found myself chuckling more than once  I guess it makes sense that this novel has become so immensely popular since its publication in the early 50 s  Every kid thinks their situation is unique and nobody understands their plight in life  However  it s obvious those feelings are nothing new  Clearly teens today aren t the first and most assuredly won t be last of angst filled adolescents and because of that  Salinger s novel provides that quintessential character to sympathize with   No big plot  no huge quest  it s probably why it took a month for me to finish the darn book  Sure  the main character  Holden Caulfield s  angst and hypocracy got annoying  not to mention his repetitive and weird little phrases  but in the end  I understood him  It wasn t just the faults of others he saw  but his own too  He had a lighter side  an observant  and even sociable side   I hated them once in a while and I admit it but it doesn t last too long  is what I mean  After a while  if I didn t see them   I sort of missed them    I like books like these  just about some kid s life and his opinions  Nothing fancy  But I wouldn t recommened Catcher in the Rye if you need a lot of drama and excitment in a book  I can see why this is so many people s favourite book  It s brilliant  yet I cannot put my finger on what makes it so  The first few pages help you understand  you understand Holden s ways and his strange ideas  You see the world through his eyes  despite those sights being distorted by either ignorance or experience  you understand  Holden  an exquisitely rendered character It s a book you cannot spoil  it doesn t seem to have a plot  The way it s written is just like Holden is talking to you  he s telling you about his pain Every character we meet  he speaks to  but they don t listen  so finds someone else It s sad  He s alone  afraid  scared and no one ever hears him because no one can be bothered to listen The beauty of this though  is the fact there are two Holden s  The one whose living the story  and the one who s telling it  The beauty of the second Holden  telling us about his past  is the prospect of hope  also found in the red cap same colour as Allie s hair  Supposedly I read this in high school  but other than a few details  I honestly did not remember the story  This time around however  I really enjoyed it  It is assigned reading for my son this semester so I decided to read along with him  He and I have had some great discussions  There are many critics of this book and I feel like it boils down to one thing  you like Holden Caulfield the narrator and main character  or you don t  Many apparently felt that he was just as bad as all the people in his life he lamented about  I felt differently  I wondered why all of the adults in his life failed him  Those he did turn to  unfortunately were the wrong kind of people  He was so obviously on the slippery slope of depression  I wanted to jump into this story and  catch  him myself  Many of his observations were humorous in the telling  but underneath was his cry for help  If you looked past the surface of Holden s narrative  you could see the lonely  sad  misunderstood  intelligent and compassionate boy he really was  His love for his siblings was heart wrenching  When asked what he wanted to be  he responded   The Catcher in the Rye   He wanted to save children from losing their innocence and falling into the sad  painful and scary world of adults  He felt guilty over the death of his younger brother and wanted to  save  his little sister Phoebe  As much as he wanted to run away from it all  he wouldn t allow himself to hurt her by leaving  It deals with some  heavy  subject matter for teens so I m glad they are taking time to discuss and address these in school  As an adult    a moving read   I m working on a response to this  but not for Goodreads  So while some may love it  some may hate it  but they re all phonies so it doesn t matter  The Catcher in the Rye is a story about a cynical kid named Holden who is trying to grow up too fast  While some may say it s a bit inconsistent and whiny  I truly enjoyed it as it allowed me to immerse in Holden s narrative and roll around in my own  negativity  for a while  Catcher has been one of the most liberating reads in a while for me  as Holden and I share similar perspectives on life  Not only is the narrative good  but the characters are believable  despite Holden being the rare example of an alienated outcast in a time where society wasn t fully satirized yet  It may make you laugh  cry  vomit or all three  but I enjoyed the book just in the fact that it speaks to me  I think this is the first book that I read that made me realize what reading meant  I was fourteen and on a family vacation  I spent the whole afternoon leaned up against a tree reading in an amazed stupor  I m putting this up there as my Number 1 book Why I picked it up I bought it shortly after the most amazing trip to New York and wanted to experience American literature which has always sat in the shadow of the English classics  Why it deserves 5 stars I can really relate to the theme of disillusionment in one s environment  the period of inspiration to do something radically different  then the lack of commitment or courage to follow through  For some reason I have found this never ending cycle apparent in various phases of my life  The story is straight forward and flows like a typical narrative  making it an easy and captivating read  To follow the character through a literary tour of Manhattan makes it a whole lot more entertaining  allowing me to do a bit of  armchair travel  and relive some of my trip to NYC Who have I recommended it to Someone considering a complete career change  from corporate to not for profitSomeone who struggled to fit in at an exclusive private boys school  but thrived once out of that environment  Well    I can t really tell why do I like this book so much  I first read the translation of it when I was 12  Or 13  don t remember exactly  Perhaps  because someonetold me that it s a good book to read  I still remember that the day I read it as a kid was nice and happy  But that s not the point I wanted to stress though  I keep thinking of it as I tend to meet people who remined me of it as they have some of Holdens ideas of getting out from their environment  Getting out in that coarse way just living everything behind and going away without even a handbag  Someone may want Holden to grow up  but he abandoned his ideas of going away when his sister told him she would ge with him  Guess what happend then and why  I think  that was the point And I mean I meet people who have no reason to comprehend these ideas  They are about twenty though  And they try to make it all real  Most come back fortunately  But I knew the guy who didn t come back alive  He was 27  I know that he was the only one who wanted to come back  but not the two who went with him  but who did come and without him  The life is much more simple than what we think  And the mind is big enough to think about ourselves  other people and anything comes to mind  Take it easy and do everything you like  Let s not to work for public eyes  There is nothing to stick at   Be like river and roam wherever you like      DISCLAIMER  I know the immediately conclusion that will be drawn by those of you who stalk my blog and are non fans of me  but no   I am not a deranged killer because I give The Catcher in the Rye five stars nor am I of the mindset that  no one understands me  which is the tone of Salinger s great American novel  The voices in my head understand me just fine  I first read this book when I was in middle school  At the time  I was living in small town Georgia and it was the modern world of the eighties  This is important to know since the  why  I read this book is just as important in order to understand my love for it  You see  people tend to forget  or just gloss over the fact  that censorship still exists  Overzealous parents try to protect their precious little princes and princesses from the harsh realities of life and history by deeming works of art and literature  offensive  run rampant even today These are the same nitwits that recently had the word  nigger  removed from Huckleberry Finn  Gasp  That s right  I typed the word  I have black friends  many of whom hate the phrase  African American   and I even dated a lovely black woman once  And a Latin one  And an Irish one  But I digress   Lenny Bruce once said  it s the suppression of the word that gives it the power   Forgetting or hiding  the bad  in  our  history or life doesn t make it go away  it merely takes away the lessons that can be learned from it  So no  I m not even slightly racist because I used a that word earlier  I just hate hiding language that exists to remind us that the world isn t rainbows and roses 24 7 BACK TO SMALL TOWN GEORGIA IN THE EIGHTIES  My parent  like most  were far from perfect  God bless them  though  for their occasional nugget of genius that kept them separated from the masses of society  My mother received a list of the books that were being banned from our public schools via the local PTA    one day and instantly became infuriated  Mom grew up in the New Jersey New York area  so she was still having trouble adapting to the slightly different mindset offered in the south  The idea of banning books just was something she thought didn t exist any more  See my earlier Huckleberry Finn reference where I just learned the same sobering lesson  So my mother did what she felt made the most sense when presented with something as ludicrous as a  banned book  list  She started buying them for her son This was the first one on the list I have read The Catcher in the Rye at least once a decade  Each time  I find myself enthralled for a different reason    In my youth  it was the thrill of reading something that  according to the local education system  was  bad     When I was in my twenties  in college and living on my own  it was relating to the world of indecision that Holden Caulfield deals with   More recently  I read it again last year  it is my current fascination with the past from years before I was born Reading that the 1950s wasn t as sanitized as the image portrayed on the television of the era is a sobering reminder of how much things are still the same regardless of cell phones  computers and the Internet  The core issues that humans have to endure are the same now as they were then  and the ignorance that seeks to pretend otherwise is still among us Just ask Holden Caulfield or Huck Finn     As I much as I detest the main charachter  I believe there is a Holden in all of us  In time  as we  mature up  we lose him  thankfully   This is a great book describing the destructuvive effects of  not being content with anything   Favorite quote   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one    Lagi belajar nulis review kalau bikin mata anda sakit tolong diabaikan saja Absolutely become one of my favorite book  It s scary how i can related to Holden s feelings about people around him  Sepanjang buku ini saya seperti ditarik ke masa remaja di mana saya mulai menunjukkan sikap rebel  menutup diri  galau  angst yg berlebihan  anti sosial  tapi tidak separah Holden sih yang sampai dikeluarkan dari sekolah nya  Ini salah satu buku yang sangat saya rekomendasikan pada anak muda yang masih mencari jati diri  yang depresi  yang merasa sebal dengan orang orang palsu disekitarnya atau merasa berbeda dengan lingkungannya  ini buku buat kamu  buku yang menyuarakan apa yang kamu rasakan Saya hampir tidak percaya kalau buku ini ditulis 50 an tahun yang lalu  Membaca buku ini berasa membaca salah satu buku YA yang ditulis sama John Green  tidak terasa jadulnya  Cuma satu yang menandakan ini settingnya jaman dahulu  every body was a heavy smoker  dari Holden sampai mamanya Holden semuanya perokok  dan si Holden merokok di samping Phoebe adiknya  I m not okay with that  but itu jaman dahulu  mereka masih belum aware sama bahaya asap rokok  jadi masih termaafkan Saya bisa mengerti kalau ada yang benci sama buku ini  kadang saya juga berasa jengkel dan gregetan sama si Holden  dia kadang terlalu jauh terperosok dalam kedepresiannya dan ketidak sukaannya sama semua orang  kayak dia orang paling suci saja hehehe  saya ingin dia cepat cepat tobat jangan galau melulu  tapi kalo dipikir pikir lagi dan diresapi apa yang dia pikirkan kadang ada benarnya juga sih Dan yang bikin saya lebih kesengsem sama buku ini  quote quotenya banyak yang bagus  cocok dijadikan status facebook kalo lagi galau hahaha  I read it back in high school  but it remains one of my favorites  I m one of those people that will say  what do you mean you ve NEVER read The Catcher in the Rye    and make people feel bad  I thought this was an excellent book  It follows the meandering trail of a disaffected teenager who was just expelled from the latest of a long line of schools  Not ready to share the news with his family he takes whats left of his bank account and kills a couple days in New York The main characters an interesting guy  Bright  but flawed  Kind of looking for his idealized place in the world  but obviously not going to find it on his current route  He s naive but well intentioned  from an introspective standpoint I read a lot of mixed reviews to this story  It seems to me that certain folks that don t like it are reading it  or understanding it  incorrectly  They end up reading the main characters controversial narrative like it s something they have to defend themselves against  For example  the teenager constantly refers to those around him as phoney s any time he detects insincerity  even polite insincerity  The author doesn t write the teenager to be the voice of reason  to be indisputably correct  He writes the teenager to be flawed  to be a teen  without direction in life  and looking for a path that literally no adult can give him  At one point the teenager is talking and explains what he d like to do with his life  He explains that he wants to stand on the edge of a cliff  outside a field of high grass where children play  and stop any of them that come to close to the edge before they topple over  unaware of the danger ahead of them In the last chapter  he s preparing to go west  and run away from home to work on a ranch or fill gas tanks for a living  or some other impractical dream  When his sister lugs around a suitcase to join him  She idealizes him to the point where she decides to drop everything to be with her big brother  An impractical and horrible decision considering he can barely take care of himself  At this point he has the chance to literally fulfill his dream and catch his sister before she stumbles ahead into danger  When she refuses to go home without him  he decides to take her back to the house  After the 3 preceding  depressing and lonely days  he gets his first glimpse of happiness as he spends some time with her  It was this crisis that could perhaps change his entire path in life  as he catchers her from stumbling over the symbolic cliffs  Great symbolism  great narrative  I highly recommend this book  I read this when I was in ninth grade  I actually like Salinger s NINE STORIES much better  although I think THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is on a par with NINE STORIES  The fact that J  D  Salinger has never allowed this to be made into a movie is praiseworthy  He has written a book which is in the minds of several generations and he doesn t owe Hollywood anything  This resistence to having hius work translated to film is a large part of his gift to literature On top of that  the book is marvelous for the sustained voice of the young  increasingly disillusioned narrator  THE CATCHER IN THE RYE has more in common with eighteenth century novels told in the first person than with most of modern literature  Holden Caulfield has never been played by an adolescent flavor of the month  his story hasn t been turned into a situation comedy  no director has overshadowed the author of this most original work  This can t be said of Ken Kesey  James Jones  Joseph Heller or even Kurt Vonnegut  Salinger s work stands on its own and has for more than fifty years  It was a good read  Well  actually  it was a great read  and I am aghast and wondering as to why I never picked it up before  I mean  a mate of mine once gave me this novel some years ago  and it s been biting dust on my shelves ever since  I keep a lot of stuff in my life biting dust really  which is a shame  because I know for sure those things deserve more than that  like  the Catcher in the Rye   So I had my elders sent it over to Northern Ireland whilst moving abroad  Still I didn t read it just yet  I simply wasn t in the mood  Now I m back in the Netherlands  feeling blue like an ocean of secrets held cold against a world that feels surreal to me  After watching  the Perks of Being a Wallflower   I finally decided to give it a shot  I mean  I read  On the Road and all that  and really digged that gem  as goes for some other classic works of fiction  I m glad I did read it after all that time  and somehow I am glad to have waited for such a long time as well  This really did feel like the right time to be reading it  if that makes any sense  I suddenly felt understood whilst reading it  I ve recently picked this one up again and  this time  I could not put it down  Started and finished it over the course of one day  I m 33 now  and I ve largely forgotten  this despite being a high school teacher  what it feels like to be a teenager on a day to day basis  Salinger  with this book  reminds me  brings me back to moments I ve not thought about in a long time  An unflinching reflection of the weariness that first becomes discernible on the world   like a kind of mold   when one is seventeen  About some books you feel like reading as fast as you can to get to know what would be the ending  that s when you completed half of the book you feel like hugging yourself again and again that you ve made it this far And at the same moment you become unhappy that this book will end soon  for you have now a very special and strong bond with the narrator  you feel this connection  your heart feels the narrator s pain and enjoys when everything s going grand in his life  With heavy heart as you reach to the very last pages  you become afraid of the ending  your head says to finish what you started and heart says I don t know what to do  You feel like the book cheated you  it never warned you about the ending  you never gave it a thought when you read its very first lines  you didn t know that the character s  the author s ideas are going to stick to you for the next week  and for some    for their entire life This is what this book did to me  I d had heard a lot about this book and for someone who likes to read a lot  it becomes shameful if somebody finds out that they d not read such classic books  Even when you find it out yourself  that what you ve been doing all your life that you hadn t made time to read such books  So it was important for me to read it soon Yesterday  I went to my friend s room and I saw this book in her bed  she just got it that day  it was a birthday gift  I couldn t resist myself  I grabbed it immediately and started reading it right away  I didn t wait for her to come and ask for permission   You d say friends don t mind even if you forgot to ask  but it was a gift that she got that day and if I were her  I d had surely made a fuss about it in my mind  There are things one should keep in mind that whenever you re going to read a book  its gonna change something in you in the end and you d spent the rest of the day to figure out what change had it done  You ll probably think you ve become a better person  you ve gained some knowledge  you ll smile again and again  you ll feel struck to the moment  the world will look somehow changed  a better place  you ll feel the air you re breathing  for books that shocks the hell out of you  you ll be dumbfounded for some time  scared  you d need to talk it out to someone  if you d find a person  no matter what you ll vomit it out  everything  what you felt  how much it has affected you  you don t care if they criticize you and curse you of becoming spoiler  you just had to speak to someone who listens  listens carefully  you ll say it has changed you  it surely did  every good book does but you ll never  never be sure of what change it has brought in your life So as I came to last chapter  I was mentally begging this author to not to tell me the ending  I was struck with the protagonist  Holden Caulfield and was scared to let him go  He speaks what you always think about almost everything  about how he cannot stand to phony people  about the ducks that he doesn t know where do they go when the lagoon is frozen  about his sister  classmates  students at school  teachers and his brother who is no more  I got to know what it is like to write whatever I think  And when he says exactly what I said to my friends or Mom few days back  at that very moment I know I m not alone  I never was  someone with same opinion about that topic exist somewhere To me  it was an adventure to get know about a particular stage in someone s life  I m not really going to say much about this book  it s already been reviewed discussed analysed dissected enough times  I just want to point out that Holden Caulfield s narration is    awesome  Seriously  He says something like  I was reading a book   then proceeds to ramble on about it for a page or so  Then he circles back and says   anyway  I was reading a book     For some reason  I love that  Maybe some people would find that kind of thing annoying  but to me it s just hilarious and brilliant After reading this  I got on Sparknotes and read some of the analysis  Good thing I did  too  getting a more thorough understanding of the novel only made me appreciate it more   I couldn t remember everything that happened in the book  but I still remember the feeling while reading it  For me what makes a book good is when it leaves you something  A memory or a feeling  Even if it involves just one scene  In the case of The Catcher in the Rye  I still recall  even after reading it a long time ago  this wonderful scene when Holden  our protagonist who ran away  sneaked into his parents  apartment while they are out  to see Phoebe  his younger sister  They talked a little bit and what he told his sister stayed with me until now   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around    nobody big  I mean    except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff    I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy  Other people have different interpretation about what Holden was trying to say  The writer might have his own  Mine s as simple as how it reads  There s innocence in it which I love  He could have aimed for money  fame  a better life or even as simple as to get laid  But he saw himself probably being happy and contented being the  catcher in the rye   Just that  And I respect it  I admire it  Most importantly  it feels good to know someome who knows what he or she really wants in life and be so certain about it  It makes you wish you do  too   I d thought it to be one of the phony titles everyone s reading just to fit into part a scene  but upon delving deeper  the no holds barred writing style   that killed me  I m not shooting the bull here when I say that this is one of my all time favourite reads  PS I suppose you d get a bang out of picking out a couple of references from this short blurb   I don t think I can properly explain how much this book means to me  I read it in my Modern Lit class my Junior year of high school and as we progressed through the book  I demanded my friends read it  too  A few of them joined It was made that much more special when I was talking about it with my English teacher and he told me it was one of his favorites because  when he was younger  his little brother died  He had connected with Holden s attitude and how much he cared for his siblings Yes  Holden is a whiny teenager  but let s be honest  who wasn t  I was pretty snotty and probably obnoxious to many of the adults around me when I was seventeen  We all mope over things that seem silly when we re younger  But  beyond that  we re also seeing a teenager  I m 23 now  so all teenagers are practically children in my book  dealing with death  more specifically the death of his younger brother from leukemia  He s trying to figure out life while still learning how to deal with a  presumably  horrific death of a younger sibling and that  of course  shapes who he is and how he reacts I haven t lost any siblings or anyone particularly close to me  but I understand what it s like to go through a hard time and feel like you can t trust anyone    including family and that s a difficult thing to deal with as a teenager  I had to re read this book after discovering the appalling fact that a family member of mine  a literature major nonetheless   had never read The Catcher in the Rye  In my long winded statement of all the reasons he  must  read it  I convinced myself it was a book worth reading again   a thing I have nearly never done   The thing is    to borrow a phrase from Holden  I read this book early in my high school years and liked it  I was irritated  however  by all the people around me who claimed   I  am  Holden Caulfield   I thought  to myself    You idiot  EVERYONE is Holden Caulfield  It s a universal coming of age story   So in my re read of this spectacular novel  this quote from Mr  Antolini stands out as a perfect description of what makes this novel so wonderful and well worth the second visit   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to    Written sixty one years ago but still valid  especially to adolescents   That s a flag to the incredible power of this book and the insight of it s author  surely  But if ever there was a book that divided readers The main character Holden Caulfield has a distinctive true voice which I found absorbing and which page by page builds a picture of a troubled psyche  meanwhile illustrating the difficulty that adolescents face in growing into adulthood It seems to me that JD Salinger understood the the struggle teenagers faced in 1950 s America and perhaps predicted the increasing rebellion  depression  alcohol abuse  suicides and even the horrendous shooting violences that have occurred since I felt for Holden and I certainly identified with his observations of the adult world I do fail to understand the repeated claim that  it s boring   nothing happens   Plenty happens to Holden over the few days after he leaves his school  Especially in his head  and it s his head we re interested in  and it s the way he deals with what the world throws at him that makes this book truly sing Tragic yet absolutely hilarious in parts  I was absorbed and enlightened  and so was my 14 year old daughter  My advice   read it and decide for yourself  and give it to the teenagers around you   likely they ll feel heard and understood  And that is a massive achievment for a sixt one year old story  I enjoyed this book a whole lot more than I thought I would  I like the way the author phrases and writes some of the passages in the book  For example when Holden starts talking about how he hates when people put commas in the wrong place and in that sentence a comma is in the wrong place  I also liked how when he was talking about Allie and he said   he is dead now  even though the book is in past tense he phrases this sentence in present tense and it shows that those who die aren t just dead when they die  they re dead forever  I just really loved this book  a lot  it surprised me  I would highly recommend this book to    I wouldn t say anyone because not everyone will really get it  I d say anyone who has    I don t know I guess been sad  But as in the sense that something bad has happened to them  I guess you don t really need that to enjoy it  but I think you will understand it better and emphasize with him better I guess  I don t know  Just read it  It s good  Awesome  That s this book summed in one word  I ve been meaning to read this book for ages  but never got down to it  And I picked it up today and finished it  I decided to put it on my list to read for 2009 and this is the first book from the list that I read I could easily identify with the depression of Holden  Every once in a while  I go along the same conflicting feelings  I liked how Salinger wrote the boy s feelings with such a pessimistic depressed outlook  It felt very real  And how  Holden hated almost everything at the point of the story  And how he was always thinking of running away  meeting people but not really identifying with any one I very much enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone going through a phase of depression  and to every one else  Salinger does a really good job on this book  Although it s written at a time period 50 years prior to mine  it s not hard to identify with the teenage problems that Holden is facing and the flighty feelings he keeps getting   Articolo pubblicato su   http   leanimesalve wordpress com 201   _Dacci un occhiata  Grazie    A Private World Of Love   Death  and all their friends  E  abbastanza bizzarro ritrovarsi  per una fortuita coincidenza  a leggere Il giovane Holden negli stessi giorni in cui il mondo intero si scopre a faccia a faccia con la morte del suo padrino  lo straordinario J D  Salinger  Una figura  quella di Salinger  che si trova ora piu che mai a fare i conti con la propria fama  con la propria storia  che ricalca indelebili i contorni di un eroe anticonformista e misantropo  Tratti decisi che delineano una personalita al limite dell icona  protagonista di una vita che assume grottescamente le sembianze di un ossimoro  un ebreo  ma anche uno dei primi soldati americani a varcare le soglie di un campo di concentramento nazista  uno scrittore invisibile che con un solo libro si assicura fama eterna Salinger e diventato leggendario  prima di tutto perche pochi come lui hanno avuto il divino dono della sua stessa capacita di scrittura  Ma anche perche  come sostiene il giornalista Wlodek Goldkorn  non ha mai creduto nel mito del Grande Romanzo Americano e soprattutto non ha mai provato a scriverlo Attraverso Salinger muore e vive una personalita ai limiti degli eccessi  che ha colpito indelebilmente la sensibilita dei media occidentali  Una natura che sopravvive nella continua negazione di se stessa  con una caparbieta propria solo di alcuni santi cattolici dei secoli passati  Nell era del capitalismo  del consumo  del culto della persona  Salinger  forse per una disgraziata paranoia  ha mandato tutto a quel paese  ha sputato su cio che chiunque brama di avere  fama  ricchezza  Ora  all alba della sua morte  il mondo s interroga su cosa potra contenere la misteriosa cassaforte di manoscritti salingeriani  catalogati dallo stesso autore per una futura pubblicazione postuma  Chissa se fra quelle pagine  scritte solo per un umano e egoistico piacere  si nasconde l autentico Grande Romanzo Americano Nei ruggenti anni  50 ne lo scrittore americano ne il suo eroe sono ignari alla societa  dipinta come un mondo avido e ostile  un mostro che oppone serie minacce all individualita  cosicche ogni forma di autocontrollo e vissuta come maligna e sbagliata  una societa che si nutre e strangola la liberta di ogni individuo Quella di Holden e una percezione infantile del mondo  violenta  disordinata  ingrata  Il giovane antieroe non puo far altro che subire questa realta  patendo la propria impotenza  Gli adulti  da sempre simbolo dell assennatezza e del giusto vivere  sono smascherati impietosamente da Salinger e da Holden  a sostegno dell idea che in quell America  a meta di un grande secolo  la condizione adulta non e sinonimo di maturita  E per questo che per molti anni  non solo Holden  ma migliaia di studenti americani rifiutarono di andare in quelle fantastiche e hollywoodiane universita  costose  costosissime  dove gli avrebbero insegnato a diventare uomini e donne  riflessi e automi della societa  dello Stato  Uno Stato che poco tempo dopo li avrebbe scaraventati nel Vietnam Crescere e difficile  per cui e meglio rimanere adolescenti per sempre  affetti da una sindrome di Peter Pan che assume le sembianze di una condizione mentale e spirituale che urla il rifiuto volontario nell eseguire il ponderato esercizio di vita  a cui sono legati i doveri della maggiore eta Holden quindi non e l unico che preferira l esaurimento nervoso nel freddo comfort della sua casa  rispetto al cambiamento scolastico  Non e l unico che sfregera il bigotto e intramontabile slogan  proud to be american  E questa condizione di  impostori  colpisce anche molti giovanotti come lui  tranne la sorellina Pheobe  che Holden ama e protegge teneramente e che lo convince a tornare a casa  Ward Stradlater e un  impostore   nella sua tracotante arroganza di bellimbusto  come anche Sally Hayes  la ragazza newyorkese verso la quale Holden sembra provare qualche istintuale interesse  Tutta faccine  mossette e risatine  Ma quante ragazze sono come  la vecchia Sally    Anche quelli apparentemente migliori  rivelano presto la loro natura di  fasulli   Prendete quel Mister Antolini per esempio  un ex professore di Holden che lo accoglie in casa  insieme alle sue confidenze  Holden rimane anche a dormire da lui  per poi svegliarsi nel cuore della notte  sobbalzando sotto una mano che gli accarezza la testa  Che diavolo vorra quell Antolini Holden e un principe naufrago in questo mondo di personaggi color fumodilondra  non appartiene a questo Grande Creato di ombre  di controfigure  di maschere accigliate e altezzose  Questo povero Holden costretto a vivere la propria gioventu bruciata al cospetto del radioso ricordo del suo adorato fratellino Allie Il nostro Holden si mette in giro per una New York cupa e mortificante e in giro vede cose  incontra persone e persino degli animali  che piu di tutti hanno il potere di stupirlo  Cosi si chiede  lui che e curioso e si interroga davanti a tutto  che non possiede quell irritante e diffidente indifferenza  fasulla  degli adulti   ma dove vanno d inverno le anitre di Central Park    Domanda  espressione simbolo di tutto l universo Holdeniano  che ritornera spesso nella mente del lettore come una filastrocca Cosi come tornera alla mente quel titolo  The Catcher in the Rye  titolo tanto sublime nella sua genesi  quanto deturpato da una traduzione italiana che predilige la comunicazione di massa alla poesia  The Catcher in the rye  il prenditore nella segale  racchiude la quintessenza del romanzo  rende palpabile la violenza disperata  la carica sessuale  la solitudine esistenziale del nostro caro e intramontabile Holden E come un Grande Gatsby di mezzo secolo e un adolescente che osserva e giudica con severita la societa che lo circonda  distante e reticente verso il mondo che voleva educarlo  che gli voleva far celebrare quel dannato  rito di passaggio  Holden non ci sta  Questo  catcher  di periferia  sta fermo in mezzo al campo  di  rye   di segale  naturalmente  pronto ad afferrare provvidenzialmente ogni cosa  ogni palla  ogni bambino  ogni emozione  ogni lettore che cada accidentalmente da quelle parti   Holden Caulfield is one of the more independent characters that I have ever come across in all kinds of literature  He is bold  not afraid to hold back his mind  and he does not seem to have a care in the world  which is what makes him so interesting  The language and the content were kind of surprising at first but then after  meeting  Holden  it makes sense and does not seem strange that books are using that kind of language  This book is about sixteen year old Holden  getting kicked out of private school  wandering around town all by himself experiencing things that are definitely a little mature for his age  Without mentioning it with detail  you can tell that he has had a pretty miserable childhood  which makes him want to leave it all in the past  I really liked this book  When it was assigned  I wanted to get to read it  I liked how my teacher chose a book that contained material that we would find unusual to be learning about in a classroom  which might be why I got into it as fast as I did   Absolutely adore this book  Recommend to absolutely everyone  young and old  male or female  This has to be one of my favourite books of all time  My boyfriend bought me a beautiful edition of this for my birthday too  When Holden wrote about Allie and his baseball glove  he ended with three very striking words   He s dead now  The whole paragraph was written in past tense but those three words were not  It showed  that people don t stop being dead  It doesn t change  That killed me And this is one of the few  if not the only  books to have never been adapted into a movie  However  regardless of its absence of any imagery  it has managed to stay relevant in a deeply image dependent culture  When texts are often criticized  it s because the critic says that he can t picture it  and that is exactly what Catcher has done so well  If it gave us a preconceived version of their  Hollywood s  interpretation  it would make it less relevant and less relatable over time  This book depends entirely on its language ability to tell its story through the plot  The story is not about the actions which we judge  but about the main story itself Then there is the authorial context  Salinger saw more war than most others  but he didn t write about war  He wrote about Holden and how the world kills people like him  But his stories were about an aspect of war  They were about the loss of innocence  He wanted to save it but he couldn t  That is what the book shows   the hopeless attempt to stop time so that no change takes place  and nobody substitutes their innocence for phoniness And finally  what I liked most was that there were two Holdens in the story  The first  was the 16 year old  who was experiencing everything  and the second  the 17 year old Holden  who is telling us the story  The first one  nobody listens to him because everybody  including Holden  is too self involved to give a damn  However  for the second one  it seems as though we all were listening to him throughout the whole book Besides that  I obviously loved the usual stuff like symbolism and the innate struggle within us all to not let go of the past  to not change  Loved this book  I couldn t put it down as much as I wanted to   this just got me  Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  YOU GOTTA READ IT  I definitely understand why some  many  most   would not enjoy  Catcher   The story is not overly exciting  the protagonist is not a hero  by any stretch  not much actually happens throughout  That being said  I absolutely love this book Reading did not come easy to me when I started this one  but I just could not put it down  Salinger spoke to something I knew  that I had not yet labeled       phonies   When you re a teenager  you start to get the inkling that maybe adults are not as genuine as previously thought  Basically  you realize that there are a lot of people who are full of sh t  In steps Holden Caulfield  His perceptions provide excellent insight into  How NOT to be   as an adult  I could keep going  but I will end this with my favorite quote from the book  I had come to be aware of a  Mr  Haas  in my own life  I thought it was obvious  but others around me were not as aware and this frustrated me  knowing that someone had everyone fooled  but me  Here s the quote  One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies  That s all  They were coming in the goddam window  For instance  they had this headmaster  Mr  Haas  that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in my life  Ten times worse than old Thurmer  On Sundays  for instance  old Haas went around shaking hands with everybody s parents when they drove up to school  He d be charming as hell and all  Except if some boy had little old funny looking parents  You should ve seen the way he did with my roommate s parents  I mean if a boy s mother was sort of fat or corny looking or something  and if somebody s father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black and white shoes  then old Haas would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he d go talk  for maybe a half an hour  with somebody else s parents  I can t stand that stuff  It drives me crazy  It makes me so depressed I go crazy  I hated that goddam Elkton Hills    The Catcher in the Rye is a novel by J D  Salinger revolves around a young sixteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield around the 1950s  The story itself is told by Holden  a rebellious teenager whose life seems to be just about as messed up as any lost young teenager  Holden is all over the place  the story itself does not have a specific setting although Holden makes it clear that he is in a mental hospital undergoing some sort of treatment  and most of it takes place in the heart of New York  This novel has heavy connotations that may shock many  but it remains true to reality  The diction of the book all goes to show Holden s true intentions  Holden teaches readers to live their lives with open eyes and observe silently  His manner of carrying himself shows the protagonist to be self centered  But Holden wants nothing but to save his inner child  although he is sexually active  smokes  and drinks  Holden s secret goal is to be  the catcher in the rye   He sees a field of rye standing by a dangerous cliff  While children play in the happily play in this field with no worries or care for the world  If they should come too close to the edge of the cliff  Holden will be there to catch them  J D Salinger shows Holden to be a symbol of innocents yet the corruption those around him caused his downfall  Holden is fighting the biological clock of growing up  Although many may acknowledge his strong will and even sometimes identify with his adolescents all may see Holden s way leads to nothing but frustration and  eventually  madness that drove him to this hospital   Womoglich ist Der Fanger im Roggen wirklich eines dieser Bucher  das man unbedingt gelesen haben muss  vor allem in dem Zeitalter  in dem dessen Cover auf Plattformen wie Tumblr Tag fur Tag von Tausenden Teenagern gerebloggt und geliebt und gelobpreist wird  Es ist eines der Bucher  das anscheinend unsere Jugend definiert und das  obwohl es schon uber 60 Jahre alt ist  Es scheint topaktuell  realitatsnah und durch die Zitate  die auf Tumblr verbreitet wurden  kam auch ich nicht drum herum  dieses Buch links liegen zu lassen  Ich musste es haben  ich musste es lesen und ich wollte es lieben   ich glaube  das ist mir auch recht gut gelungen Inhalt  Ich Erzahler des Romans ist Holden Caulfield  der sich zur Zeit seiner Aufzeichnungen zur Erholung und psychiatrischen Behandlung in einem Sanatorium befindet  Sein Roman handelt davon  wie er nach einem Schulverweis fur seine schlechten Noten kurz vor Beginn der Weihnachtsferien die Schule vorzeitig verlasst  um dem oberflachlichen  selbstdarstellerischen Verhalten seiner Kameraden und der Schulgesellschaft zu entfliehen  Er traut sich aus Angst vor der Reaktion der hysterisch nervosen Mutter und des erfolgreichen Vaters nicht sofort nach Hause  sondern irrt drei Tage lang auf der Suche nach menschlicher Nahe und einer Zukunftsperspektive durch Manhattan  Meinung  Holden Caulfield ist eine Person  fur die man von Anfang an so etwas wie Sympathie empfindet  Vielleicht ergeht es auch nur mir so  aber ich konnte mich unglaublich gut mit ihm identifizieren  Wenn er wollte  dann konnte er mit all den Menschen um sich herum auskommen  er brauchte sie auch  denn er wollte nicht allein sein  Andererseits gingen ihm diese ganzen verlogenen und piefigen Scheisskerle  um es mit seinen Worten zu formulieren  dermassen auf den Senkel  dass er es nicht aushielt  langer mit ihnen unter einem Dach zu leben  So beschloss er  nach dem Schulrauswurf  der ja im Ubrigen nicht sein erster war  nicht bis zum offiziellen Schulschluss zu warten  sondern auf eigene Faust zu gehen  dann wann es ihm passte  Er hatte ja sowieso nichts mehr dort verloren  bei diesen piefigen und verlogenen Menschen  Ja  piefig und verlogen  das waren wohl die Worte  die Holden Caulfield am haufigsten in den Mund nahm oder zumindest dachte  Und durch diese Gedankengange eines mit sich selbst und der Gesellschaft unzufriedenen 16jahrigen bewegt sich der Leser nun sage und schreibe drei Tage lang  Drei Tage weichen wir nicht von Holdens Seite  erfahren alles  was er tut und denkt und begleiten ihn durch eine Zeit  die eher durch Tiefen als durch Hohen gekennzeichnet ist Ich wollte Holden in den Arm nehmen  ihn knuddeln und ihm sagen  dass alles wieder gut werden wird  Ich wollte ihm helfen  dabei sich selbst zu finden und ich wollte ihm sagen  dass er ein grossartiger Mensch ist  er aber nicht wirklich etwas daraus macht  Ich wollte ihn antreiben  ich wollte ihn beruhigen  ich wollte ihn aufmuntern  Ich wollte ihm eine Freundin sein und fur ihn da sein  Was naturlich alles nur in meinen Traumen und Gedanken einen Sinn ergibt  In der Wirklichkeit habe ich Holden aber immerhin der Liste der fiktiven Charaktere hinzugefugt  in die ich unstreblich verliebt war bin immer sein werde  Es geht schliesslich schon so weit  dass ich mich auf Twitter in Ms  Caulfield umbenannt habe  jawoll  Die ganze Zeit wahrend des Lesens hatte ich Angst  dass Holden sich das Leben nehmen wurde  er schien so nahe am Abgrund  tanzelte direkt an der Grenze und alles was ich wollte war  seine Hand zu nehmen und ihn sachte von diesem Abgrund fortzufuhren  Was naturlich nicht geht  Aber ganz runtergefallen ist er glucklicherweise nicht  was habe ich ausgeatmet  als das Buch zu Ende war und Holden sich nichts angetan hatte Aber nicht nur ausgeatmet habe ich  beim Zuklappen des Buches  Naturlich habe ich auch getrauert  Ich kann es nicht ertragen  wenn solch derart gute Bucher so derart schnell zu Ende gehen  Ich wunschte mir  ich konnte noch mehr von Holden erfahren  ja ehrlich gesagt wurde ich ihn gerne bis ans Ende seiner und meiner Tage begleiten und nie wieder von seiner Seite weichen  Diese drei Tage  die ich Holden in seinem Leben begleiten durfte  waren einfach zu kurz  Viel zu kurz  Ich wurde J D  Salinger gerne fragen  ob er mir noch eine 42937346388seitige Fortsetzung von Holdens Leben schreiben mag  aber leider ist er bereits verstorben  Und alles  was er uns hinterlassen hat  sind diese drei Tage aus Holdens Leben  Drei Tage  Immer noch besser als gar nichts  Aber trotzdem viel zu wenig  Dann muss ich mir halt Holdens Zukunft selbst ausmalen  Mit mir an seiner Seite  Okay  das klingt wie ein abgedrehter Nicholas Sparks Titel  Aber egal  Mit mir an Holdens Seite  Das gefallt mir eigentlich ganz gut  Lustige Nebeninformation  die eigentlich niemanden interessiert  Als ich den Titel Der Fanger im Roggen das erste Mal horte  dachte ich  es wurde um einen Jager gehen oder irgendeinen Waldmenschen  der im Roggenfeld lebt oder wasweissich  Ich hatte mir jedenfalls niemals traumen lassen konnen  dass es um eine so wundervolle Person wie Holden Caulfield es ist  gehen wurde  Positive Uberraschungen in Buchern sind doch sowieso immer das allerbeste    11The Catcher in the Rye is a fiction novel which follows Holden Caufield  a high school aged boy dealing with belonging and innocence This book is placed right next to the Great Gatsby because I read the two of them right after the other and felt the same emotional connection to the characters  I wanted to reach into the pages of the books and try to console the main characters  I read the Catcher in the Rye alongside my dad a year ago  and while he found Holden annoying  I felt like I needed to help him  The teen angst shown in this book and the loss of belonging also related to me  as I have suffered with a loss of belonging at times  It shows me that one can got through an abyss of despair and find strength to be whole at the end  As a child who felt stifled by my parents  watching another teen act in rebellion against his parents was also something I felt exhilarating to read  Having never been made to read this book  I can t really tell you why I wanted to read it all of a sudden  but I m so glad it crossed my reading path  This was really one of the best books I ve read for multiple reasons  1  Holden was so likeable as a character that by the end of the book  he just about broke my heart being so deeply sad  2  The movement of the novel was fast paced  so I had no trouble picking the story back up again after a short pause  The real trouble was putting it down  And 3  Even though Holden was 16 in the novel  and I m 23 and a girl  I could relate to almost every observation he made about girls  about life in general  about sex  and society  I loved this novel  it will definately go on my favorites shelf  e shelf and physical    A lot of people read this book and think it s boring and pointless  however it s definitely about finding a deeper meaning to the story  I first read this book when I was 15 and initially it struck me as the most awful book I d ever read in my life  being at that age only reading vampire fiction  Oh dear    Actually I probably would have continued thinking so if I hadn t been studying it for my English Language GCSE  Reluctantly I was taught to analyse it correctly  it was then I began to realise just how brilliant it really was  The genius of this book is that you can read it a thousand times and always interpret it differently  Nothing is solid in this book  no physical facts of Holden s state being you can build upon  it s ENTIRELY down to how you read and choose to understand it  I m pretty certain my love of this book played a major part in achieving my great English grade and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone with an open mind  I hated this book  and it was wonderful  Every time I started a chapter  my heart sank because Holden s world was so absolutely depressing  Never has a book affected me so deeply  nor dealt with the issues of coming of age with such stark  dirty realism  One day I hope to write a book that people will love to hate as much as I did Catcher   Jeez  i m shocked i never got around to reviewing this one  wonder how many other long read books ll surface that i didn t put not stars aside  how s THAT for grammar  Cazul lui Salinger este cel putin atipic in literatura  Dupa ce a scris cateva carti unanim acceptate ca fiind foarte bune  a hotarat ca nu mai vrea sa scrie  sau cel putin sa publice si brusc s a retras in Cornish  New Hampshire  unde a locuit retras o viata intreaga  alaturi de sotiile sale  a fost de 3 ori insurat   Cea mai mare distractie a lui erau copiii  ai lui si ai altora  si isi petrecea timpul jucandu se cu ei  citindu le  invatandu i sa iubeasca literatura si viata  punand probabil in aplicare visul celui mai cunoscut personaj al sau  Holden Caulfield  care intr o pagina memorabila din romanul The Catcher in the Rye  De veghe in lanul de secara  ii spune surorii sale  Phoebe    In orice caz  in mintea mea am vazut o multime de copii mititei jucind un joc in lanul intins de secara  Mii de copii    si nimeni in jur  adica nici un om mare  in afara de mine  Si eu stau la marginea unei prapastii ametitoare  Si stii ce fac  Prind copiii sa nu cada in prapastie  Vreau sa spun  cind alearga si nu se uita unde merg  trebuie sa le ies in cale si sa i prind  Asta as face toata ziua  As sta de veghe in lanul de secara  Stiu ca i o nebunie  Dar e singurul lucru care m ar tenta  Stiu ca i o nebunie   Nu stiu in ce masura si a imprumutat Salinger din personalitate personajului sau  dar aceasta pagina pare rupta exact din subconstientul sau de la sursa  J D  Salinger   De veghe in lanul de secara   SemneBune http   semnebune ro 2013 j d salinger    The Catcher in the Rye  1951  by J D  Salinger is often mistaken  and rightly so  as a novel about an angry young man  When I was an angry young man  about the age of 20  I asked my English professor if I could sit in on her class since she was studying The Catcher in the Rye  and at that time I thought Holden Caulfield was an angry young man  Now  some fifteen years later  after having travelled across Asia and for the last ten years witnessing off and on extreme cases of poverty and grief  and after my second reading of the novel  I see a different side of Holden  and I also see a very tragic event that I had glanced over in my initial reading  Holden is not an angry young man  Holden is a grieving young man unable to cope with his brother s death and much like Quentin Compson in The Sound and the Fury  we watch a sixteen year old Holden as he indirectly contemplates suicide over the course of a few days  But before we get down into it  let s take a moment to consider what most never even knew about Jerome David Salinger  Much like Holden who by the end of the novel has been kicked out of Pencey Prep and knows his father will send him to a military school  a young Salinger was shipped off to Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne Pennsylvania  and one can know from Salinger s own words that if this book were ever made into a movie  only Salinger could have played Holden  We should also take into account that Salinger was drafted and in World War II he landed at Utah Beach during the Normandy Invasion  And all through the war  Salinger was working on this very novel and was even photographed doing so  Salinger served from 1942 to 1944  and thereafter he suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized  much like our dear Holden  So it is by far safe to say that much of Holden s life can be found in Salinger s  So for one thing  how do we know that Holden is hospitalized  The greatness of The Catcher in the Rye is partly due to its subtlety  Check out this passage and try to spot the clues Page 1   If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  Most people might believe that Holden is actually talking to them  i e   the reader   but in the realms of the fictive dream which must at all times maintain literary soundness Holden can only be talking to someone within his own diegetic world  In other words  Holden is talking to a shrink and he is there laying on the couch as the novel opens and is uninterested in telling the psychoanalyst anything much about his early childhood  No  something else more tragic happened  and we are going to get to that later  But let s continue with the opening page to spot more clues  In the first place  that stuff bores me  and in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them  They re quite touchy about anything like that  especially my father  They re nice and all  I m not saying that  but they re also touchy as hell  Besides  I m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything  I ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run down and had to come out here and take it easy  I mean that s all I told D B  about  and he s my brother and all  He s in Hollywood  That isn t too far from this crumby place  and he comes over and visits me practically every week end  He s going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe  What we do know about the rest of the story is that Holden s home is in New York City  yet he clearly states on page one that  this crumby place  is near Hollywood  where his sole surviving brother D B  lives  And we also know that he is not at home  but he is somewhere that only allows visitors on the weekend and that he might be able to go home in a month or so  The only satisfying conclusion one can make is that Holden had a mental breakdown  e g    this madman stuff   and he is now hospitalized somewhere in California and not in New York where the most of the plot takes place  By the end of the novel  we return to more of these clues  That s all I m going to tell about  I could probably tell you what I did after I went home  and how I got sick and all  and what school I m supposed to go to next fall  after I get out of here  but I don t feel like it  I really don t  That stuff doesn t interest me too much right now   A lot of people  especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here  keeps asking me if I m going to apply myself when I go back to school next September  It s such a stupid question  in my opinion  I mean how do you know what you re going to do till you do it  The answer is  you don t  I think I am  but how do I know  I swear it s a stupid question    It s funny  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   p 213 214  Here Holden makes a direct mention to working with psychoanalysts and we can gather that each chapter could quite possibly be a single session as Holden tells the story that is centered around an incident that takes place at Pencey Prep  The entire novel revolves around a young man s suicide and Holden s own conflict to kill himself  Much like Quentin Compson in The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner  the reader follows a young man over the course of a few days as he contemplates life and death  Quentin is a Harvard boy  much like Holden who comes from a similar community of prep schools and the Ivy League  Quentin and Holden have also gotten into many fights  coming home with a black eye  much like the one Holden wears after he gets into a fight with his roommate Stradlater  which prompts the hero Holden on his journey  and  later in the novel  with the pimp Maurice  Agonized and neurotic  Quentin desires to save his own sister Caddy  much in the same way Holden does Phoebe  and ultimately quits college  Holden again  and drowns himself in the Charles River  But will Holden have a different outcome than Quentin Holden  however  does not kill himself and is ultimately committed to a mental institution  But suicide is the focal eye of this narrative tale  and it is often ignored in far too many intelligent conversations about The Catcher in the Rye  I argue that Holden is not angry at all the phonies  Not really  Instead  Holden is deeply troubled and saddened by the death of his brother Allie and the death of James Castle  a peer at Pencey Prep  Holden even confesses that he wants to kill himself  What I really felt like  though  was committing suicide  I felt like jumping out the window  I probably would ve done it  too  if I d been sure somebody d cover me up as soon as I landed  I didn t want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when I was all gory   p 104   And Holden is not saying this metaphorically  No  He actually is considering killing himself by jumping out the hotel window  We know this because James Castle killed himself in the same manner at Pencey  And you should ve seen him  He was a skinny little weak looking guy  with wrists about as big as pencils  Finally  what he did  instead of taking back what he said  he jumped out the window  I was in the shower and all  and even I could hear him land outside  But I just thought something fell out the window  a radio or a desk or something  not a boy or anything  Then I heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs  so I put on my bathrobe and I ran downstairs too  and there was old James Castle laying right there on the stone steps and all  He was dead  and his teeth  and blood  were all over the place  and nobody would even go near him  He had on this turtleneck sweater I d lent him  All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them  They didn t even go to jail   p 170   The Quentin Compson section   June 2  1910   in The Sound and the Fury is by far one of my most favorite sections of any novel  There is an elegant dance Faulkner performs as the reader follows Quentin s thoughts and progress as he struggles with the Past and Present  much like Holden does  throughout a single day  Holden s time lasts roughly two days   Holden is traumatized by death  much like Salinger was during World War II  and it is this young man who cannot come to terms with his own mortality  especially after a loss of a loved one  his brother Allie  On the very next page from the description of James Castle s death  Holden has a conversation about Allie with his sister Phoebe  I like Allie   I said   And I like doing what I m doing right now  Sitting here with you  and talking  and thinking about stuff  and    Allie s dead  You always say that  If somebody s dead and everything  and in Heaven  then it isn t really    I know he s dead  Don t you think I know that  I can still like him  though  can t I  Just because somebody s dead  you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake  especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all   p 171  Holden is not so much an angry young man as he is a grieving young man  and he so desperately needs someone to talk to  Phoebe  his kid sister  however  is not helping  She even mentions death to Holden later in the same conversation  Daddy s going to kill you  He s going to kill you   she said  I wasn t listening  though  I was thinking about something else  something crazy   You know what I d like to be   I said  You know what I d like to be  I mean if I had my goddam choice   What  Stop swearing   You know that song  If a body catch a body comin  through the rye   I d like    It s  If a body meet a body coming through the rye    old Phoebe said   It s a poem  By Robert Burns   I know it s a poem by Robert Burns  She was right  though  It is  If a body meet a body coming through the rye   I didn t know it then  though  I thought it was  If a body catch a body    I said   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean  except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy  Old Phoebe didn t say anything for a long time  Then  when she said something  all she said was   Daddy s going to kill you   p 172 173  Holden can find no comfort with his sister and when he seeks out someone else to talk to  Holden calls Mr  Antolini  the very teacher who is there at James Castle s death  He was about the best teacher I ever had  Mr  Antolini  He was a pretty young guy  not much older than my brother D B   and you could kid around with him without losing your respect for him  He was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window I told you about  James Castle  Old Mr  Antolini felt his pulse and all  and then he took off his coat and put it over James Castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary  He didn t even give a damn if his coat got all bloody   p 174  What tragedy  Imagine  as I can  that this happened  that that moment described above of a teacher having to use his coat to carry away a young boy who has just killed himself was real and you were the teacher or you were one of the students standing around the smashed and broken body of the boy  Oh  how we do not truly cherish life until it is too late  What heartache and agony must it have been for both Mr  Antolini and Holden  To witness such a death is almost incomprehensible  James Castle had so much potential before him  and yet he felt like whatever troubled him could only be solved through suicide  And Holden  like James Castle  the very boy Holden lent a turtleneck sweater too  is considering suicide  But Mr  Antolini has some words of wisdom for Holden  and this might have saved the young man s life Mr  Antolini lit another cigarette  He smoked like a fiend  Then he said   Frankly  I don t know what the hell to say to you  Holden   I know  I m very hard to talk to  I realize that   I have a feeling that you re riding for some kind of a terrible  terrible fall  But I don t honestly  know what kind   Are you listening to me   and a little later in the conversation    He started concentrating again  Then he said   This fall I think you re riding for  it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement s designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  So they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even got started  You follow me    and a little later     I don t want to scare you   he said   but I can very clearly see you dying nobly  one way or another  for some highly unworthy cause   He gave me a funny look   If I write something down for you  will you read it carefully  And keep it   Mr  Antolini has just directly referenced Holden s conflict of suicide by saying  dying nobly  one way or another   and a little later adds    Then he came back and sat down with the paper in his hand   Oddly enough  this wasn t written by a practicing poet  It was written by a psychoanalyst named Wilhem Stekel  Here s what he  Are you still with me   Yes  sure I am   Here s what he said   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   and finally   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry   p 186 189  And it is poetry  This last statement best sums up the overall theme  in my mind  found in The Catcher in the Rye  Humanity is about sharing knowledge and that  beautiful reciprocal arrangement  is indeed  poetry   much like this book  Most people  however  will focus on the somewhat homosexual encounter between Mr  Antolini and Holden and completely miss that Mr  Antolini  quite possibly  has just saved Holden s life  But let us consider another possible interpretation of events besides a homosexual one Holden describes the incident between him and Mr  Antolini   Then something happened  I don t even like to talk about it  I woke up all of a sudden  I don t know what time it was or anything  but I woke up  I felt something on my head  some guy s hand  Boy  it really scared hell out of me  What it was  it was Mr  Antolini s hand   What he was doing  he was sitting on the floor right next to the couch  in the dark and all  and he was sort of petting me or patting me on the goddam head  Boy  I ll bet I jumped about a thousand feet   p 191 192   Here  Holden takes Mr  Antolini s act as a homosexual one  This may have been Mr  Antolini s intentions  or it may not have been  Imagine that like Holden Mr  Antolini is also suffering from the death of James Castle and Mr  Antolini has recognized that Holden is in a similar predicament  Holden  a youth with such promise ahead of him  is considering taking the easy way out  And remember that Mr  Antolini has been up drinking highballs all night and perhaps he was just sitting there adoring the immortality and beauty found in youth s promise  the innocence un abandoned  Perhaps Mr  Antolini feared for Holden s life and was sitting  indeed drunk  by the couch and thinking not of sex as some deviants might argue  but he was sitting and thinking of that dead boy he had to carry beneath his own coat to the school s infirmary  What sadness  And even Holden says he might have misunderstood Mr  Antolini s actions  I mean I started thinking that even if he was a flit he certainly d been very nice to me  I thought how he hadn t minded it when I d called him up so late  and how he d told me to come right over if I felt like it  And how he went to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all  and how he was the only guy that d even gone near that boy James Castle I told you about when he was dead  I thought about all that stuff  And the more I thought about it  the more depressed I got  I mean I started thinking maybe I should ve gone back to his house  Maybe he was only patting my head just for the hell of it  The more I thought about it  though  the more depressed and screwed up about it I got   p 195  Holden is wounded emotionally  and he even admits to such  When I was really drunk  I started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again  I was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts  I kept pulling my hand under my jacket  on my stomach and all  to keep the blood from dripping all over the place  I didn t want anybody to know I was even wounded  I was concealing the fact that I was a wounded sonuvabitch   p 150  And Holden s  wound in the stomach  is not by accident but a direct reference to the emotional pain he is experiencing from another death  the death of his brother Allie   When the weather s nice  my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old Allie s grave  I went with them a couple of times  but I cut it out  In the first place  I certainly don t enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery  Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all  It wasn t too bad when the sun was out  but twice  twice  we were there when it started to rain  It was awful  It rained on his lousy tombstone  and it rained on the grass on his stomach  It rained all over the place   p 155   And this very rain appears once more at the end of the novel  in one of my favorite scenes in all of literature  Holden is at the zoo with Phoebe  Then what she did  it damn near killed me  she reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head    She ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time  Then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back  Then she got on it  She waved to me and I waved back  Boy  it began to rain like a bastard  In buckets  I swear to God  All the parents and mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel  so they wouldn t get soaked to the skin or anything  but I stuck around on the bench for quite a while  I got pretty soaking wet  especially my neck and my pants  My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection  in a way  but I got soaked anyway  I didn t care  though  I felt so damn happy all of a sudden  the way old Phoebe kept going around and around  I was damn near bawling  I felt so damn happy  if you want to know the truth  I don t know why  It was just that she looked so damn nice  the way she kept going around and around  in her blue coat and all  God  I wish you could ve been there   p 212 213  Indeed   Read this book when you re young  It s best read when you re a teenager   the world is new  Enjoy the book the first time  It s never quite the same magic when you re older   The Catcher in the Rye is an amazing work  It is about an extraordinary boy named Holden Caulfield who has characteristics that allow any reader  regardless of ones background  to identify as well as adapt views and understands similar to his  Being as troubled and confused as he is  it is an interesting writing ability  on Salinger s part  to allow the reader to feel his trouble and confusion so directly Holden is a 16 year old who had recently been expelled from his high school  Pency Prep  with this comes much conflict in his life  He throws himself out into the real world to escape what he feels is limiting and hurting him  however the plot is filled with his conflicts with the ugly truth of  phony  adulthood and many more disappointments consisting with his family  friends  hookers  and homosexuals The reader will ultimately take away from the story an understanding of Holden s fear of growing up  And it is through the books elements of loneliness  relationships  intimacy  sexuality  lying  and deception will have us all wondering  where the ducks go when the lagoon freezes over    This is basically the best coming of age story ever told  Anyone  teenagers and young adults especially  can totally relate to Holden Caulfield  I don t know anyone who has read this and not felt enchanted by the main character  There are countless symbols and themes that make you keep thinking long after you finish reading the story  I was genuinely sad when I actually finished it Holden is completely unreliable  honest  easily distracted  easily amused  and has the language of a sailor  You want desperately to be his friend  but you kniow that he would never want to be friends with you Unlike most people  I read this book twice before being forced to read it in my 11th grade English class  My class was full of complete  as Holden wouyld say   phonies  and they all loved it  Ironic much  Anyway  it s an outstanding book  If you haven t read it yet  I would definitely reccommend it  It s a classic  Don t quit before Holden gets home  Or you ll go away thinking the book is pointless  It s all just a long process of setting up the background until page 180 or so  some of what follows might be considered spoiler I liked the perspective into our teenage mind  So many brutal waves of emotion hitting on Caulfield  so little in the way of role models to steady his north  Sometime  when he talks to Phoebe  it all starts to come together  Mr  Antolini then sums it all up  some people give up looking for what they need  What makes for such unbearable voids  Is it parental indifference  Poor Holden  he s so needy all he wants to do is help other kids before they fall off some cliff  What a big cry for help that is  Aren t we all Holden Caulfield  I read this book at school with my students Thay have a lot to say about Holden s behaviours On every page there s something that surprises them  Catcher in The Rye is one of my favorite American works  It is funny  witty  expressive  and ultimately timeless  In recent years it seems that many  literary  types have dismissed the book because of its lucid prose  I find this approach myopic  From Faulkner  to Hemmingway  to Wells  authors have always been of the opinion that being able to write something lucid and make it meaningful is a difficult task  I agree and I don t believe that Catcher in the Rye will dissapear despite these negative interpretations  It s funny  I have a friend that read it  someone who I respect the opinion of a lot and he outright said he  hated it   I bought him another copy and although he told me he read it again   didn t believe him  I was put off by his resistance  He is a big Cormac McCarthy fan and I have told him many times that McCarthy is highly overrated  but I have agreed to read Blood Meridian and even to have an open mind doing so  even after he spoiled the ending for me by reading a review by Harold Bloom     Most people regard Bloom as a genius of criticism  I think he is ok and has certainly read a lot and written a lot of good reviews  but I find if you take anyones work and cannonize it  than you are inviting mediocrity  Every author has his stinker  In any case  I recommend this book highly to those with open minds and a sense of humor  Another good book to read in this same vein is O Toole s Confederacy of Dunces   This book was wonderful company  I love such an honest voice  It reminded me of Bukowski s books  but the character is more innocent obviously   The tale takes place in New York City over the course of about a day and a half  There are practically no time lapses  You live every moment with the character  I admired his thoughts and sentimentality  and I sympathized with his plight It s about a precocious  wealthy sixteen year old kid who gets kicked out of a prestigious school  He is confounded by the world and life  Why is everyone so phony  Indeed  Hang in there  Holden  The answer seems to be in applying himself  to learn  but why       Enjoy   That a truly great book can only come from complete honesty  I have read  and enjoyed  many books during my life  but I don t believe that I have read a book so devoid of pretense  so unconcerned with the reader s reaction  just telling it  but in a wonderfully special way I started this book when I was fifteen or so  a complete idealist  and I couldn t get past the part with the old guy picking his nose  And so  for about fifty years I held this novel in contempt and couldn t understand what all the fuss was about Well  now I get it  and I am thankful that I used the occasion of J D  Salinger s death to pick up this book and to let it give me a second chance to listen  and finally to hear  So  for now at least  and to paraphrase Mr  Jimmy Durante  Good Night Mr  Salinger  Wherever You Are  Absolutely brilliant  Flow of consciousness of an adolescent so authentic that I could imagine teenagers nowadays talking like that  just insert some  likes  in there   I don t get the negative reviews  To the person who said that she wanted to slap Holden around and tell him  to grow up    this is a snapshot of two days in the life of a teenager  not a growing up story  Holden Caulfield is smart but completely lacks direction in his life  He has problems  applying himself  because he feels alien in his world   he is not a kid any more but he is lost at who he is  He is self conscious and inept at socializing  What he has is creativity and imagination   qualities discouraged in the boarding school environment  He is incisive and insightful when observing others  especially identifying  phoniness    but misses the phoniness in himself until Phoebe reflects his own foolishness back onto him   and she can t explain her as a phony  like he does with everyone else  This book gets slammed for teenage angst  cursing  acting out and booze  For Chrissakes  isn t it obvious that this kid is trying everything for the first time  He tries them  all right  and he quickly finds out the downside of the adult excesses  He is all talk   he doesn t go through with any  bad stuff   He hires a prostitute  but he is just lonely and wants a conversation  and is scared to death to do anything to her  He learns quickly what happens when you get mixed up with prostitutes    and when crooks lie to you  He buys booze  and gets drunk  He talks like he does this all the time  but he doesn t recognize the symptoms of hangover because it is the first time he is hung over  He makes mistakes in every conversation  All the cursing     is posing  He gets really upset when he finds curses in his kid sister s school  Holden is a good kid  but one who is brighter  more sensitive and is affected by teenage alienation much harder than other kids around him  Underneath all the nonchalance  he is just trying to protect himself from the world    from all the conversations he has to have  He d rather hide in a cabin and become a deaf mute  Then all the conversations would end Some of the characters in the book  I have met them  I have had the conversation with the self absorbed guy would always talk about things he didn t like  so we asked him what he liked   and he couldn t think of one thing  The guy who is intellectual and likes to ask personal questions about everyone so he can be the smartest in the room  but  gets sore  when you ask him similar questions back   like  he is afraid that someone else will say something smarter than him    I know that guy  I know the girl who would keep you standing and would block the traffic  for like a thousand years   I know the teacher who would be concerned about your future  I know the guy who would be laying it on the girl in the bar  Those characters are timeless This is an easy read  both style and length wise  I also adore that it doesn t chew anything for you  Just tells it how it is  Even tells you that whatever is left out was because he wasn t interested in talking about that  If you are a teenager   have been one   or have talked to one   you know that s how a teenager feels  What s the point of talking about boring stuff  Talking when you don t feel like it  Many claim this as a life changing book  I don t subscribe to that  Yes  it is universal  Most of us have experienced a phase of searching for answers  not fitting in  feeling like a weirdo  feeling like  everything is phony   So yes  most of us can relate to it  But this book has no answers  Just a teenager telling how it feels like to be a teenager  Think about it    Holden Caulfied  a 16 year old adolescent boy  gets kicked out from Pencey Prep just before Christmas  Tired of dealing with all the  phonies  in his school  he spontaneously leaves to New York  From there  his journey of searching for the purpose of life leads him to meet variety of people  from prostitutes to nuns  and encounter one of the strangest experiences that changed his life   During his visit to New York  Holden gets dependent on drinking and smoking  and develops a strong desire for sex  He wanders between the boundary of childhood and adulthood  both trying to be a grownup but stopping himself from turning into one  This desperate teen stops at bars and nightclubs to fill his insecurities  until  he meets his little sister Phoebe  After meeting her and taking her to the Central Park zoo  he finally understands that growing up is inevitable and departs from his long depression   Salinger did a great job portraying this lonely and lost teenager  aimlessly going around in a big city with no one to guide him  Through his use of slang profound words  repetition  and emphasis  the readers feel that they are the psychoanalysts that Holden is ranting to  Salinger s writing represents what people are actually thinking in their mind without noticing it  Holden makes the readers really question about the society and the smallest things that we actually have to think about  ducks in the frozen lake   Towards the end  Holden s brief feeling of happiness somewhat relieves the readers and wonder about what happened to him later on   As my Mum based her English Literature University Masters on Salinger  I thought it was about time I tried one of his offerings myself  I was far from disappointed  The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderful coming of age story with none of the cliches that are included in many other ones  It is nothing if not original and yet Salinger still managed to keep me captivated into the life of Holden Caufield throughout  On the surface it seems like not a lot happens action wise in this book  however  I think it is so much more than about action  it showcases a journey through adolescence unlike any book had done before it  as far as I know  An incredibly worthwhile read  Questo libro calza alla perfezione con la mia attuale sfiducia nei confronti del sistema  soprattutto di quello scolastico E  un libro tutto infastidito  che di certo le cose non le manda a dire  Un libro che tenta di farti aprire gli occhi  se non li hai ancora aperti e che  se hai gia capito le condizioni penose a cui siamo soggiogati  da man forte ai tuoi ragionamenti  integrandoli con quelli di un uomo arrabbiato che vuole far sentire la sua opinione al mondo della fine degli anni  40  This story is about a young man who doesn t have a high temper he was kicked out of many schools because he has too high standards for people he is close with later on he experiences problems a young man would experience and he falls into temptation and causes his life to get worse but the worst part is that he makes his younger sister want to follow his path and because of this he decides what would make him happy is helping kids from falling through the cracks However he has potential to be a good person he however tries to erase a bad word from a school wall At the end he decides to go home to stop his sister from doing some negative by leaving with Holden This book would be recommended to mature readers because there are adult situations and experiences that people might have to chose between and goodness  There s little to say here that hasn t been said before  really  The Catcher in the Rye is considered a masterpiece for a reason  What I love about this book most is how if you don t sit down and think critically  it s really easy to think that this book is about nothing  That s a reason that I m glad I never read this in high school  I feel like I have a better opportunity to appreciate it now  A lot is said in very little  You have to notice the way that Salinger writes    or rather  the way that Holden talks  Why is  phony  written about ten times on every page  Why does a third of Holden s dialogue begin with  Listen    Why does he hate the movies  why does he dwell so hard on Allie  what does he want from his interactions that he never gets  and that leave him frustrated  It s easy to write Holden off as a whiny brat who s never satisfied  It s harder to look into his motivations for his words and actions and decide why he does the things that he does  and why he says the things that he says  But that s what the reader of this book has to do to appreciate why it s a great American novel  It is a classic novel about the love hate view of man on life  where Holden Caulfield  the lead  says and thinks of all the bad things in the world but says and does the other way   the good way  Gloriafic  ey It is a novel that constantly remind us of our social contract to do good to others despite being overly possessed by our vicious nature  dark  wild  carnal  nomad and self centered Most of us are but not in my circle  as i currently see it or maybe the people i know are still boiling their dark side  ready to spill out the heater  Such viciousness is inescapable because in the pursuit of reaching ones potentials  we do face ego inflation and spiritual narcissism  as a ripple effect of ego trips for recognition and gratification Take Lucifer But when we are bounded of the social contract  our personal journey becomes spiritual  That is why seekers  like the Mevlevi dervishes from Turkey  need spiritual guides to deflate any inflation  To end almost perfect or at least alive  we act our truest self  our potentials  within that contract  It is hard  you would agree  but it is vital  The people we live with guide us not to be derailed in becoming vicious Ever tried saying  glad to meet you  to somebody when you are not at all glad  It is not kasipsipan or kaplastikan  it is telling you  you are good and human  And this is the message J D  Salinger is relaying  Same true with Renee Descartes  or some other guy    man is basically good  The book was truly classic  It was worth a reread  though really not my second because i cant remember its story  just the idea that it was dark and cool   And this was the first novel and first non school book I just remembered I read and not Jim Morrison s biography  It is the book that I oathed not to read novels because they are not worth collecting  But it is the same book that inspired me to read more At a literal setback  Holden was full of cowardice and lack a lot of will to do things  But in in depth  it was real self control  sensitivity and humility  He was fully aware of the Dr  Jeckyll inside of him  absolutely harmful if let out Either you are suffering identity crisis split personality or too tempered or a virgin or tough  it is a must read  must laugh and Stabilo worth  You d learn a lot of pocket values and unconventional wisdom bananas   accepting punches  helping nuns  unhating people  good insults and sex Read it at dawn and you become absorbed in his principles  I became Holden one time  Holden was a gentle madman   mean by thoughts yet really kind by deeds  It was disagreeable he was only fun  He was damn so positive  you could sing and I think I d be him sometime  a classic  raw and honest   Holden Caulfield sure doesn t like phonies  Luckily for him this book definitely wasn t phony  J D  Salinger uses language that everyone can relate to and writes in such a manner that I was laughing  sometimes LOLing  throughout the entire novel  I reread this book everytime I need a little pick me up and some perspective to make me realize that no matter how seriously I take myself  there s always room to poke fun  I would suggest this book to a mature teen  at least 15 years of age  The main character is a senior in high school who touches on subjects of a sexual nature  Holden also drops the F Bomb quite a few times towards the end of the book  So if you re offended by cursing this book is not for you  or your teen    When little Phoebe dragged that big suitcase showed up  and kept asking his brother  Can I go with you  and everything   It really kills me  What a lovely kid  And when they were at the zoo  when little Phoebe ride the carousel  the atmosphere between them really makes me crying  Sibship is not a thing you can throw away  it is in your blood  it will alway warms you and makes you crying   this story is aabout a spoiled handsome rich kid whose not very likable and keeps getting kicked out of school    The shocking ending as to why he is the way he is will blow you away  My first book ever  Gifted to me by my cousin on my 16th Birthday  You want to know a teenager s mind  Read this book  I personally resonated with the thoughts of the main character   his style of thinking  adventurous streak   his view of the world   If you re a teenager   you haven t read this  you re missing something      Holden Caulfield is just a normal highschooler trying to figure out what to do with himslef  Yet  he is different  He has been kicked out of many private prep boarding schools in New York because he is failing  And he is only failing because he thinks everyone in his life is a big  phony   He is perfectly well smart enough to be the top in his class   The Catcher in the Rye  is just a story about the three days of Holden s life when he is kicked out of the latest school  but can t go home until he is supposed to for Winter Break  He starts hanging out with his old friends  He is to mature to be around everybody else  but too immature for everybody else to be around him  As just a quick read  I highly recommend this novel for the horrible  yet addicting writing style and the horrible  yet addicting plot   No significant action really happens in this book  but the language is  helluva swell   It killed me every fucking time that Holden was fed up with some  phonies  or  flits   when he gave  the old eye  to some waitress or gave a buzz to  good old Phoebe   who was his 10 year old little sister   He was the original hater  and I felt very identified with him  I laughed a lot  and I love to laugh  5 stars then  I loved this book so much just because I could relate to the main character  Holden  By reading the reviews of the book  The Perks of being a Wallflower   I thought those two books are very similar  so I was afraid when I started reading  The Catcher in the Rye   since I didn t like Chbosky s book  It actually turned out really well  I don t think that everyone would like this book or that everyone understood it the way I did  but if you re young and still looking for yourself and you hate to see the inequity in this world  I think you will like it      I truly enjoyed this book  everything about it made me love Holden and Salinger  the plot is quite simple  but the way he analyzes the dephts of Holden s personality is wonderful  you don t get to know that boy in a  classic  way  as Dickens used to do and you understand that from the very first lines  If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  an what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth   The book is full of deep thoughts  all scattered through the pages  that make the plot never boring  I can t stop reading him and I really wanted to talk to the writer  as Holden said    or  at least  this is how I felt  what I found while reading this book  I felt somehow like Holden  if you didn t  then I understand why you hate it   sorry for my English e_e   Why this book inspired many killers  such as the man who killed John Lennon or Kennedy said that they had inspired by this book  Does it full of rebellion from a young boy named Holden  the main character  Holden was spelled from his last school  he had been spelled from his previous schools   Instead of told his parents and went home  Holden run away from dormitory to New York  He had three nights there  These 3 nights life of Holden became point of this book  How his missed his big brother  his late brother and his little sister  Phoebe  He did not miss his parents  He missed his brothers and sis after he had heard a girl sang The Cather in the Rye  in street near Central Park  What happened to Holden like hated school very much as well as the  hipokrasi  from his teachers and most of the students  his classmates and seniors   Many students committed suicide since they could not bear the treats from school  It might the critics from Salinger himself to education system at that time  It was the time when US education system was really orthodox  gave no freedom to students  Parents also had dominant role in their children educations  They tended to send their children to prestigious and dorm school to maintain their social status  It also often appeared in sort of movies that described the era such as Monalisa Smile  and Dead Poet Society  During his 3 days of running away  Holden experienced many incidents like a quarrel when he had tried to sleep with a hooker  or a time when he stayed in his former teacher s apartment  He thought that his teacher was gay  He sneaked to Holden while he was sleeping  Many incidents led him to his home   One of my favorite books in high school and college  Salinger portrays isolation and one s struggle to individuate with starking reality  I love this story  Franey and Zooey is a good follow up  Yeah  I think the ducks are probably important Holden has experienced a lot of death on a personal level  but he s also standing in for the way post war America was dealing with the losses of World War II  While others may find hope in religion  like the two nuns  or the Quaker student that he knew at school  or romanticized logic  like the cab driver who insists that  obviously  mother nature would take care of the fish  and the ducks  or even in consumerism and pop culture  like Sally and all the phony kids at his school   it s all just phoniness to Holden  None of it helps him Somehow  the ducks do  Just knowing that the ducks come back over and over again  no matter how harsh the winter is or how unconcerned  Mother Nature  is with the ducks  they come back  He doesn t know where they go  just like he doesn t know how he s going to make it through his own winter  But they come back  year after year  and so will he  Here are some of my favorite quotes  When I really worry about something  I don t just fool around  I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something  Only  I don t go  I m too worried to go  I don t want to interrupt my worrying to go   Real ugly girls have it tough  I feel so sorry for them sometimes   You take somebody that cries their goddamn eyes out over phony stuff in the movies  and nine times out of ten they re mean bastards at heart   Totally get why this book over the years is a classic   that polarizes opinion  I admit I didn t have to read it in school and likely a good thing  I m sure younger readers would get annoyed with Holden and his rich white boy privilege  But reading it as an adult gave me some distance from Holden and also some compassion  I know readers have called it  dated  but give Holden an iPhone replace every damn with f  ck and every sonofabitch with motherf    er and you re not far off from today s sixteen year old privileged white boy  I liked listening to Holden s monologue and POV  possibly one of fictions most unreliable narrators  as he weaved through New York  Funny  sad  and clueless as we often are when we re a teenager  Definitely read it   as an adult  samoe zanimatel noe  sravnivat  perevody na russkii  Osobenno   Maksa Nemtsova i Rity Rait Kovaliovoi  takoe

sophomore year of high school  What s amazing about revisiting this book is that it affects you differently each time  based on where you are in your life s trajectory When I was younger it was about being misunderstood and let down by all of the  phonies  in the adult world  In my 20s it was about dealing with emotional issues and coming to terms with the way the world actually is  not the way we want to see it  In my 30s it was about a young man who so desperately needed understanding and nurturing  And in my 40s it was  quite simply  the most brilliant literary protagonist I d ever read  Holden Caulfield will always be my first love   After debating between this and 1984  I can safely say that THIS is my favorite book of all time  The story flows like a calm and peaceful river  the ideas that the book brings is phenomenal  But my favorite thing in this book  and my favorite part of any book  is Holden Caulfield  He is  without a shred a doubt  the most complex  diverse and relatable character I have ever seen  He is easily my favorite fictional character of all time  and I have read The Great Gatsby for goodness sakes  I just can t get over The Catcher in the Rye and its brilliance  Normally I don t like to reread books  but this will be the only book I will read year after year after year  I love this book  what else can be said   This book is an American classic  as Holden Caulfield takes on the burdens of adulthood  Since we all grow up  I guess we should all read it and see if there is any truth there  Bir cocugun ic sesi  buyukler dunyasinin

the rye by J D Sullenger  The book takes place in the late 1940s to early 1950s it is about a boy named Holden  Holden lives in New York City and attends a lot of private schools however academically he doesn t care so he ends up getting expelled a lot  One night at pencey  his school  he gets really depressed and decides to live in the city  Throught the book he meets new people  has adult life experiences  and does different things  Also  Holden tries to find his place in lifeThis book is told in the first person of Holden  Holden is 16 in the book and is explaining his life and his experiences  Holden thinks that everyone is phony  and or dumb  You perspective can change through the book about Holden  For example in the beginning I thought he was a spoiled brat who did not care about his life  However  later in the book you find yourself rooting for him to find his place in life and you end up supporting him  Holden has many qualities to him he is smarts  caring  carefree  manipulation  and dark humor  One example of his manipulation and smarts is that he can go into bars and get alcoholic beverages because he looks older than sixteen on account of some of his gray stands in his hair  The book can actually be very funny because of Holden s dark humor an example of this is  Who wants flowers when you re dead  Nobody  However this humor may not appeal to everyone so don t read the book just based on humor that I mention  By the end of the book I was so drawn in I did not want it finish I really wanted to listen and learn more about his experiences  I would recommend this book to all teenagers and adults  I would advise against a younger audience reading it because it has adult experiences such as prostitutes  drinking  drugs  and smoking  which a younger audience would not understand  However the book was OUTSTANDING  Not many people read these novels especially adults however almost everyone can relate to Holden  Everyday Holden has a new adventure waiting for him  I also had a ton of questions my questions were when will Holden s parents find out  Will he ever return to his family  I could not wait for end of the book for the questions to be answered  FINAL VERDICT  5 5  Loved the book  I read it after the Great Gatsby  I had pretty low expectations  but this one was good It was something I wasn t expecting from classics  It broke every law of writing  the same sentences repeated  the same words used again and again  And that s what is good about it  it seems a person is really speaking his head out  It s not phony  The book is witty  The details are well constructed  Not much of a moral  the book just provides the point of view of a person who is going through a fall  Don t expect the book to provide you with tremendous insights though  Salinger just picks something up  anything and points out its uselessness and lack of meaning  It s a book to be read when you are feeling down  slightly  Seriously like one of the greatest books ever  do I even need to say anything else  At first  I rated it three stars because I could understand some of the message behind it and didn t find it too painful  I was looking back and I realized that this book needs time to be fully chewed and swallowed Holden s monologues aka the whole book can be annoying  Really  really annoying  But when you stop to think about the depth of the book  not just an angsty teenager and rebellion but the many layers and many different ways this work can be interpreted  you realize that it s not so much of a good book to read but a good book to think about  It s a solid piece of literature that could maybe even be an art piece  No one will really know if Holden was or was not a phony or if Salinger s message can be read on the surface or not or whether his message is found in the text or in the book as a whole  This added to Salinger s reclusive life style basically means that you have to decide for yourself exactly what the book is about and represents because you could really run in any direction with it That s what I enjoy most about this book  how you can discover new sides to the story that you would never have imagined months later   Perhaps the best thing about The Catcher In The Rye is how human it is  When one reads it  you can really connect with the frustration and wonder of Holden Caulfield  the narrator  However  despite this familiarity  he remains a little distant  He speaks to you  telling you things  explaining  complaining  whatever  and you listen  But it is not a case of one and the same  No  Holden tells you his story  and it is for you to glean what you can from it  For me  it led me to question a bit myself and the world  ask myself questions like  What do I want   and the like  And I feel like that is something a lot of people need  The Catcher In The Rye does not have a very defined story structure  in fact  I d have the cheek to say it has not a defined beginning and end  It is merely a snippet  it seems  out of Holden Caulfield s fascinating life  A glimpse into his head  And that is exactly what I want from a book  I don t want everything to be given to me  I want to feel as if there is more  and it is real  When you re young it always seems that the world is against you so you revolt and try to fight back and it takes time to discover your own place in the sun  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry   There always must be someone between you and an abyss who wouldn t let you make a fatal step Mark David Chapman after he had shot John Lennon remained at the scene reading The Catcher in the Rye until the police arrived and arrested him   isn t it disgusting  I d heard a lot about this book  i read it for school and was surprised by how much i liked it  it was really different from all the other books i had to read for my english class and i liked the teenage language style  holden is a character that s easy to understand  the way he sees the world and our society    we ve all been there  i could understand him and the problems which salinger wanted to show us  i loved how there was no summary on the back of the book  that made it mysterious  tbh  reading the catcher in the rye was like reading a lovely book during my free time   it didn t feel like i was forced to read it for class  and if a book achieves that  then for me it s a good book  special yes  but good  I absolutely loved this book  It was simply a story of a few days of a boys life  nothing more and nothing less  I thought it was well written  Holden was hilarious and sharp  and  towards the end  deeply upset   This book has been in my library forever  For all the debate and crap  it s a rebellious  cynical and sarcastic look at a 1950 s teenagers  Why was it such a well read  studied and critically acclaimed book  Because everyone could identfy with it  even most would deny it  Much like similar books about coming of an age  it rattled the authority and power   But I feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  about You don t even have to be 17 to feel like in a way we re all Holden Caulfield I might add this book to my favourites But not now  It s too early now  I m still grieving over the fact that the book has an ending  This book was very different from other books I have read and other books I will probably ever read  The book gave just a small snippet of Holden s life and left you hanging at the end  It was interesting in the way that I thought perhaps the problem to be solved  as there is often a problem and a resolution in a story would be that he would face his father and a compromise would be reached between them  but it did not end like that  the reader did not even meet his father  but instead with Phoebe  his younger sister  riding around on the carousel  This made you think deeper as to what the meaning or problem was  Perhaps it was Holden growing up  When he gave his sister his hunting hat  perhaps it was him giving away the younger side of him and leaving behind his feelings from school  growing up slightly  None the less  it was a fabulous book and I thoroughly enjoyed it I think everyone that reads this can basically identify with some of the self imposed angst that Holden feels  We like to see ourselves in things  which is precisely the reason this book is awesome  I  understood  it totally at 16  maybe less at 23   felt cynical while I read it and a need to judge it  just as Holden might have done     and when I reread it after Salinger died  I fell in love all over again  The character of Holden isn t REALLY cynical at all  rather he is a romantic  constantly disappointed and in awe of everything  That s an endearing quality  His skepticism is obviously masking insecurity and his innocence both complicates and simplifies him  One of my favorite books of all time  This is one I ll be reading for the rest of my life  totalmente recomendado   JD Salinger disappears in Holden Caufield  creating a brilliant portrayal of teenage angst and a view of a generation in flux  Yeah  Holden can be self absorbed and a bit depressing and annoying  but he s also a realistic three dimensional character  The result is a poignant novel that is as relevant and feels as fresh now as it did in 1951  even if some of the colloquialisms at times feel dated  It remains the starting point for many  I have reread at least seven times and bought it in four different editions  An obsession really  a simple obsession Omygod  This book actually took me days to finish  It wasn t because of the length of the book  it was because of the words and when I was reading this  I didn t know what to look forward to  I mean  I didn t know what s the main focus of the story  be it his brother s death s effect on him  or his problem with flitty people  or with girls  or with the phoniness of the people  Yeah I know the last one is the dominating one in the story among those I ve mentioned  Also  the language  God  this book has a lot of slangs from the early 1940s or something  I had to charge my phone to search the words in this mobile dictionary  Considering that English isn t my mother tongue  I really had to go through the whole process of stopping then searching the word and even searching analysis on google and other stuffs about what those recurring symbols mean  the hunting hat  the ducks  and all  Haha I like the story  It happened for only about days  I mean  the duration of his story  but it was enough to know a lot about the character  Why do I see myself in Holden   o Seriously  almost everything that he d thought about  the hitch hiking stuff  living in the cabin in the woods  hiding your children and teaching them all by yourselves  the going out of school stuff  and a lot more  I have also thought of those even until now  When I was reading  I was like   Oh thank god  I m not the only one   And there were times when I said   Sh t  this is totally me  Do I have to consult a psychoanalyst too   Because really  I think all the people have been there  been going through this  or will go through this  This is a very relatable book  This may have been published in 1951  but you can really see that teenagers before and now are still kinda similar  Okay  overall  it s a great book  Holden s story begins on a Saturday following classes at Pencey prep school in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  This is the fourth school that he has failed out of  rather pathetic if you ask me  He has a very unique personality  not much of a drive and no personal motive to becoming better and is always swearing and being rude  If you don t want to read at least two swear words a page  then Catcher In The Rye is not the book for you  Although  in my opinion  the language and technique used is quite brilliant  it would not have the same meaning or appearance if those words weren t there  He has failed four of the five classes he is in  ironically enough he passed English  The thing about Holden is that he is compulsive liar  He lies to everyone  so this story shouldn t be taken too seriously  but then on the other hand  he could be lying about being a liar  Confusing  huh Holden goes to visit his elderly school history teacher  In the process  Spencer attempts to change his mind about school and what he wants to do with his life  and of course he becomes irritated and gets our as fast as he can  He hears that enough from his parents and other schools  sometimes it just takes one more person that can toss you over the edge  Many things come his way that he s not too thrilled about  of course not many people are fond of random women on subways  prostitutes  men who think they are too good for everyone  and old girls that don t understand  and being drunk all the time  Things just never turn out the way that he expects  but when do they ever turn out the way that we expect them to The one thing that he can count on is his baby sister  Phoebe  She adores him  She even arrives with her suitcase  She wants to go away with him and not have to be at home anymore  He has a rough temper and says no  she begins to cry and says she won t talk to him anymore  but she does follow him to the park and rides the carousel  He loves the fact that she is happy again Although this is just the beginning of his story  he stops talking about what has happened  He mentions that he gets  sick  but other than that  he mentions no more  As he looks to his future  he is  cautiously optimistic    Another book that I started with high hopes was The Catcher In The Rye  J  D  Salinger and his masterpiece were in the news of recent due to the sad demise of the author earlier in 2010  I failed to read the news pieces  for I am lousy when it comes to reading about contemporary happenings in the world  but I did manage to find out that the book was an instiller of rebellion  Curious  I began the book with almost no idea of the content  for the title provides no clue to what is to be expected from the story  much unlike my last read   Treasure Island  What I faced was a beauty  Something written to provoke one s sympathy  anger  disappointment  angst  The entire novel lives a few days in the life of a sixteen year old boy  It describes his  adventures  when he is kicked out of the school and leaves it but does not return to his home  The writing beautifully captures the confusions and the anxiety of the protagonist  or of any sixteen year old  relating to academics  human tendencies  love  sex  philosophy  religion  future and life in general  To me personally  it appealed in a way that I could relate to  The sudden bouts of romanticism  the urge to shun all pretense  to hate all those that pretended  disappointment in people s failure to understand one s self  impulses to leave everything behind for a faraway land and life in anonymity  all seemed to me as feeling that I had either lived  or had felt scraping my life  or see some around me go through  Salinger writes in a way that seems very much like a teenager describing his problems  his angst  his disappointment in others for their lack of understanding  his disappointment in himself for understanding  his love for his siblings  his hatred for  phonies  What struck me as the most beautiful aspect of the story was the sudden phases of romance that the condescending youth went through  The apparent irony with which he treated every subject  the meaning of the contradictions known to him but his inability to explain them explicitly  It is the second book in which I read the author speak through the mind set of a young one  the first being Harper Lee s  To Kill A Mockingbird   The story in itself is not much but nevertheless is never boring  The author keeps it to the point and off every point at the same time  I learnt to appreciate the title as I went along  An apter one might not have been possible The book left me exhilarated and thoughtful  Praising the author in my mind and to the ears of every person who could lend one  I recommend it to anyone who has not read it till now  It is a delight to read Salinger in this one  I hope his others turn out similarly interesting  All I know is  I m glad I didn t read this book when I was younger  although it is about a young adult  I wouldn t have had the life experience in my earlier years to have been able to have grasped this story  I read all the reviews about it   what a creep Holden is  HE S the REAL phony  and so on and so on But the painful truth is that  yes  Holden Caufield is all these things  But he s just about the most perfect character I ve ever read  Human  Confused  Angry  Insecure  Messed up  Honest  brutally so  But his honesty is with himself  It s been a long time since I ve read a character whose self loathing gripped me so hard  And I loved him for it  Underneath all the critical jive he had going on was one of the most tender  deep  reflective hearts I ve ever read  His pain  thinking of his dead brother underground in the rain and cold  grass  growing on his stomach   Never being able to separate the flesh and blood brother with the deceased  The regret he had for not allowing his brother to hang out with him and his buddies that one day  A regret that a less sensitive person would never have even remembered  His reflections on  old Phoebe   his younger sister  The way every little move of hers could evoke so much emotion in him  Nah  Holden Caufield wasn t a creep  He was just a very realistic young person who had the misfortune of letting the irritating things in life   irritate him  And  again  most of my fondness for him might be that need to  be a recluse  inside me  My own short fuse when it comes to life s annoying rubs  But  whatever the reason  I ached for him  I knew him  I felt a strong bond to him  And I m glad I saved the experience until I was an adult so I could recognize my own messed up self in him   Amazing book  It is beautiful the way Mr  Salinger guides us in the madman life weekend of this young boy  Once you think about it  it is clear how Salinger illustrates Holden s  craziness  by repeating his ideas  how Holden is so confused about his life that cannot even explain why he behaves the way he does  How his ideas and actions contradict each other  He is what he hates  but he does not want to be it either  He will prefer to stay right where he is just like the Museum displays where nothing will change  J  D  Salinger s magnum opus  The Catcher in the Rye  1951   was a landmark novel in the 20th century American literature and was listed as one of the best English language novels of the century  Hailed as that  rare miracle of fiction    where  a human being has been created out of ink  paper  and the imagination   this mock autobiographical story  narrated by a cynical  sardonic  cuss tongued  yet sensitive and grieving seventeen year old Holden Caulfield as he spends his days in a mental asylum  has captivated the imagination of many and sold more than 60 million copies  and continues to sell 250 thousand copies a year In the vernacular of his time  the 1940s   which Salinger delivered in an incredible capture of language  Holden tells us  about this madman stuff that happened to  him  around last Christmas just before  he  got pretty run down  when he went to New York the night following his expulsion from Pency Prep The Catcher in the Rye is the mouthpiece of Holden s rebellion  the launch of his antipathies toward the  phoniness  of adulthood  In the character of Holden  Salinger molded an archetype of teenage angst and alienation  almost like a younger sibling incarnate of the disturbed unnamed narrator in Dostoyevsky s Notes from Underground  Mark David Chapman  the man who shot John Lennon  said   Because Lennon was a phony   His response letter was only composed of one line   The Catcher in the Rye   World War II created Salinger  the soldier was  the ghost in the machine of all the stories   Salinger carried chapters of The Catcher in the Rye to help him survive and wrote amid the war  The pages landed on the shores of D Day  hid in the trenches  and witnessed the atrocities of the concentration camps  all of which were funneled into the novel Due to unwanted fame  Salinger went reclusive  and the public invaded him throughout his life  Though remaining unpublished from 1965 until his death in 2010  he wrote prolifically  In the bunker where he installed himself was a safe full of manuscripts  this was said to contain the complete chronicles of the Caulfield and Glass families  other novels  short stories  and a Vedanta manual  Claims hold that Salinger  left instructions authorizing a specific timetable  that these works be published between 2015 and 2020 Despite having only a few visible works in his oeuvre  Salinger was a literary giant as The Catcher in the Rye resonates through generations of teenagers caught between childhood and adulthood  A reread  of course  If you re like me and haven t picked this up since you were 16  I d recommend you do    in ways  it was like a whole different book  I still loved the writing  the characterization  and Salinger s incredible ability to pinpoint specific life discomforts  that you have had  but maybe didn t even realize you have had  and certainly didn t ever expect anyone else has had   I laughed out loud and cried in public rereading this  But it s interesting  At 16  I remember Holden being some sort of inspirational figure who totally understood me  and even kinda loving him a little  But now I m an adult  and I so often found myself thinkin that maybe he should deal with his crap and grow the f up  Maybe I turned into a phony  I think I m gonna come back to this again in another 7 years  It may not have affected me in the same way this time around  but I think it s absolutely amazing that teenagers can relate so profoundly to this character in a unique way that older people maybe can t  That s some kinda magic  Funny story  I read this book as a teenager and hated it  I thought Holden was a douche and resented the fact that my English teachers all thought I would love it and totally relate to him  Reading it as an adult  it s painfully  painfully  obvious to me that the reason I reacted so strongly is that this book was quite literally a mirror my teenage self  In every conceivable way  I was Holden Caulfield  and of course I hated reading a book about myself Every word  every line in this book rings true  It s frightening and deeply painful at times  but what a book  There s no way I could have ever appreciated it as a kid  but as an adult  This is a monumental achievement  and a book I think I ll need to re read every few years or so just to remind myself of its brilliance  And  of course  I ll recommend it to any teenagers who remind me of myself  But I suspect they ll hate it until they re old enough to reflect on their own stupid teenage selves   Incredible classic In J D  Salinger s novel   The Catcher in the Rye   Holden Caulfield is a seventeen year old prep school drop out who tells the story about his life changing twenty four hour stay in New York City  He experiences the phoniness of the adults throughout his trip  The qualities he values most are kindness and integrity  and he finds few adults to look up to in either of these aspects  He attempts to deal with the death of his younger brother and an overwhelming pressure to lie about his troubling sexual experiences  Anyone who is at the age of sixteen or older will be able to identify with this unique character because Holden contains bits and pieces of all of us  This is the reason that  The Catcher in the Rye  has become one of the most loved and read book of our time  I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 because Salinger s writing is so clever  his characters are so real  and his writing makes it easy for anyone to relate to the characters  Even though the book was written over 60 years ago  readers can still understand and relate to the plot  Throughout the book  Holden over analyzed every person he encountered  He would go on and on about the same thing  therefore losing me at some parts but then grabbing my attention unexpectedly  If this book ever had a penis  i d fuck a shit out of it  I did not read this book once or twice  I read it whenever I could  Tens of times  Sometimes I had to hold my breath to finish it  It was a book to remind One may think that I was influenced by that average Mel Gibson movie Conspiracy Theory and  the assassin of Kennedy had a copy of Catcher in the Rye in his pocket  legend  but it was not so  However it is true that I found myself reading the book after I watched the film  But the reason I repeated reading it  is nothing to with the American this and that I suppose there are many people who may regard this book as pulp or a passtime magazine  I prefer to leave them be  Holden Caulfield is about how every one of us is disgustingly fake and how each and every one of us continues to pretend we aren t so  The only way out is to embrace that fake ness  It s not as bad as it sounds you know I used to read the ending just to remind myself what was going on in the whole book  Holden s sister IS the catcher  She is the whole point in life  At least for Holden  Everyone has some catcher  Or else  I don t know what I also like the bit on the prostitute  I do not know why  she gave me a tense realization of Holden s inner conflict  She gave me possibilities of every character of the book  It is also the texture of the book  It is a book of possibilities  You never really know any character for sure  Except for the sister whose name I forgot  She is the only divine figure in this godless  wanna be tragedy  I d very much like to dig into the concept of godlessness and the modern in  Catcher in the Rye  but that s a plan for the future for now This book must be read to love or hate  not to like or dislike or say  hmm  I guess it s just a book   Or else it s just faking to have read it   I think this book is amazing  It is relatable to me   I don t know if that is a good thing  but I believe that everyone has a Holden Caulfield inside them  It is written with great humor  irony  and sarcasm and beneath Holden s hate and stream of consiousness is hidden deep philosophical questions and answers You have to be in the right mood to read this book   it is not very optimistic  neither very easy to understand  in the sense of symbolic values  message and such  A very good story about a boy who hates practically everything and everyone except perhaps children  and he is fully aware of this and it makes him depressed  A story about hate  frustration  coming of age  and living with your thoughts   that you somtimes wished wasn t yours  Just re read for the third or fourth time  It was great to be able to have a more accurate map of New York in my head as I was reading  to be able to take the city today and imagine it as it was in the late  40s  early  50s  Also  having recently spent a few months researching cultural figures from the  20s through the  40s also helped me to better imagine the world that Holden Caufield navigates  None of this  of course  is necessary to love this novel  Even though I m now twice Holden s age  I still find myself identifying with his search for an authentic life  his repugnance for all things  phony   god  especially in New York   Salinger very adeptly created an everyman for the twentieth century in Holden  Even though he lives in NY and comes from a well off family  his resistance to that life  that culture  make it easy for anyone to relate to him and his struggles   The book  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  is a book about a boy going through adolescence  It revolves around 16 year old Holden Caulfield  who was recently expelled from Pencey  a high school near New York  Realizing that his parents would not get the letter telling them that he was expelled  until Christmas  He uses this time to go to New York  and hide for awhile  On his journey  he sneaks drinks  hires prostitutes  lies like you would never believe  and much more  His entire journey has a undertone to subjects  much like many of Allan Moore s graphic novels  that keeps people intrigued to hear the point of view of a 16 year old  This story is a very controversial book  that has lead to many arguments between readers  I found this book to be very good read  It had a writing style that was interesting  and was unlike most  The undertones were like a well made puzzle  that kept you guessing what it was actually trying to talk about  If you didn t focus on the undertone  while hard not to  it was a simple journey of a boy  The storyline reminds me a lot of  Freak the Mighty   by Rodman Philbrick  not in what they do exactly  but in the fact that they are both adolescents on an unusual journey  inspired by not getting in trouble  I thought that it was a great read  that all should partake in reading  even though it is on the banned books list  I was first interested in the book because of it s controversial subjects  which I enjoy a lot  and a friend recommended to me  I give  The Catcher in the Rye  a five out of five stars  It was a very intriguing book  that was a great read  It was more than I expected from this book  which made me happy  and was not disappointing  If you like realistic fiction  or not unrealistic adventures  then you will love this book  unless of course your not a fan of books that have an undertone  I would definitely recommend this book  and I give it five out of five  It was so deep  I think everyone goes thru that phase before becoming an adult that they re scared what that might mean for them    Salinger makes you feel like you want to take care of Holden thru the horrible things he s going through and the ending was beyond worth it  It was so heartwarming seeing Holden realise that childhood is not equal to innocence and adulthood is not equal to corruption and that we can choose the people we want to be  It was life changing seeing him happy without changing his external environment  going to therapy and everything    beautiful  3  It s just about this kid who complains the entire book for no apparent reason   or  a judgmental teenager who is nervous about having sex   This book is so much more than Holden struggling to conform with the  pressure  of participating in sexual intercourse  I connected with Holden more and more after each page  Those of you who have read may be concerned by that statement  but allow me to rave further  Of course I wholeheartedly despise his perception of women  but I had to analyze him deeper to fully comprehend his perspective of society  Holden is lost  he has no sense of direction  which explains his curiosity with where the birds go when the pond freezes over  The birds fly south  they have a sense of direction  but he doesn t  Everything is phony and  kills  him   The Catcher in The Rye by J D  Slinger is about a teenage boy  Holden Copperfield  who struggles to get through his brother  Allie s death  Although Allie died because he was sick and there was nothing to do about it Holden was the most affected from his family  Through the book Holden is constantly mentioning him  His daily life is affected by Allie s death  Holden s main fear is to grow up  Because Allie died at such a young age Holden always wants to be like that he does not realize that Allie would have grown older and become more mature  That s why Holden adores his little sister Phoebe  Holed mostly liked Allie because of his originality  In the book you also realized that Holden abhors unoriginal people  That s another reason why Holden loves his sister  She is unique in her own little way  The thing is that he is not the best role model for her to follow  As the book goes on Holden does start to make better decisions  By the end of the book he is able to be that big brother and show her the right path instead of being backwards   I really enjoyed this book while I was reading it  This first person point of view book does sound like a 16 year old boy was writing it  This is mostly because the word choice used is how we  teenagers  talk at a daily basis  Holden is just another one of us trying to find what he really wants in life    After reading this book and talking to others who have read it the world seems like it is split in two  people that like Catcher in the Rye and people that don t  What side am I on  My rating might make it clear but it was really hard to rate this book  It s like having to rate the original Spider Man movies  me as a comic book nerd cannot do it others can but I can t  to rate those movies you have to dissect them which is what I will do with Catcher in the Rye  Lets start out with our main character Holden  Holden is a teenager who flunks out of almost any school he goes to  To todays time that seems cliche but at that time not really  From reading through the whole book Holden seems like a smart kid but doesn t imply himself  Trust me half way through the book I was tired of his knaggy attitude too but then if you think about what your reading it makes sense Holden is a teenager  I know from that it looks like I am categorizing that all teenagers are like that but most are like that  So when that registers I think J D  Salinger has that part of the character down  Holden in a sense seems confused like some teenagers about his future but is still in a place where he knows he has a future of something  The whole part of Holden being Catcher in the Rye seems smart to me meaning that Holden thinks of himself like this because he feels like he is  catching everybody and throwing them back   Doesn t everybody feel like that every once in a while that they have a responsibility that you are keeping everything afloat  maybe I am interpreting that part wrong but that s what I think for me personally  The last thing other than Holden I wanted to dissect was the message of the book  People have different ideas of what to think of this message mine is about intelligence  Making something of your life and using that  There is one part of this book that I love the most  at the end of the book Holden visits one of his past favorite teachers and even though the teacher ends up a little weird I love what he says  The teacher talks about how intelligence must be implied for the most part and how the way Holden going he is going to end up like one of the old high school jocks who don t do anything with what they had  Anyway my thoughts on Catcher in the Rye was that everybody should be required to read it sadly where I am from kids don t  This book I think taught me to live long and Prosper   I believe I have read this book about four times already  Perhaps it is my love for Character Development and Hero s Journey type themes or just the youthful and humorous tone throughout the novel  but I find myself laughing  smiling  crying  feeling and simply appreciating the wonderful story line of this novel every time I reread it  Personally  I can relate in many ways to Holden  the main character of The Catcher in the Rye  and his points of view  the longing for meaning and simplicity in life  the disgust for society s superficial and  phony  ways  and the admiration of his carefree younger siblings  This admirable young character and his  solo  adventure through the city have captured the essence of learning the necessity to separate oneself from the world in order to find one s true self   tshbh nhy  lHrs fy Hql lshwfn l  Hd m nhyt l flm lmGrby

blogspot com 2012 0    Interested in reading Charles Bukowski s Ham On Rye  I decided to read Catcher in the Rye first  A young boy  Holden Coulfield  narrates the 1951 novel by J D  Salinger  Coulfield is sixteen years old and undergoing treatment in a mental hospital  He attends Pencey Prep School  his fourth school since failing out of three others  however  he runs away to New York prior to being expelled  Coulfield encounters a number of regressions  as all the events he undergoes affect his mind  He searches for understanding and acceptance  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel  for it was very relatable  Holden was going through teenage angst and anger  He refused to grow up  but eventually grew up and became an adult  Unlike other novels  he used much profanity  Some may view it as a negative aspect  but I found that it made Holden more applicable and showcased his anger  The novel was  overall  very depressing  Holden smokes incessantly  drinks a great amount of alcohol  and discusses sex frequently  He hired a prostitute and was beaten by a pimp  in the end  he went through a mental break down  Catcher in the Rye gives impressionable minds bad ideas  which is why many may dislike it  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone  Like every teenager  Colden is just a troubled teenager that is searching for himself  This novel went into his mind   our minds  The usage of his profane language was necessary  This novel is aimed at readers who have an open mind about a boy and themselves  Catcher in the Rye was written for readers to reconsider their lives  It was an excellent novel and great read   What I really liked about Catcher In the Rye was the casual presentation of the story  coming from the always opinionated teenager  Holden Caulfield  It was a smooth read because of this presentation and flow  I also liked how Salinger created the character of Holden as a person who explains every thought he has  He never talks short about a topic  even if it s a very minor ordeal  This was refreshing  hearing an honest take from an honest character  throughout the whole novel  And of course  I liked the plot and the lessons messages that the reader can extract from the book  The way that the entire plot sets up Holden s character  just to wrap up the whole message of the story up in one small chapter or two in the very end was simply remarkable  Lastly  I loved how the book was centered all of the time on Holden and him only  The story never focuses on another character specifically  only certain characters  like Phoebe  for example  through Holden s eyes  There wasn t one aspect of this book that I didn t enjoy  The author perfectly captures the character of Holden  and impressively takes up practically the entire novel to do so  The plot was random  but this only enhanced the character development and purpose  Nothing in the novel happened for no reason  and I thought that was essentially what made the book so great  Like I mentioned earlier  the way that Salinger perfectly explains the story consistently through Holden s eyes with his opinions is classic  and makes for an always entertaining read that you can take a lot away from it   Like most people  I read this book first when I was a teenager  and like about half of people  I hated it  I constantly interrupted Holden by thinking  Why don t you just cheer up  Go back to school  You re rich  your family loves you  and you re young  so take off your weird hat and enjoy your life   Then  my sophomore year of college  I read it again for a class on YA literature  This time  I couldn t put it down  I think that Catcher has to strike you at exactly the right point in your life  and if it does  it feels like a revelation  Holden doesn t talk down to you   in fact  his honesty is overwhelming  He sometimes acts like a little jerk  but if you pay attention you realize that he is  outwardly  extremely kind  Inwardly  he s just confused  like a lot of people his age  about living in a world where people are cruel to each other without reason  This is a book for a day when you want to do nothing more than stare out a window   not for a day when you d rather be outside playing in the sun  Of course  there s nothing I can write that hasn t already been written about this 62 year old classic  I will just note that it remains a fun  easy  quality read and is not by any means a dark or threatening tale  as portrayed by some due to its supposed inspiration for a few famous celebrity assassins Anyone who would base anti sociatal  or anti phony  actions on this stream of conscious narrative from a normal  questioning  conflicted  thinking adolescent has issues that go well beyond any work of fiction   I didn t read this when I was young  I m 43 now and I m glad I read it now  I see why Holden appeals to the young  I also understand why so many hate him and hate his voice in the book  Salinger really  truly nailed the voice of this kid   writing so deeply in character  I don t know if Salinger even LIKED Holden  I don t think he did but that became beside the point  I think it s probably unfair to Holden to call him any one thing  He s spoiled  yes  He s whiny  yes  He s also so lost  The loss of his brother Allie and having no guidance to see him through the grief affected him so much  The thing that amazed me what how deeply Salinger wrote his character  He took the most unexceptional of the Caulfield children  the middle child  and focused on him  All three of the others seemed smarter and more creative  Holden wanted to be D B  and was furious when he sold out  He admired who Allie was in his short life and he loved Phoebe and wanted to protect her  He hated change   especially after Allie  The thing I took away most was that Holden Caulfield lacked wisdom  We all do at his age  He had plenty of experiences but true wisdom takes time and reflection to digest those experiences  He played  like most of us  at being a grown up until the wisdom of age appeared  Oh  he was flawed but I think he probably turned out okay  In my mind  he became a teacher  He spends some time toward the end imparting a little knowledge on younger kids  That seemed to make him happy  He wanted to be the one who would run out of the rye and catch kids heading for a cliff  That spoke volumes  He was a remarkably complex character  He was a whiny  spoiled prick that had legitimate  unresolved pain in his life  I think that maybe that was the point of the story  I don t know for sure what was in Salinger s mind  We are all complex  fragile creatures putting on brave faces in a world of complex  fragile creatures putting on brave faces  Okay book report over  J D  Salinger s  Catcher in the Rye  was published on July 16  1951  It was his first novel  It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations  I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book  I felt very close to Holden Caulfield  the main character in the story  as I read it  Holden Caulfield  a sixteen year old boy from New York  was quite unlike kids his age  He had no interest in being popular or social  From the very beginning he lets us into part of his personal life  His parents are very touchy and his mother is especially protective  It becomes clear very quickly where Holden s interests lie and where they start to veer off  He tends to lean away from the fake in the world and is a teller of what is real  Holden is not a fan of the movies at all  He saw his brother  D B   throw away his natural writing talent all for a large Hollywood check  Any other boy Holden s age would have been absolutely ecstatic to have a sibling working amongst the stats in Hollywood  but not Holden  It was all far too  phony  for him  and phony is his worst enemy  Salinger s use of sarcasm and irony is beautiful and hilarious  As I read through each chapter I found myself highlighting funny  sarcastic things Holden would say or think  and trust me  there are DOZENS of time where this occurs   One specific time in Chapter 8 he is talking to a cab driver who is acting like a real fool  Holden says to the readers   He certainly was good company  Terrific personality   Salinger s character Holden is actually a lot like Salinger in his real life  Like Holden  Salinger was known for his reclusive nature  Uninterested with the fakeness of the world  Holden keeps his distance from phony people  After Salinger s success of  The Catcher in the Rye   he slowed down his publishing and slowly but surely drifted out of the public eye  To this day Salinger refuses any offers to have  The Catcher  put on the big Hollywood screen  Salinger s ex lover  Joyce Maynard  even once said that   The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J D  Salinger   It seems to me that it is no coincidence that Holden is no fan of Hollywood and that Salinger in real life and doesn t want anything to do with turning his popular novel into a movie  Holden says   If there s one thing I hate  it s the movies  Don t even mention them to me  Since I have learned more about Salinger s personal life  I recognize a lot of Salinger s personality in Holden  In the story  Holden has overbearing parents much like Salinger s parents  Salinger said his mother was over protective  Salinger has one sibling  a sister  which is ironic because it is Holden s sister Phoebe who has a profound influence on Holden  He often talks about her with very high regards Holden is not a character who tried to sugarcoat the way he sees the fakeness around him  Holden  making fun of the people around him  often says things like  you would ve puked  and  it was very phony   I think that is another one of the reasons I like his character so much  For example  he is quite upset with the fact that his brother D B  is selling his work to Hollywood instead of using his talents for his own pleasure  Holden even says that his brother is his favorite author  Salinger himself is a man who wrote for his own pleasure and likeness  I made a similar connection to a girl named Sally that Holden likes in the book  to a real life lover of Salinger s named Oona  Oona O Neil was self absorbed and stuck up  according to Salinger  yet he still phoned and wrote her letters quite often  Holden s  Oona  in the story was a girl named Sally Hayes  Though he found her extremely irritating he thought she was very attractive as well  After spending a day with her  he pointed out about a dozen instances where he thought she was being  phone as hell   By the end of their only meeting in the book  Holden says to Sally   You give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth   The real life Oona O Neil ended up breaking it off with Salinger and married the famous actor  Charlie Chaplin Despite Holden being a sixteen year old teenage boy he acts much older than his age  One time in the story he has the chance to be with a prostitute but instead of acting like a pig  he starts to feel sorry for her and instead tried to have a conversation with her  He even offers to pay her for good conversation instead of for sex  He also stays alone in hotels randomly  drinks at bars and clubs often  and even tells people he s older than he really is  But the reason I find his character mature and intellectual is for other reasons Holden does not hold money or material things to be really important  He is more excited to hang out with his kid sister than he is any other time in the entire book  He is content with something that would probably be boring to other guys his age Like many teenagers  Holden is often depressed  The way he deals with it most times actually breaks my heart in a way  He likes to talk to his deceased kid brother  Allie  He will take a real event that he can remember where he was talking with him and pretend he is talking to him again  He says   I started talking out loud to Allie  I do that sometimes when I get very depressed   It is really very heart wrenching to hear Holden talk about his brother  One of my favorite moments in the book is when Holden and Phoebe are talking in Phoebe s room and she points out that Holden doesn t like anything  Holden responds quickly by saying   I like Allie  And I like doing what I m doing right now  Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff     Phoebe says to Holden   Allie s dead you always say that  If somebody s dead and everything  and in heaven then it isn t really     Holden interrupts her with his final comeback   I know he s dead  Don t you think I know that  I can still like him  though  can t I  just because somebody s dead  you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake  especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all  One of the most beautiful things about  The Catcher in the Rye  is the way Salinger uses symbolism  From Holden s red hunting hat  to Jane Gallagher s checker playing technique  Salinger wrapped up more than meets the eye into things you never would have dreamed  The main thing that drew me into this story is the realness of Holden s character  He is a teenage boy with a teenage boy s mind but seems to have far more common sense than anyone else around him  He is not a jock  He is not a math whiz or a science whiz  He is not really interested in sports  He sort of makes up his own category  a category that I call  the genuine   He is on his own a lot and loves it at first  but happiness and love are meant to be shared with others  It has a much less meaning when by itself and he realizes it by the end of the novel  He is growing intellectually little by little throughout the whole book  He realizes what really makes him happy  I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like to read a story that could possibly change the way they view the world  I have honestly laughed outloud to myself as I read this story  Yes  there is talk about drinking  sex  and lots of cussing  but if you are going to avoid reading this story because of that then your missing out on a beautiful masterpiece   Twenty years after my first reading of J D  Salinger s classic  I re read it  and boy did my opinion change this time around  Here  FYI  was my original review  written a year or two ago  based only on my memory of reading Catcher as a high school senior I read this my senior year in high school  I remember that even as a foul mouthed kid myself  the language in this book appalled me  It s a really strange story  and yet somehow compelling  Twenty years later  I find myself wanting to read it all over again  Do you think that makes me a serial killer This time around  I absolutely loved it   Plus  to my chagrin the language didn t bother me nearly as much as it did back then  I worry about what this says about me   It s going on my  Favorites  shelf  right beside Room With a View  That s because  for sheer depth of things said without being said aloud  Catcher is as masterful as Room  which is not something I say about very many books  Whereas 20 years ago  I merely thought it a  strange  story  now I can appreciate the undercurrents  which are the real point of the story after all  Holden Caulfield s gradual descent into mental illness is really more of a succumbing to the overwhelming  supressed pain of his young brother s death  His brush with mortality at such a young age  and his own fears of disappearing  his need to rescue his young self by being a  catcher in the rye  for other children  his intense quest to feel the way he thinks he is supposed to  and his inability to do so time and time again  for instance  during his visit with the prostitute  drive him deeper into desperation in a way that makes me think Salinger was decades ahead of his time in his understanding of the human heart and mind  The ending is just right  leaving room for hope  without promising anything  If you re old enough to recognize more than just  a really strange story  in Holden Caulfield s account  than I think it must be impossible to read it and remain unmoved  It s about the unheard cries of the human heart  and in that way  this is everybody s story  After the first chapter of this book  I decided to read this a little differently from how I usually do  I imagined that Holden was some guy I knew of  who I never thought much of  I imagined we d been locked in this place  a library  anywhere over night or something  I d told him a little about myself but really we weren t getting along  However  soon something very Breakfast club like happens and he starts telling me about an incredibly significant part of his life  I read this book as though Holden was finally starting to open up  Like he was telling me it personally  trusting me enough to tell it Of course I didn t agree with all he said  I love the movies    but I like him  He was more sensitive than he wanted people to believe  he was hurting  He was not just a badly behaved teenager but a lost  lonely and scared guy  The further I read on  the more I learn t and cared about him  I felt sorry for him  I only wished he had called Jane up  Holden clearly like Jane a lot  why else would he fight for her Holden is a good guy  a good brother and this is a story I can see staying with me for a while because we can all relate to feeling confused about the future and terrified about the shallow  ignorant and cruel society we lived in  Really enjoyed this book  Can t believe I m just reading this for the first time  I love it  I think if you are someone who has never had any sort of depression or feelings of despair that it would be hard to relate to  but I can definitely relate  This book is wonderful    The Catcher in the Rye takes place in New York City for the most part  But the character is constantly moving and doesn t stay in one place for very long  The point of view is in first person point of view in a narrative way  It is told from the perspective of Holden Caulfiel  He is also the main character in The Catcher in the Rye   Holden Caulfield is a teenage boy struggling to find a place where he cares  He is a slacker and is very picky about how he feels and who he hangs out with  Hee thinks everyone is a phony  He has trouble applying himself and the only person he can t find anything wrong with is his late brother Allie  He thinks that people don t deserve to be able to go out when Allie can t because he is dead   Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another school  Instead of going home he tries to find something to occupy his time  He goes from the hotel to the bar to the home of his old teacher  As he goes from place to place his mind wanders and you find out a lot of Holden s opinions  He has very strong opinions about life and how serious it is and how everyone now adays is phony  Even with this Holden has a captivation with child memories and you hear a lot about them  especially his brother Allie  Holden also feels like he is responsible for everyone  His dream job is to be the catcher in the rye who is responsible for catching the baseball players whenever they are not looking lest they fall off the cliff   I loved this book  It is amazing in the way it makes you think so much about how people really are and why they act the way they act  It also makes you feel sorry for Holden because he is so unhappy no matter who he is with  He doesn t know what to do with himself and he feels responsible for everyones well being  Although this book has no real plot it is captivating the way Holden talks to you and it will keep you glued to the pages   I decided to review this book  10 years after I read it for the first time  because I was snooping around Goodreads and found a discussion threat essentially bashing this book  And it is probably hands down my favorite book My introduction to this book came in my sophomore year of high school  and I ll never forget it  My teacher walked into the room  held it up and said  When the police found Mark David Chapman  John Lennon s killer   at the scene of the crime  he was reading this book  He told others that if Holden had grown up  he would have gone on to kill the biggest phony alive  and in Chapman s mind that phony was John Lennon   I was riveted  I LOVE John Lennon  and just that tidbit of trivia was enough to make me eager to read the book The book did not disappoint me  First off  Holden Caufield is one of the most engaging  infuriating albeit endearing  well developed narrator characters in all of literature  Yes that s a huge statement to make  and I stand by it  Holden s voice  so vulgar and honest  creates someone so real that it s scary  People love this book  people hate this book  others think it s nothing special  The reason I think this book sparks so much controversy is that Holden is so well developed  Salinger creates a kid that is an asshole  he s bitter  he s sad  he s funny  But he s complete  a complete  human character  I read like crazy and in the last 10 years have yet to find a book like Catcher in the Rye  or a character like Holden Like many of my literary favorites  this book is sad  Not in an obvious way like in books where the character dies  not the case here  don t think this is a spolier   but in a way that just leaves you with this pondering sadness  Salinger gives us this incredible look at the loss of innocence that Holden experiences  and I swear that everytime I read Holden saying that you can never rub all of the  fuck yous  out in the world  this book reels me back in  The metaphor of Holden wanting to a catcher in the rye when he grows up  is still one of the most vivid  symbolic  and powerful metaphors in all of literature  This book changed my life  And it s the reason I love to read so goddamn much  pun intended   I had to read this book for school  and at first I thought it was going to be boring like other books I have to read for school  but surprisingly I loved this book  Holden is a character that at times you will feel sorry for him  but at other times you hate him From start to finish  this book was filled with ups and downs  I d strongly recommend it to anyone  So now I get why this is on so many lists of must reads  Certainly I ve read many books with similar themes and ideas over the years and some close equals  some far from the equal of this  An excerpt of some thoughts I posted in a discussion on the book  Maybe I m strange    but having never read this until now  I totally and without equivocation  got  Holden Caulfield    the whole whining  dumb decision making  rambling  verbally   wandering  physically  and smart mouthed  smart assed and completely messed up boy man that he was  This book was stunning  I know it was written long ago but I truly didn t see feel it s age in very many places nor very long in those places where it did fleetingly seem  creaky  with the times  I can understand why it still holds its place as a classic of its genre right alongside the newer later models  I can comprehend the praise  the raves  all of the surrounding atmosphere of it  And  I will     likely put Holden s story on the all time favorites list henceforth  Although I ve always been taught to never judge a book by its cover  I m going to be completely honest when I say that I thought this book was going to be a complete bore to read  Without any prior knowledge  I assumed The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger would be yet another old fashioned novel that is deemed a  classic  because of when it was written Regardless  my dad was the one who persuaded me to read this book  He rambled on and on about how he  just knows I would love it  and how he read it  back in the day   So  reluctantly  I decided to give this book a shot  And  I am so glad that I did  In a very shortened summary  The Catcher in the Rye is about a 16 year old boy named Holden Caulfield who runs away to New York City in hopes of getting away from all of the problems he has been facing at school  With this  he discovers new parts of himself that he has never known  The book is a little hard to get into at first  seeing as there is a lot of exposition and explaining before we get to Holden actually running away  But  once you get past that  I promise that you won t be able to put it down  The Catcher in the Rye revolves around the ideas of identity  sexuality  mental health  and the overall value of life  which makes it one of the most relatable  realistic books I have ever read  And I believe that  in fact  all teenagers would be able to relate to this book in one way or another  However  I d highly recommend it to anybody willing to take on a new perspective  Some might argue the complete opposite  that the use of language  violence  and sexuality gives the wrong image of what the life of a teenager should be like  For example  there was a case in which Holden brought a prostitute named Sunny to his hotel room  but only to have a conversation with her  When she realized this  she left and came back with her pimp  Maurice  who punches Holden in the stomach whilst Sunny steals money from his wallet  This book wouldn t have the same  realistic feeling without these topics included  If you cut out all of the language  violence  and sexuality  the book would seem like a boy explaining why he ran away to his parents  Instead  The Catcher in the Rye is written like a diary  personable  intriguing  and overall interesting If anything  people should read this book because of the controversial topics  The ideas discussed in The Catcher in the Rye are all Holden s life lessons  similar to those learned by a typical teenager  And no  I m not saying to run away from everything to escape your problems  but I am saying that out of every mistake you make  you learn something new This book is considered banned not because it has strong language  sexuality  and violence  but rather because it touches on subjects that society wants to forget It is evident that Holden has mental health issues by the way he speaks  his rationale  and his way of thought  Mental health is a topic we seem to disregard as a society  so it is very refreshing to find a book that explores how issues like depression  bipolar disorder  anxiety  etc  can affect little things about your personality  The best way for me to describe The Catcher in the Rye is actually a quote in early chapter 3   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   Trust me  this book is definitely worth your time  I remember reading this book back in middle school and remember thinking  How pointless   I didn t understand why it was written how it was  and why it s centered around Holden  It seemed just to be a random collection of events in a random person s life  Reading it several years later  I gained a greater appreciation for Holden  He s a cool  honest kid  I enjoyed how he just did things  he didn t conform to what was around him   It s pretty funny that he mocks David Copperfield on the very first page  because I adore that book  So naturally  it ticked me off  But little did I know that by the end of reading this novel  I would place A Catcher In The Rye right beside DC at the absolute top of my book shelf  Sorry Holden   Sadly though  this book is borrowed    Holden Caulfield  o jovem heroi deste livro  que e ja um classico  fica na historia das personagens mais interessantes que se pode encontrar nas paginas de um livro Desconcertante  absolutamente original  puro no seu inconformismo e na sua forma peculiar e critica como ve os outros e o mundo  HC nao deixa ninguem indiferente J D Salinger escreveu esta obra prima ja ha 60 anos e continua a ser um livro perfeitamente actual  Eu tinha o lido muito jovem e ainda algo imaturo  quando foi publicado sob o titulo  Uma agulha no palheiro   e penso que era um titulo mais adequado  embora este actual titulo nos seja explicado num dos melhores textos do livro  One of my all time favourite books  Probably the book that got me into classics  So many emotions were uncovered when reading this and would recommend to anyone who loves a good book  The book is amazing  The book and story is quite short  but you get told so much  and you get a look in to Holden s life  the main character  as i have never seen before  How the book is told  and how Holden  speaks  to us  is pure genius  You have to use time on the book to reflect on how the story is told  and to understand how Holden is as a person  and how he is feeling  There are a lot of  hidden  messages  so you have to think of what he might is telling you   Even though I didn t really  enjoy  reading this book  I m going to give it 5 stars  because I Think it really does well what it wants to do  It wants to illustrate an angsty teenager who thinks he s better than everybody else  when in fact he s  quite obviously  not  Of course nobody is going to enjoy reading a book of a character you can t emphatize with and complains about everything and everyone  but that s what the book is supposed to be  The Catcher in the Rye is not like any other book I have ever read  I usually read books with mystery and suspense but this book is much different and is a very good read  There are a lot hidden meaning to the book so you have to read carefully and look at the spark notes to get the full meaning  Really great book though  My stance on The Catcher in the Rye is that this book is very relatable for the majority of the teen population  The book should be thought to 10th graders and maybe even younger teens like my sisters age  Ive never finished a book that I was assigned to read in school  and this is the only one that that I ve actually liked to read  When I was told I was going to be reading another book as an assignment  I thought to myself  great  another book of boring pointless papers at the end   When I got home I asked my 17 year old brother if he had read the before and surprisingly my 13 year old sister responded that she had and that it was good  and she s the one that actually got me interested into reading the book  While reading the book I was bored but at the same time I wanted to know what Holden would get himself into  This book  in my opinion  can be very influential on teens that haven t been through situations like Holden has  but are close to  to actually foresee what the consequences of their actions may be  Actually being a fan of The Perks of Being a Wallflower first  I had heard several comparisons to this work  I knew that I couldn t be an avid reader  and just skip over Salinger  Somehow  it hadn t been assigned to me in high school  but I took a literature class during my fall semester of junior year at Florida State  where it was assigned   We actually read Nine Stories first  and I was excited to get to Catcher On one of the exams for the class we were actually prompted with a question about books being burned  and out of the assignments what we would have saved  and I just can t imagine the literary world without this novel  Salinger exquisitely captures how it feels to be a teenager in any time period  through the story of Holden Caulfield  Something about Holden makes you fall in love with him  maybe because most of us are him  or have been him  for even a moment in our lives  I love the stream of consciousness style  and the relentlessly honest descriptions of the facets of life that are difficult to trudge through at that age  It amazes me that this was written by an adult because it reminds me of many things in life that seem to be left behind as we grow older  A lot of times adults lose the ability to remember what they felt like at Holden s age  or to connect with people at that age now  I think I would have enjoyed Catcher even more if I had found it in my own high school days  I have noticed that people either love this  or hate it  I personally think that everyone should try and read at least once  I think people get frustrated with the novel  and the techniques used simply because it s a lot like life   Salinger does an amazing job capturing the turmoil so many of us feel in life  especially when we are in the midst of the angst of coming into adulthood in our late teenage years  What is the meaning of everything  Where do we fit in  What is the purpose of school  The search for authenticity and truth  The struggle to avoid phoniness and be original  It s much deeper than a desire to listen to independent and original music and avoid the top 40   this is about finding an authentic purpose for our very existence Holden struggles to find happiness and  while intelligent  he flunks out of school and drifts from place to place   a result of everything being boring and phony  He finds joy in writing  but even that doesn t push him to succeed for success sake  When asked by his little sister what he wants to do he shares a dream of people falling in the rye   falling off a cliff to their death and he shares from his heart that it is being the person catching them that he wants to be   someone with purpose   someone making a difference   he wants to be the  catcher in the rye   What a beautiful analogy and dream  It resonated with me and I remember back to my late teens when I wanted to do something similar that made an impact on the world and saved people s lives  As an adult now I realize I can do these things in small amounts  but I still struggle with purpose and still wonder what I m doing and if in fact I should continue to strive to be the  catcher in the rye  that Holden wanted to be There are multiple layers to this book and I know I d pull a lot more out of a re reading  which I will do someday  Salinger captures the angst and doesn t offer solutions or a pie in the sky ending   but there is hope and we see Holden take the first step towards what will be a lifetime of discovery and journey  I would recommend this book if you like stories where not a lot happens  Holden is very observational and spends most of the novel bumming around New York trying to get someone to listen to him  This book brings great insights about life and growing up  Many people say that the main character is  whiny  and annoying   I didn t find this to be the case  While he was deeply unsatisfied with life  it wasn t annoying    to me at least  I found this book to be fascinating and relatable  You truly feel like Salinger is an old friend afterwards   I just reread this again  and once again  I am amazed by how it holds up after 60 YEARS  How can teenage angst hold up that long   Because it never changes  for chrissakes  A couple of days ago I finished reading this book  Before reading it  I ve known that the murders who killed JFK and John Lennon love this book  So  I wanted to know why they are attached the book so much  Although I couldn t find any reasons  I really enjoyed reading it This book was my twenty second book in English this year  The main character  Holden  he is an outsider and a troublemaker in his family  but I think he is a sensitive soul and very fragile  I think this book is good at describing his growing process  At the end of the story  I figured out that he finally grew up I think when we are teenagers  more or less we have the similar problems like Holden  He reminded me of my high school days  The days are so sensitive for us because we are not adults yet  but not kids anymore  Without any reasons  we easily get mad at something or depressed  As Holden mentioned  it might relate to hormones  While reading the book  I thought I have a teenaged daughter  and I have to think about her more I want to recommend this book to my daughter because I m very curious to listen to her impression  I m sure hers and mine are different  She might agree with more parts of this book than I agree  After she reads the book  I want to discuss this book with her   Ovo sam procitao bar tri puta  S svakim citanjem mi je bila bolja Kada sam ovo prvi put procitao u prvom srednje zivot mi se zauvijek promijenio  To kazem bez ironije Ne mogu ne biti subjektivan u vezi ove knjige  Najjaca je scena na kraju knjige  u lunaparku  Every time I read it I m struck by something else  This time around I see how horribly alone Holden is  how sad  how grief stricken  with no one to reach out to  And the prep school world he lives in is brutal  This book deserves all the accolades it has received  bbsT  hdh ktb y bth b qlk fl t wd tr  l mwr km knt tf l  stltft kthyr wtrqb Hrkt mn Hwlk wtSrfthm    wtqysh bmqys hwldn lt ry  lzyf ldhy ylf Hywtn   I could see his trusty highball glass in his hand  You re a very  very strange boy   I know it   I said The  I  in this book is Holden Caulfield  17  with his mood goes up and down in a very extreme way He has a quite regular life but somehow he can manage a drama in every aspect of it If people ask me about the story of  The Catcher in The Rye   I wouldn t be able to explain It s just a story about a boy who has so many weird scenarios in his head and the book basically just told you about those fiction in this boy s mind I got interested in reading this book when I heard a song called  Holden Caulfield  by Eternal Morning  good song  by the way  look it up    I didn t know that song title is actually a character s name in J D  Salinger s book  The Catcher in The Rye  until my friends started asking me about the song on twitter  I was wondering why people were familiar with that name  so I googled it  Then I told my friends I should read the book It s very surprising  the way J D  Salinger wrote He was from 1950 s and I didn t expect him at all to write in such a very casual way  I thought everybody from that era would ve written novels in such a very poetic way with all these vocabularies I wouldn t have understood So  to be honest  the biggest part that made me keep going reading the book is actually just the way Salinger wrote it  It was like reading someone else s diary instead of a literature creation  Because you can build a very interesting  weird character like Holden Caulfield in any other way  but Salinger s way is really captivating Gonna check out the other book Salinger wrote  then    D Don t ever say anything bad about Holden Caulfield around me unless you want to get into a really huge awful argument with someone who literally hates arguments more than black licorice  Have you ever had black licorice  It may be pretty clear and known that this book is great  I mean great is little for this book  We all know it is a classic  and it damn right is  Seriously  the way it is written is just like looking into a teenager s mind and see a whole generation  from then and now  portrayed into this intricate character  Holden Caulfield  The entire way he is developed by Salinger is agh so amazing  I can not make this book justice with a simple review  but it will change your perspective in some things  question another and make you feel or re feel the horribleness of adolescence haha   VIDEO VERSION The Catcher in the Rye by J D  SalingerFew things irritate me more than people who constantly insist the world is so different now and things change so much  This typically happens between people with age differences  Notice I m not singling out any particular age group because they are all equally guilty of this narrow minded behavior  Grandparents tell college kids the world is so different now  College kids tell gradeschool children the world has changed so much for them  Children in junior high tell adults they don t understand how much the world has transformed  See  Everyone does this  Preteens  Teenagers  College students  Adults  Senior citizens  All of you think your age makes you special  All of you out there  every generation  is guilty of deluding themselves into believing your age group is somehow unique in all of human history and therefore  no one outside of your age group can possibly comprehend what your world is all about or what you are going through  No matter what generation you identify with  your mind is clouded with self important misinformation and misguided delusions of grandeur based on nothing but your birth certificate Stop it  All of you  just stop it  Stop thinking your generation is so goddamn extraordinary   and again  notice  I m not singling out any particular generation  It doesn t matter which generation you are in because all generations exhibit the identical stupidity and ignorance  From birth to death  we re all the same  yet you constantly insist that the world has vastly evolved  compared to every generation that is not your own First of all  allow me to redefine the word  generation  for you  I need educate you  because you re using it wrong Within the minuscule and irrelevant decades of your lifetime  we often define 20 years as a generation  Right  Give or take  but that s a good approximation  A newborn baby is a  different generation  compared to a 20 year old and a 40 year old is a  different generation  from a 60 year old  Can we all agree on that  20 years is the typical cutoff Now  let me tell you  that s wrong That viewpoint is a very selfish and feeble minded perception of time In truth  generations actually span a much larger range of history  And frankly  you already agree me  so long as it s outside of your lifetime Allow me to give an example  Do you see people born in 1820 and 1840 and 1860 as being very different  Do you perceive those groups of children as  new generations  No  You see them as people born in the 1800 s  Correct  You don t think of them as separate generations  You lump them all together  Why  Because you have an infantile perception of time  When you look at moments of human history that occurred decades or centuries before you were born  the word  generation  takes on a new meaning  Instead of  generations  originating every 20 years  you might acknowledge spans of 50 or 100 years  Right  Obviously a person born in 1830 and 1930 are clearly different generations  But  when we are talking about decades from past centuries  like 1820 and 1840  we don t really differentiate that 20 year span as a new generation Therefore  I reiterate  the perception of every 20 years being a  new generation  is wrong  Inserting yourself in your rightful place in a larger cosmic timeframe  a  generation  is defined as the time between the lifetimes of every living relative we meet while we re alive  The bookend of those family members represents our generation For example  the oldest living relative I ever met was my great grandfather  He was born in the late 1800 s  If I ever have children and greatgrandchildren  which is never going to happen because it would require meeting a woman with a pulse  but bear with me   then my generation would end with their deaths  That s the true definition of a human generation   it s the span of time within which your life has touched other living souls  Those people consist of your generation My definition of  generation  is superior  Because my definition reminds you that humanity is one  and we are far more connected and similar than anyone seems to be aware of  Regardless of our age difference  so long as we are alive upon the earth at the same time  then we are of the same human generation  This is our time  This is our generation Let me repeat that  Because it s important  It s important for you to stop alienating everyone you didn t go to high school with  So long as you and I are alive on this earth at the same time  we are of the same generation What does all of this have to do with a book review for The Catcher in the Rye I made this review in December of 2013 and author J D  Salinger wrote The Catcher in the Rye over 60 years ago  in 1951 Once upon a time  I read a commentary from a schoolteacher who lamented that none of her students related to The Catcher in the Rye  She then drew an ignorant conclusion   that the voice of Holden Caulfield had grown obsolete with the current generation  That s bulls  t  The truth is  she had an entire class full of lousy phonies  The whole point of The Catcher in the Rye has always been that 99  of people aren t going to get it  Most people aren t going to relate to it  That s the whole idea  The book was never meant to appeal to teenagers just because they are teenagers  The book is relatable to anyone  at any age  who isn t a fu  ing lemming  Most people are braindead goddamn sheep  The Catcher in the Rye isn t for them and it never was  The fact that a teacher had a class full of kids who didn t appreciate the book isn t any great shock  But to presume that the problem is a generational one is forgetting that most people  of every generation  are a bunch of pudding brained reality show addicted zombies surgically grafted to their cellphones and televisions  These aren t people capable of critical thinking or exerting free will  They are the children in the rye  They aren t the catchers and they never will be The explanation is truly that simple  All the children will hate it  Only the catchers will understand it Anyone stupid enough to think The Catcher in the Rye is a book about teen angst and you stopped relating to it when you became an adult  missed the point  The truth is  you never understood it  You re nothing but a big phony and Holden would have let you walk right off the cliff  because lousy phonies like you could never be saved  You were always a lost cause Those people who dislike the book often become very defensive and argue that just because they dislike it doesn t mean they don t understand it Um  yes it does The book is about the rage of having to deal with the blissful ignorance of humanity  Don t you see  Everyone should share in that anger  Remember that old saying   If you re not pissed off  you re not paying attention   Thus  to deride people by saying  you didn t understand it  is a compliment  We are giving you the benefit of the doubt  Because if you truly understood the story and you still disliked it  there is something clearly wrong with you  So when we fans of the book tell you that you didn t understand it  shut the f  k up and concede to that  The alternative is that you re a fu  ing demon  Because if you see what s wrong and you just don t fu  ing care  then you are part of the goddamn problem The Catcher in the Rye isn t about whining teen angst  Not at all  Never was  Anyone who perceives the book as such has no reading comprehension skills  Although  considering the broader degradation of intellect in western culture  that s not shocking  The story is about the frustrations of how oblivious people are to the world around them  For gods sake  J D  Salinger tells you the entire meaning of the book in the fu  ing title itself  Ever notice that there has never been a negative review to comment on the title  That s because people who dislike the book aren t intelligent enough to spot the obvious  The entire meaning of the book is about the blind childish stupidity of the world and how Holden just wants to be The Catcher in the Rye  the only one mature enough to see above the problems of the world and protect all you kids from falling into oblivion  Dreaming of being the savior to you all  You can t see how fucked up you are because you can t see the cliff  We stand above you not in arrogance  but because we ve just been here a little longer than you  Why the the fuck do you think he used that as the title  There s nothing to debate or discuss or analyze  The fu  ing meaning is right there  There s nothing cryptic about it  It s as clear as a punch in the fu  ing nose  You fu  ing sissies have probably never been in a fistfight  so you wouldn t understand that metaphor If you ever stop relating to that  if that message ceases to resonate with you as you grow older and you suddenly think The Catcher in the Rye is about some whiny prep school jerk  written in the voice of an obsolete generation  then you have devolved into a phony of the worst kind  You ve become a traitor to your own ideologies  You never understood what it means to be The Catcher in the Rye  And you never will  The price you pay to maintain your ideals is a lifetime of isolation and accepting that fate without regrets  Preserving your ethics is a charge you ve never possessed the fortitude to do Nothing changes You can instantly tell those readers who remain true to themselves and those who compromise and become phony  In that vein  The Catcher in the Rye is another  dating test  book  Never go out with a girl who doesn t like this book  Never go out with a girl who doesn t love this story  She s not worth it  She has nothing to offer For those of you who haven t read it  The Catcher in the Rye centers around Holden Caulfield  a teenage boy who was kicked out of his prep school and spends a few days wandering the streets of New York City  The book has no plot  No antagonists  No action scenes  No love interest  By the end of the book he ends up institutionalized for his nervous breakdown but as a person who had dated and loved those girls who end up in institutions  that s a load of crap  There is nothing wrong with Holden  There s no justification for him to be locked in the looney bin  The world is flawed and deranged  You know the old saying   In an insane world a sane man must appear insane   I said there are no antagonists in the story  but I misspoke   the culture itself is the antagonist and those who see the insanity of our society too clearly are typically the ones we shut away  The story breaks all the conventions of storytelling structures and does so in a way that is absolutely poignant and captivating  The kind of book you read in one sitting and when you look at the clock  you re stunned at how quickly the hours flew past Holden is an idealist  A dreamer who really wants to the world to be better than it happens to be and he meets all these people and has all these conversations and slowly comes to see how his view of life and his idealism is simply not shared or understood by the rest of the world around him  The rest of the world conforms to compromise and too readily eschews any nobility or idealism  Although it was written over 60 years ago  it still resonates with an insightful meaning and it reflects a kind of exasperation that is just as prevalent today as it was in 1951 One statistic I found claimed the book still sells 250 000 copies a year  I have no idea if that s true or not  but it wouldn t surprise me  Author J D  Salinger passed away in 2010 and all of us who were alive in that year  shared the lifetime of J D  Salinger  Even through it was written decades before I was born  this book and his writing was a voice for your generation and mine In closing  allow me to apologize for one thing  Forgive me for doing a review on The Catcher in the Rye and using the terms lousy and phony  There is no greater cliche than an imbecilic book reviewer using Holden Caulfield idioms in order to appear as a hip and cool genuine fan  That shows a pretty weak and pathetic lack of creativity  I got a bang out of that  Compared to J D  Salinger  we re all a bunch of crumby flits  That killed me  In America the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience    In fact  it may be truly said that no American child is ever blind to the deficiencies of its parents  no matter how much it may love them    Oscar Wilde  How would you know you weren t being a phony  The trouble is  you wouldn t   Something about this book was trying to stop me from reading the last fifteen pages  It was probably the fact that I knew how it would end  Those pages were kind of disappointing  too real and yet hard to believe  Then again  it s hard to believe pretty much anything Holden says  he s naive  narcissistic  and doesn t seem to be very perceptive of the fact people treat him like a child because that s what he is  Everything about his actions is childish he fills himself up with this security that comes from nowhere  he talks and talks about how he loves cocktails and drinks  and yet doesn t seem to know what a hangover is  doesn t understand that the phrase  Fuck You  can be written or uttered by just everyone  But he grows on you  and he grows himself  When he does  the book leaves the reader with an incredibly rich character  one that represents a lot of insecurities about growing up and how everyone is anxious about hiding them not to appear childish  Catcher in the RyeThe book I am reviewing is titled The Catcher in the Rye by  J  D  Salinger  I wish I could tell you that I really loved this book  I had extremely high expectations when I started based off the reviews I read and heard from people  but to be honest  I have no idea what inspired the author to write this book  It almost seems as if he was just bored out of his mind and started to write a story  but couldn t decide on anything that would make a climax  It seems that the author s intended audience for this book are teens that have nothing to do on a rainy day but sit and read a book   The narrator for this book is Holden Caufield  He is the main character as well  He says everything from his point of view  which is very important to the book because there is nothing else in the book but him  Without Holden  there would be no Catcher in the Rye  He uses quite a different dialect that s a little harder to understand  but gets easier to understand the more you read   Holden is a boy who is in boarding school but doesn t quite fit in  on his own accord of course  The title of this story is an important part of Holden s character  Holden sings a song where a catcher is standing near a cliff and children run towards him  He pushes them back to safety and let the children play  That s how Holden sees himself  as the catcher  Children are the only innocent people in his mind  as of the author s too   Holden   You know that song   If a body catch a body comin  through the rye      Phoebe   It s  If a body meet a body coming through the rye      It s a poem  By Robert Burns     J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Rye  Chapter 22   So even though Holden misquoted it  it only makes it mean that much more  His mistake led to his happiness The author made it pretty realistic with real life  He based it off of his own present time when he was writing the book  which made everything that much easier to understand and relate to  I would say the author was successful in his goal in writing the book  He seemed to have written it for a purpose  and in finishing it and having it published he has to have some kind of satisfaction  There might have been some hidden meaning behind all of it  or some lesson to be learned  but I have failed miserably in the task of interpretation then  At the end  he had a few words with another character  and some of it seemed symbolic  but the words just seemed empty based off the character s other thoughts  I didn t think the ending was good  It left everything too open and offered little security for the already non existing climax  There are hardly any characters worth mentioning in this book  and I don t know if anyone can relate to them  I don t feel as if I relate to this book at all what so ever  The main character is a boy who is confused and unsure of whom he really is  I  myself  am secure with who I am  The side characters are all very uncommon to modern day society  for this book was written about 70 years ago  I don t think that there is any other book  movie  or TV show that is comparable at all to this book  It s pretty unique   To conclude  I didn t enjoy this book that much  It had its moments  and I was caught at first  but it seemed as if I was just trudging along by the halfway mark and just wanted to finish it already  All in all  I give it 3 out of 5 stars  This book has been steeped in controversy since it was banned in America after it s first publication  So what is The Catcher in the Rye actually about  Superficially the story of a young man s expulsion from yet another school  The Catcher in the Rye is in fact a perceptive study of one individual s understanding of his human condition  Holden Caulfield  a teenager growing up in 1950s New York  has been expelled school for poor achievement once again  In an attempt to deal with this he leaves school a few days prior to the end of term  and goes to New York to  take a vacation  before returning to his parents  inevitable wrath  Told as a monologue  the book describes Holden s thoughts and activities over these few days  during which he describes a developing nervous breakdown  symptomised by his bouts of unexplained depression  impulsive spending and generally odd  erratic behaviour  prior to his eventual nervous collapse  When we are honest we can see within ourselves suppressed elements of the forces operating within Holden Caulfield  and because of that I would recommend this thought provoking novel as a fascinating and enlightening description of our human condition  However  beware    for that very reason it is not comfortable reading   Like many others here  I ve reread this book and I must admit that I like it even more than when I read it as a teenager  It s because I see it now not as life changing literature  but more as a life underlining story  I think the strength of this book  and the reason people both love it or really hate it  is that almost everybody have to at some point say  oh yes I feel I felt like that  I know what he s talking about  It s the state of teenage angst showed in your face  And we all been through it  one way or another  The thing is  we probably hated it  I mean  feeling like that  Growing up is the fact of life  we all have to go through it and it s rarely a smooth ride  Fear  anxiety  doubt  unfulfilled fantasy  lost hopes  running from responsibility  it s all part of life  It s all laid down in front of us in this book  Depending on how old we are  did we get over it  through it  or are still in the middle of it  did we embrace the world of adulthood and everything that comes with it  or are we still running from  or if we are very lucky  did we found a way to reconcile childhood idealism with adult cruel  fake world  we form our opinion on this book  and the way we are shapes the way we read this book  It s easy to understand why teenagers can relate to and even fall in love with main character  and it s equally easy to understand why people rereading it at older age can get angry at him and wanting to  tell him to fucking grow up   But  I don t thing Holden is there to be loved or hated  to be admired or to be condemned  he s there to tell us a story  And it s a story that endures the test of time  even though it s happening in 1940 s  it may as well be happening in modern day New York  the doubts  the fears  the wishes would be the same  Yeah  we can say that Holden is a little shit that complains a lot and fears responsibility  but hey  people are little shits that complain a lot  Life is both scary and beautiful and it goes from one to another in a minute  and don t tell me you don t judge people just like old Holden did  at least he had enough grace to judge himself equally  This is one of those books that states  that shows and don t offer conclusions or answers  Sometimes  it s not necessary to have them  Life rarely offers answers  and this book is life  It s not glamours  or heroic  It s not a fairy tale  It s not a love story  It is what it is  a couple of days in a head of one human being  It s enough   This book was one of the mandatory reads in grade 12 age 17     This book is no longer my favourite  but it is still precious to me as  back then  I was completely taken by Holden Caulfield  As a 17 year old I was already on my way out of angst  but not out enough   as I was able to draw parallels between his way of thinking and mine  His recklessness and lack of direction or skewed reality  was comforting back then  The way he dealt with life  was rather romantic back then   I however cannot imagine myself going through the whole book today  without wondering what was so fascinating about a mentally ill boy  with a very bizarre and unstable reality   who only manages because he comes from a family that has money   The coming of age novel  The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book of all time  Sixteen year  old junior Holden Caulfield is rebellious in that he wants to defy the hypocrisy of the grown world  He is restless  has failed out of four schools and holds a scar of his brother s death  He alienates himself from the world and is extremely judgmental of everybody that it is almost funny  It s really just his blindness of not wanting to understand the world  He wants to be the person in life who protects innocence  hence  the catcher in the rye  Holden s relationship with his sister is so charming and kind  that it is easy to overlook his faults  It shows that despite being an unreliable narrator  who has a compulsion to lie and be judgmental  he has a genuine love for his sister and her well being  He wants to protect her from the ugliness in the world  In a way  his love for her is what sets him in the right direction because  although Phoebe is six years younger she knows growing up is necessary  And through her eyes we see how broken Holden really is  but it s that brokenness that s so endearing because his sincere protective nature and his want of things to remain unchanging are beautiful  We get to see who Holden really is and what he s afraid of  He can t prevent children from falling out of innocence  That transition from childhood to adulthood  A lot of people are uncomfortable with their own weaknesses  and in that we are a lot like Holden Caulfield The Catcher in the Rye was an amazing book  I picked this classic because it seemed interesting and it was  I loved how the whole book was narrated from a teens point of view  It was narrated by a boy named Holden who was sixteen at the time  It basically shows his transformation as a teen into the adult world  He fails out of all his schools and at the begininning of the book he is in his fourth school Penecy  His roomate Stradler is dating a girl named Jane Gallagher  She is later realized to become a very important character in this story  Holden goes to New York and encounters some very adult like situations when he tries to fin love  However  he is still in love with Jane  Anybody should read this book to find out more about Holden and how he ends up  This was an amazing book  Yes  yes  yes  I know  it s a classic  We all know this  However  I think that it s important to note that THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is about something very real  and I think that most people may likely forever misunderstand it because of this and that s a serious shame  Please try not to write it off before you read it or to get your hopes up about this book changing your life  because  by doing so  you ll be denying yourself something that fewer and fewer people will ever be able to have  This is a very particular novel with mixed opinions  Everyone either loves it or hates it  It s a very personal novel meant for a certain type of person  I believe it depends on your personality and own experiences whether or not you ll enjoy it  If you can t relate heavily to feelings of disassociation  isolation  and overall sadness depression you ll find yourself hating this book and despising the main character as you won t be able to understand why Holden behaves and thinks the way he does  I can t say with any certainty if you ll enjoy this novel or not  I can only recommend you give it a try because if you have ever felt any of the feelings Holden Caulfield deals with in this book you will have found a book that will mark a place in your heart forever  As for my own personal feelings I read this book when I was around 14 and struggling with many issues  This book reassured me that someone out there felt the same things I do  Someone out there struggles with me  I m not alone  And that s a pretty special book worth giving a chance to  I m truly grateful to J D  Salinger for writing this book  A preppy flunks out of school  goes to New York  tries to pick up some girls  pisses off a pimp  fetches his sister  watches her ride a merry go round  Not much of a plot  Yet Salinger captures the universe within these shallow confines  Of course I have read and studied this book many times before but as I wanted to introduce my Year 10 class to it I decided to re read it  It is a classic for all the right reasons  Holden s voice keeps you entertained and sometimes saddened as you turn each page  My students are loving it too but some find the language  dated  and the culture a bit alien to them which is interesting as I thought with all those American teen movies out there a high school drop out from an elite school would still very much resonate with those who aspire to be part of that academic world Mmmm interesting  I read this when I was 16 in the car  on a family vacation up and down the eastern coast  I m curious to see what I think of it now     update    I remember loving it when I was Holden s age because it was just so different from most of the other books I read at the time  I also thought it was hilarious and got a kick out of the bad words  etc  but I think I missed a lot of the whole point of the book because I was too sheltered and well  content at that point  all the usual teen angst aside  I think Holden s angst is more Salinger s angst  or that of a much more mature 16 year old  as I suspect they were back then  Rereading it 12 years later  it struck me as so very sad  and really touching  It s a book I was almost embarrassed to be seen carrying around  because I know it s cliche  everyone read when they were younger  and it s got a reputation of being overrated and just too affected  But I really identified with it so much more now  which has me a little worried about my mental state   And I loved the 40s 50s lingo and customs   I think I would much prefer to live in that time period  If Holden thought people were unbearable then       I don t think he would have survived the 21st Century I look forward to rereading Franny   Zooey soon  I read that on a train in Europe when I was 17 I think  and I remember liking it a lot too  All time favorite of just about everyone who has read it that I can think of  How could it not be  This is THE classic of all classics  No estoy muy segura de que pienso de este libro Me recordo a The perks of being a wallflower  por el final y por el modo en que piensa Holden  se que no se parecen en nada  pero ven las cosas de una forma muy similar  aunque Charlie de un modo inocente y Holden de un modo mas consciente  Me gusto mucho  mas que nada por como piensa Holden  aunque la verdad es que si es un personaje muy molesto  porque no le importa nada ni nada le agrada  pero al mismo tiempo estoy de acuerdo con el  no me la paso quejandome todo el tiempo pero no hay muchas cosas sinceras en el mundo y esta bien estar inconforme con eso  I honestly thought it was okay during the beginning and then i fell in love during the end  He really grew up as the book progressed on  It showed him maturing I felt  Towards the end  i thought he was trying to protect the kids  innocence when he saw the writing on the walls of his sister s school  He tried removing it and i realized that just like innocence it ll eventually go away after a while   This book has become one of my favorites  Its not that I can relate to it or anything its just a remarkable book  I know many people though  who indeed can relate to this book It shows a great sign of independance in Holdan  He feels lonely  depressed and unwanted at time but he is still hanging in there  He feels like an outsider and he doesn t really seem to care about anything or anybody but himself  but if you read until the end you will notice how he shows affection to some people like his younger sister  He makes it seem like he doesnt care that he gets kicked out of every school he enters  but you can notice a sadness within him and the way he expresses himself towards situations that affect him  This is truly a must read book  A classic of American literature recommended by many  I have never read it before  Finally  I decided why not  and picked it up from the library  It is a relatively short novel compared to the usual 300 page average but do not be fooled  I was able to finish from cover to cover in three short reading sessions  and  boy  was it well written I have heard from many others that they hate this and that character and the plot  but I must say that  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D Salinger being so radical makes it  good   No wonder the book was repeatedly banned and still taught in school today  There is not much more to say about this novel  otherwise I will reveal too much  Everyone should give it at least one read  whether or not it is enjoyable  It definitely pushed some of my feelings a little  and overall it is enjoyable to the brain  A word of warning for those who are sensitive to depression  read it it with an open mind  and you will be able to enjoy the story from more of an objective point of view  whether or not you agree with the protagonist   I loved re reading this when I was in Hawaii  I had connected with it on a profound level as a teen and as an adult rediscovered its timeless value  humor  I give it to some young clients that find themselves lost and not knowing their own brilliance   This is a story about a young boy who is lost with in love  He faces some obsticals and picks his battles  He is deeply in love with a girl and wants her in his life  This young by doesn t have a ton of people to turn to but he is always pushing himself to keep himself together  This book has a lot of repeated thing in it  unlike other books the characters are relatable to a high school student and it is a pretty easy read  I liked this book because it really made me realize that being able to have people in your life that support you and are there to talk to you whenever  is a huge part of a persons life   Holden Caulfield   tonaringen som hatar allt och alla  Ibland  Hans framtida yrke skulle vara  om han fick bestamma  Catcher in The Rye  Han skulle vilja fanga in alla barn som springer som blinda i havrefalten innan de ramlar ner for stupet  vilket verkar vara synonymt med att bli vuxen  vilket ar synonymt med att bli fordarvad  Alla manniskor han ser ar  phonies   och ingen ar riktigt genuin  Alla har sa manga daliga sidor  och nar nagon ar riktigt duktig pa nagonting  sa tycker Holden att de ar for bra   sa bra att det blir falskt  Through Holden s angst and intriguing voice   The Catcher in the Rye  is at some parts hilarious  and also sad and depressing  It s a book that I will definitely be rereading multiple times and I will not forget Holden s adventures in New York City any time soon The Good  Holden s voice really holds the book together  all thanks to J D  Salinger s amazing writing   So many great quotes that are very intriguing as well as relevant to the story itself   I loved reading about how Holden interacts around all these different characters    I found that some of the best moments in the book were those with Holden by himself  just reading about his thoughts and feelings of what he sees in the world around him  I like Holden Caulfield  I really really like him  I know  we all know that his character  if we will judge him easily  is full of crap and all he does is drink alcohol  wander around and notice unnoticeable things  But I love him because I m an 80  Holden Caulfield girl version  I suck at many things  I m also quite illiterate but I read a lot  I also wanted to runaway most of the time and I am also  yellow   This book taught me that everything around us make sense even for most people they re not  Each time you go somewhere  you will meet someone and another kind of idea will be served to you  Life is full of goddam bastards  lousy people and ofcourse  phonies but there are still people who accepts us no matter what an eye sore we are I just love this book so much  I would give everything just to see an on going movie adaptation of this  Please But if not  it s okay anyway I will never get tired of your stories  Holden Caulfield    The Catcher and the Rye  was about a boy named Holden Caulfield struggling to find his place in this world  He gets kicked out of school again and decides to wander around New York City for a while  He is very depressed and thinks very negatively so the book really helps you understand all about what goes through his mind  A text to self connection I can make is between Holden Caulfield and myself  He thinks very negatively about people and things in general  Sometimes I also get in this mindset  That is how he reminds me sometimes of myself  This is a text to self connection because it is between the book and myself  I gave this book 5 stars because it is about this kid that has a lot to say  This makes it interesting  Also I thought the setting in New York CIty made the book seem like there was a lot going on in it   The Catcher in the Rye  is probably my favorite book  I would recommend this book to people who like classic books  Also if you like psychological books this one could be for you  The way that this book was written is just mind blowing to me  The symbolism and character study alone make this an amazing novel and a rewarding read  I was a bit disappointed with the end and it still left me with alot of questions  which I know is partially the point but I had some questions I believe should be answered  such as what exactly causes Holden to have this terrible handicap when it comes to coping with the transition from innocence to experience  I d understand some of the minor quirks but being 16 years old and asking aloud for the help of a deceased brother in the middle of the new york street is just insanity and I feel that it cannot simply stem from any of the reasons given in the novel  That said I still really truly enjoyed the book and the language in which is was written  You phony  An amazing groundbreaking book  When I first read it  a zillion years ago  a whole world was opened up to me   one that I had no idea existed  Characters that were flawed and had so many dimensions           urbane  jaded  innocent and sweet  Teenage angst and teenage sweetness all wrapped up together in that way particular to that time of life  I was hooked on J D  Salinger from then on  I actually prefer his short stories myself   try  em  There is just something so reassuringly human in the wry humor that is present in all his work   including this great book  There are two things I want to say about this incredibly moving book  I enjoyed not only the book but the narration  but also that I understand why most people don t like Holden  I don t respect Holden  nor do I feel that he s a role model or anything like that  But I do understand him  and what he s going through in the novel  Most of the time I want to punch him in the face and tell him to wake up from his endless  self pitying   I hate the entire world  slumber  but there are some instances in the book where he actually opens up to the reader  and all I want to do is hug him and tell him that it will be okay  Another important thing that readers must remember about this book is that Salinger  most likely  wanted to ignite these contradictory opinions and this ambiguity in his readers  I think that this aspect is what makes the book even more enjoyable  Warning  this is not a review I hated high school  I don t trust anybody who looks back on the years from 14 to 18 with any enjoyment  If you liked being a teenager  there s something wrong with you    Stephen King I was reminded of this quote from the very first ten or so pages of The Catcher in the Rye  Oh God  how true these words are to me Listen  obviously I m not crazy about the thought of getting older  but being a teenager sucks in so many ways  You have no idea what you re doing  you don t have your own place nor any own money  you probably look funny and everything is so fucking complicated and scary  Everything is shitty  Well  maybe you were one of those lucky bastards who got to survive through your teenage years more or less painlessly  but don t try to tell me it doesn t suck   I like little kids  and I like older folks  but it s with and about teenagers when I m getting the most protective However  from reading loads and loads of reviews  I figured out that this is going to end in one of the two possible ways  either I would adore Holden  being able to identify with his problems and his angst  or I would despise him as a whiny  privileged spoiled brat  So I mentally prepared myself more for the second option  as A  I m being 29 pretty soon  which basically means I m old and I don t relate with angsty teenage boys B  Let s be honest  most of us got their fair share of reading about white  privileged males being angry about stuff in our lives and we re sick of it  What I can say to you now  I feel like you can learn a lot about a person  if you know how do they feel about Holden Caulfield and WHY Holden is stupid and egocentric  He thinks and does cruel  stupid things  He practically refuses to be helped  He s not someone I d like to be a terrific friend of mine and call him up on the phone  to quote him  Holden is also fragile  He is kind to children and nuns  He feels sorry for the things and people he thinks he hates  He s completely not self aware and too self aware at the same time  He is absolutely  utterly lost  This being said  I don t really get how the boy got to be the symbol of the teenage angst  I came to believe that his problems are not coming straightly from his age  I believe that the whole Holden Caulfield buisness is the result of trauma  maybe with some influence of shitty parenting on his parents  side  He s not an angsty teenager  he s an angsty young person who had to deal with his brother s and schoolmate s deaths when he was definitely too young to deal with such stuff  So  in general  I don t get people who are in love with Holden  idealizing him and relating to him  I also don t get people who hate his guts   If there s any type of crowd that wants to shelter Holden from evil things  borrow him books and simply worry about his future  let me know  I think it s fascinating that this book is always pegged as a book about growing up  and letting other kids grow up  I think if you think that s the main point  you re missing quite a bit I don t love Holden  He s a bit impossible  and very bipolar  But his frustration with society makes sense  When he s  whiny  about something or other  it s generally something serious  Something big  You don t have to agree with all his social displeasures  but they are certainly interesting Furthermore  this isn t a novel about preserving the way things were in a traditionalist sense  It s really about an unwillingness to join the phoniness of society  and adulthood  That doesn t change  His hatred of adulthood isn t  wahh  I don t want responsibility  Getting older sucks   It s much more  I hate society  and adulthood  and all the bull shit you need to pretend to like as an adult  Everything sucks  and no one wants to admit it   If we are to accept the thesis that childhood is less bound by society than adulthood  questionable  certainly  but not unreasonable   than Holden s contempt for adulthood is being bound to a lousy society Additionally  late in the book  mild spoiler  Holden brings around the two kids to see the mummies at the Met  He s excited  He s happy to tell them about it  He s happy to be responsible for them  Same goes for his relationship with Phoebe  When  rather serious spoiler  she shows up with her bag  and wants to run away with him  he doesn t shy away from the responsibility of the situation  He in fact   selflessly  considering he was having mania  and he is also a teenager  stops  and takes care of her  He should bring her back to school  I know  But he brings her to the zoo  and to the carousel The truth is  funny as this sounds  I think this is quite a misunderstood book  I think it s greatest critics are generally not very engaged with the text  and I think its greatest fans don t see Holden s gaping faults  Holden is not a great person  but he s not horrible either   I have issues with the fact that people believe characters need to be likable  but whatever   It s a beautifully written book  full of thought and heart  and perhaps most impressively  it captures speech in writing in a way I ve never seen done better  The Catcher in the Rye will always and forever have a special place in my heart due to its amount of realism and character exploration  Before I first read this novel during the month of October  I was searching for a story that I could solemnly and legitimately relate to  Luckily  I found everything  and more  that I was looking for while traveling with Holden Caulfield through his troublesome struggles and boundaries  Instantly  I fell in love with Holden Caulfield and his ways of thinking  only because he reminded me a lot of myself  He s independent  he over analyzes almost everything  and above all  he s lost  I could easily pick out many of my own traits in Holden s character  which made me fall in love with the book even more  I also especially enjoyed Holden s curiosity and his ache for finding contentment  a place to fit in  Holden would boldly find himself communicating and getting involved in activities that didn t well suit him  but I personally believe he did it to find a place in the world  And as humans  I believe we re all searching for our belonging and our calling  This book has moved me in ways that I can t even begin to fathom because it is just so extraordinarily put together  In conclusion  I personally believe that the use of language and realism put into this novel reflects onto its true beauty   Here is a very unique story of Holden Caulfield  a young rebellious teenager who retells the events that took place after yet another expulsion from school Do to his lack of ambition and inconsistency  Holden embarks on a arbitrary journey on the cold streets of New york city  Like Many others  i was caught off guard by his use of obscene language and irresponsible actions  But as i progressed i learned quickly that holden and i  as well as alot of young men share similar qualities And it took a while  but eventually he grew on me  and i realized that he s one of those characters in a novel that you either hate or love  I definitely think there is alot of life lessons that can be learned from  The Catcher in the Rye   that will stick with me forever  Unique Plot  Funny and Witty dialogue and a touching conclusion  I read a review recently which criticized this classic work simply on the basis that the language was that of the Forties  and times have changed  If a reader is unable to get over this point  and the book was first published in 1951 with sections from earlier years  then it is unlikely that they will be capable of appreciating the main thread of the entire work  Salinger has written from the perspective of a young man  beset by many troubles  who is unable to come to terms with his own life  with society  with the education system which  he seems to feel  has failed him in many ways  It is  from the main character s point of view  a very one sided  lamenting tale filled with worries  with missed expectations  with mental anguish and hopelessness It is a work which is still very relevant in our times  if the reader is able to understand everything that has been packed into the text We are confronted with a young man who has failed in college and faces the prospect of returning to his home  his family  with little hope for the future  He has failed before  and we gain the impression very quickly that he knows he will fail again  He has no real interest in society  in the world around him  but has an inner vision of what he wishes to do  where he wishes to be  but not how he can achieve it He is a young man lost in memories of better times  of possibilities  of grand ideas  His mind constantly wanders  digressions within the story as he recalls people and places  events which have impressed him  mainly from his childhood and formative years  He is comfortable around younger children and avoids  with few exceptions  conversation with his peers who are  to his way of thinking  boring  shallow or arrogant  We gain the impression that he hates much of society  or the society he has been forced to grow up in  to spend his college years with  and would love to return to an ideal which  perhaps  has never existed We follow the wandering thoughts and memories of a man on the brink  overwhelmed by events he cannot understand  surrounded by people who cannot help him  by people who see the chance of taking advantage of his problems for their own ends  We see a man who other people do not want to understand  who cannot see that he has mental problems and that he is completely out of his depth in society  And it makes no difference whether the language used is from the Forties or from our own times  the story is as fresh today as it was over fifty years ago That The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most banned books in the United States is understandable  it has been objected to  removed from bookshelves by those who cannot read beyond the words on a page  who cannot see the anguish  the pain  the complete lack of hope a young man feels  People who cannot understand that a seemingly normal young man from a good family  attending a good college  can have problems far beyond those they have experienced themselves  It is a work well worth reading just to delve into the mind of someone faced with insurmountable mental problems  with depression  with hyper activity who cannot keep his ideas running along one straight track but has to digress  explore  worry and justify The more astute reader will understand long before the final passages exactly what this character is talking about as he relates his life and memories  but the closing lines are still an eye opener  and a warning to society  In modern times it could almost be suggested that this man is one who is working towards a complete breakdown which  with the right tools  could cost the lives of countless others through an act of violent hopelessness  Why did my highschool teacher won t let us read this goddamn book  And why didn t I attempt to read it during those years  I feel guilty that I just read this book  Now  I know  This is book is full of profanities which makes it unsuitable for young readers  Holden Caulfield is an epitome of loneliness  cantankerousness and a bastard  But despite of this  I like his character just as like Cook in Skins  Let s just say I can relate to him that s why I like him  or part of me is really a Holden  or I like him because I fcking want his red hunting hat  We were once a  Holden Caulfield  in our life  Remember those days when you are so curious about everything    sex  drugs  physical appearance  When you hate people because they are not like you  hate things because it does not come look in accordance to what you are expecting  There  you are indeed Holden Holden  in the story  is just trying to find a niche in the society but his protective wall of bitterness prevents him from doing so  He s suffering from a pain which is also caused by himself  I mean  if he only lets himself interact with the people around and try not to be judgmental about everything  perhaps he can do good with his life  He feels alienated towards himself  But everyone experiences such things like these  As Mr  Antolini put it   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement   The book is just a light read and I finished it in a day and a half  The way Salinger narrates the story is like John Green  or the other way around  because when you are reading it  it is as if Holden is beside you talking eagerly his experiences just like he is your dear friend  I also imagine how Salinger was able to write this classic book with all the fuck  goddamn  phony and sonofabitch and turned out to be on the list of 50 books you should read before you die list  Wow  just wow   The main character of this novel was Holden Caulfield  a teenager  who didn t want to face the reality that things would change as people grow up  Holden tried to accept the adult world that he needed to deal with in the future  but he thought that growing up and being in the adulthood  you just needed to be phony  Throughout the whole story  Holden mentioned how he disliked phonies and the stupidity of the world  This made Holden wanted to be a catcher in the rye  so he could catch every child that is falling over the field s edges into adulthood  Just like he could protect children and keep them from losing their innocence  So to Holden  the only person that he could trust in and talk to was his sister  Phoebe  So he often sneaked into his parent s apartment to visit his sister during the few days in New York City  This is because Holden thought that Phoebe still had the innocence of a child  not begin phony like the adults  At the end of the story  Holden brought Phoebe to a park to play merry go around  As he watched Phoebe rode on the wooden horse and trying to reach a prized brass ring  he felt a combination of fear and joy  He enjoyed how happily Phoebe was on the ride but at the same time  worrying that she might fall as she tried to reach the prized brass ring  And while watching his sister  he realized that he cannot stop Phoebe from reaching the prized brass ring  just as the way he couldn t take control over her life and stop her from growing up  Phoebe would make mistakes and fall as she grows and matures    The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   I finished reading this a few nights ago and I wanted to wait awhile before writing anything about it This is a really amazing novel  and I understand why so many people love it  I also fear that a lot of the love for it is misplaced  and it s pretty clear why this novel and Holden Caulfield have inspired some disturbed individuals The Catcher in the Rye is what I d call an anti coming of age novel  It tells a story in the first person of a few days in the life of a young man who is desperately afraid of growing up  He is a young man that is afraid of being alone  but even more afraid of life  He uses his cynicism to keep everyone at arms length while he runs from encounter to encounter trying to connect with anyone I can see a lot of myself in Holden when I was that age  as I think almost everybody can which is why the novel resonates  That second birthing we experience  the birthing into adulthood  is often frightening and far more painful than that initial birth  Adults seem trapped in a world where they have to act certain ways  do certain things  in this web of responsibility and fake smiles  The innocence of childhood is a place nobody would ever choose to leave Holden s problem though is that he never goes beyond the surface  He also never chooses to look inward at his own  phoniness  and the way he treats other people in his head  The world is black and white to him  and he s the only person that can really see everyone for what they truly are The novel comes to a climax though in a conversation with a former teacher  While Holden runs away from him because of a perceived homosexual advance  what I feel he really ran away from was the truths he was told Holden s fantasy job is to be the person that stands in a field of rye catching all the children playing from falling over the cliff into adulthood  His teacher explains that he is the one that needs to be caught because he is due for a great fall  That he is falling deeper and deeper into cynicism and apathy that he will never be able to pull out of  This is well worth a read  My initial thoughts as I was reading were nothing but loathing for Holden and his bullshit  I realize now that a part of that is my age and experience that allowed me to see him as his teacher did  To see past his obvious bullshit  As I read more  and remembered myself at 16  it made more sense and I felt for what he was going through  most of which I felt stemmed from the loss of his younger brother  I didn t pity him  but I didn t hate him  I just wanted him to snap out of it  to listen to the advice he was given in that beautiful drunken speech from his teacher about simply learning  filling yourself with knowledge and then worrying about how to use it later  To live in the world and not live outside of it  or else you ll drive yourself insane  It s advice I wish someone had given me back then  so that maybe I still wouldn t feel so much outside of the world as I do  There is something of Holden Caulfield in everybody  because too often the rest of the world can feel fake and empty  Holden is not a role model though  and I think that s where people can love this book for the wrong reasons  Holden is a lesson to not just settle for what s on the surface  To not always fight the world because we don t always understand it  A lesson his little sister teaches him so eloquently when she shows up with her suitcase  He doesn t quite get it though  thinking she needs him  She knows that he needs her  He needs something to love without fear I could talk about this book for a long time  but I ll simply just recommend it again even though I m probably the last person in the world to get around to reading it  I read Catcher in the Rye two years ago  and it was a book that barely left an impact on me when I did  Then I analysed the book for my English class  And my goodness  it was deep  Holden is such a powerful symbol of alienation in a society like ours  fast paced and eternally changing  Many of the people who think this book is overrated may not appreciate the simplicity of this book  Why  Well  first of all this book was written in a teenager s point of view  You don t expect a 16  17  or even an 18 year old writing about complex issues of life  Holden tackles these problems as maturely as he can  and he breaks down  The loneliness he feels runs much more deeper than most adolescents  The simple way he conveys it captivates me to read even more  Holden always makes me realise how much the world may have changed  but the wishes of most people stay the same  to be accepted  loved and belong  Sure  this book depressed me quite a lot  Not as much as Holden  tho     Popularly and critically acclaimed  I recommend this book to anyone looking for common ground   I have this book for nearly 3 years now  and i ve been honestly reading this book for about 2 and a half years  This book is one of those popular  banned  books which caught my interest because of its relevance not only to modern and literature  culture  but it was the book that is closely related to my music heroes  This book was Billie Joe Armstrong s favorite book  and this is the book that Mark Chapman was reading before he shot John Lennon  And so this book is so interesting to me and I just need to have a copy But  as what I mentioned earlier  I ve been reading it for 2 years and a half  and its so absurdly unusual for me  It s because  when I first grab the book and read it  I think I only reached nearly a half of it then stopped   I got bored  Then after some weeks maybe or months  I started reading it again from the very beginning  because I really wanted to give this book a shot   then  I stopped for the second time  Then after another year of college  I couldn t have a better time to read it again than now  And I am able to finish it atlast  And man  was I foolish to be bored when I read it first time  This book is far one of the best books I have read  It is about human behavior  angst  saving childhood   avoiding all that adult crap in life  The  depression   the  loneliness   and the  hate  of Holden    I can relate to those feelings  Especially in this time of my life   tek kelimeyle  mukemmel Holden Caulfield is a mentally unstable 16 year old attending a preparatory schooled called Pencey  Due to the fact that Holden is failing three classes he is subject to be expelled  Holden isn t scheduled to go home until Wednesday so he leaves the school and stay in Manhattan on his own for three days  While in the city Holden is brought to the terrible realization of just how horrible the real world can be  He sees the world in a different light and it changes how he views the world Pros  Obviously a highly controversial book  The Catcher in the Rye is very hit or miss  Personally  I believe this is one of the greatest books I ve ever read  Salinger is able to capture the intimidation of the real world while still maintaining a child s point of view  He touched on very taboo topics such as homosexuality  prostitution  transgenderism  the list goes on and on  All of these experiences are portrayed through the eyes of a relatable teenager and while his reactions may not always be justified  they are defendable and provide a foreign point of view on risque topics  Holden s infatuation with a childhood story  granted misremembered  leads him to yearn to protect others like him from having to experience the gruesome real world as he has  This progression of Holden s character beautifully portrays just how powerful and intimidating adulthood can be  Nearly everything in this book can be taken as either insightful or offensive  I choose to take it as insightful and it is one of  if not the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading Cons  As stated before  this book does contain a lot of mature content and is more likely than not going to be disliked by a large demographic  This controversy prevents a large number of people from wanting or being able to read the book  With less people reading the book  less discussion and interpretation is able to occur  Also  young people are very impressionable  and this is a very powerful book  Perhaps it would not be beneficial to have a bunch of kids growing up with this book thinking like Holden Caulfield  While he is a great point of speculation  he is mentally unstable and his personality should not be recreated on a large scale The Catcher in the Rye is a classic piece left open to discrimination  If the reader chooses to read the book with an open mind  it may be one of the greatest book they have ever read I give The Catcher in the Rye a 5 out of 5  Io odio contestualizare un opera  Nel senso che per me esiste solo e soltanto il testo  del resto non mi interessa niente  Un po  come quando  l anno scorso  leggevo i  Promessi Sposi  e pensavo  cazzo se e scritto male  Cioe  non e giustificabile il periodo storico  I latini sono venuti anni prima e scrivevano meglio  Punto  C e da dire altro Ma  Il giovane Holden  necessita una contestualizzazione  Questo libro  all epoca  deve aver fatto un casino mica da ridere  Me le immagino gia  le madri di famiglia che fanno smorfie sapendo che e il libro preferito dei loro figli  O delle loro figlie  Non ne avranno apprezzato i contenuti Holden e vicino  molto vicino a me  Lui si sente solo e depresso quasi per tutto il libro  Io ho queste cadute di umore  ogni tanto  E lo capisco  Salinger non ha usato il suo stile  ma piuttosto quello che avrebbe usato un diciassettene  quale Holden e quando racconta  E questo e molto apprezzabile in un libro  Probabilmente andro in giro a dire  vattelappesca    Cristo santo    e via discorrendo    e compagnia bella  per qualche giorno  ma non mi lamento  Insomma  ho detto 250 pagine in un giorno  non so se mi spiego Non c e altro da dire  se non che mi leggero tutta la dannata  o maledetta  a vostro piacimento  produzione di Salinger  Au revoir  noi ci si stanca a scrivere recensioni dal cellulare  Vi voglio bene   Voglio dire  come fate a sapere quello che farete  finche non lo fate  La risposta e che non lo sapete  Credo di si  ma come faccio a saperlo  Non si puo non amare questo magnifico personaggio creato dall altrettanto magnifico Salinger  Qualcosa di assolutamente incredibile  H V C  Holden Vitamina Caulfield  I think I liked this novel so much because I really related to Holden  like Holden I also try to save the innocence or try to  catch  my little siblings if they  fall   I also isolate myself like Holden had I just really enjoyed this novel  It was definitely one of my favorite books i read in 11th grade English class  I read this book in high school and when ever the teacher told us that we had to read some pages at home I was all too willing  I don t think that I can do a large review for I have read it along time ago but I absolutely loved this book  I love the way Holden describes his feelings about the things he sees and what he experiences  Reading  you may find how judgmental he may be and what it is that bothers him  I feel many people relate to holden so much because I believe that many go through a stage in life where they see things one way until adulthood forces them to see things differently  Sometimes it s not adulthood just growing from one stage to another  Holden isn t the epitome of all youth because not all youth are hospitalized but many may can be compared to him  Especially on how judgmental he may be  Sometimes we judge what we do not understand and holden  at times is definitely like that  Especially to the fact that he wants to have sex with someone whom he doesn t like because he believes that it shouldn t be that way  Many readers end up liking this book because Holden in some way or other portrays who they they are or once were  Even in adulthood we may have out  Holden Moments   I recommend this book to any and everyone   When I was 16  we did this book in advanced literature  I was the only person in the class who enjoyed it  which I was stunned by  It still seems like a either love it or don t get it classic  I read it every couple of years I still see people asking why is it a classic  what happens  what s so good about it  etc  so I thought I d post my review of why I love it Firstly  I love the narrators voice  It s one of the most distinctive voices in any first person novel I ve ever read and I m always searching for more like it  It s also the way I like to write myself  with a strong first person narrative so I m biased in that sense Secondly  when I was that age  16  I felt many of the things that Holden describes  Mostly that society is full of phonies and people who don t give a shit  Though I m not as cynical as that now  at 26   I still find his expression extremely relateable   Nothing happens  And isn t it beautiful  There s not all this action and climax and big events happening and cliff hangers  That is not what this book is about  This book is about language and expressing feelings and social commentary  It s about the narrator s journey  It s about life  Life just goes on  it doesn t need all the craziness and explosions some stories like to tell  and nothing wrong with that    In saying that  I think  nothing happens  is a pretty big understatement  Plenty happens  A young boy discovers many things about himself  relationships and the world  It shows them through a skewed view of an unwell and cynical boy  It s a psychological journey To me  there s not a lot of true  literature  out there anymore  especially in the mainstream  Books like this that have such a distinct style of writing and storytelling is what I  personally  classify as true literature  This book isn t for everyone and that s okay  But these are the things that I appreciate about Catcher in the Rye  my favourite book of all time  I would recommend it to anyone  but don t expect an action packed  edge of your seat kind of journey  Expect a slower but insightful look into the human psyche  OK  maybe this one doesn t grab me as much these days  the way it did when I was in high school  Maybe the tone of Holden s voice  calling out phoneys and princes  the stud muffin roommate and the pimply faced gross guy down the hall doesn t sing as true now  But for those of us who grew up hiding a copy of this paperback in our vinyl notebooks and plowing through it in our spare time back in the sixties  we knew that we were glimpsing and grasping a level of cynicism that we would need in the years ahead  when the government had gone mad and was sending my generation to Vietnam to be slaughtered for unfathomable reasons  Yes  all of us in some part of our souls would like to be the catcher  preventing childhood from disappearing over a cliff  hoping that we can deliver a prized record to those younger than us  but knowing that it will probably be shattered before it gets there  Salinger left his mark on a lot of us   Quando un libro e da cinque stelline a mio avviso  non so mai bene come descriverlo Una recensione non puo risolvere e raccontare un libro da cinque stelline Comunque diro cosa penso dei personaggi  ma non aspettatevi niente che sia anche lontanamente intelligente o interessante Che dire di Holden  E  quell amico di cui tutti abbiamo bisogno  quella persona che pero si paventa di diventare  Spesso chi ha bisogno di un Holden non ancora si e accorto di essere lui stesso un Holden  Holden e quella parte di noi che non vede niente di buono nel futuro  e preferisce deporre le armi piuttosto che combattere  Recentemente in Orlando della Woolf una frase mi ha fatto riflettere  finche c e riflessione c e arte ma non vita  Finche uno si perde nel mondo delle idee rimane ingabbiato in un inquietudine che forse ti tormenta quanto la vita  ma non c e nessuna vita in quel genere di timore E Holden teme la vita  come tutti a un certo punto la temono  come me in questo momento  Finge di non interessarsi di niente  sottolinea ogni maledetto comportamento che lo faccia uscire fuori dai gangheri o che lo faccia emozionare  In pochi giorni saluta tutti quelli che hanno significato qualcosa per lui  ma non trova il coraggio di esternare il suo amore per Jane  dice sempre di non essere in vena per questo  ci vuole preparazione per una cosa simile E in realta Holden sta dicendo addio a tutti quelli che va a salutare  forse pensa che sia proprio la fine per lui Se non fosse che Phoebe sua sorella gli porge la mano  lei cosi piccola  lei cosi intelligente  e lo salva  Lo conduce con dolcezza a salire sulla giostra  a vivere  a smettere d aver paura Deve dimenticarsi di cio che lo turba  deve riappacificarsi con se stesso  dire addio a Allie  addio alle brutte abitudini  abbracciare la vita  come fa lei inconsciamente  lei vive  lei non e letteratura  e azione  vita Non sto a spiegare i motivi per cui questo libro mi e piaciuto cosi tanto  So che se incontrassi Holden lo abbraccerei fino a fargli perdere il respiro e lo condurrei al laghetto di Central Park  ci pianteremmo li fino a vedere dove diavolo sono andate quelle maledette anatre Giocherei con Phoebe e le bacerei le guance per ringraziarla di essere cosi piena di gioia e di speranza  d esser cosi intelligente e dolce  d essere la sorella di Holden e di averlo aiutato Non so perche abbia letto solo ora questo romanzo In realta forse non ci avrei pensato se non lo avessi trovato tra gli ebook gratuiti  sono cose che capitano Salinger e uno di quegli scrittori che dopo averlo letto ti viene voglia di parlarci ancora  di abbracciarlo  li abbraccerei tutti  scrittore e personaggi  e piangerei nel ringraziarli Ecco  Basta  Either you totally relate and accordingly get utterly obsessed or you think it s nonsense  And luckily  I related   This is my favorite book  Period  I first met Holden when I was a senior in high school and nothing rang truer to me than his disgust for all the  phonies  he was forced to encounter everyday and everywhere  I ve hesitated reading it with any of my classes because I didn t think I could have handled hearing someone say   Ugghh  I hate reading this book     But  12 years into teaching  I had to give in  And I am glad that I did  Reading this with my 8th grade class was a different but equally fulfilling experience  The book  The Catcher in Rye  was great and i loved it  What Holden went through i can relate to  Holden feels alone and how he dislikes a lot of things including school  Holden s character is very odd and not like a normal teenager  Holden Tends to distant himself from others such as  Phonies  which he would call people  Most of what Holden has been through i can relate to  Having parents but you feel like you can t talk to them  Also Holden rebels and that s something i tend to do a lot  In the book Holden looks back at his brothers death  Allie  He loved Allie and losing a family member can make you feel some type of way especially how close they both were  Another thing about Holden is that his physical characteristics make him look older than what his age really is  Holden only has person he can talk to that s his younger sister Phoebe  Phoebe s character is what makes her role unique  Phoebe is straight up with her brother  What makes the setting and plot unique is that all of what happens is going on a few days before Christmas  The setting takes it from Pencey prep in Pennsylvania to New York City  The story made me realize that it s not healthy to judge everyone  The story takes place in the 1950 s and as Holden make his way home he encounters a lot of individuals who change him on his journey  The reason for Holden leaving is that he is going to be kicked out of School  again  Winter weather makes things much more real and for this is that around this time a lot people who are alone in the winter can t find joy and that s what why i think the setting of weather makes the story stand out more because of the so called  Winter Blues   I connected to this book so easily as i read it  At times i could feel that i was there in his journey  At times in my life i would feel sad and hate everything like Holden  This book is so unique as one who wants to understand it must be able to put themselves in Holden s position  I like Holden did what he wanted did not care about what others say   Don t ever tell anybody anything  if you do  start missing everybody   Salinger  That quote can relate to anyone because it makes sense  Once you tell someone a secret or that you re leaving it can make you think that you ll miss those you told and it can be redundant in your mind and well you think of others   Like many  I read this book when I was in my teens and read it again as I left those years  And  with permitted time  I will hopefully join the ranks of those who read it yet again much  much later in life  In my current station  at 24  I still very much enjoy  The Catcher in the Rye   There is a lot to be said about the book  Lengthy reviews and analyses are all over the place  Everyone has their own spin  If you ask me  the reason this book still carries a pulse is because it puts to page the truest depiction of what it sought to represent    that angst ridden  rebellious teenage kid we all know somewhere  I think a possible reason people turn on Salinger s book is because when they read it  and simultaneously sneer at the real life teenagers about them  they forget the reality of their surroundings  That these teen goofs aren t disembodied plagues upon society  but that they are real people  Shadows of our former selves  forgotten because calendars can t reflect what is lost in their turned pages So  I don t get the hate  The book doesn t promote negativity  it merely represents it for what it is  or  in some cases  was   As far as writing style goes  it is an easy read  A literal  and rather exact  connection between reader and protagonist  Such genuine writing is difficult to find  And in these days  when the  young adult  bandwagon is overflowing with speculative fiction  it s quite nice to go back and read  The Catcher in the Rye  and reminisce  for better or worse  on how things used to be  ntwrdsht slynjr srshr z Hss bwd  srshr z lHZty kh dwst dshty wsT khwndn p bh py hwldn klfyld gryh kny p bh py wn dywwnh bshy   Simply  a book I loved to read  Full of the delicious reality of human flaw and the raw flow of the mind s thoughts  I drank it in  If you want to read this book  you should first understand that two things will happen after you ve read it  First you will have a great new friend  nothing special but kind of the best one you ever had  and second you will feel a love to anyone who has read it  The odd point of view of the protagonist and the way he thinks will hug you from the very first pages  This is one of my favorite books  actually i fell in love to a girl who also read this book and she was amasing   If you are feeling lonely  unhappy and if you think that everything is going in a way that couldn t be worse  start reading this book and Holden will be your guide to get away from the dark sides of your mind and you will be feeling better  If you do read this book after reading my review please be kind to let me know if you loved it like i did    I wish I could be Holden Caulfield in this life  Nothing stops me from becoming so  but I would definitely be ostracized  lol  and that defeats the whole purpose ain t it  Probably that s the reason why Salinger chose to write a story on that note  It would be wrong to talk about this as a story of teenage alienation  In fact  holden s wry observations should be seen as  realistic  assessments  This world is characterized by  hyper reality  which masks the real reasons why people are here and why they do what they do  This hyperreality is constructed because of social expectations and re inforced by norm setting  Now if one just discarded hyperreality and merely asssessed reality as one sees it  the result would be a honest character like Holden So Kudos to Salinger for having ripped through the whole surreal reality with his biting character  holden  and that too way back half a century ago    I am always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though   To start this off   The Catcher in the Rye  is my favourite book  just as  Majora s Mask  is my favourite video game  Both of them are connected to troubled periods in my life  I do not think The Catcher in the Rye is the best written book  nor do I think it has the most compelling protagonist  It would not be my most recommended book either  But  on an objective basis  I believe this book to be essential reading  When I read this  I connected with Holden Caulfield  which is not to say that I felt that I was similar to him or that our lines of thinking aligned  but that he was as much as a troubled and conflicted sixteen year old soul as I was The Catcher in the Rye begins with Holden on the verge of being kicked out of Pencey Prep after being held on academic probaton due to failing everything but English  He decides not to finish the semester there and instead takes to wandering about New York for two days  In this novel  character drives the plot rather than vice versa  The book s title is based on an image that Holden concocted due to mishearing lyrics from a song  in which he imagines himself poised in a field below a cliff with a giant baseball mitt in hand  He sees his job as to catch the children that fall off the cliff and thus sees himself as a protector or guardian  The problem with Holden here  though  is that he holds a world view too cynical to become any form of real light to any of the characters he meets within the novel Holden dislikes almost everyone he comes across  discsrding them as morons or  phonies   The only people who seems to truly hold dear are his keen and talkative little sister  Phoebe  and his talented brother  D B  Holden describes his meetings with people with dry humour and restrained honesty  For example  while dancing with a girl at a night club  he relates it as dragging around the Statue of Liberty  And he doesn t hesitate to lie or take on new personas with a friend s mother on the subway  or with a young prostitute Holden isn t a terribly complicated narrator  in my opinion  and he is not very likeable  yet he has had a hold on me more than any other  J D  Salinger s style and writing sounds more authentic than anything else I ve read  The voice is careful and clear in the words within  and while it is difficult to like Holden at many times  it is easy to see what is really going on with him  The line that would divide the lovers and haters of this book would be simply if you care  Read it at least five times in my life  I think I liked this book so much  because it reminded me of my own pathetic adolescence  Holden Caulfield is a man s smart ass  that s for sure  His observations on his world around him are hilarious  From the opening sentence  we can already get an idea of his rebellion and apathy towards life     If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  If you ever felt like you were on the outside looking in as a teenager  and most people do   this book is for you  One of the best coming of age stories of all time   Holden is so troubled and just overwhelmed with life s puzzlement  And I love it  This book feels like those nights when you figure you don t want to go to bed  You hang out till three in the morning  You go downtown and sit in the middle of empty street  Or you just sit up all night listening to eternally long playlists  This book captures all the erratic feelings of teenage  Sometimes I hate them  Sometimes they are the best thing that can happen inside my head  Anyway  I surely do not want to forget them no matter what  And here it is  The book to keep them alive for me whenever I feel like re living my own troubled days  Holden Caulfield has to be one of the most absurd fictional character I ve known  During the first chapters  I was beginning to worry that I was reading a completely nonsensical  knows no expression other than f    classic  I wanted to quit reading and put it down  but then I thought there must be a reason why this book s a must read literary  besides  I promised the one who gave it to me as a Christmas gift that I d read it   and so I figured I d finish it  And I m glad I did  Behind his make believe stories and unswerving use of curse words  were much deeper thoughts to ponder  Holden s almost unfathomable spiteful personality stemmed from the traumatic events he experienced in life  His relationship with a sickly brother and a suicidal classmate caused him both to despise phonies and be  emotionally numb   I ve made some research and found out something really interesting  It says that J  D  Salinger used this novel  and some of his other novels  to perhaps share his own experience of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the WWII  which is really cool   Hace mucho tiempo me puse con este libro y lo abandone despues de unas cuantas paginas  El libro que encantaba a los adolescentes a mi no me molo  Holden Caulfield me parecio un pringado y un poco gilipollas y esta falta de empatia con el prota me expulso de la novela  Su cinismo me parecio demasiado  sobre todo cuando el pecaba de lo mismo que los personajes a los que criticaba con acidez  Viniendo de clase alta su rebeldia  teen  me parecia mas una pose que otra cosa  una chiquillada de nino criado entre algodones Hace poco  aprovechando una visita a Nueva York  me parecio buena idea retomarlo como lectura de viaje Y esta vez si que me ha gustado y si que lo he terminado  Y me ha parecido un libro precioso  Entiendo mejor al joven Caulfield    o  mejor dicho  esta vez si ha despertado mi simpatia aunque siga pensando lo mismo de el  Entiendo mejor su vision del mundo y en cierto modo me veo reflejado un poco en el  con todas sus contradiciones y  por que no decirlo  tambien con sus estupideces  Y me ha encantado el final con esa preciosa visita a unos de sus prefesores favoritos para pasar la noche  Holden aun no lo sabe pero ese profesor le ofrecera importantes claves para enderezar esa desazon que siente  Y tambien le confirma que nunca desaparecera  Tambien me han encantado los dialogos con su hermana Phoebe y todos esos trozos en los que rememora a su hermano fallecido  Me han parecido realmente emocionantes y nada forzados  muy naturales  muy bien escritos  Y poco a poco le pillas carino a este chaval pijito con residencia al lado de Central Park  Todas sus dudas  toda ese temprano descubrimiento de que la vida puede ser un lugar muy oscuro  todo ese pesimismo no es todo pose Y por cierto     alguien sabe donde se meten los patos de Central Park en invierno  This book There is nothing I can say about this book that hasn t been said before  Some people love this book  some people loathe the fact that it was ever printed  I will say that I love this book  So lets get started The characters in this book  There s only a few that can be defined as characters  The main character is Holden Caulfield  He is more or less the ideal vision of adolescent angst  He will be the person that you relate to  Regardless if you want to or not  you will find one quality that you share with Holden  If you re like me  you will find quite a few  The reason that this is true is because Holden s character seems to adjust and adapt to the type of reader that you are  You will quickly figure out that Holden s troubles have been experienced by you  Maybe not in the same type  but you have no doubt experienced the same distress  Many people  many people  HATE Holden  They say that his constant complaint regarding just about everything  pisses them off  I can see why they say that  Holden complaining is definitely not in short supply in this book  However  it has a much deeper meaning than the surface  The story  There is not a great story in this book  nothing really happens  It is really Holden telling a story about past experience  He recaps a large portion about the last year of his life  The recap is interesting enough  just don t go into this book expecting a very compelling story  It is still very good The symbolism New section  Exciting stuff guys   Anyway  there are so many things in this book that are symbols for other things  Just go into the book with a deeper analytical sense than you would normally  Keep an eye out for the red hat and the pond  Overall  this book has been taught  has been banned has been loved and hated  But you cannot neglect to say that this book doesn t deserve the props that it gets  It is to me at least  the embodiment of what a coming of age novel should be  Give this book 50 pages  if you hate it after that then put it down  I love this book though 5 5 The Catcher in The Rye by J D Salinger is one of the most recognized novels of all time  The Catcher in the Rye is considered a classic  which means that it has stood the test of time  This novel was published in 1951 and is still read today  even after 64 years  In order to be considered a classic  a book must be over 50 years old  The Catcher in the Rye is a fascinating novel that contains sophisticated language  so that makes it very interesting  Some people consider The Catcher in The Rye to be a perfect novel  while others disregard it and don t understand why they love it so much  It s a very controversial novel because of its ideas and plot because Holden Caulfield is a high school student and he does some very unacceptable actions  Many schools also enforce that The Catcher in the Rye be read in high school even though Holden Caufield is a very bad influence on people  Holden Caufield is a misbehaved  ignorant  and ungrateful high school student who is attending his third high school because he just can t avoid the boot  It takes place in New York City but most of the book is spent at the high school  Holden has a problem with people because he really can t find someone he likes or trusts  Holden shows very questionable behavior for a high school student throughout the novel and broke the law about 5 times  Despite these very questionable acts I thought The Catcher in The Rye was overall a very  very good novel and something I would reread later in my life  It contained lots of detail and had an engaging plot  As a 7th grader I understand this book contains high level language and some bad words  These words made the book seem more realistic and made Holden seem more like a high schooler  I can understand why this book lasted a very long time because I couldn t put it down  I really felt like I connected with Holden and his thoughts about life and school  This novel gave a very accurate explanation of what it s like to go to camp because you have roommates  I don t like books that aim to give an accurate explanation of something and just aim way off but Catcher in The Rye was the complete opposite of that  It gave me  at least  a sneak peek of what it s like to go to boarding school or live in a dorm with other people  Holden explains how he likes some people and hates others  He also explains how his relationships with people affect his life in positive and negative ways  J D  Salinger does an absolutely amazing job at making the book sound like it was written by a teenager in high school  His writing style is very engaging and detailed and he does a great job of explaining feelings and emotion throughout the novel  Overall  I would recommend The Catcher in The Rye to anyone who wants a new novel  I would give it a five out five  A really great read  I absolutely enjoyed reading this Firstly  I would like to comment on the language  The Catcher in the Rye was easy to read  there were a few words that I did not know but that didn t stop me from enjoying it  As for Holden  I find him to be a very interesting character  He s lonely and often has to go out to find company so I feel sad for him  Other times  I just want to slap him a few times because of his cynical attitude  It just drove me crazy  Despite his often negative attitude  I still find Holden wise and humorous    I really like how he respects people who are not  phony  like his little sister Phoebe and the two nuns he met  The title  The Catcher in the Rye  finally made sense to me now that I have read it  It s a genius title    Overall  I really enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye and I recommend it to everyone   Boy  I got a real bang out of reading this   OF PROSTITUTES  HOTELS  PHONIES AND SONUVABITCHES  A K A  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  I first encountered this book through a competition wherein we  the contestants from different schools  were to orally analyze a book picked randomly from a list that was given before the competition itself Looking back  I remember my crammed up preparations for that competition  it was evening and I was reading and studying the plots of the books of the said list  That was the night I first met the madness of The Catcher in the Rye Dear God  it was madness I tell you Because of all the books in the list  it was the only book which I had not understood and fully comprehended  I ve read its 800 word plot about ten times and still  nothing retained  So that night ended with me offering my prayers to all saints and gods in existence to help me randomly pick any book from the list in the competition except for Salinger s work Luckily  I ended up picking Tolkien s The Hobbit instead and surviving the whole thing  But still  even after the book talk competition  my curiosity in the supposed  most defining and yet most controversial coming of age classic novel  persisted So now  after having read the novel  I now understand what went wrong in the fateful night when I tried in vain to understand Salinger s best known work  The fault  as I have now understood  is in itself what makes this book unique among the other so called   contemporary classics   What makes this book stand out is that it does not capitalize and perpetuate its unique story and message through a well constructed plot  something which is very much prevalent in other books  but rather  it makes itself outstanding through the personal reflections and thoughts of its main character  Holden Caulfield  Unlike its contemporary coming of age novel  which is John Knowles  A Separate Peace  The Catcher in the Rye as I ve said  capitalizes not in a strong plot or story  but rather in its conflict that is  the character s dilemma with society which according to his thoughts  is something alienating and strange Ergo  one cannot understand fully the uniqueness of this classic  by only focusing on its plot which is slowly constructed not in accordance with time  but with Holden s strange pattern of thought  jumping from one subject to another  and sudden flashbacks like the death of his brother Allie  which overtime  justifies his seemingly cynical thoughts about society and man in general So you see  The story is not focused in its primary plot itself  but rather in what and how Holden sees and struggles with the world with which he slowly became aware of due to his impending maturity The result  A coming of age novel that is really genuine and reflective of why the youth struggle to cope up with society in  seemingly cynical  ways because of the  strangeness  and  weirdness  of them suddenly growing up and faced with both the wonders and ugliness of the mature  dominant  and adult world Holden is in struggle with the idealism of childhood and the realism of maturity  Over time  the slowly interwoven plot of his brother s early death due to leukemia  imprints upon Holden what a man should really be  someone good  ideal  and innocent like his brother Allie who died young and thereby preserved in eternal childhood  All of these is due to Holden s recollections and thoughts as he leaves his prep school  Pencey  much earlier than the start of Christmas break because of him getting kicked out for the fourth time in his schooling  He takes a train to New York City and in the city  encounters many misadventures with bars  prostitutes  hotels  and adults that to him  are all phonies and pretenders  individuals lacking the sincerity and genuineness  of both their thoughts and their actions  Narrated in first person through a crisp language with slangs and swearing  the reader encounters a prose that is realistically active  engaging  surreal  and entertaining  The slangs and constant swearing might of course first take the reader in a surprise  like what the book did to me  but overtime  one realizes that that is what makes the book a unique and timeless classic  something feisty  fierce  and better yet  a genuine and true book which still  is relevant and  relate able  even after 63 years since its first publication in 1951 Truly a novel which effectively captures the struggles and dilemma of the adolescent generations that found their  baptism of fire  in growing up not in wars and gunfire  but rather in their battle and conflict with the hard realism and the seemingly apparent phoniness of the mature  post war  and peaceful world  Catcher in the Rye  A brilliant and deeply touching book  It made me kinda cry at the end  I was so scared that something tragic was about to happen  Thank God it didn t  I mostly laughed my arse off throughout tho   the way Holden described people s quirks and his mannerisms  After all you learned that he loved his family so much  Especially Phoebe and his deceased brother  At first he seemed like a slacker and a jokester but I came to understand Holden as an innocent  idealistic  caring  intelligent  very complicated  and sadly mentally ill young man  Well  one could use a thousand adjectives to describe him  You really could  I m not kidding   WOOOOW That was in no way near what I expected  It was like a slap in the face  but a sweet one though  This Salinger guy is a literary genius  I had the best time getting into Holden s head and wandering in his thoughts  Definitely one of the best classics that were ever written through the course of time  I d never read this book when I started dating the girl who  in How to Make Love to Adrian Colesberry  is called the Loved One  In an incident that was recounted in the book for several drafts  she asked me to read it on our first date  The date was kind of strange  She d gotten in trouble at school that week  was still in high school while I was a sophomore in college  and asked me to come spend her detention with her  in her school s library  I arrived that Friday at six  Her punishment was to stay there until nine  I d imagined that we might spend the whole time snogging in a corner  but no  She had to stay in the detention area  but broke away for just long enough to give me a copy of her favorite book The Catcher in the Rye and half beg  half command me to read it  OK  I thought and plowed through most of it in the three hours I sat there  It is an amazing book and reading it in that sexually charged state of thinking that I might get lucky that night or maybe the next night with this girl who got in trouble for things  Wow  Really enhanced the whole experience   I reread this in a cafe after the blizzard this past weekend  It s the first time I ve read it since high school  and I hated it back then for reasons I still can t offer a nuanced argument for  This NYU professor who shared the table with me asked how I was liking it  and I said it was fine  I enjoyed it  and that I read it once when I was a teenager  He kind of laughed and said   It gets better the older you are  I think it s a mistake assigning it to high school kids  It s a mistake identifying yourself with Holden  don t you see everything he s doing wrong now   Who cares about school when children are falling off cliffs  One size does NOT fit all  When systems fail  marginalization can redirect one to self discovery of greater authenticity  less any bitterness  Cathartically crass  Salinger benevolently bequeaths Holden s introspection as a beacon of validation to the despondent  I remember putting it down and thinking to myself   Oh my God  Somebody gets it   Lousy people like me will like a lousy book like this  Neither I like phony nor does Holden And it s true  You give me a real pain in the ass  if you want to know the truth   And  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody  SOOOO GOOOOOD     It damn near killed me Such a beautiful corny book Now don t keep on expecting that I ll tell you more It s a very good book  for Chrissake    This is a very important book  at least for my family  I read it when I was 14 and just read it again  I am 49 now  It had a completely different meaning to me back then  For me now  it relates to my son  Jack who is Holden s age in the book  Holden s intolerance of anything or anyone phony and his frustration with humankind and how hateful the world can be  opens up an understanding of my sensitive son  My daughter gave this copy to Jack with her notes in some of the margins  our hope is that he will read it and feel hopeful  The message from Holden is  Hold on   even though you don t like it  things change  feelings change  everything changes    hold on    The Catcher in the Rye was a wonderful book and I enjoyed it thoroughly  Unlike the majority of stories out there it doesn t follow the standard route of a hero overcoming a monster or getting the girl  This novel was more like a written documentary of a real boy wandering through New York alone  I use the term real boy purposely  for as I read I got such a personal view of Holden that he felt like a real person to me  He was well developed and very believable  not to mention hilarious  this kid had me laughing outloud  Overall I really enjoyed the Catcher in the Rye  Although I personally loved it I wouldn t recommend this book for people who like straight to the point storytelling as Holden goes off on tangents all the time  I also wouldn t recommend it to people who like stories that are hopeful in a conventional sense  As for anyone else  especially sarcastic types this book is a definite must read  you know when your teacher says that you won t like holden caulfield when you re a couple years older and look back on it  but i think that s lousy  there are kids that already hate him and i don t get it  all he wants to do is catch kids in the rye  all he wants is to help other people even though he doesn t really have anyone helping him  he s the only person that isn t a phony in this book  i stayed up until 2 am reading this book and it made me cry  holden is so sad and i know why because i feel like everything is phony sometimes and it s just lousy  it kills me  it really does  I just finished rereading this  I picked it up and finished it within one day It s really said  I don t really want to approach this in a literate way  It s still the saddest book I ve ever read  but I m just so glad he finds help  I m so glad there s the POTENTIAL for a light at the end of this book  Great  great book  I love the progression from the feeling of relation to Holden at the start    hell yeah that pisses me off  I hate stuff too    To the realisation that Holden is completely lost    Ohhh shit   The way it s Holden s fears of isolation and uniformity are what leads him down his path of loneliness and desolation is beautiful  Love this book  I m 16 years old   and as far as I m concerned I have nil in common with Mr Caulfield  This book is amazing  The book follows Holden Caulfield as he tries to avoid going home due to him getting kicked out of school  Right off the back  I d like to say this book reminds me of many things that I ve gone through or things that my friends and I go through  The main character is easy to relate too  He s a teenage male who s just been kicked out of school  Holden also possesses smarts in unusual ways  He knows how to navigate the streets  and get from point A to point B in a pinch  His reasoning and the logic he goes by are all reasonable and relatable  I loved just about everything in the book  I found it quite funny how his school had similar qualities to that of my school  Holden s classmates were also interesting  Since the time period is definitely different I found his taste in music interesting  In the time period this takes place jazz was the only music available  I found it interesting that some things were valued more back in Holden s time than in today s time  For example when Stradlater lost his virginity it was a huge deal  because that wasn t the social norm for that time period  However in today s time we don t value it as much as persons back then  The way Holden talks of his parents and describes them was more than perfect  I found it really funny that he was sneaking into his own apartment simply because he didn t want his parents to know he was home  I d recommend this book to any and everyone that s in their mid to late teens  Also anyone with a free spirited rebellious nature could read this book as well  I feel as though if this were to be made into a movie  teen Leonardo DiCaprio would ve been a great actor for the role  Honestly you d have to read the book for yourself to truly be able to appreciate the story   I tried reading The Catcher in the Rye a few years ago when I thought I was mature enough to understand it  I hated it  Holden s unreliable narrative and strong  cynical view of the world was just too hard for me to take in at that time Now  here I am  and it is one of my favorite books in the world  It s definitely raised my standards of good literature sky high  What made me love it so much  The very same thing that made me detest it in the past The Catcher in the Rye is not a shallow  easy read  It is a bold and brutal one  It won t warm your heart   it will break it And that s what makes it so beautiful  Oh my  my  I m so glad I ve read this book once again and while I m still sixteen  Really  this is the best young adult novel I ve ever read  And in spite of its age  it is still very relevant to the present day adolescent problems that we often face  I simply find no other way to describe it but to say that it is amazingly brilliant  It is very vivid to be more specific  And most importantly it is a parade of moral behaviour  in spite of the language used  What I mean is that Holden Caulfield is a normal teenager who s not successful with his studies but still has high morals that he lives by  The way he sees things  the way he get hurt  his ideas are all factors that makes him a good example of a teenager  And I say it again  in spite of his failure with his studies  J  D  Salinger must ve had a very hunting adolescence in order to write such a thing  The abundance of the words   goddamn  and  phony   often provoked me when I first read this book  But the second time  I got to focus more on what he means  and not how he s saying it  Maybe it s because I went through some things that I didn t before  This book is certainly on my favourite books of all time shelf  Anyhow  if you re a teenager  I advise you to read it soon  And if you re a fully grown man  do read it too  P This is tied with Nabokov s  Speak  Memory   aka   Conclusive Evidence   as my all time favorite book  The book of my teenage years  It brings me to the time  when my worldview was so narrow  that I could t understand what really matters in this life  Helped me to grow up in a particular way  Thanks for that     The thing about the book is  many people try to find out what s wrong with Holden instead of actually looking at things from his point of view  On one side  there s the sweet world of childhood innocence  where he wants to stay  and on the other there s the cruel orld of shallow adult hypocrisy  where he s afraid to go I believe that one of the reasons I enjoyed the book so much is because of how much I could relate to Holden at some points  At first he s so judgmental about nearly everybody and everything  He criticizes people who are boring  insecure  and  phony   He sometimes gets so bad that it even becomes funny  such as when he says that people are so crass that someone will probably write  fuck you  on his tombstone  However  what most books I ve read lacked with the psychological evolution of the character s values  And this evolution is exactly what happens to Holden  From the seemingly bratty arse at the beginning of the book  at the end we can clearly see how much he s grown in a span of several days This is a quote from chapter twenty five  when Holden is watching old Phoebe ride the carousel and fears that she will fall off while reaching for a gold ring which gives the winner a free ride  The thing with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them  I believe that he actually acknowledges that no  he cannot become the idyllic  catcher in the rye  and he will never be able to live in his dream world where children never reach the  phoniness  of adulthood  He s reached an epiphany  Children  at some point in their lives  must grow up  Must move on from their childhood innocence  And just like that  he lets go As for old Phoebe  She seems to realize Holden s bitterness both towards the world and towards himself  She sees him for who he is   a truly sad  insecure young man who s in need of love and support  Which is exactly what she gives  I felt as though she was the older sibling  not the other way around    Because it seems to me that she understands that it s not only her that needs Holden  Holden needs her just as much  if not more Overall  the book killed me  It was an amazing read that really got me thinking  so I d recommend it to everyone  My name is Aidan and i am twelve years old  i have just finished reading The Catcher and The Rye and i thoroughly enjoyed it  So much so that i am seriously considering making it my favorite book  Holden Caulfield is one of the best characters i have encountered in literature and i wound up wishing i knew him in real life  I would recommend this book to anybody who appreciates wit and humor and loves to read  To anyone who dislikes it i would suggest that they read it again  Anyone who truly hates the book and has read it twice i will never understand and i don t know if i want to  Perhaps they should try to look deeper into the books great protagonist and all of its metaphorical meanings  If you cannot realize that Holden not only suffers from chronic anxiety and depression but also that he is more sensitive and kind  especially towards children   than anyone you will ever meet then i strongly recommend that you see your local physician or psychiatrist   The parade of books on growing up and giving you a road map for life sometimes exhaust me  For once  they always try to give you a road map through life after spending a couple hundred pages telling you that you couldn t have a road map through life  Sure  I get the point of morals and stuff but I understand irony better so there The Catcher in the Rye was a very basic story  or so it seemed at a beginning  A guy at a boarding school who s not doing so hot decides to run away to find himself  You could spawn a list of titles from that one sentence description  But the plot thickens and I like that  I also liked the themes of the story  Spoilers to come  The few that I coined were 1  Loneliness  Holden spends most of the novel feeling alone in a crowded room  which is super easy to relate to  or at least it is for me right now  Like  for God s sake  this guy is trying to strike up a conversation with a prostitute and she won t have it  During the whole book he ll say things like  She ll kill you  Phoebe will  or  You d have liked him   He s a narrator trying to talk to us  and not just to describe things around him  Holden wants more than anything for the reader to reply to him  say  Yeah  Phoebe sounds like a riot  or  Allie sounds like a blast   If that s not lonely I don t know what is  and it s so sad 2  Phoniness  Holden tends to classify mobs of people as  jerks  or  bastards   His favourite and most relevant word is  phony   Holden sees a ton of people during his time in New York but throughout the novel you feel like even though all these characters are different  they re all one of the same  They re trying to be like everyone  they re trying to be cool and do the right thing  But Holden  who already hates the world for reasons x  y and z hates that  It comes off as phony  There are even more specific examples of that  like the guy who visited Pency on Veteran s Day and checked for his initials on the can door  He wrote his initials down there  and now he s worrying about if he made something that lasted and if they re still there years later  This guy  just like all the other guys  are trying to be the same   Oh yea  I loved my high school years    while trying to stand out   those initials are mine     And all of that is still relevant today Another thing that needs to be talked about is Holden  He s a fantastic character  I like him  Bright on the outside  but so complicated on the inside  He s sarcastic as hell  he s hilarious  The people shooting hat and just the way he talks to people is fantastic  But on the inside he s asking himself all these deep questions  like where he belongs  and all these shallow questions  like where do the ducks from a lagoon go in the Winter  that matter to him no less  I think that J D  Salinger nailed that part about Holden  because there aren t many people who are specifically one thing or specifically another I mentioned how Holden talks to people  Another thing I really enjoyed about this book was the way that he talked  Holden had his very specific vocabulary that always came up and made him feel more real   Phony    It kills me    I m not even kidding    dough   and much more  Also a bunch of other characters are fantastic  Phoebe was a brief appearance but you had to like her  mostly because Holden liked her so much  Brothers Allie and D B  didn t even make an appearance and they were lovable  Some characters Holden didn t like  but you liked anyways  Some characters I m still not sure about when the book ended  like Mr Antolini who still had a nice moment Anyways  I loved this book  It was fantastic  Read it  Hurrah   This is how people who are good at this stuff finish reviews  Great book  As a person  I would hate Holden  but in this book  he s strangely lovable  he s just a lost boy trying desperately to hold onto his innocence only to see it slip away  Even if we don t want to admit it  we all have parts of Holden in ourselves  we all want to be young forever but we have to grow up sometime  we can t stay stuck in the past  I love how Holden seems to have an opinion for everything  he sounds like he s got it all figured out  but in reality  he s just as confused as everyone  His exploits around New York City and his memories make this book so very enjoyable  I would reccomend that everyone read this book at least once  it s a treat  This is one of those books that is meant to generate a reaction from people  positive or negative  If someone hates it  that s what the book set out to do  make you look at a character like Holden and say  good lord  what is wrong with this boy   or the latter  to identify with Holden and though you may not agree with his choices you at least can see either where he s coming from or why he may make some of these choices  The fact that the book has very little plot and virtually no turning point or climax works to its advantage  Now  I m just another ambiguous person on the internet with an opinion  that doesn t mean I m anymore qualified to tell you that this books  encapsulates teenage life  than another person telling you  life is nothing like this Honestly  it really depends on your own attitude and the way you think  I feel like this is the type of book that you either absolutely love or you absolutely hate  There s almost no way to argue it because the very reasons a person like me likes this book are the very same reasons someone else hates it  I say  to anyone who wants to read it  if you want a good straight forward read that ll thrill you with an exciting plot  a heroic protagonist and a tied up ending  do not read this book  But if you want something that may challenge your way of thinking and possibly change your outlook on some things I d keep an open mind to it   I re read this book annually  It all started with my high school  creative writing instructor  Cal Benson  Many know  love  and cast this man as completely responsible for their love affairs with words  words  words  I was handed a beat up copy of CitR by Benson when I was 17  I cracked it open in the sunny  autumn wind and was suckered in by the first line   which is my favorite in all of literature  If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  Since that time  I ve kinda used this book as a watermark of my personal growth  Each year  as the smell of decay and the warm evening glow spreads cinnamon and tiger hues across the trees  Holden begs to be heard  This year  the book was particularly emotional for me  I cried like a madman  I really did  If you want to know the truth    There is one  of many  I suppose  scene in this book that makes me want to call people up and just hear them breathe on the phone  maybe tell them I love them   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive  in fact  Of course we can talk about the death of innocence here but it really just makes me miss everyone I know  I feel all lonely and incredibly connected all at once  reading that  Also  Holden has my heart with this line   People always clap for the wrong reasons    Because that is true  This book has spawned so many imitators and I think a lot of the detractors come to it from that angle  I understand a lot of people don t like the attitude of the main character but just because you disagree with a character does not mean the book is of no worth  In fact  if the book has a character that seems believable enough for you to feel one way or the other about them then the writer has succeeded  I actually preferred Franny   Zooey  but this book is still one I think every one should have at least read  There is so much crap that has been flung in the direction at this work and unfortunately a lot of it has stuck After re reading this I added two stars    really loved it and you can see the roots of so many subsequent books in this text  Holden Caulfield thinks you re phoney  Fantastic       This is probably my favorite book  I read it first at the perfect time for doing so  high school  and I loved every page of it  It was the kind of novel that expands your heuristics about what a book can be  When I was young  Holden Caulfield s actions seemed to make perfect sense to me  It was only when I was older that I could more clearly see his breakdown in progress  which was somewhat jarring to discover  I d say this is a true coming of age story about someone who is desperately trying to hold onto their youth  I think my favorite part is Holden s date with Sally Hayes  and the meltdown of that relationship from  Did you ever get fed up   onward  4 5 5 No cuenten nunca nada a nadie  Si lo hacen  empezaran a echar de menos a todo el mundo    Record de quotes  When I first began reading JD Salinger s most prized but controversial novel  I couldn t put it down if you ll pardon the cliche  I am a vast fan of first person  direct and to the point narrative  I loved the little quirks and mannerisms that Salinger obviously had focussed on when creating the character of Holden  I think that one of the novel s main strengths was the authenticity and reality of how a teenage boy would act and I found myself relating to the genuine boys I know and the similarities between them and Holden  Stradlater provided a moment of adoration in my opinion  strangely although a minor character  I found myself drawn and attracted to his masculine and arrogant demeanour that once again is evident in the teenage boys I know myself Although Holden s pessimistic outlook on life began to drag at the end  I think Salinger has created a believable coming of age story that truly emphasises the alienated emotion that a teenager faces in their everyday life  hwldn swf yGyr fkrk tjh tSrft lns Hwlk    I read this book when I was finishing school and even though it was for class  and the Spanish translation  I was the only one in class  including the teacher  who actually enjoyed reading this novel  Since then  Harold Cauldfield has been always on my mind  as one of those special characters that you cannot forget because they mean soemthing deeply special to you  I wanted to re read it again in the original version and see if my opinion changed  but it hasn t  it s even better now that I could read Harold s  real  expressions  You just have to read this goddam book  otherwise you ll be a phony  if you want to know the truth   I m one of those girls who loves Holden Caulfield  but not romantically  I love Holden the way you love and care for a sibling  At the time that I read The Catcher in the Rye  I was in the middle of a very dark time in my life  and it was incredibly comforting to take a break from my issues to see how Holden was doing  I saw a lot of myself in him  I ll definitely read this again someday   Brilliant    Este libro me hizo recorrer las 5 etapas del duelo en varias ocasiones   El guardian entre el centeno siempre me inspiro cierta curiosidad  es un libro que se ha mantenido presente por mas de 50 anos  que se ha vinculado con una amplia gama de personajes de la vida real  que ha inspirado canciones  obras y ensayos  Con ello me fui generando una expectativa cada vez mayor  y cuando lei los primeros dos capitulos comence a preguntarme el porque se le atribuia tanto al autor  al personaje y a la obra  sentia que la historia no avanzaba que el protagonista no hacia nada mas que quejarse  negacion  y no encontraba mayor conflicto     esto es lo que me depara los proximos 24 capitulos   ira  Me negaba a avanzar  depresion   estaba demasiado apegada a todos los comentarios que habia escuchado y lo que habia leido de la vida de su escritor  me imaginaba que el libro reflejaria parte de su oscura personalidad  estaba buscando un libro inquietante  controversial  tenebroso  no se  negociacion      pero  una vez que pude desligarme de todo y comence a considerarla como cualquier otra historia  aceptacion         me involucre con el protagonista  entendi su manera de pensar  comprendi sus miedos  me rei de sus pensamientos y sin darme cuenta habia pasado ya 23 episodios mas Tal vez para esta epoca la controversia se haya aminorado    pero si nos situamos en tiempo  el libro tiene peso por el simple hecho de atreverse a representar en la mente adolescente temas como las drogas y el sexo  Y lo increible es que aun asi  se lee con ligereza y sencillez El ultimo capitulo me dejo un poco descontenta  esperaba algo mas  aunque siendo honesta no logro idear un desenlace que me dejara contenta    eso me pasa con ciertas historias  me gustan tanto que no existe un final que te complazca En el principio de la novela Holden Caulfield menciona que hay cierto tipos de libros en los que cuando acabas de leerlos  desearias que el autor fuera tu amigo para poder llamarlo por telefono    no estoy segura de querer llamar a JD Salinger  honestamente quien quiere tener de amigo a alguien que bebe su propia orina XD   pero por otro lado me encantaria poder llamar a Holden  aunque algo me dice que si le llamara    probablemente me colgaria  I first read this book as a high school junior  Not quite 30 years ago      What do I remember about this reading  I remember the class discussion  We talked about cliques and bullying and what it feels like to not belong  I m not sure I was aware of the controversies surrounding this novel until sometime later  Some readers find teenage Holden s bad attitude  his language  and his exploits  which include drinking and a visit with a prostitute  troubling and even despicable  I am now the parent of a high school junior  and I find the controversy ridiculous  It still exists however  schools near my town in Illinois now avoid it rather than confront it  Recently  I read a teen novel  Will Grayson  Will Grayson  and something about it reminded me of The Catcher in the Rye  but I couldn t remember what due to that almost thirty years  So  I re read The Catcher in the Rye  I now know what links the Wills Grayons and Holden Caulfield  but I ll save that for the Will Grayson  Will Grayson review  The Catcher in the Rye isn t nearly as positive as that book  rather it has the sad beauty of a tragedy I m not sure if anyone else would think of The Catcher in the Rye as tragedy  I ve not hunted down critical reviews and I didn t check my definition of tragedy before I started writing  But rereading about Holden s miserable  yet privileged  life I found myself deep in rapture over the power of good literature to rake at the very essence of ourselves and our culture Holden is a wealthy New York boarding school student  He has nearly every possible advantage  Everything should be perfect for him if he wouldn t just throw it all away  Holden gives every appearance of being unaccountably miserable  He has failed out of several schools and doesn t seem to like anybody or anything  The only class he does well at is English  More importantly  he asserts repeatedly that almost nothing in his life has value  It is all  phoney   He hates the fakes  And pretty much everything is fake to him  Everyone is living a lie  Yet he goes off and lies himself  Lies to his parents  his teachers  his friends  He lies about his age  his actions  his own intentions  He has built a wall around himself that almost no one can get through to understand him  I have encountered more than one reader who doesn t understand him  Only his younger sister and one teacher seem able to understand him  However  at the heart of this story  Holden is a sad and broken person  He cannot deal in any way with bullying  He has had personal tragedy in his family and he cannot understand why the rest of his family is able to deal with the pain  Holden looks out on the world and sees only that everybody is ignoring the pain all around them  He is unable to accept the goodness in his life  he must dwell on the bad  However  as a hurting  pissed off teenager  Holden expresses this in obnoxious language and behavior  The Catcher in the Rye is a sad story  I m not sure that I really find it to be primarily about a bleak outlook on human indifference  or about the change beginning in the 1950s which led teens to reject the privileges given to them  although the wonderful literary quality of the writing allows me to consider all that while reading it  I think it is about a boy trying to make sense of his world  and crying out for help  like any troubled teen today  The Catcher in the Rye seems to be mostly about the pain of a person who just doesn t want to see any more pain in the world  He also wants his pain acknowledged  He wants everyone else to see what he sees  This novel seems just as applicable today as it ever was in the past  Reading it allows for insight into a troubled teen while at the same time reminding me that most of our everyday actions in life stroll along the surface  rather than floundering through the depths of pain or happiness I m giving it to my daughter as assigned summer reading  If there is one line from Catcher in the Rye that could epitomize the story as a whole  it is the last line of the very last page   don t ever tell anybody anything  if you do  you start missing everybody   I found this to be true upon finishing Catcher in the Rye as I wished it were longer  By the end of the book  I had come to know and nearly appreciate Holden Caulfield as a person  albeit  a very cynical  narcissistic person  Holden Caulfield is the main character and narrator of Catcher in the Rye and tells the story as an inside narrative  He is seventeen years old and is contemplating dropping out of high school when the book starts  Perhaps the most substantial quote of this book comes from the beginning  as Holden is receiving advice from a former teacher  who states  Life is a game  boy  Life is a game that one plays according to the rules   Holden  naturally  dismisses the advice given  however  the beauty lies within the foreshadowing of what is to come of Holden  Holden tends to give the first impression that his head way too big for his brain to wander around  His disdain for so many of his peers goes into intricate detail several times in the story  Needless to say  it wouldn t be hard to grow tired of Holden and what he has to say  I probably should have  but I didn t With every page  I grew more and more compelled to interpret  perhaps on a different level  what Holden  or Salinger  was truly attempting to say  The logic that was used when constructing Catcher in the Rye seems to be an accurate insight into the realm of a seemingly troubled individual  an individual who is especially aware of his own inconsistencies  yet fully acknowledgeable that something is wrong  Perhaps this is why this book has been held high as a form of genius  Salinger s personal outlook on society is evident in the text  as a critical sort of cynicism that is as original as it is rebellious Throughout the story  it is apparent that Holden struggles with his inclusion within the hegemonic structure of society  a sort of hierarchy of acceptance  if you will  On several occasions  Holden appears to be placed differently within this hierarchy  For instance  his disapproval of a particular group of individuals  i e   when Holden refers to  Those athletic bastards  that will  always stick together   and his involuntary inclusion  i e   when speaking about Ackley  portray Holden weaving in and out of the hegemonic circle like a confused drunkard  There is absolutely no doubt that these scenarios and situations are intentional  It is safe to say that Holden is knowledgeable  despite his failing grades in the beginning of the book  Through the structure of the book as an inside narrative  Holden Caulfield is obviously an individual with a full load on his mind  His constantly reminiscing about his late younger brother  Allie  whom he misses dearly  along with his talking of his younger sister  Phoebe  reveals an incredibly nostalgic side that Holden possesses  Holden Caulfield is truly a human being like you and I  and maybe not so different  What makes this book so instantly accessible are the painfully truthful undertones  The accessibility of Catcher in the Rye lies in the informal communication from storyteller to reader  The nature of the quotidian language used in the text represents a casual storyteller  one unconcerned with upholding a reputable self image that is revered by so many  This kind of desire  a desire in vanity is what Holden would consider  phony   a word used quite frequently throughout the text  Overall  to one who finds an interest in adding another gem to the shelf  Catcher in the Rye would make an excellent addition  Its language and structure truly captures the essence of the story  This is one of the few books in my personal library that I would not consider changing a word  J D  Salinger s literary accomplishments reached a peak with The Catcher in the Rye as few books ever achieve the benchmark of eloquence that Salinger achieved with this book   When is it that you start seeing yourself as an adult  As someone  responsible   If you ever  Do you ever  I guess there are people for everything  Those who do and those who don t  But I would think everyone is at some point in their lives completely awake  and not willing to accept the patterns that they see in others  Maybe when you re a kid  or maybe when you re a teenager  But that time  no matter how hard it might be for those around you  is important in everyones life  it s maybe when you define yourself as a person  Who you really are  or want to be  Society is  and will always be there  maybe now it s different that it used to be in the 50 s  but it still has its rules  and you either follow or you don t Maybe Holden will grow up to be a  responsible  person  or maybe he will stay at the edge of things always  asking questions  While he is there  he is alive and awake  and it s great to read him  It s like he is a friend frozen in time  just as he is  I will miss him now that I have finished this book  I ll have to read it again soon  After having finished  everything is illuminated  by safran Foer  I did not expect myself to be reading that much or fast  being full of stories already     Well  I guess a vacation s a vacation  so I started on this book  I knew it was a classic and all  that it was meant to be good    Well at least watanabe in  Norwegian wood  read it thousands of times    I didn t expect myself to eat I raw  I couldn t put it away  The way the story was told by Holden Caulfield just caught me  I really liked him  being a part of his head and all  he s such an awesome character  I loved everything  Just everything  It has been a while since a book caught me in this way  If you haven t read it   read it   I had never read The Catcher in the Rye  but now I have  and it s the best first person narrative I ve had the pleasure of consuming into the pink folds of my brain  Mhm  I wish I had looked up from my path to college at the same age as our young narrator  Holden  But I would ve risked what becomes of him  discovering that I wasn t meant to play with most of the other boys and girls  yet I really  really wanted to  Holden s story is harsh and funny  and very real  It rings true  like a bell of truth  hanging in Truth Tower  being rung by Trudy Truth  I relate to the way Holden s immature feelings try to catch up to his mature realizations about life  The story is set in the 1940s  but the descriptions of his feelings are timeless  He can t find a stop for his train to adulthood  so he abandons the engine compartment  letting the train careen around the corners and threaten to leave the tracks  I wish I d read this earlier in my life  It gets two of Ara s thumbs up  Excellent   A coming of age story that will never grow old as time goes by  Everyone can relate to the main character and his adventures  I read it in high school and ever since  I have been a fan   I first read this book 40 years ago when I was in high school  Loved it  But I had no plans to ever read it again until I came across an article about Salinger recently that said he wrote much of Catcher while serving in WWII  His war experience were so traumatic he ended up with PTSD and spent time at a mental hospital when the war ended  He then disappeared from public life  I think it can be said the war had a devastating affect on him  So I decided to reread Catcher with this in mind  and the novel took on a deeper feel  Holden s story is that of a traumatized human trying to make sense of things and failing  His impulse to run away feels true and understandable  The whole postwar mentality that Salinger was about to enter was all about sucking it up and getting busy fulfilling the American dream  which all too often required a great deal of repression   See  Mad Men   Holden is incredibly earnest in his alienation  He knows something s wrong but has no way to fix it  I m far removed from youthful angst  and I know it s possible to make a beautiful and meaningful life  but I do love earnest characters  As the great guru Nisargadatta Maharaj   I Am That   put it  just be earnest in whatever you do  and you will find your way  Holden is finding his way  And this is a wonderful book  If there is one thing that I find particularly difficult to do in my own writing  it is to generate dialogue that sounds even remotely natural  Frequently what is printed on the page would come off as too stuffy sounding  too premeditated  than the casual language people actually utilize in their daily lives  J D  Salinger is a true master of making the written word ring with the cadence of genuine conversation  and even his use of colloquial jargon and curse words reinforces this fact  The story of The Catcher in the Rye is not what makes the novel so compelling  it is the way it is told  and the way it reads like a casual retelling from the voice of a teenager in the early 1940 s   fk knm tnh ktb  hstsh kh t ln bhsh 5 ddm  fqT mytwnm bgm dstn dr  yn sdg  jdhbi w trjmh   mHmd njf  fwq l ds    I d heard how much other people my age seemed to hate this book before a friend of mine leant me a copy to read  I was expecting to hate it  to despise the character and get tired of the plot before it had even begun  Thankfully  I was wrong   Holden Caulfield is by no means perfect  He spends a lot of his time wondering where the ducks in Central Park have gone  he thinks just about everyone he meets is a phony and he s clinging to his childhood while simultaneously trying to convince people that he s old enough to drink  But that s why I love him  If Holden wasn t Holden  this book wouldn t have worked  But he is  and it did   I highly recommend this book  especially to people who are teenagers like I am and have written it off before they ve even read a page  Give it a chance  You won t regret it   A must read for everyone  It expresses one teenagers journey and struggle with grasping adulthood  It is so sweet and meaningful anyone who does not read this is really missing out   America s Bildungsroman  this book is not only classic but also cult  Sure  everybody is forced to read it in school  also in foreign countries  believe it or not   but the hard core fans go back and read it again and again  I really love how the title comes from the Robert Burns poem  I think of that often  I have read this book twice now  once in high school and once in college and both times I could not put it down  It made me quite depressed for a little while in high school because I began to see everyone as phonies  In college when I was a bit more mature I could enjoy it for what it was  a book about a kid who can t find his place in this crazy subjective world   Cliche  but true  This book changed my life I read this the first time when I was about 10  Ordered it on a whim off the Scholastic book catalogs they d pass out at school  It was the first  grown up  book I d ever read  and when I finished I reread it over and over and carried it around everywhere in my pocket  God knows what my 10 year old self could have latched on to  maybe some strange unconscious foreshadowing of the future  ha   but it was some revelation to realize that I could connect to a book  a story about a wandering boy  so strongly and somehow feel a part of something These days  I keep my beat up copy on the shelf  I know you can t shouldn t be Holden Caulfield forever  but maybe I m just doomed to be angst filled forever because I still love this goddamn book  At first I thought it was a book just about a kid who ran away from his school and is not telling his parents  However when I read it again I knew that it was about a psychologically unstable kid who wants to help vulnerable people and he is very idealistic  However the things he wants to help people who are falling and he said to his sister  Phoebe  that he wants to be catcher in the rye and catch kids that are falling  However as the story goes on people show that he is the vulnerable one and that he is the falling one  and he hears this from Mr  Antolini  his english teacher   This book is one of my absolute favorite book of all time  But I could NOT stand Holden s CONSTANT whining  I mean  I even wrote in to my battered copy of the book   SHUT YOUR DAMN WHINING  HOLDEN  I MEAN  SERIOUSLY  GET A GRIP    I don t know why  but I can t handle people who whine and moan and complain   Oh  dear  I m complaining  myself  LOL  Back to my point  I first read this book in 7th grade because I felt like it and my dad was pestering me to read some classics  so I was like   Why not this book  My philosophy on books with swearing Good books with bad words are OK But bad books with good words are bad All in all  I loved this book   The Catcher in the Rye is one of those polarizing books that s difficult to talk about for obvious reasons  Many were forced to read it in high school and despised it  Others read it later on and loathed Holden  When I was growing up  it was said that you either love  The Catcher in the Rye and hate  The Bell Jar or vice versa  It s near impossible to love both I fell firmly into the Catcher camp  The Catcher in the Rye touched on parts of me that I really didn t want to acknowledge  It delved into insecurities and the desire for meaning that didn t necessarily exist in the world around me  It spoke to me in a fundamental way as a teenager that I think would be difficult to replicate as an adult  I enjoyed reading it  I enjoyed it every time I read it  It s one of those strange capsules of confused emotions that will likely always speak to me on some level  Which probably means I m a terrible person  I can t describe my feelings about this book  I love this book so much  I loved Holden  I guess Holden is just a part of me  I remember my class that time was full of the Brazilian students  but most of them were nice and smart  There was a girl from Taiwan  Chy u I guess  OMG she s super cute and quite  I liked her so much  Her final project was amazing  I was shocked     O    and that session was her graduation  That session was my first session with my Canadian mom teacher Susan  lol this sounds strange I know  I admire this women  and I hope someday i ll see here name her and her book  I got depressed because of this book so much aaah   I guess it s hard to accept the fact that we have to cross main phases in our life  but someday we will do it   Gak semua orang bisa baca buku ini  Menjadi salah satu pembacanya adalah kesenangan tersediri  Bercerita tentang isi pikiran seorang remaja laki laki  Holden Caulfield  pandangannya tentang orang orang disekitarnya  dan betapa jujurnya dia sama dirinya sendiri  Menurut saya dia coco jadi kritikus  Haha  Bagus banget bukunya   The adventures of Holden Caulfield were amazing and lifelike  Holden s personality is realistic and his character comes to life in the pages of the book  The adventures in New York after leaving Pencey are exciting  I simply could not put the book down  I do not fully understand how anyone could not like this book  Holden Caulfield you are so pretentious and unlikeable I want ten of you  Increible  Es verdad que el protagonista a veces ha llegado a caerme bastante mal  pero una terminada la novela  he de decir que me ha maravillado  Un libro unico y muy bien escrito  con una historia que te hace reflexionar  Muy recomendado  hos  akici ve karakterin hissettiklerini hissettigim bir kitap  sevdim bu kitabi  holden i This was a really good book  I m serious  I don t know what everybody s problem is about this novel  This book was so hilarious  I m not sure if it was suppose to be  but it was  Some of the stuff that Holden the protagonist  said I didn t really get but that s one of the reasons it was so funny  The only bad thing about this book was the ending  I m assuming he went to some kind of insane asylum afterwards which kind of sucks  Anyway  awesome book  A Year later   So I ve reread this book  And I realized that I m not crazy  I still love it  And I even understood more and more of the book and noticed more than the last time  Holden is so funny  Gosh  Here s one of my favorite parts Gosh he s hilarious    All i can say is  don t see it the movie  if you don t want to puke all over yourself  The part that got me was that there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddamn picture  The phonier it got  the more she cried  You d have thought she was kindhearted as hell  but I was sitting right next to her  and she wasn t   She was about as kindhearted as a goddamn wolf  You take someone that cries their goddamn eyes out over phony stuff in movies  and nine times out of ten they re mean bastards at heart  I m not kidding  Okay  sorry for all the swearing  I was just quoting what Holden said  And yes  I know I m a nerd for actually getting my book out and typing all that out  Oh gosh  but I just loved this book  One of the best and real books I ve almost ever read  Two Months later   Okayyy  So I ve reread this book yet again  I still stand firm on loving this book  Gosh  I love it  Lemme see if I can find another quote from there that I  rediscovered    If you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all  you got to hate everybody in the world  I swear you would   Deep  Really  And my friends said  that because I love this book so much would you believe no one but me liked this book in my class   that I would be some kind of serial killer like that guy who shot John Lennon  Which I find funny since I am a pacifist  Anyway  great book  I love Holden Caulfield        One of the many inspirations behind why I wanted to become a writer   re read this for the first time in decades  love it  holds the test of time  very good for fathers to read as we all get to be catchers in the rye to our kids as we try to protect them from phonies   With the passing of J D  Salinger recently I wanted to give The Catcher in the Rye another read  It s probably been 25 or 30 years since I last read it  I definitely think the book had an effect on me as a teenager  and now reading it again it s easy to see why  Holden Caulfield may not be every teenager  but he certainly represents many of the issues a young adult male faces as he attempts to figure things out  And while Holden perhaps took things to the extreme  and obviously ended up going over the edge  I certainly related to the issues that drove him to the loony bin   things like not understanding girls  and not fitting in at school  and thinking everyone and everything was phony  to use his term  I really enjoyed reading it again  and this time I had a whole new perspective given that I am in my 40s and have a son who is about to become a teenager  Hopefully I ll be able to share these lessons with my son and keep him out of therapy  Fuck it  I still love Holden after all these years I don t care if he s a whiny  spoiled  fucked up  rich  white kid  When I think of Salinger s pain of having been through all of D Day and Battle of the Bulge in WWII and living with survivor s guilt after watching his fellow soldiers die in front of him that eventually drove him to write this book from the perspective of an outsider   a veteran used to another reality  perhaps   I want to give him a big hug and share a cigarette I don t care it inspired a bunch of privileged teenage kids all over the world to call things  phoney  and act like they re better than everyone just because they re a little introspective  This book made me love reading and inspired me to write my own stories While my feelings might not be as intense and sympathetic as they were when I was 16  I still appreciate this book greatly and would recommend it to any kids who feel out of place and going through hell just trying to survive through adolescence  As my YA lit professor often said   Adolescence is war   I read this for Banned Books Week  a reread from my junior year of high school    I wonder now if I should discount everything I read before college because I get something totally different from this book now  People evolve and change over the years    if they do it right  anyway    and I spent the first quarter of this book wondering how the fizzle I ever saw myself in Holden Caulfield  Sure  I m white  male and American and I probably felt at one time that no one saw the world as I did    the height of silliness  But it s quite another thing to see that absurdity laid bare on the printed page  Which speaks to me now in a slightly different way than it did in 1991 as I slogged through my junior year of high school  Nonetheless  it still speaks to me and I m grateful for that      I went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands  The snow was very good for packing  I didn t throw it at anything  though  I started to throw it  At a car that was parked across the street  But I changed my mind  The car looked so nice and white  Then I started to throw it at a hydrant  but that looked too nice and white  too  Finally I didn t throw it at anything  All I did was close the window and walk around the room with the snowball  packing it harder  A little while later  I still had it with me when I and Brossard and Ackley got on the bus  The bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out  I told him I wasn t going to chuck it at anybody  but he wouldn t believe me  People never believe you   This is something I ve been meaning to read for a very long time and I couldn t be more pleased that I finally got round to it  This book is about nothing and everything  The novel spans just 3 days in the life of cynical teenager who has just been kicked out of his third school  When I first picked up the book I couldn t stand him  and yet  never before have I warmed to a character as much as Holden Caulfield  At first he comes across as bitter and belligerent  with an aura of superiority   things which I later discovered to be awkward manifestations of his insecurity  I think that this kind of pivotal change in a reader s mind set is a sign of really great writing   and for that  Salinger cannot be faulted  By the end of the book  the peculiarities of his speech have stayed with me   and all     and  after putting the book down  I swear I miss him    I really do     I m feeling a 4 5 to 4 8 stars range of a rating for this I was once told that a male character I wrote sounded a lot like Holden  I hadn t read The Catcher in the Rye then  and while Holden s tone did seem a little similar  and consequently  familiar  to me because of that  my male character and Holden were quite different  In any case  and since I m not posting any story involving said male character for anyone reading this to relate to anyway   The Catcher in the Rye didn t exactly sent me into sparkage reading right away  About the first half of the book felt like a chore to read  It wasn t bad  But it wasn t exciting either  I honestly only found little portions of excitement there   And I also honestly felt a little stupid or clueless or darn am I a good reader at all because a lot of people told me that it was a good read  So I was sorta looking hard for what was so exciting about it  if you get me   The second half  though  or  really  more accurately  the last few chapters  was when I got quite involved in the book  I m still soaking it in  I just finished reading it a couple of hours ago  but I think I can safely say for now that the rest of it was redeemed   When I first got my hands on this book  a friend told me that it would teach me a lot of things  But what I got out of it was  a kid who went to a private charter school and roamed around New York for the time he needed to waste  Don t get me wrong  it was still a good book and I did enjoy reading it  I just had real high expectations about this book but it kinda brought it down a little  Overall it was greatly written   Writing about The Catcher in the Rye is a suicide note But let the passion take over the masochism for a while  Because Salinger brings you back to the old school version of you  and Holden peeps out every now and then  never to be forgotten and never to grow out I ve been trying for a while to write this  but something keeps me from summarising a masterpiece into a banal bunch of words  I might call this lack of self confidence  shame or repulsion  but probably it s just what something this big can naturally haunt you with Because Holden s story might as well be everyone s story  A ritual of passage through the rye grass of life  adulthood and conscience I was 19 when I first read this novel  and someone told me that if you re older you re less likely to be impressed by the book  What I actually think is that there are several levels in everything we do  and thus several things to keep with you  The Catcher in the Rye is not children s literature  it s not a bildungsroman  it is  instead  a stream of emotions and sensations we all feel during the course of our lives  And not only did Salinger give shape to what we feel all the time but never had the strength to forge  but he even antropomorphised it  In a shocking  uncompromising way  In a way that only Holden s words can truthfully explain  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though  And Holden is not a kid  Because there s no age that life can defeat or lock up  You can read the book at any age  you can read it at any level  but there is no age without sensations  And that s what makes this masterpiece a timeless  ageless  spotless journey And  I dare say  there s no heart within a person who hasn t cried to that tiny little moment between Holden and Phoebe  those minutes of epiphany of the soul  I felt so damn happy all of a sudden  the way old Phoebe kept going around and around  I was damn near bawling  I felt so damn happy  if you want to know the truth  I don t know why  It was just that she looked so damn nice  the way she kept going around and around  in her blue coat and all  God  I wish you could ve been there   This was a refreshing read for me as it differs so much from my usual genres of books that I read  The construction of Holden is brilliant and I liked his hyperbolic view on the world around him  it allowed the reader to both see his point of view and to question the validity of his accounts of situations  What i found most interesting was the baseball glove covered in writing that used to belong to his brother  it made me question whether Holden s seemingly unconventional actions in the book were somehow a concealed reaction to the loss of his brother  supported i feel by the final chapter which ambiguous as it is could perhaps be him finally getting the help he needs to cope with a loss that no one seemed to realize had left such a big impact upon him  However  this was not necessarily the intention of the writer simply one possible interpretation I entertained  I really enjoyed this book and in future am going to start reading books which are outside of my usual comfy reading  Holden Caulfield is the personification of the  outsider   Like Camus did in the Stranger  Salinger has perfectly described what it is to be on the outside of society  to be separate and to not belong  Unlike Camus  Salinger has also described how utterly horrible it is to be on the outside Some reader interpret this book in a positive light  suggesting that Holden is merely experiencing  Teenage angst   This is a superficial interpretation  What Holden experiences is tue existential angst  not just a passing phase he will likely grow out of  This book should not be an example to teenagers that life will get better with time  At it s core this is an extremeley pessimistic and harrowing novel  It is also completely and utterly brilliant  This book has been in my arsenal for so many years  Untouched  neglected  I felt kind of sorry for it  It s a classic  I told myself  I gotta read it  It s one of those things where if you don t read it  you feel like a crumb bum  A phony  Goddam book  just staring at me and all  Finally I picked it up  I turned it over in my hand  Nothing written on the back  Just a blank white cover with the words   The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  on the front  Simple  short and sweet  Most things aren t short and sweet anymore  Most things are long and convoluted  Trying to be more sophisticated than they really are and what not  But not this one  This one seemed all right  Fine  I ll read it  I almost read the whole goddam thing in a single sitting  I kid you not  My ass was killing me by the end of the night  to tell you the truth  I could barely feel my legs  But it was well worth it  Old Salinger did not disappoint  I think I even miss that goddam book  Truly a masterpiece I really love the language of Holden  I got quite a bang out of that It s a fun book to read while commuting  Surrounded by all those phonies and old Holden is just killing me every other page  Chuckles guaranteed   DThere are also a bunch of hidden gems in there  On life  through boyhood  I wonder if some of Holden s struggles stem from some sort of timeless  archetypal man struggle   At least they don t appear that fictional to me  I love the style of this book  the way it throws you in and even though there s not big plot twists or lots of unique and funny characters you carry on reading because it flows and it s interesting to just hear the thoughts flow from Holden s head and yes sometimes he goes off on tangents but that s how the human mind works and I found it fascinating how he thought about everyone and how he referred to people inside his own head  I also think it s a very strong story  as John Green once said  catcher in the rye is the perfect book about growing up without a friend and I see that  On the whole this reminded me of like the perks of being a wallflower or maybe one of John greens books in the sense that you are invested in this character and their thoughts and even though there isn t actually a lot going on you are still enthralled by the world that is supposedly the same but also mysteriously different that the author has managed to create   The last part  THE FREAKING LAST PART  GODS  I HONESTLY DIDN T CHECKED THIS BOOK OUT  I JUST GRABBED AND STARTED READING IT  I highly recommend this book to yall   If you really want to hear about it the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David copperfield kind of crap but I don t feel like going into it if you want to know the truth  And you should listen to angus and Julia stone when you re reading this book   Not what I was expecting  Pretty enjoyable and very fun  You can t even find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write   Fuck you   right under your nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say   Holden Caulfield   on it  and then what year Iwas born and what year I died  and then right under it ll say   Fuck you   I m positive  in fact  Old Holden  what hell of a character  Damn   Angst at its best  A classic   This book is about a kid named Holden that is 16 years old and he goes to pence but then he got kicked out and flunked but then he went to see his favorite teacher spencer and the he goes and sees him but he is afraid he will ask him why he doesn t apply himself and then he goes to the central and hops onto the train and he meets a friends mom and he talks to her good things about his kid that he goes to pence and he tries to flirt with his mom and invites her for a drink but it is too late and it is closed so the mom hops off the train and he got to new York where he is going to try to call someone but then he changes his mind and doesn t call no one and he goes to a hotel where he doesn t like because his neighbors are perverts and so he leaves to go see his sister but he doesn t want to see his parents and so he leaves to see his teacher that he gives respect to because a kid fell out the window and he carried him and he got sick and stayed there for the night and he left because when he woke up the teacher was touching his head and so he left to see his sister at her school and he saw fuck you written on the wall which drives him crazy but his sister was mad at him so the left walking and Holden was going to the zoo and his sister fallowed him and then they got happy at each other again  In J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye  Holden Caulfield recounts the days following his expulsion from Pencey Prep  a private school  After a fight with his roommate  Stradlater  Holden leaves school two days early to explore New York before returning home  interacting with teachers  prostitutes  nuns  an old girlfriend  and his sister along the way  J D  Salinger s classic The Catcher in the Rye illustrates a teenager s dramatic struggle against death and growing up J D  Salinger use Holden to demonstrate the confusion sparked inside a teenage boy during a time in which secrets and problems were  swept under the carpet   As Holden travels further  he notices he suffers from depression  feeling the need to commit suicide and leave his problems behind  The characteristics which Holden present throughout the book are truly realistic for a boy who has so much pressure placed onto him  The Catcher in the Rye takes place in New York  a large city with large characters  causing Caufield to feel claustrophobic and unimportant I feel like this book touches a very closeted subject  but still blows it open wide to reveal its power  That is why I believe that this book should be read by anyone who has ever gone through any toughness in there life  as well as any teenager who may feel unfit for life society  I am very impressed with this book  I ve made it my goal to read classics and some of them I haven t found the appeal  Until now I wish I had read this book during the peak of my adolescence as 16 year old me would have gained so much more than I did reading this as someone on my way out of adolescence  Salinger understands in every sense of the word what it s like to be a teenager  What it feels like with the angst and alienation and doing things and not understanding why  Holden Caulfield epitomises all the traits of a typical troubled teen  much like I was  Death obsessed and fearing  impulsive  hot headed and most importantly cut off from others by his own doing  Yes  others authors have attempted to create the teenage tension but it mostly comes across as self satisfying  pathetic and very annoying yet Salinger makes Holden charming through the fact he hates most things but when he cares about something  it s charming and lovely to see  Such as his relationship with his siblings I don t think Holden particularly changes between the beginning and end in sense of anagnorisis but I think that s the point  He caught in the adolescent battle between childhood adulthood  when is appropriate to stay young and fun  When is i crucial to grow up  He has a peter pan complex  Nobody wants to grow up but this novel is about how Holden is struggling to find a balance and so rather teeters on the edge of childish and immature to compensate  Its the main reason he keeps calling adults phoneys  nobody wants to grow up and the fact they did  makes them a phoney to him  There isn t much in terms of plot it s more of his stream of consciousness but I cannot describe how much I enjoyed this book and the profound effect it has had on me  I ll definitely be recommending this to my 15 year old sister  Very rewarding read  a type of read I ve missed  Catcher In The Rye  the cult classic of teenage angst that I should have read as a teenager somehow had eluded me and I read it now  Obviously its appeal is universal though it would have been more so had I read it at the right age  Holden Caulfield s struggle with the hierarchic boarding school system in the US of those days is brought out in its vivid detail All the observations are from the point of view of this fifteen year old extremely sensitive intelligent and sensible boy and hence sound absolutely realistic The only problem I faced was when he loiters about in NYC and just drifts about from one meaningless encounter to another  The book seemed to drag on for me  but as I said its because I found it hard to identify with the situation  The most brilliant part is Holden s interaction with his kid sister Phoebe towards the end of the story  Its the most delightful account I have ever read of a brother sister bonding though she is just a child  Through this interaction we are privy to Holden s thoughts and ideas and how those find resonance in a child who is so young but still seems to understand his point of view more than any of the adults or peers Holden encounters  What a delightful little character this Phoebe is  As my rating says I really loved this book and the story would stay with me for ever    My clothes   she said    I m going with you  As the tale of Holden Caulfield unwraps itself on the starchy pages of Catcher in the Rye  one cannot help but to feel a pang of sadness within their heart  and to soak in the details of the terrible environment in which Holden finds himself  However  Holden s station alone is not the cause of this melancholy  More than bleak contexts  there are bleak actions  and bleak consequences  This melancholy is empathy  that is  empathy with the regrettable victims of Holden s reckless disregard  including his loving sister Phoebe  These aspects were also reflected within my personal experience and as I dove deeper into the story  and I became addicted to discovering the connection between my personal story and that of a rich kid attending a private boarding school   Holden Caulfield  This infatuation with the idea that there was a correspondence between ideals which had shaped my life  and those that had shaped Holden s  led to an astonishing discovery   the ideals that Holden s parents held were almost the same as those expected of Asian Americans  Fortunately  these ideals were not ones that were forced upon me by my parents  Unfortunately  however  they were prominent still in forming impressions that other individuals had on me  The routine looks of shock on the faces of adults affiliated with my parents when they learned that I did not attend a private boarding school but still expected to attend a prestigious university  is a display of the strict ideals faced by many in my position  I felt a sense of connection with those not only in my position now  but those that had been in it before  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book due to the strong connection that I was able to establish with it  many aspects of the book as well as how it was written  were particularly perturbing  The obscene language prominent throughout the book combined with scenes of minors committing acts injurious to health such as smoking and drinking are among the features of the book that I found to be egregious  The frequent discrimination against individuals by a child who is fortune enough to have  white privilege  is also protrusive within the book   demonstrated when homosexuals are referred to as  flints   These parts of the book have caused unwanted attention   leading to The Catcher in the Ryle being challenged  as well as banned Disturbing content  however  helps to create the big picture   that is  a story in which important principles are prominent  The frequent descriptions of Holden smoking and drinking when he is feeling down  or simply just bored  craft an image of a troubled child who is in desperate need of a savior  Although Holden may be privileged compared to the  flits  he frequently discriminates against  on the inside he is just someone who deeply needs help  someone who needs a  Catcher in the Rye   The constant depictions of disturbing content create the image of a boy who may be financially sound  but is mentally unsound Fortunately for Holden  his sister Phoebe is the savior he has been waiting for   as readers watch the transformation of Holden s attitude upon spending time with his sister  However  it is not only Holden s attitude that changes  as Phoebe s does as well   for the worse  An intelligent and motivated schoolgirl transforms into a girl who has a desire to run away with her older brother   demonstrating the severity of Holden s influence on his sister  As this relationship is examined more closely  the extent to which Phoebe suffers because of her brother s mental state becomes evident  which is enough to start the flow of a steady steam of tears down the reader s cheek  Not only deeply saddening  the kinship between Holden and his sister helps to understand the value in family in life  and helps to illustrate that we  as individuals living within a community  need to help others to overcome the obstacles that they face  Salinger is suggesting that we all need to be a  Catcher in the Rye  for those who need one  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to become immersed in a thought provoking adventure  and also learn more about themselves in the process  Although there is some obscene language used throughout  at certain points it is necessary in order to create Holden s character  and thus should not be a deterrent from reading this book  Anyone who reads this book will find themselves astounded by the principles revealed throughout the story of a troubled  rich  boarding school child  and will be glad they decided to invest their time into reading about Holden Caulfield  Amazing    why did i take it so long to finish this book   but as soon as i finished it i wanted to go back and start it again   lbdy   Zm l y sn   l  kwkb rD fy khll l 4 wnS mlyr sn  lly ftw   hy dy lrwy  lly

Caulfield  an average 16 year old on the surface  but  much like many other teens  struggling with depression  loneliness  and angst  After Holden is kicked out of his private school  he decides to head to New York on his own  unable to let his parents know about his failure  During his time in New York  Holden goes on many adventures  both good and bad  and therefore discovers many important life lessons  but also slips further into a state of hopelessness  Salinger s hauntingly beautiful tale shows a unique understanding of life as a teen  Holden  at first glance  seems like a typical  spoiled teenage slacker  who doesn t care about anything or anyone  except for himself  However  upon closer inspection of Salinger s careful and subtle language  we learn how much more he really is  The most interesting thing about this characterization is that it isn t simply laid out in the exposition  but instead it is left up to the reader to find  We also see a unique development of character  as Holden gradually opens up more to the audience as the story progresses  which is an interesting contrast to his initial reluctance  Salinger s use of symbolism and recurring themes are also exquisite  as they are so seamlessly integrated into the narration and made to fit with Holden s stream of consciousness or conversations in a way that flows I highly recommend this book to boys and girls of ages 15 and up  Although it does contain some strong language and situations  it is a literary classic and a must read  It should also only be read at this age  because  The Catcher in the Rye  requires a high level of literary analysis  which is most likely only achieved then  In conclusion  men and women over the age of 15  with a passion for novels  should consider reading  The Catcher in the Rye   Holden Caulfield and his adventure in New York was one  goddamn  joyride  Probably the best fictional character I ve read till date hdhh hy qS  hwldn kwlfyld whw mrhq Djr   y lth

   Willis Kallay5 8 08English 1Book Review Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books ever written in American literature  I believe that the author J D  Salinger created a great read  Salinger accomplished a book that is set through the eyes of teenager going through some struggles  I believe that the book holds problems that are even faced by teenagers today  For Salinger to grasp this concept as an adult and put it into writing was amazing and after reading the book you tell  Holden Caulfield is the main character if the story  He is a sixteen year old boy who has common struggles in school  At the beginning of the book Holden is on his way to leaving his third school because of his grades  After leaving school Holden ends up roaming in New York City  This is where the rest of the story takes place  New York is a large city and a lot of problems arise and confront Holden here  Holden s little sister in the second main character of the story  While reading the book you begin to realize her importance   The main character  Holden  suffers from depression which really a big deal  New York City is not an easy place to live in for even an adult  so Holden free roaming it is a tough situation  Hard situations are what cause some depression for Holden  Another aspect that plays a role is loneliness  This causes big issues for Holden and makes him think about decisions he needs to make  Being an adolescent and the problems coming in that stage of life affect Holden the most throughout the story  The genre of the book I believe that best fits it is a type of drama mystery  The story is a drama in the fact that Holden faces some difficult real life situations  A mystery type because while reading the book you find Holden speaking about situations and him trying to figure out answers to his problems  Drama best fits the story in my opinion  This story really shows some real life struggles and how a teen comes to face them and learn from his mistakes   The writing style of the story is brilliant  While reading the book I felt like I was in a room with Holden and him telling me the story right in front of me  This style is very unique and a great fit for the story as a whole  I thought that the writing style captured you as reader and held you in the entire book  Salinger perfect the way he wanted this story to be read  The narrator makes a connection to every reader it seems  Like I aid earlier I felt like Holden was in the same room as me telling me his story  The style made the book what it is   The language set into this book makes it even more amazing to read  This book has lines in it that are memorable  Holden s hypocritical nature brings out some vivid words in the story  Goddam is used through out the book by Holden  This is Holden s way expressing his feelings about something  This word has no reference to God or has any meaning that goes against him  Harsh words are also found in the story and these are looked down upon  Reading the story fully to the very last page will give you an even better example of how the language fits Holden   While reading this story I felt a sort of connection with Holden  The problems that he faces are not weird or unique  they are problems that could come up in any teenager s life  I loved this story because of this  Connection and the reality of the situation leaves you wanting for more answers and for more of the story  Reading this book is one of the best decisions  I think that teenagers can learn from this story of struggle and overcoming factors in adolescents  I recommend this book to almost anybody who wants to read something  This book can make almost any type of person rethink how they view certain things  I strongly recommend the Catcher in the Rye to any audience wiling to pick it up and read   Somehow I never had to read this book for school  and since it s a classic I put it on my to read list a while back  When I saw it on the shelf at the library I grabbed it on a whim  and I m glad  it was much funnier than I expected I was expecting CITR to be more like To Kill a Mockingbird perhaps another English class was reading this one while we read it  I m not sure why else they would be paired in my memory  They re somewhat similar in having youthful narrators who are disillusioned by most adults people  and the tone  sort of  the way they handle serious topics with humor  CITR is lighter overall than I remember TKAM being  it s been a long time so I shouldn t try to do a compare contrast  but they re so linked in my head that it s hard to resist  I wonder if I would have enjoyed CITR as much when I was a teenager  since some of my enjoyment definitely stemmed at being able to view the teenage narrator with the perspective of an adult  If that s the case  why do we make kids read it in high school and ruin it for them  Sometimes the way the narrator takes himself seriously is hilarious  and other times his insights ring true with a clarity that s hard to retain into adulthood  I m still not sure I totally understand the book and I want to talk about it with someone  reading it for a class would have helped with that  true   and I know I ll keep mulling it over for a long time  Which is why it s a classic  surely  even if it s not the kind of classic I expected  This is my favorite book  My number 1 favorite book I think  Catcher in the Rye  is a novel people either really love or really hate  Some think Holden Caulfield is stupid and has no real cause to act the way he does  but that s exactly why so many teenagers can identify with him  Holden has legitimate problems and he doesn t know how to deal with them because no other characters will recognize them  So he acts out  This is a familiar experience for many teenagers  who are told they are either too young or too old to be acting the way they are  Also  Holden s worldview can appeal to certain adults as well  those who find themselves surrounded by  phonies  and just can t take it anymore So  if you haven t read this  do  You may be one of the people who decides Holden to be nothing more than a whiny brat  But you may not  And that is when the real magic begins to happen  The first time I ever read it was in March of 2003  while on spring break  dorky  but I have done so many times since  Easily my favorite book of all time  The first time I read it  it made me realize how cynical I already was  and sort of intensified that  I related with Holden Caulfield and had thoughts a lot like his  After a couple reads  I was able to separate myself from that and realize how ridiculous I was to view life that way  I definitely think this is Salinger s best work  with so many classic lines  One of two books that I could honestly say has changed my life  and I had been forced to read a lot of  Christian  books in college    Ho letto questo libro tutto d un fiato  e credo pochi siano riusciti a fare altrimenti  Pagina dopo pagina mi riconoscevo sempre di piu in Holden  nella sua visione del mondo  nel suo rifiuto per un mondo di adulti che non si fidano e vivono incapaci di fare cio che vogliono veramente  e soprattutto nei suoi pensieri I pensieri di Holden  e  solitamente  i miei  non sono mai quelli che verrebbero in mente per primi a  per esempio  un avvocato o un medico  ma sono pensieri di seconda  terza fila    Quando lo accarezza l idea di uccidersi  di tutte le ragioni che si possono trovare per non suicidarsi  lui ne sceglie una in particolare  si sarebbe immediatamente buttato dalla finestra  se non fosse che poi chiunque avrebbero visto il suo corpo inerte e probabilmente fatto commenti Holden e un manifesto  quello di chi non vuole essere come gli altri non per scelta me per natura  chi non ce la fa proprio  non vuole crescere per non far parte di un unita omologata e che ormai non riesce piu a sentire veramente nulla  ma soprattutto a non fare cio che vuole Appena finito il libro  ho iniziato a piangere  Avrei voluto chiamare Salinger  chiedergli cosa succede dopo  che fine fa Holden  ma forse e questa la sensazione che dobbiamo provare  In fondo  Holden siamo tutti noi  e a tutti noi e capitato di trovarci smarriti in un periodo della nostra vita  quindi la risposta alla domanda  cosa viene dopo   e proprio la nostra vita  Forse non la troveremo mai  come forse non sapremo mai dove vanno le anatre del lago di Central Park durante l inverno  I am in a state of dilemma now  I don t know whether I am a fan of Holden Caulfield or the great J D Salinger  I am gonna give this review in Holden s style   Who cares  All these are corny reviews  We aren t going to remember it after we finish writing this review  Tell me sincerely wat wuddaya do  Will you remember it  No right  Thats what am saying  All of you are the phoniest reviewers I have ever seen  I hate it when ya do like that  I hate everything around me  May be if Allie is present  I would have cared to hear his review because he ain t a phony like y all Man  what a novel  what a journey to cross through while reading it  I sincerely wish J D Salinger is alive now so that I would have tried to meet him personally and thanked him sincerely from my heart for giving such a great masterpiece J D what you have given all of us is a gift that is so pleasureful that we couldn t have asked you more for  This has come up in 1951 and ts 2012 when I have read it and I can pretty surely say that I have never ever read any such wonderful masterpiece like this  And definitely I am not being corny now     Its a classic  Read it for sure  lrwy  dy mn  hm lrwyt lly  thrt fy nfsy wkhltny  yzh ktb rwyt wHsyt n bTlh by br  ny l nh bysh r blwHd  wbykrh lkdhb wlzyf fy lmjtm  w jml Hj  nh  br  n kl dhlk b slwb skhr msh htHs byh l

Rye is one of the rare exceptions  I loved this book  though  to tell you the truth  it s rather difficult to explain why  Not a huge amount happens  the protagonist is almost constantly complaining and it s often difficult to like him  However  with all that being said  the book is damn near impossible to put down  The writing style is unusual  engaging and thoroughly personable and Holden  whilst being incredibly downbeat and cynical  is strangely likeable  Perhaps that s not quite the right word  but I did find myself feeling incredibly sorry for him and willing him to turn his life around  I realise that for every positive review of this book  you ll find a negative one  but a t less than 200 pages  The Catcher in the Rye really is worth tearing through in a day and making up your own mind about  For me  it s a mesmerizing classic that demands to be read   I read this book in my teens when I was into boys and not men  I couldn t enjoy the book because I focused too much on Holden as someone who I d never date  I dismissed him as an attention seeking boy from a privileged family who can afford to go about the world with so little ambition because he has a family who d just move him into another elite school each time he gets kicked out of one  So I just couldn t understand the fuss he made about many things in the book  In my view  he had everything he needed    why was he so depressed  I also hated the fact that the book comprised entirely of Holdern s  stream of consciousness  which  back then  I felt  didn t allow me to properly experience the places he went to  particularly New York City  a place I had been very curious about as a teen  And now many many years later  I re read the book and it was almost as if someone had re written the book  I am able to appreciate the poignancy and brilliance of Holden s observation of the his world  Trapped between adolescence and adulthood  his fears and anxieties are relevant than ever to the human soul that finds itself forced to make a transition  whether it is to transition into adulthood or transition into modernity  I could easily identify his strong dislike against phony people as well as his inability to completely distance himself from it  however strong he wants to  How many times have we heard stories of people feeling trapped and abused by their professional routines and social statuses and dream of breaking free but never really take that step  This novel is not about dreaming nor about taking the plunge  It s about succumbing to defeat and the mental digression that goes with it There were many passages that I loved in this book  One in particular is the part where Holden complains to his former English teacher  Mr  Antolini  about a subject in school  where students are taught how to give oral presentations or speeches  Whenever anyone goes off track in his speech  fellow students are supposed to yell out   digression   to help the student get back on track  Holden despised the exercise because he felt people should be allowed to stray from their ways and  digression  should be appreciated  I think he hated what s fixed for him in life  what lies ahead of him in terms of the path laid out by his family  his prospective adulthood  Another part that I really liked was where Holden kept asking driver of every tax cab he took about where the ducks in the Central park lagoon go in winter  No one really tried to answer his question as they thought of it as a dumb one  I believe  their dismissive reactions were supposed to illustrate a clear case of adult ignorance  It seems that  in Holden s view  adults have little curiosity and imagination as everything in the adultsphere were either important and worth caring about  or unimportant and is best to be ignored  I also finally understood the meaning of the title  There was so little reference to it  initially I thought  but once I ve re read a few more passaged I understood the allegory used for adulthood is  to fall  and to Holden the only salvation to it would be to be  caught   His hunting hat symbolized his resistance to making that  fall  and at the end when he passed the hat to his kid sister Phoebe  it seemed to me that he succumb to the fact that he has to fall  either way or another  and that he is ready for it   I read this in 7th grade and loved it  I read it again in college     and loved it  My brother  and I quote it to each other frequently  so it felt like time for a fresh read  I m floored  Not only does the book hold up over time    I love it just as much and it feels as relevant as it did in 1983    it s a phenomenally written book  duh  right    Genius  in fact  But sad     oh so very  very sad   This was required reading where Marc went to high school   It wasn t for me   I got interested in the book when he told me   Mom probably wouldn t want you to read this  There s a lot of bad language in it   I think it should be required reading for ALL high school students    with lots and lots of discussion  Dobra narracja mlodego umyslu  nastoletnie traumy  fiksacje i fascynacje  Lek przed brakiem autentycznosci  przemijaniem  dorastaniem

piece of literature in any way If I read this when I was younger  it could have been bad for me  lol   My absolutely favourite book  I read it 3 times  It s about a young man Holden  who doesn t care what other people are saying  He has been fired from school and he has to go back to his parents  The story tells his journey back to his home and the feeling of the young adult  Can t express how many impressions I got from this book and how much it thought me  I read it in two translations in Hungarian  but I think this book is ansolutely amazing  I will write a review in Hungarian as well  because on my native tounge I can express myself better  I highly recommend this book  it s fantastic  belive me   I understand that this book is surrounded with much controversy  from its being banned in schools during post WWII cultural revolution to modern students simultaneously lauding and despising it in equal measure  However  I would argue strongly for its importance as not only a work of literature but also as a representation of depression and disconnect  Perhaps I should feel happy for those who dislike the book and find within themselves no empathy for Holden  because perhaps they have simply managed to avoid the apathetic feeling of dissatisfaction and unsatisfaction Holden appears to feel throughout the novella  perhaps  however  that inability to empathize and connect is precisely the struggle which Holden reflects back   one of my all time favourite This book was really good  I read this book only for my english class and my teacher say   If you don t hate this book you will love the book  I think that I m the type of person who loved the book  I really think that the main character is   real  sometimes the characters are really  nice  or really  mean  this character is real because he shows the good and the bad from the people    Better read some phony spiritual book instead of this lousy Goddamn book   D  P  I loved this book  Holden is my inner angsty and depressed teenage self  You re either a phony  a goddam sonovabitch  or you re alright  And that kills me  I m glad that some lousy teacher never forced me to read this book in grade school  It s the kind of book you should read because you want to not because you have to  I finally decided to read this book after hearing about the similarities between it and perks of being a wallflower  I think that if I had read this book before perks I would have called chbosky a phony  I think that the two books are very similar  They really are  But I like both a lot  They both are thought provoking and must reads  And this one is a classic  The Catcher in the Rye  a novel by J D  Salinger is a well known classic  I personally really enjoyed the book throughout the end The main character of this novel is a sixteen year old New Yorker named Holden Caulfield  This book revolves around one weekend  just after he flunked out of prep school  At first I found the beginning monotonous  but moved on  As a teenager myself  I really connected with Holden  At this point in life  everyone expects you to know who you are and stop acting like a child  yet tell you that you are one  It s seen very realistically  Holden doesn t know what he wants and wants to have his childhood innocence back  Sexuality and religion is portrayed in this novel as well  He s not sure if there s a god or not  but still wants to be good  Like many teenagers  he brags about sexual encounters he never had due to modesty and a bit of fear  I really enjoyed his interaction with his little sister  even after encountering the  phoniness  of society  phoniness that blares in modern teenagers  faces today telling them who you should be This book is hard to read in the beginning  partially due to Holden s narration  He rambles and is crude  However  that is the main point of the character  so in a way that was done really well  It was a change from the usual  innocent  main character  People tend to look for a huge main plot or adventure  but this was interesting just to see the insight of a typical teenager s turmoil  all in school  religion  and early adulthood  I recommend this to every teenager  even if you don t like swearing or other  touchy  subject in books  I don t see why there was a big scandal over these books   like people were scared of these internal conflicts  These are the thoughts that should more exploited  as seen brilliantly by this novel  Classic for a reason  Reread this book at different points in your life and see how your opinion of Holden changes  If you didn t like this book then you should give this whole reading malarky a rest  it s not for you  Every couple of years i re read this book because I like it so much  I love Holden s narration and seeing the world through his eyes  I know some people find it boring because not a lot happens  but really I think so much happens  Holden is lost in the world  trying to figure out where he belongs  and more and more it seems like he doesn t really belong anywhere  Sometimes his narration is funny and clever  and other times it s so sad and lonely   Very funny  although it could be confusing at certain points because it is written in the perspective of Houlden s inner thoughts as well as his actions   The Catcher in the Rye was  for me  one of those books that you actually had quite high expectations of and still ended up taken by surprise since you didn t think you could actually like it That much  It s been said before and it will be said as long as this book keeps getting reviewed  that it didn t really have a plot  which might cause it to feel empty or scattered or just not that good  yet it works way better than well as a description or a tableau of an angry young man on a certain time of his life  who seems to be severely depressed and mature  deep for his age  which still affected him  a point that didn t get forgotten and really bought me    too frustrated and disappointed by people and their ways around him to see the sense in doing things just because you re told so  Holden Caulfield reminded me of this very good friend of mine  I m sure that s a point worth mentioning as it definitely had some say in how much I was to enjoy the book  So to say  Holden was a very realistic character  and the author didn t try to get the readers to see him through pink floral goggles just because people tend to like pretty things   the raw  hopeful and defiant personality was portrayed through its owners mind  which created an illusion of softened and rounded sharpest corners  which could be rather easily discovered by hitting ones head on them   I  Hey Holden  Hi  I read your story  I really    Holden interrupts Holden  Boy  you mean the story written by that Salinger guy and all  I told him to just keep it to himself but he wrote that goddam book about me  People never keep your secrets  I  But it s a good book  You must have got something for it Holden  Yeah  Salinger gave me some dough for it  He said he d give me more of it when the sales pick up  I don t know when the sales are going to pick up  You can never be sure about the sales picking up  I  Well  that s good  What did you do with the money then  You bought something Holden  I bought some cigarettes  I gave the rest to Old Phoebe  She got so happy  It made me happy to see her happy  She said she was thankful and all  I was sort of teary eyed I  That s so good of you Holden  Have you talked to Ackley or Stradlater lately Holden  Boy  I tried to get in touch with those phoney guys  I couldn t though  I hated Pencey but I was missing them  I will try some other time now I  Why don t you try now Holden  I m not in the mood to try that now  You have to be in the mood to do that kind of stuff I  Anyway  Holden  You were so frank and honest throughout the book  I mean everything that you said made me laugh  You re a terrific boy Holden  Jesus Christ  I don t know what ya all find funny about that book  I mean I was depressed and all and I was thrown out of Pencey and I fought and I yelled and I cried  And you laughed at that  People always laugh at you when you re depressed  I  I didn t mean it that ways Holden  Come on  Relax  I understood your situation pretty well  Mr Salinger has written everything the way probably you d have written it Holden  Yeah  D B  told me that everyone in Hollywood has read the story  And the morons have liked it  I know they are up to something  People are always up to something when they like something I  Holden  I ll have to go now  I will call you soon  May be we can have another chat sometime  I want to ask you thousand other questions  I ll let the world know what a great book it is  I ll ask everyone to buy a copy of it  That way Salinger would get his sales and you d get your dough  Holden  All right  I d better be going too  I ll give old Sally a buzz   I was at my local bookstore  which is sadly gone now  RIP Borders  last summer  looking for a classic novel to read  I knew at some point in my life I had to read  The Catcher in the Rye   which is listed next to  Huckleberry Finn  and  The Great Gatsby   both of which I love  as the trinity of classic American literature  I rolled my eyes and bought the novel  Little did I know  this would become one of my very favorite books of all time Starting the novel was a little bit restless  I must admit  The novel follows Holden Caulfield  an anti social young adult who is leaving his prep school for a little adventure of sorts in New York City  It starts a little boring until Holden boards the train into the city  After that  you are taken on a roller coaster ride of a slice of life  coming of age allegory of what human life really means  If the novel had an alternate title  I d call it  Three Days in the City   Because that is the plot in literally 5 words  simply put  I liked Holden as a character  I became very comfortable with him and felt as if he took me onto a little drive through his psyche  I was his best friend for the duration of 300 pages  The people he meets  however  are not fully appealling  Luckily  I had Holden  who felt like a real person instead of the  phonies   as Holden likes to call people  What is so amazing about the novel is that there aren t any fancy gimmicks  no full cast of colorful characters  no pilgrimages to who knows where  The plot is so simple  Everything is so simple  I feel like that s what makes the book  To be called an immaculate novel and have something as simple as a young boy recalling some stories and walking throughout New York City is really awesome  mad props to Salinger I just can t get over this book  highly reccomended   I read Catcher in the Rye for the first time in 2009  then once again this past summer  and now in school  I ve always found it hard to read books more than once  but for me  Catcher in the Rye is one of the only few I can never get sick of  You either love it or you hate it  For me  what draws me in the most about this book is of course  Holden Caulfield  His psych has always been so intriguing to me  I love everything about his character  As for the novel itself  I ve always felt that whilst reading this book it never felt like I was actually reading a book  if you get what I mean  I ve always felt like it was as if Holden was talking to me  or I was living the story so crystal clear through his eyes  My love for New York also ties into it  and the enthralling psychological messages have never failed to interest me Overall  I highly recommend Catcher in the Rye for those who like to get attached to a novel s characters  I rest assure Holden Caulfield will not fail to amuse you  intrigue you  frustrate you  make you laugh or shake your head  He is one of a kind  and so is this novel   Wow  not what I expected  Angst  Immaturity  Okay  yes  but there is so much more than that going on in the story The Catcher in the Rye is about a young man who is incredibly sensitive to the world around him and is disgusted with anything that conceals beauty  innocence  or genuineness  though he is as  phony  as those he critiques  It takes a confrontation with his sister  Phoebe  to make him realize his own  phoniness   And though he has this revelation  he still cannot grow up  He remains very sensitive to the beautiful  the innocent  and the genuine  so much so  that it overwhelms him and paralyzes him in the form of nostalgia  Before reading this book  you may want to read Robert Burns s poem   If a body meet a body   and understand what it s saying about sex  That way  when you get to Holden s misinterpretation of the poem  you will get a crucial insight into how he see s the world  Also  you may want to read David Copperfield  and see how Salinger is creating Copperfield s antithesis  Interesting tidbit  David Copperfield was born with a caul on his head  Holden carries the caul in his name  For one  the events from childhood pass  for the other  the events from childhood persist  It s obvious that Caulfield s whole worldview is pretty blunt  he s self absorbed and judgmental and a jackass  but there s still a kind of inner search for authenticity that I think most young people go through at his age  It s basically 200 pages of reckless wanderlust and inner dialogue as directionless as the plot  But I think there s a kind of isolated  intangible yearning for authenticity and meaning that motivates his actions  and links the story together  There s some sort of inner journey in there  as reckless and drunken as it is  and I think alot of young people can relate intensely to that It s unfair and shortsighted to judge this book by the maturity of it s protagonist  It s about an immature protagonist  The book ought to be judged by the quality of writing and how well it fits into itself  its capacity to enchant  and the pleasure that one gets from reading it  And on those three counts  I m giving it 5 stars  I really got a bang out of this book  And I think all you phonies who don t like it should go shine your shoes or something  You bunch of jackasses  This is the story of Holden Caulfield  a 16 year old boy who has been expelled from school    again  It is apparently a very simple story where he tells us what happens to him in three days when he decides to leave school and go to where the world takes him  We are fully aware how everybody says that adolescence must be lived to the fullest because it is one of the greatest times of one s life  Most of the book is a mental monologue where the author takes us to the innermost thoughts of this young man  reminding us how those  wonderful years  are not always so  We feel identified with the fears  depression  desire to belong  loneliness  confusion  awakening that youngsters go through  More shocking still is when we realize that Holden is a nice  good hearted boy  incapable of doing any harm willingly  A depressing book  but with a small window of hope  no matter how contradictory this may sound  Worth a second reading  An absolute eye opener  Coming of age is a messy  confusing business  There s the longing for adulthood  with the echos of childhood hovering nearby somehow in a way both irritating and comforting at various moments  Salinger s well known novel  told from the perspective of an angsty teenage boy named Holden  deserves all the praise it gets  Told with bitingly raw honestly  Holden tells of all the things and people he dislikes  why he is being kicked out of school again  and ultimately why life can seem so messed up but still have such bright nuggets of love and longing thrown in the mix  Holden may be angry and heartbroken with a chip on his shoulder  yet in the end all he wants is to be a catcher in the rye  a noble occupation concocted in his own head  and the reader can t help but hope he gets to be something just like it   This book was about a cool guy named Holden Caulfield who is in his little imaginary world  He thinks that there is a difference between him and other people calling them  phonies   At the start  we find out he s been moving from school to school by getting kicked  However he leaves the last one on purpose after fighting with a student  In the essence of reading it as a teen  you can experience all the things that is  wrong  in Holden s world and really connect to it  He has a sister who he wishes the best of luck to throughout the book and always avoids his parents in whatever situation he can  This book is great and well projected through the point of a 16 year old guy  I recommend it to everyone to see how harsh life is sometimes and wrong mistakes can cause a domino effect in life later on   First  you shouldn t read this if you are not ready to eat all your thoughts you think were right or acceptable because Holden  this boy  is a real fan of despair  Though he was right  J  D Salinger did say all the things I want to say to people too  Not that I am like Holden but I d admit he s too much sometimes like I hide under my blanket and cry for ruining what I believe  But the story  I love it very much  Especially his thoughts about Pheobe  his younger sister  We don t really know what innocence can do  Not many books can leave me speechless  but this one certainly did  It took my breath with each page I turned and it s definitely not a book you can get bored of   A beautiful story about coming of age  Having read this book years ago in Russian translation  I discovered it had the same effect on me as it did back then  Some of my favourite parts  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   It had this guy in it named Lieutenant Henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all  I don t see how D B  could hate the Army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that  I mean  for instance  I don t see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by Ring Lardner  or that other one he s so crazy about  The Great Gatsby  D B  got sore when I said that  and said I was too young and all to appreciate it  but I don t think so  I told him I liked Ring Lardner and The Great Gatsby and all  I did  too  I was crazy about The Great Gatsby  Old Gatsby  Old sport  That killed me  Anyway  I m sort of glad they ve got the atomic bomb invented  If there s ever another war  I m going to sit right the hell on top of it  I ll volunteer for it  I swear to God I will   But Catholics are always trying to find out if you re a Catholic even if they don t know your last name  I knew this one Catholic boy  Louis Shaney  when I was at the Whooton School  He was the first boy I ever met there  He and I were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary  the day school opened  waiting for our physicals  and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis  He was quite interested in tennis  and so was I  He told me he went to the Nationals at Forest Hills every summer  and I told him I did too  and then we talked about certain hot shot tennis players for quite a while  He knew quite a lot about tennis  for a kid his age  He really did  Then  after a while  right in the middle of the goddam conversation  he asked me   Did you happen to notice where the Catholic church is in town  by any chance   The thing was  you could tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if I was a Catholic  He really was  Not that he was prejudiced or anything  but he just wanted to know  He was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all  but you could tell he would ve enjoyed it more if I was a Catholic and all  That kind of stuff drives me crazy  I m not saying it ruined our conversation or anything  it didn t  but it sure as hell didn t do it any good  That s why I was glad those two nuns didn t ask me if I was a Catholic  It wouldn t have spoiled the conversation if they had  but it would ve been different  probably  I m not saying I blame Catholics  I don t  I d be the same way  probably  if I was a Catholic  It s just like those suitcases I was telling you about  in a way  All I m saying is that it s no good for a nice conversation  That s all I m saying   while i was working at the american apparel warehouse in LA  the bathrooms we had to use were shared by the whole factory and were always really trashed and disgusting  but in the stall on the far right someone had scrawled  fuck you  by the toilet paper dispenser  at first i convinced myself that the person who wrote it was referencing this book  when holden is going to meet his sister in grade school and sees  fuck you  written on the locker  spends time vigorously removing it  only to find it scrawled somewhere else   which made me really happy  then i decided that the likelihood was that they meant it sincerely  then i decided that that was actually better  any action meant sincerely is preferable i think   Knock it all you want  The Catcher in the Rye holds its place in literature for a reason  Salinger is able to put the myriad of adolescent emotions onto paper in a way that teenagers everywhere can relate to  Holden Caulfield is not the voice of a generation  he is the voice of every human being who has gone through the trials and tribulations of adolescence at one time or another  In his confused  disjointed  irrational narration we get an honest and realistic view into the teenage mind  As we get older and wiser we begin to look back on our years of adolescence with a simmer of disdain  Maybe with the growth of a few more years I ll realize that this book isn t as fantastic as I thought  but I hope I won t be so stubborn as to say I couldn t identify with it  If a work s greatness is in terms of how relatable it is  The Catcher in the Rye has been one of the greatest books of my life thus far  The Catcher in the Rye is an extremely complex book  The novel is all about a boy struggling to find himself in a sea of  phonies   Holden Caulfield  the main character  is trying to cope with his brother s death  but is having a hard time so his parents send him away to numerous private prep schools in hope that he will be able to grasp reality again  Holden get kicked out of all these schools and continues to be a disappoints  The pressure he feels from society to be  normal  again is tremendous  and all teenagers can relate to him  The book is ideal to read for ages 15 21 because it addresses drinking  smoking  sex  and overall rebellion at this age  Salinger is creative in the way he creates Holden s character  usually through cynical remarks or subtle actions  Holden and the reader is usually a love hate relationship  I love Holden Caulfield  but others think he is completely insane  I highly recommed this book  i think it sends an important message  teenagers deal with adult problems too   I could write a review but i m worried Holden may find it phony as hell  I mean he is still there crawling in my mind and won t leave  which is silly  He kills me                                           okay the inside jokes apart  but i m trying to write this goddamn review of this helluva book by this author  J D salinger  who is so damn good Holden Caulfield is still running in my brain  Catcher in the rye is so damn good  that s all i can say  I mean i can t explain it more than this  even if i did  i m worried you may not believe me Good by  Recently  I have finished one of America s novels  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  It is the first book that I have ever finished reading completely  then flipped it back to the front page to begin a second time  The Catcher in the Rye is a novel that makes you root for the underdog  and wish he would get away with something  just once While reading Salinger s novel  it felt like he was sending a message to his entire audience  He presents Holden as a normal teenage kid  one that could be found anywhere in the United States or world  However  through Holden s actions and the predicaments he gets himself into  displays how seemingly good kids can get off track easier than some may think  Even with the  bad boy  attitude  Holden does things for people he loves that would spread warmth throughout the coldest heart imaginable  After leaving his school and heading back to New York  he secretly sneaks into his sisters room to tell her everything   Holden must sneak because his parents don t know that he was expelled from yet another school   While in his sister s room  Holden seems like the  all American  bigger brother that every little brother or sister could ask for  That quickly changes when Phoebe  Holden s younger sister  goes back to sleep  and he watches her  as if a stranger in her bedroom When I first took this book of off our library s bookshelf  I chose it for the interesting story it promised  However  while reading the book  it has become my favorite book  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading and is either a high school student or older Steven Dowden I could easily write a long winded explanation about why this is my favorite book of all time  but I will refrain  I DID NOT like this book the first time I read it  as a sophomore in high school when I was required to read an AP novel   The second and third time I delved into it  I found Holden Caulfield to be one of the most remarkable and interesting characters antiheros of all time  He is as complex as he is heartwarming  and his interactions with the other characters offer a close study of human nature and idiosyncrasy  I highly recommend it  though I doubt other people will enjoy this book as much as I did  as is usually the case   Just to understand a small amount of Holden s story is worthwhile  I have not read Salinger s other work  it s all on my list    but I would put money on the fact that this is his best  Do yourself a service and let Holden into your life     I read this in high school and had no appreciation of it  I re read it late in college  and it is one of the most honest  confused  touching coming of age stories I ve ever encountered  A little existential  overwhelmed  and on the brink of sanity  much like I felt at a time in my life  this book reaches through confused thoughts and feelings and offers a little solace in the company of a kindred soul  I ve read others of his books  and after this one I see a lot of the same desperation and frustration in his works  This book has for me one of the most beautifully desperate and heroic lines in literature  from which the author took the title  My literary boyfriend  Holden Caulfield  Only because Atticus Finch would be inappropriate for my age  Holden  I know about you calling the prostitute On a more serious note  my review of The Catcher in the Rye A classic coming of age novel that is usually assigned to high school students  I m not a reader that cares about what s assigned  Usually when the school reading list for the year was handed out  I had already read all but one of the books listed  Holden Caulfield is intelligent but really has no motivation to get good grades or try at all at academics  He has a younger sister  Phoebe  that still lives at home  I love the scenes with the two of them because Holden will be stubborn and Phoebe will give him advice  a girl wise beyond her years At the beginning of the book  Holden is expelled from school  As a reader  we sense this has happened before  in multitude Holden then goes on a journey to find himself  I love this book because it was written with no intention of teenagers reading it and has now become a life changing book for so many people of that age  The sarcasm  wit  and charm is some of the best in all of the written word and the book still stands true to its original message  Se ha convertido en uno de mis libros favoritos  Imprescindible  I just finished it and all I could say is one thing GREAT I mean  it may have been about a excessively cursing bastard that goes by the name Holden Caulfield  it still offers us many life lessons  like  nothing is permanent  However much we hold onto something  it doesn t stay  and it s meant to be gone  Just like Holden s precious Allie  or maybe even his education at Pencey  All in all  it s a very worthy read  and although some parts may come off repetitive  it still pulls through  To those suffering of depression and stress  highly recommended  You would or wouldn t be disappointed  either way  its a novel worth your time   I think that one of these days you re going to have to find out where you want to go  And then you ve got to start going there    The Catcher in the Rye  is one of the greatest book that I ve ever read I remember reading it for the first time in 2011 for a school project so I m very glad to have re read it    What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though    I love everything about this book from the protagonist to the author s writing style  Your experience with this novel will depend on how much you are able to connect with Holden  If you don t  then this will be an unpleasant book to read  We were all teenagers once   that feeling of invincibility is echoed throughout Holden s decisions  This book seems anticlimactic  but we re all just visiting the mind of an average teenager  What more do you expect  A primeira vez que eu li O Apanhador no Campo de Centeio  terminei o livro achando o Holden um reclamao sem graca  e que o livro nao tinha historia nenhuma  Eu tinha uns 15 anos  e quando estava na faculdade  uma das minhas professoras disse  quando falei que nao tinha gostado  que eu nao deveria ter me identificado com o Holden  Seja qual for o motivo que me levou a nao gostar do livro  hoje dou 5 estrelas  e algumas lagrimas tambem  as ultimas frases  nossa   depois de me identificar muito com o Holden  talvez ate demais Editado para adicionar que  Acho pecado mortal escrever e grifar em livro  mas to arrependida de nao ter um marcador aqui pra marcar todas as partes que gostei  I hated The Catcher in the Rye when I read it for the first time  I thought that Holden was a boring complainer  and that the book was about nothing  I was 15  but a few years later  when I was in college  I told to one of my professors that I didn t like the book  and she told me that maybe it was because I didn t relate to Holden  Well  today  I give 5 stars to The Catcher in the Rye  and also a few tears  those last sentences  wow   and I can say that I relate to Holden  and maybe a little too much Edit to add that  I think it s a sin to write or to use a highlighter on books  but now I regret that I don t have any marker with me to mark all my favorite quotes  En mi opinion  una de las mejores novelas americanas de todos los tiempos   Read this review and others at The Silver Petticoat Review  The Catcher in the RyeReview by Autumn ToppingRating  4 5Before YA was an actual category in literature  there were still novels that set a precedent for what young adult literature would soon become  touchstone novels that would create a voice and influence future generations of teen literature as we know it today  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger was one of these novels The Catcher in the Rye follows 16 year old Holden Caulfield  a character so stifled by his prep school environment that after he gets expelled  he takes off for New York City  searching for truth and commenting on the hypocrisy  or phoniness  of adulthood along the way On the surface  the story itself doesn t sound particularly interesting  So what is it about The Catcher in the Rye that stays with us  What is it about Holden Caulfield that just works  I believe it is Holden s universal teenage alienation and cynicism as a character that still rings true  It is about identity Holden s search for independence within his hypocritical environment creates an unsettling fear of nonexistence and lack of identity  Holden Caulfield particularly dreads he will lose his independent thinking  his quest for individuality in the midst of conformity and phony adulthood while also desiring attention and companionship at the same time Despite his quest to find his personal identity in The Catcher in the Rye  however  Holden is never ultimately able to reconcile the two opposing forces of independence versus the want of attention to fully ever negotiate and find his individual identity in the midst of a conforming society  This intensely deep characterization makes Holden one of the most memorable characters in the history of YA  It also makes him relevant to teen readers today as well Aside from characterization  the prep school works as a brilliant symbol  the school representing the fears Holden has of adulthood  Holden s want of independence also connects to his inner desire to hold on to the past as he rejects the idea of adulthood  Holden unconsciously isolates himself in order to be protected from the smothering of identity he finds in adults and the Pencey students who represent them It is this unconscious recognition that his individuality is at stake  that his identity will become those of whom he despises  that every road he crosses  every step closer to adulthood he takes  the more he will disappear until his individuality is obliterated into nothing  This intense focus on identity and Holden s voice  character over plot  is what makes Salinger s novel so memorable  Holden just feels real Even though some readers will still be turned off by all the angst and Holden identity seeking  one can t deny the power of Salinger s classic novel because the writing and characterization is so powerful  While this will never be one of my favorite novels of all time  I m more of a L M  Montgomery or supernatural type of girl   I appreciate what Salinger accomplished  I appreciate that he was one of the pioneers that opened the door for more literature of an age group once ignored  He helped give it a voice  Lan thu hai doc lai  qua thuc cuon nay rat hay  Lan dau minh thich  nhung lan nay minh thuc su thich Holden thuc ra la mot cau be chan ghet thuc te hien tai  nhung ke bo

reason or other  I had never read  It s definitely not what I expected  Frankly  I m not sure what I expected  but what I got was this  a bit of plot  a little action  one very well developed character  and a profound message  I d be willing to bet that very few people would enjoy Salinger s book as much as me  but Holden Caufield reminded me so much of ME that it was more than a bit shocking  The way he is so easily bored and annoyed by everyone and everything  And how is he so depressed about what his life has become  He has no real friends  except maybe his 10 year old sister  He wants to escape his mundane life  but can t  And in the end  he accepts the cards that have been dealt him and decides to give it another go  Too bad you re a fictional character from the 40s  Holden  or else I d really want to meet you  Wow Probably the second best written book I ve ever read  The  voice  of the book was so believable  Salinger broke some rules of writing I never would  but that only made it read better I can see why misanthropes and societal outsiders feel such a connection to Holden Caulfield    I found myself agreeing with him more often than not myself The book is definitely as relevant today as the day it was published  And my hometown of Norwalk  CT  even got name dropped  Still not sure if the ending was positive or negative  but in a good way that will have me debating with myself for probably years to come  I decided that I would randomly choose a book off a bookshelf in my home and read it  The book that I choose happened to be this  Not only did I like the book  it kept me reading and inspired me to establish a life goal to read every book written by JD Salinger  Although this book may not be for everyone  due mostly to the writing style and content  I felt that this established for me the meaning of the phrase  Luck of the draw  Frankly  I m not a big reader  not that I don t like reading  but I don t read very often   Because of my short attention span  But the book definitely kept me turning the pages as I was entranced into the compelling and humorous reminiscing of protagonist Holdon Caulfield   One of my favourite novels of all time  It s the only book I ve ever read twice  The first time I was too young to understand it  but I still enjoyed it  and the second time it resonated with me and I felt strongly connected with the protagonist   This book was amazing  This is a classic that teens today are still able to relate with  That s a big deal  I love Holden s story about his struggles with growing up and leaving his childhood behind especially when he had a pretty lousy childhood to begin with  Everything he encounters  from sex and rape to the  fuck you s of life  forces him to realize he can t be a child forever  He has to grow up  And he hates the idea of it  The most romantically tragic part of it all is that he was already forced to grow up the very day his brother died  Tragedy at such a young age creates such an impact on people that  like Holden  they yearn for the childhood and innocence they lost  This was a beautiful story and I think everyone should read it  I was pleasantly surprised by this one  I had no idea what it was about  and it caught my attention from the very first sentence all the way to the end   Innocence lost  If you could sum this book up in a phrase  that would be it  The Catcher in the Rye  takes at least two readings to appreciate  but once you have you ll understand why it s a classic  The title initially gave me the impression that I was in for something deep and philosophical  something that would no doubt wax lyrical on the beauty of life or something or other  Instead I was greeted with the unfiltered polemic of an angry teenager  angsty in all his glory and up to his ears in unbridled hatred for everything living and breathing  If it were not for the fact that I HAD to analyse this book for for my high school thesis  aah  the joys of 4 Unit English HSC   I might not have had the strength to plow through what I thought was a laborious read  In between Holden s proclamations of  phony  this and  phony  that  I found it difficult to understand how exactly this was a classic  Such questions as  why the hell is this boy so bloody angry    primarily occupied the forefront of my mind  But like a gem in the rough  the farther you progress  the more you start to understand why  And that maybe we re so caught up with living our lives a certain societally prescribed way that we don t stop to realise how phony everything really is  That s why this is a book about innocence lost  We all grow up shedding the ideals we had as children  and like the skin of a snake  what emerges isn t exactly what we had hoped for or what the world needs  In the words of someone possibly famous   we are born as butterflies  but grow into cocoons  It is also worth noting that JD Salinger s ability to faithfully reproduce teenage speech patterns is a monumental achievement in and of itself  never mind the fact that he wrote an entire book in that manner  So I ll give him that much  In short  you should read this book on the proviso that you ll be somewhat disappointed the first time round  and greatly enlightened on the second  Hopefully this review will lessen the sting of the first time  Laugh out loud funny especially page 130   I m sort of an atheist  I like Jesus and all  but I don t care too much for most of the other stuff in the Bible  Take the Disciples for instance  They annoy the hell out of me  if you want to know the truth  They were alright after Jesus was dead and all  but while he was alive  they were about as much use to him as a hole in the head  All they did was keep letting him down  I like almost anybody in the Bible better than the Disciples  If you want to know the truth  the guy I like best in the Bible next to Jesus  was that lunatic that kept cutting himself with stones  I like him ten times as much as the Disciples  that poor bastard    Absolutely wonderful  I ve read it so many times  I just love the way I can get Holden Holden is a sweet boy who struggles with school but more than anything with himself  if you re a teenager who is feeling misunderstood  this book is great for you  he also makes you realize how much you can actually dislike the people from your school Every time I feel lonely or misunderstood I find this book really good as  way out  of my world  my stress and my schoolI highly recommended  I read The Catcher in The Rye for the first time the summer before i went into high school and the last time somewhere in undergrad  I often say three books define my adolescence and thus began to shape the person I am today  The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy  The Catcher in The Rye and The Communist Manifesto  I struggled through adolescence feeling misunderstood  as we all do  and when I read The Catcher in The Rye I felt for the first time that all of these confused and conflicting thoughts I had about the world were not just my own personal crazy  Now Holden is by no means a role model but his struggle with life  death  religion  and adulthood was my struggle  My parents had a horrible divorce and where absolutely hossible and miserable to each other and my sister and I  My childhood was cut very short by selfish adults who felt that their new single lives were more important then preserving our childhoods  I so identify with Holden s idealization of little Phoebe and the yearning to recapture that innocence of still being a child   Then the carrousel started  and I watched her go around and around  There were only about five or six other kids on the ride  and the song the carrousel was playing was  Smoke Gets in Your Eyes   It was playing it very jazzy and funny  All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring  and so was old Phoebe  and I was sort of afraid she d fall off the goddam horse  but I didn t say anything or do anything  The thing with kids is  if they want to grab the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   I love this part of the book and I admire Holden s wisdom of letting a child just be a child  I think for so many of us Holden reflected not only our sadness of our childhood lost but of what we did with it  For me the loss of my childhood at an early age made me so much more protective and encouraging of others  I could not save my own childlike innocence but I could try and preserve that magic for others  I always tear up when I read the passage  She was right  though  It is  If a body meet a body coming through the rye   I didn t know it then  though   I thought it was  If a body catch a body    I said   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around    nobody big  I mean    except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff    I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy   Here was Holden so empty and alone with no one wanting or caring to save him and his thoughts were not for his own glory but to some how keep these children safe  to play  to just be  Like Holden I struggled a lot with religion and like Holden I liked Jesus well and good but felt very confused by all the rules and dogma of the Roman Catholic Church  No one around me in my Italian American family would question or even talk about theology in an abstract and critical way and until I read this book at age 12 I just thought i was horrible person for even thinking such things  Holden like me longed for something to make sense  to stay true  to be consistent  Like Holden I grew up around NY and his description of The Museum of Natural History was so poignant to me because of what it stood for and because my experience of that museum was as his over 30 years apart from each other   The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move  You could go there a hundred times  and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish  the birds would still be on their way south  the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole  with their pretty antlers and their pretty  skinny legs  and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket  Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   I loved this book and until someone asked me why and I read a few excerpts I had forgotten just how much  I am rereading the Great Gatsby as I write this and I am so disappointed in how it has lost it s enchantment for me from when i read it in high school  but as I reread parts of Salinger I reminded of why for me this book is a classic and how even at 40 I remember how Holden spoke to me and made me for the first time feel like i wasn t alone  An Absolute Classic  The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one Unpretentious  yet prodigious    In most high schools  you are required to read a specific number of books from an approved list of classic literature  The number of these novels varies from school to school  but the lists are similar  including titles such as Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and Great Expectations by Charles Dickens Salinger s Catcher in the Rye was on that list  and I wish I would have read it during high school rather than labor over some of the other books that I chose  It is a fantastic example of bildungsroman  or a coming of age story  The text is simple and easy to understand  I was hardly able to put it down and finished it in two or three days during my spare time Highly recommended to anyone and everyone  especially those with that high school reading list  Yes  read it again When I had first read it I was really young  And  while I could dig Holden Caulfield  I felt a tension with him  getting angry at his lack of faith  hope and trust  in anyone and anything  I read it again later  and perspectives changed  And  now  again  I read a narrative that I had missed earlier  Sometimes  in this age of social media and hyper connectivity  I find myself turning into Holden Caulfield with a biting cynicism  surrounded by phonies everywhere  I feel a phoney too  at times  An imposter  Lonely  Even judgemental  lIke Holden  Always criticising and cussing the phoney world around us  we ourselves become one But  then there is always hope in human relationships  Some people always stand there like a peg in the ground    like old Phoebe    who help us believe in ourselves  and the humanity of us A classic forever  A deeply haunting tale of moral and spiritual crises that stems from sensitivity that is so important  yet so debilitating  The other extreme is perhaps being comfortably numb  but that is a death of another kind  Four days in the life of a 16 year old prep school boy in the 50 s    in a word  captivating  I m ashamed to say it took me this long to get around to reading this classic  It wasn t assigned  that I recall  when I was in high school in the 70 s  but I do remember that most of what was assigned I either wouldn t or couldn t bear to read  I was all into the book and the main character Holden Caulfield from the first page  actually the 2nd sentence      in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them  Maybe I could hear myself or my friends saying the exact phrases Holden used   to tell you the truth    that killed me    phony    crumby    sex maniac  and of course the multitude of obscenities  What high school student doesn t litter their speech with swear words Holden s manner and thought process transported me straight back to that tempestuous time in my youth  I found Holden to be real and endearingly sensitive  At one point he calls his roommate  Stradlater conceited  but generous  He had this way of seeing both sides of a person    the annoying or bad side  but he could see the good side also  Holden was contemplative and confused yet compassionate  I d say this novel is brilliant and timeless  capturing the essence of a teenager and the struggles they face  If you think your teenager shouldn t be exposed to the language in this book  think again because they already are  and I d bet they d not only find Holden to be a  Prince   but identify with him too After weeks of trying to obtain my local library s ONE copy of The Catcher in the Rye  I caved and bought a copy for  6 99 at Barnes   Noble  Though it was a very quick read  it was well worth the price Hands down  Holden Caulfield is my favorite narrator  to date   His voice is unlike any other that I ve ever read  I enjoyed every second of his musings and explicit language  It just sounded so real to me  I very rarely feel so completely enthralled by a narrator  and it wasn t even that I loved Holden as a character  In fact  I was pretty ambivalent about him  He s generally pessimistic about his peers and older people  and though he hates phonies  he occasionally contradicts himself  rendering himself a phony  For example  he says he hates when people use the word  grand  because he feels it s a gross overstatement  but he constantly says things like  She kills me   Another idiosyncrasy worth mentioning is Holden s simultaneous immaturity and wisdom  People constantly tell him to act his age  yet he sees into the depths of others  minds with startling clarity  He notices girls convincing themselves that a man has an  inferiority complex  when he s really just a nasty human being and egoists who are only willing to talk to other people until they run out of things to say  However  the biggest thing that I really like about Holden is his fascination with his kid sister Phoebe s innocence  The one thing that he likes in the world is spending time with her  and this is ultimately what saves him from his worsening depression  While I m still trying to figure out how much I like him  I can t stress enough how impressed I am by Salinger s ability to craft such a clear  distinct voice The Catcher in the Rye is largely plotless  After Holden leaves Pencey  he wanders around New York City  stopping in bars and meeting old friends  and the novel ends with him visiting Phoebe and deciding not to run away from home  The entire book is just an account of his misadventures in the city  Usually I tend to disfavor books without a distinct plot  but Holden s voice won me over  I kept expecting something significant to happen  but the closest moment to real action was when Holden wakes up and finds Mr  Antolini patting his head  While this suggests molestation  especially when Holden refers to it as a perverty thing to do   it is never made clear what Antolini s intentions really were  Though Holden spends the entire novel anxiously awaiting a reunion with Jane Gallagher  he never so much as speaks with her  The ending kind of builds when Holden claims he s going to run away  but he goes back on his word and promises Phoebe he ll go back home instead  In short  the novel is really just a series of events I haven t done my research yet  but as of now  I can t discern the reasoning behind placing The Catcher in the Rye on a banned books list  There is an abundance of curse words and the encounter with Mr  Antolini is questionable  but I honestly don t understand what s considered  bad  about this novel  While he does discuss sex throughout  there s nothing graphic  and while he s rebellious  he never really partakes in any real crimes  Whatever the justification for its reputation may be  The Catcher in the Rye is now one of my favorite books of all time  J D  Salinger uses just enough stream of consciousness to create a highly relatable narrator without confusing readers with mile long run ons and completely unrelated ramblings  even though Holden is prone to straying from the subject at hand   All in all  I loved The Catcher in the Rye  I find myself wanting to sit down and discuss this with everyone  including my teenage self who read it first   3 The Catcher in the Rye was published on July 16  1951  The Catcher in the Rye is about a sixteen year old boy called Holden Caufield  that is expelled from a school called Pencey  Holden is a unique character that hates anything  phoney  to do with the world  He struggles to grow up and face people in a mature way  yet at times acts much older than his age This story is about growing up and realizing that things do change and you have to change with them  Holden is very honest and isn t afraid of being different and i respect him for that  Although I do find that his character is very obnoxious and hypocritical  He is always calling people  phoneys  when he himself does actions that are just as  phoney   He is very judgmental  even if he doesn t fully know the person  He also makes irrational decisions very quickly and never follows up on his plans  He is the typical teenage boy that is sometimes depressed  refuses to grow up and confused and I think this is relate able to many readers  Although I do find him to be very frustrating and selfish  he does have a very strong relationship with his little sister Phoebe and his dead little brother Allie  For example on p g  171  Phoebe asks Holden one thing that he really likes  He responds with   i like Allie   I said   And I like doing what I m doing right now  Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff     Phoebe then remarks he can t say he likes Allie because he s dead  but Holden replies with    I can still like him  though can t I  Just because somebody s dead you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all   I like these moments the best because Holden is very honest and open and relate able  I recommend  The Catcher in the Rye  to anyone that can relate to Holden s struggle or someone that can deal with a slow progressing book and Holden s peculiar character  I thought the book was incredibly frustrating and the only reason I continued to read it was because I wanted to know what happened at the end and it was very well written  The ending was extremely shocking and left me even more frustrated  Although I think this is what J D  Salinger wanted  After reflecting on it I realized this is now one of my favorite books and the only book I love  but hate the main character   Thirty years after first reading The Catcher in the Rye and falling in love with J D  Salinger  I am still enamored with the complicated  immature  screaming Holden Caufield Suffering and confused begging to see fairness proof of genuine life  Caufield scrambles to put together a life that he controls that flourishes in goodness but by his own standards  With so many years having passed since its first publication and my first introduction to this novel  the way it reads in 2015 is so much more layered that it was those 30 years ago  There is both less and more depth to the dear great cynic Holden Caufield and so many viable motivations for his actions taht are perhaps only hinted at but that fit what we often know as a truth for someone who suffers so much  Well worth the second read and surely  I would consider a third glance as well  I am still as madly in love with Mr  Salinger as I ever was as well  The Catcher in the Rye maintains its five star status with me and proves why it is a solid classic  it was a very interesting book  holden is such an intelligent character  i related to him so much because at times   growing up as teenager with psychological conflict turmoil can be so hard and the pretentious bravado was touching  i liked his clear and clinical observations of the modern american  the insencerity of the emerging consumerist society in the richest empire in the history of mankind  i loved the dark humour and it really made me laugh out at times with his observations  and i can totally relate to the sarcasm   not ebing american i wasnt exactly a big fan of the american dialect but i suppose it adds to genuineity  a good read that catches the loneliness of growing up when not fitting to your social group class  Reading this book at age 14 taught me a lot about literature and about the role of the author  About using stories to say so much in subtle ways  and about the art of style and craft  Then  it was the voice of my teenage angst and one of the earliest glimpses I had to thinking like an adult  It represented my adolescence in so many ways Ten years later  this book means something completely different to me  but it s still as significant  Holden s perspective is so reflective of things within my own life that it was often difficult to read  The feelings of hopelessness this story sometimes invokes were at times overwhelming  but important to recognize and reflect on nonetheless  The crucial thing to understand is that books can be closed when it s their time to end  While I can understand Holden  I can no longer relate to him  and I m glad to know this now  Because of my fondness for Chbosky s Perks  I recommended Catcher to myself  Now I think it s pretty weird to read Salinger s novel and be reminded of Green s Alaska instead  I m sure it s all because of the cursing I guess the one thing that I love the best about Holden is that he has this   what  Hatred  I don t know  I guess it is hatred  Anyway  it s the phonies  He has this very terrific hatred towards phonies that I find so  well  I don t know I don t really know where to start  But oftentimes I d find myself laughing whenever Holden used  goddam    bastard    and all that crap    Chrissake   I honestly don t know why  They killed me  though Anyway  the novel s so good I couldn t let it be done after only one or two days  I sure as hell am going to read this book again  In my most doubtful moments I feel as if I m living somebody else s life or at least should be living mine differently  Then later some small and curious thing will remind me I am living my own life after all and that I m living it the only way I can manage at that point in time  And then I ll have doubts again  That always happens  I think I will always have the feeling that I m missing out on something  That there s something I should be doing  somewhere I should be  someone I should meet   It s hard to put into words the exact feeling Holden Caulfield first evoked in me  even if it was positive or negative   because while there is a strange comfort in nostalgia  there is also a sadness    All I can say is he is a rare character I still  in my adult life  feel the need to revisit from time to time   I really wish I d read this book in high school because every teenager can relate to Holden Caulfield in some way  Even now  as an adult  I feel connected with Holden  So often  I feel trapped and I want to rebel and destroy things  I ve come to realize that in many ways  adult life and the responsibilities that come with it are so much more oppessive than anything I faced in teenhood  As an adult  you are forced to be subordinate to many more people than your parents and the obligations that one is subject to are almost dictatorial   In Catcher in the Rye  Holden has simply had enough  Throughout the entirety of the book  Holden has had enough  And how often do I feel like I ve had enough  He does what I wish I could  run away  The rub in running away is that you realize that your troubles catch up with you  There s always something to burst that idyllic bubble that you can escape from everything that brings you down Perhaps I wish I d read this book in high school because it really is a fantastic book for disenchanted youth and outsiders  We are all outsiders in some respect  Holden feels separated from his peers  his family  and the city that surrounds him  It s the very essence of youth  A beautiful book to read when you feel alone and misunderstood  The kid runs away to New York City and talks about his weekend in the City  He drinks even though he s underaged  won t have sex with a prostitute he hires  and goes to a museum he went to as a kid  The entire book is written in the point of view of Holden Caulfield at the mental institution he s at in LA because he has many problems  There  I just saved you three hours of pointless reading  HOWEVER  this is quite possibly the best book I ever read about phonies and how we should deal with them in our society  This book has inspired me   MUST KILL JOHN LENNON  I loved this book when we read it in class  It was so interesting and in some ways I think that every kid can relate to him  I don t really know why others didn t like it  I had a lot of opposing views but he didn t really annoy me like he did everyone else  In class  we did activities were we played therapist but really  analyzing everything he says and does was my kind of story reading  It just captivated me even if there wasn t a romance theme in it  I really can t read anything unless it s romance related  If you can tolerate him  read the whole thing out and really let it sink in  Give it a shot  I adored this book Whilst reading the piece I had to keep continually reminding myself that I was not actually in the head of a teenage boy  The notion that an adult could even comprehend the emotions of a teenager to the extent achieved in this book is mind blowing I don t know what it was exactly about this book that made me love it so much  perhaps it was the period of my life during which I read it  or perhaps it was the author s amazing ability to dive into his characters  Whatever it was  when I finished reading this book I wasn t able to move out of my seat  It was so moving and I could really empathise with the confusion and apathy of the main character Holden Although to some this book might seem cynical and even superficial  I thought there was so much depth to Holden s cynicism and apathy  Rather than being so overt about  teenage issues  as most authors are today  I thought Salinger addressed the issues in a really subtle and clever manner  There was so much more depth to Holden s apathy than what met the eye  It was refreshing to finally read a book that dealt with teenage emotions and issues in such an astute manner      Bir sey var idi ki  Stredleyter

parts they re presumed to play  others just don t  It s the divinity of human mind to question and search for that something more  for that hidden mistery that we hope explains it all  But it s a painfull quest  full of questions and no answers  And that ache in the back of your throat and the pit of your stomach just gets worse  until you think you ve grown a well inside of yourself that s sucking you in  imploding within  And there isn t even a remote chance we ll belive it will pass over  that all will  eventually  be alright  Although  it will  one way or another  It s been a very  very long time since I last enjoyed a book so thoroughly  It speaks to a long forgotten part of ourselves and pleasures us in painfully sweet reminiscences of that time when we felt so much as outsiders  we were sure we were a  madman   To be honest  sometimes I still do   Honestly  The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book of all time  Though I have read it multiple times  I continue to keep reading it because every single time I read it  I catch something I didn t catch the time before  In my Advanced Senior english class this coming semester  we have an Independent Reading Project IRP  and I already know I am doing mine over The Catcher in the Rye because it hits home  The emotion that J D  Salinger wrote into Holden hits you where it needs to and I can easily see characteristics of myself in Holden that most people don t know of  I can relate well to him and that is a huge reason why this is and will remain my favorite book   I loved it  Holden is so spot on everybody  Left me feeling a little strange  the ending that is  Was Holden perhaps mentally ill and not only physically sick  I quite liked how drastically the tone of the book changed after he encounters Mr  Antolini   Hold on to your Childhood The Catcher in the Rye is a phenomenal book  Trying not to lose your childhood  the main theme of the book  is manifest at every turn of the page  J D  Salinger truly captures the meaning of this theme in his novel  The Catcher in the Rye   Holden Caulfield  the protagonist of the book  is different  He is best described as a university student who hates life  Holden has lost his childhood  but he wants it back  The entire book describes his journey to regain his childhood  and what types of adventures he meets along the way   Holden is a person who values genuineness  He mentions the word  phony   hypocrite  numerous times throughout the book  Each time he says it  he usually goes off on a few sentence rant about how much he hates these phonies  This can be seen when he says   I can t stand that stuff  It drives me crazy  It makes me so depressed I go crazy   Salinger 24   Almost everyone he meets is a phony  There are only two people characters throughout this novel that he genuinely likes  and neither of them are phonies  Phoebe Caulfield  his loving little sister  is one of the non phonies  In some ways  she provides a character foil for her  When Holden talks to Phoebe  it is easy to see that he does not want to grow up  However  his little sister who is younger than him by six years  is in some ways more mature than him  Phoebe understands the necessity of growing up  and on multiple occasions becomes aggravated with him  This novel is interesting because the main character is so human  He has hardly any good qualities  and is very miserable and judgmental of almost everyone else  The story of this dejected young man s attempt to hold on to his rapidly disappearing childhood is truly a must read   If I lived in New York  I would think every one is a phony too One great thing about being a teenager  is you can call everyone a phony and no one bats an eye  When you get older  you have to be nice and understanding and caring to everyone  I like  and relate to  Holden s point of view  I loved it What a great book  Maybe I missed the part that lead people to murder  and I can sorta understand why the book is banned  But it was still an awesome book  It was kind of difficult to see what Holden had to go through  and his adolescence behavior Holden really reminds me of  One Flew Over The Cukoo s Nest  character McMurphy    I wonder if Holder grew up to be him  he definitely has some mental problems  Holden really seems to be bipolar    or maybe it is just teenage hormones    This book really brought me back to teenage years  and it really explains the angst that teenagers are going through     Just finished the third reading and I think now its time to write my review of  THE CATCHER IN THE RYE   It is the most truthful portrayal of of the awkward late teenage  The way a teenager sees the world and try to find or to lose his place in this world  The confusing  baffling and socially painful  coming of age  stage in a boy s life  This book is near perfect  it s not only hard but virtually impossible to find a single fault in this great modern masterpiece by J D  Salinger  Every time I read this book i have this feeling that how this book has influenced the writing styles of the so many bloggers in the present scenario  Not a mean accomplishment  given the fact that it was written 60 years ago  when there probably was no computer  forget the internet from the picture   This book have the narration of the modern day teenager s chat  The vocabulary has the palpable delightful touch of slang somewhat similar to the ones now so prevalent in internet forums albeit the absence of acronyms I am not here to dissect the story or go into a deep literary review of how the narration unfolds or what hidden messages this book conveys or why it found itself on the list of banned books for so many years  Let the people who don t like it eat cake  And the one who love it  unfortunately including some of the most infamous serial killers in US history enjoy it again and again  Every reading is akin to sneaking into a hidden time passage and arriving an old memory lane  I recommend it for those people who don t mind nostalgia or feeling blue every now and then  Finish this book and reminisce the void you felt when you finished the beautiful journey of your own innocently corrupted teenage days   Digression  Interesting and enjoyable digression  This is the very word that describes this book  digression  The book is 200  pages and the story in it spans over only two days and a half  It s crazy  I know It s a story about a teenager  Holden  that is unique and like no other teenager  but who  at the same time  resembles every teenager in us  Every single person who read this book told me that they can relate to the main character As a close friend to me said about this book   Reading The Catcher in The Rye is like reliving adolescence  It is a wonderful book and the main character is extremely sarcastic  which I really enjoyed  but the thing is  I didn t like the way the main character repeated everything he said  It s like reading every single twice  In fact  you do read every single sentence twice  But I guess that was overshadowed by the awesomeness of the book  and I didn t mind it that much since the story was enjoyable on the overall   The Catcher in The Rye  I was so curious about this book for pretty a long time  I kept wondering what this book was all about and anything  I mean  I d read some articles about it  that this book was all about a six year old boy that flunked out of several schools he went to  But  if a book could be in a best book ever list  it should have something in it  right  So  I felt sort of satisfied when I finally read it  And I just want to share what I d read  This boy  Holden Caulfield  got the ax for several times  He didn t flunk on account of stupidity and all  He was just fed up with all phonies and mean guys that existed in the schools he went to  He hated all kind of injustice around him  He hated if somebody bullied somebody else or at least never let somebody else join him because of trifling reasons such as boring or pimply  He couldn t stand all of that stuff  Finally  all he did was he let his teachers flunk him so he could get out of there  We might suppose Holden Caulfield didn t like anything  He was always swearing at everything  Frankly  it sort of bothered when I started reading this book  The curses  I mean  I ve never read a book with so many oaths in it before  But I thought it was just the way the writer emphasized the Holden s character or anything  I didn t really know  Anyway  if we omit all that swearwords we ll find out what kind of guy Holden Caulfield is  Actually  he was a kindhearted boy  He really was  He liked to give somebody around him a hand  He could also being touched easily  He got depressed when someone else got an inferiority complex because of him and all  This book told us about Holden Caulfield s experiences in three days and what he was all thinking about  We could take a lesson from his story if we wanted to  By reading this book  we knew why Holden let his teachers flunked him and what things that made him sore and nervous and everything  So  we could sort of figure it out  The reasons why Holden made out like all that stuff  I mean  The part I liked the most from this book was when Holden spent his time with his little sister  Phoebe  That was the nicest thing from Holden  He loved her sister so much  And Phoebe was fond of him  just the way Holden did  no matter what her brother had done with his own life  What they did together was so funny in one thing and touching in another thing  That s nice  I quoted what Holden said to Phoebe about what he would like to be  Phoebe asked Holden about what he d like to be because he flunked out of all schools he went to  What Holden said to answer his sister was sort of touched me  It really was  I mean  Holden acted like a naughty boy or anything  but he was a noble one  though  And here what he said   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean  except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy   I think this is my favorite book  Holden is just your typical teenager  but he actually has the guts to act on the ideals that he is so passionate about  which I think is admirable for someone his age  The most touching thing about this book is realizing that behind Holden s attitude and angst is a lost boy with a broken heart  All he wants is for his younger brother Allie to have not been sick and for his family to have been happy together  This view into his secret pain opens up other doors into his past as well  What I love most about Holden is that he knows himself so well  I can t help being envious of how true to himself and his own voice he always is   Holden Caulfield  a sixteen year old from New York  has once again been expelled from a state of the art school  Pency  on account of poor grades  Holden  having mixed emotions about his expulsion  leaves the school early to go on an adventure of a lifetime  without supervision  in the big apple  The Catcher in the Rye is a magnificent novel told from Holden s point of view  Some would think this book is dull or boring  but i found it rather amusing because of his many redundant phrases and interesting anecdotes  Once  when he went to a diner for breakfast  he saw a couple of nuns with cheap suitcases that weren t made from genuine leather  He claimed that the sight of the nuns with their cheap suitcases made him depressed because it reminded him of a boy he used to know when he went to a different school  which he was also kicked out of  This boy had cheap plastic suitcases and he d always try and hide them under the bed and it made Holden feel awful  The Catcher in the Rye is a day in the life kind of story about a teenage boy growing into a young man  I loved the book  and I would recommend this to any reader who likes adventure told in a realistic way   I adored this book  I read it at high school when I was 15 years old  My teacher told me to read it once  when I d actually read it 3 times  It was so moving it brought tears to my eyes every time  The catcher in the RyeBy  J  D  SalingerReviewed by Ronnie Kelsey J  D  Salinger is a true genius with his book Catcher in the Rye  At first I didn t know what to expect from the book just because I had heard horror stories about it from some friends  Eryn Leigh Dunwody   Salinger captures the essence of a true rebellious nature through the character of Holden Caulfield  He has such a truly eclectic thought process that although the book has no major jump out at you events  the reader is drawn towards Holden  That s right I said it there are no major  or what we define as cool events in the book  It is the life of a troubled teenage boy  Holden however has a very rigid schema on what society is all about  He frowns upon all those phonies that conform to society because of what is accepted  I loved Holden because he called out 90 percent of the people in our world today  Instead of being what our true self tells us to be we push that aside and let society impede on our natural thought process   I really can relate to what Salinger is trying to portray here  That s why the book was such an eye opener for me  I m a really sarcastic  insulting person  So when I look at Holden I don t see a crazy  weird teenage boy  I see some what of a reflection of myself  Holden tells it like it is there is no sugarcoating of any sorts  The beliefs Holden holds today stand true for all eras and all generations  The book is set in the 1930s and 1940s and rebellion then is much different then rebellion now  They both have the same underlying idea and Salinger captures it perfectly  Holden makes the reader almost feel like a bad person because of who he thinks of as a phony  It made me analyze my life and actions and I found that in certain aspects I am an individual and yet in others I am a true phony   The story starts out in New York  Holden is from a very wealthy family and attends many great schools but fails out of all of them  He has barely any friends and considers all of the kids at school phonies  At one point in the story as Holden is sneaking out of Pencey Prep school he yells  Sleep tight ya morons  as loud as he can through the dormitories  This just shows that Holden doesn t deal well with other kids  However awkward a person may be though there still is a path too a somewhat hardened hart  Holden respects very few people in his life but still holds his family as his most prized possession in life  He misses his brother Allie who died and kind of prays to him sometimes  He loves his sister Phoebe and values her as a person and never ridicules her once  Phoebe is a quiet young girl with a vivid imagination  She is a very simple character and shares many odd quirks with Holden  To me she has the most definitive quote in the book  She tells Holden that he doesn t like anyone  Holden responds by saying I like Allie and you  She then says no like other people  Holden becomes confused after this because he doesn t like anyone else outside truly  He has 2 people outside his family that he respects but doesn t like  That is Mr  Antolini and Mr  Spencer  They both have a profound impact on Holden but can not sway him in the path he heads down in life  Holden has all this weight coming down on his shoulders and does not know where he is going  He thinks often times he is going crazy and generally says so in the book  The pressure starts to get to him when he starts to upset Phoebe  So where will Holden go with his life  Will he conform to society or will he be that same sarcastic rebel  Read the Catcher in the Rye to find out  I would definitely recommend this book to all readers out there because I think everyone could get their own message from the story  If you are in to action and twists and turns then this isn t the book for you  However this is a good change of pace and has showed me that what I thought as boring books before can have profound message that impacts you more then books with a bunch of twists and turns  Rating  4 5 5To tell the truth  nothing really happened in this novel  guy gets kicked out of school and we follow him around for the next three days  But  as with many coming of age books  Roddy Doyle s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha comes to mind  though I m not necessarily making a connection as it s been too long since I ve read it   the strength of the book anchors not on some fancy outbursts of  intellectual   ah  yes  would like some tea with that  plot points or outright commentary but rather to how readers can relate to  or know someone like  the main character  Even if readers might not go through all the curiosity about sex  the need for alcohol  the hatred against the world that I want to be a part of  and all that jazz  they can certainly understand the frustration and confusion of growing up and trying to figure things out  To that end  The Catcher in the Rye makes absolutely splendid use of voice  Holden spends the entire book complaining and keeps repeating certain phrases to describe things  This becomes annoying at times  but it makes the novel all the more believable  It s not like people are trying to write essays while they re talking to each other I m also happy that Salinger alluded to Ring Lardner multiple times throughout the book  You Know Me Al in particular also follows a guy s thoughts on the world and would make for a nice companion piece With all that said  I don t think this is a novel I d be rereading  It s not for everyone  Holden points out every single little thing and comments on it and digresses  but this is a great example of dialogue and  as already mentioned  voice   Wow  what a great book  I read it in one day even though I had 8 million tons of homework to do  Reminded me a lot of Catch 22  with the dripping cynicism  the commentary on human nature  and the outright humor  I was cracking up reading it  This is definitely in my Top 10 books ever  and is one of those that I will reread at some point  This seems like a really good candidate for a reread  in some of the reviews I read people were commenting about how you can see different aspects of it each time through  It s funny how books  movies  video games  etc  can be like that  Makes me feel like there s a ton of stuff I need to re experience like that  but who s got time  I can t even get through everything I want to once  Anyway  this is one of the best books I ve read in a long time  and as a bonus it s pretty short  so that makes it even more appealing  I love this book  I really do Years after first reading it  I bought a copy and the book has been sitting on my shelf ever since  That red cover has occasionally caught my eye and I d toy with the idea of revisiting Holden s story  But I ve been afraid  What if Holden didn t stand up to the pedestal he occupies in memory  What if J D  Salinger isn t as amazing of a writer as I once remembered  When he died  I knew it was time to justify that position on my favorite books shelf It took me a week and half to read this book because I wanted to savor it  What a powerful story teller  if only he d learn how to break a few paragraphs every once in awhile   Love or hate Holden  you get Holden  That moment when he held the snowball and looked out over the snowy street below  unable to throw the snowball because it looked too pretty  was such a fabulous example of showing us Holden s personality and his insecurities about himself in the world  that it made me smile  So much of his quirky personality  word choice  exaggerations and the way J D  Salinger writes it with such power and metaphor made me smile  well minus the use of about the only swear words that makes me cringe  I have a weakness for good boy protagonists  Girls get whiny and annoying  but boys bottle it up so you want to protect them  I found the scene where Holden fights with his roommate for saying he messed around with a girl he liked so powerful  You can feel the emotion breathing off Holden and know exactly what he s thinking despite what he says  For all his angst  Salinger gives us enough of his emotional breakdowns and his show of good heart that you feel for him  even if you want to shake him  Dealing with his brother s death and his insecurities about living up to his family  he s falling apart  but even those who see that he needs don t get that his alienation and apathy are self preservation  I can t help but think that he wanted to protect kids so much because he needed someone protecting him  He s such a child  his whole character full of irony  He needs his own catcher in the rye  standing on the edge of that cliff to make sure he doesn t fall  I found this book pretty interesting after reading all that Philip roths obsession with panties and stuff and Naipaul s early days spent in Classic London with his literary life  I picked up this title after my uncle   who is a keen book lover you can probably call him a born to read kind of a guy   suggested me to read this book I picked up the hardcover from early prints and started reading on my way to a train journey at friends place I was curious about the term   Catcher in the Rye  As I followed the Holden s words I was fascinated towards his introduction of serval characters in the book  It s a dark sad story of a innocence age filled with hope of something but still I recommend this book to each and everyone as we all have some memories of our early childhood a story worth to be written or told  I would say add this to your bookshelf it s a must have book to get understood everyone s childhood  The catcher in the rye is talking about Holden s lift He s brother is dead when he is 16 at that time  he break all the window and he don t like the thing change anymore at school Lackey is his friend they always play and talk together One day he meet one guys That is his roommate his name is Straddler  but one day he say he want to sex to one girl that Holden like so they start to fight  Holden is loss Then he leave the school and go back to where he live and he take train to New York On the train he meet one boys mom that boy is the student at his school So he use the other name to talk about how good is that boy Then when he get to New York He go to a party to meet those people  And he go away because those people are phony He don t like phony So when he came back to his room he see one phony She ask 15 dollar to sex with her but Holden just give her 5 so she is leave but when Holden came out of the door one man start to hit him  And the phony came out to stop him than she give Holden 5 dollar to let him go when Holden is came out He went to Mr  Anatolian s house and talk about where he going  and he sleep on the sofa than he wake up because Mr Anatolian s hand is on his hard he thing he is the that kind person than he run out the door when he go outside he meet he s sister than he going to the park with her he sit there watch her to play He feel so happy for that     Wow I just skimmed the reviews written by other GoodReads folks and am really surprised at how many people hate this book  What the   I love this book  I ve loved it since I was 13    But I m starting to realize that something happens to you when you read a book at a young age that really knocks you out  it kind of becomes a part of you  and you love it forever  I feel this way about several books  this one included   Holden Caulfield IS a slacker  he IS completely self absorbed  but so what  I love that he hates phonies  that little things like a kid walking along a curb humming a tune can cheer him up  that he hates to see  F    you  written on things where it can upset a kid  that he likes the natural history museum  that he wears a red hunting cap  I love these things about him  I love that he curses  I don t dislike him because he s sad  or weird  or because he got kicked out of another prep school   I think the bottom line about this book is either you understand a little bit of what Holden is feeling  or you don t  If you don t then he seems like just a pain in the ass  If you do  then you ll always kind of like him and his little observances about the world that stay with you   I love this time honored classic because of its reversal for Holden Caulfield  Salinger crafts the narrator s voice so strongly that it is persuasive and endearing but as time passes  so does my perception of him and his teenage angst psychobabble  I also think that the symbolism is very easy to understand  I will join my voice with the crowd and salute this novel   I found the style of writing was very interesting  I liked the naration style of the protagonist as looking back in his life  I found this gave the reader a feeling that the character is very real  Some people see this as uncreative  The point of was in a mental hospital to be a very creative aspect on Salinger s part  I also liked how he kept on repeating words like phony  depressed  that kills me  and the really I did  I think that these repetitions give the character a realistic feeling  De este libro se ha dicho todo o casi todo  es una referencia literaria constante y popular  favorito de muchos y que al mismo tiempo ha sido prohibido en colegios estadounidenses por vincularse con eventos siniestros de la cultura americana y general  Pero dejando todo esto atras lo que en realidad nos obsequia  El guardian entre el centeno  es un poco de sinceridad  desde el particular punto de vista de Holden Caulfield  un adolescente a la deriva pero genuino e ideal La historia transcurre en Nueva York a principios de los anos 50  Holden Caulfield es un adolescente de 17 anos  quien a veces puede resultar muy infantil  es expulsado del Colegio Pencey  hecho que personalmente no le preocupa demasiado  anteriormente lo han expulsado de otras escuelas  Pero sabe que esto le traera problemas con su padre y su madre  Por lo que decide ir a New York durante un par de dias y en este viaje es donde nos vamos adentrando en el mundo de Holden  Sus inquietudes e impresiones personales sobre el mundo  su familia y amigos  con un discurso muy coloquial  sin reservas y tal como se le viene a la cabeza Esta narrado en primera persona  por lo que vemos New York y sus personajes a traves de sus ojos y juicios  Holden se cree un rebelde porque planea ir contra la corriente  pero esta desorientado y termina siempre en el mismo lugar  Sabe que no es como los demas  no soporta las hipocresias  odia las mentiras y simplemente no parece ser capaz de entender al resto de las personas y como estas funcionan y se relacionan  Quiere convertirse en un personaje totalmente frio  Pero es contradictorio y la mayor parte del tiempo crea planes de futuro que desmonta inmediatamente despues Y es todo este idealismo puro de Holden lo que mantiene vigente el libro  su angustia adolescente por encontrar su espacio vital  Porque a pesar de que fue escrito hace mas de 50 anos  Holden Caulfield es un personaje con quien muchos seguiran identificandose  confundido  molesto  tierno y carinoso  Holden entiende perfectamente cuanto necesitamos encontrar el lugar donde pertenecemos  Fantastico  assolutamente fantastico Definirla una lettura piacevole e decisamente riduttivo Holden e un personaggio incredibile  Non vedo l ora di leggere qualcos altro di Salinger   t thyr khyly zydy rwy mn gdhsht tqrybn hm sn w sl hwldwn bwd khh wn rw khwndm  yh jwryy khwdm rw mthl hwldwn my dydm b I ve read this book three times in my life  First as a teenager  then late twenties  and finally now in my early forties  I find it fascinating how each time I ve come away with a different perspective As a teenager I was all   Semper Fi  motherf cker    It became an anthem  and Holden Caulfield my all time favorite counterculture hero After re reading TCitR in my late twenties I was surprised to find myself annoyed with Holden s antics  He seemed to me just another trust fund brat with a silver spoon in his mouth  Here I sat with babies and bills and not enough hours in the day  and suddenly I wasn t so sympathetic And now this reading  forty years under my belt and not nearly so quick to judge  I find myself loving H C  all over again  I guess I ve got a soft spot for overly sensitive souls who hide behind gruff exteriors  He s loveable to me again Finally  it goes without saying J D  Salinger created something so brilliant    so unique    so timeless    that you d be doing yourself a disservice not reading it  Better yet  pick it up every decade or so and see for yourself how you ve changed  the book is the constant    you re the variable  Happy reading  It s very  very easy to dislike this book  But I do think that a novel should be based on what it means to the reader and not the writer  Holden is a disillusioned brat  but  to me  that s kind of the point of the book  This was a fantastic book to be frank  I have to admit I put off reading it for awhile because I didn t like aspects of Holden s character  I think that s why people don t like this book so much  they focus on what they don t like about Holden  though his faults are pretty large  and not the larger picture  He s very no  crap which is a hate love thing throughout the whole book but the fact that he is is a pretty amazing thing by itself  His love for his sister Phoebe and his trust and willingness to learn from children is another thing  For this book to be completly enjoyed  you must not judge Holden like he seems to do to a lot of other people  it may very well cost you a good read and the comforting feeling of not being alone  Five Stars   The Catcher in the Rye  an account of one very alienated New York teen struggling to find his place in a  crumby    phony  world  is a book that speaks to the jaded and angsty adolescent in all of us  Some might find its subjective  intimate and colloquial style abrasive and its meandering plot tedious  but for those of who have once   and sometimes still   walk in Holden s shoes  there s an odd comfort to be found in his disgruntlement with small  everyday injustices and the sooty and sharp edges of a big city  While a palpable sense of isolation and disillusionment looms over the proceedings like a haze of traffic exhaust  beneath Holden s hard shell of cynicism lies a man child pining for lost innocence  locked in a desperate struggle to preserve his own against the onslaught of age and inevitability  Me and Holden Caulfield seem to be the same person  When I started reading this book  I was immediately drawn to the main character  I felt I was him and that this book paralleled my own life in some ways  A great coming of age novel to read  I suggest you read it especially if you dislike phonies like me and Holden do   J D  Salingers novel The Catcher in the Rye certainly opened my eye about other books with its doubts and emotions that might go through a teenagers mind  Holden Caufield is not one of the most relatable characters I ve ever read about  especially considering the troubled past he s had but failure to understand other people and having difficulties with finding one s place is definitely familiar  The theme of innocence often comes up throughout the novel because Holden s enemy is the adult world and the cruelty and struggles that the adult world really has  The people he admires all represent innocence  He thinks of Jane Gallagher  for example  not as a mature young woman but as the girl with whom he used to play checkers with  He goes out of his way to tell us that he and Jane had no sexual relationship  they usually just held hands  Holden comforted Jane when she was depressed  and it bothers him that Jane may have done sexual acts from her drunken stepfather or from her date  Holden s roommate  Stradlater   Salingers style is in a first person point of view the narrator  Holden Caulfield  is not to reliable in his understanding and reporting of events  Holden s hesitant speech adds uniqueness to his character  Salinger presents him as a realistic teenager  given to detours and profanity typical of a boy his age  Therefore  all of the language of the novel increases thematic concerns as well as characterization  The result is that the reader fully understands Holden and the trauma that he experiences  Being that the book is from a teenagers point of view its makes the book even more unique which is why i liked it a lot  Holden Caulfield is the main character and narrator of the novel  Holden is a sixteen year old junior who has just been expelled for failing his classes at a school called Pencey Prep  I like this character a lot  Just because he is the same age as me i can relate so much more to him  He is extremely judgmental of almost everything and everybody  He criticizes about people who are boring  people who are insecure  and  above all  people who are  phony   Holden carries this liking for passing judgment to such an extreme that it always becomes extremely funny   The Catcher in the Rye shows a teenager s dramatic struggle against death and growing up  I couldn t think of living on my own in a big city  I always wondered how Holden had money to pay for hotels and what not  At some points this story was hilarious because the author makes you imagine a hooker showing up at a teenagers hotel room also this is all happening in between the time periods of 1948 and 1949  The plot is set in the 1940s specifically 1948 and 1949  The novel is narrated by a teenage boy who has failed his classes and is being expelled from his school  After a fight with his roommate  Stradlater  Holden leaves school two days early to explore New York before returning home  interacting with teachers  prostitutes  nuns  an old girlfriend  and his sister along the way   In conclusion is book was truly amazing and any teenager could make connections with what Holden does like judging other people  I recommend this novel to all teens you will probably get a good laugh out of this book  After re reading this book I remembered why I loved it  The character of Holden is so real and honest  His struggle to find his way in what he sees as a phony world reminded me of my own feelings as a teenager  But reading this as an adult  I can also see more  He becomes more and more disturbed by others who seem to always let him down  He can t talk to his parents  He is really very depressed but he doesn t recognize this  The only one who knows him well is his little sister  maybe because she is still just herself  The setting in NYC also seems very real  This is an eye opening book about being a teen in the late 50 s   early 60 s  It could also be read as a view on mental health when society was just beginning to understand more about it  Caution  May contain a spoiler or 2  I loved re reading this book at 45 years of age  after having read it at 20  The difference in perspective of age helped me appreciate it more during my latest reading  At 20  I identified with Holden Caulfield s anger  angst  and solitary teen narrative  having been a malcontent myself in my teens and early 20s  At that time  I felt like a fellow punk kid was confiding in me  as if he recognized in me a kindred spirit   At 45  however  I realized the first person narrative wasn t a trick to give the reader the impression that Holden was confiding in a sympathetic kid his own age  but the casual language and tendency to repeat phrases   It really is    That kills me   indicate that he is actually talking to someone  That person is a psychologist   By the end of the novel  it is clear he is in a sanatorium  but the clues are there from the outset  Having gone through depression  I was able to see  from the other side of that  that throughout his story  and probably before  Holden is suffering from an extreme protracted depressive episode  The crux of his problem is he cannot adjust to adulthood  He cannot stand how horribly people  teens and adults  tend to treat one another   Holden continually refers to his little sister  Phoebe  with much affection  and often seems more relaxed when encountering her and other little kids  He loves their innocent  ingenuous  and naive ways  and their different personalities don t seem to bother him very much  since their innocence tempers these variations   Teens and adults  however  pose a problem for Holden  He hates their quirks  personal habits  meanness  disrespect  greed  vanity  and indecorous ways  It is his mulling over peoples  different traits and what he sees as wrong behaviour  whether he s right or wrong  that is the psychic weight dragging him down  He is fixated on details  too often to his detriment  with his tendency to fixate on what he doesn t like  This monomania over the foibles of others keeps him from enjoying the finer details in his life  He cannot balance the two  though his brief excursions with Phoebe tend to make him forget his depression  at least momentarily   I had mixed feelings about this book when I first read it  then re read it at 30  more of a re cap   as I wasn t sure if it was a good novel or not   Now I know that it is   all time classic  nothing more to say  I m ambivalent about the book  I started reading it with no idea what it s about  I knew it is a classic  so I had pretty high expectations At first I hated it  with it s convoluted writing style and teenager talk  Then I started to get into the rhythm  and felt bored  there was nothing going on  OK  the writer was drawing a very good picture of Holden Caulfield s mind and all  but there was nothing new  nothing I haven t read or heard before  I started comparing the book with Holden s description of his brother Allie s baseball glove  a good description  but ultimately futile  It s just a glove  in the end  It s just the same old story about a teenager trying to figure out life Towards the end I started to enjoy it  I started to hear the writer s voice and find meanings beyond what Holden thought  and realized that all is not lost  there is yet something to get from this book All in all  I can see how this would be considered an iconic book  I can see myself re reading it a couple times and analyzing it and digesting it  I m not going to do it  though  I feel good enough about it  and about crossing it off my to read list  FANTASTIC     Insight into the human psychology on an intimate and subtle level   I would read again  The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite books in the world  and one of just two that I hold at to a higher regard than any other   Incidentally  the second is Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte   The impact that this book had on me was probably so strong due to the time during which I first read it  my freshman year of high school  At fifteen years old  I was the perfect age to empathize with Holden Caulfield  Although I understood that he was deeply disturbed  I didn t find a thing wrong with the way he thought  He struggled to hold onto his youth  which is something that  at fifteen  I was first experiencing  Now  four years later as a college freshman  I have read that novel many times since  Although I have matured a great bit since the beginning of high school  I still understand the desire to hold onto youth  I  along with most of my classmates I m sure  are absolutely terrified to  grow up  graduate  and be forced to go out and fend for ourselves in the real world  What I m trying to say is  despite what some may say about loving The Catcher in the Rye as a teenager  and growing less fond of it as they grow older  I will always have a special place in my heart for this book  I grow with it rather than from it   P S  the date is random except for the year    I quite obviously don t remember the exact date four years ago that I finished this book  except for it was toward the beginning of the school year   I read this book every couple of years because I enjoy that much  The first time I read it in High School I was bored  And couldn t for the life of me understand what all the hype was about but after my nervous breakdown in college suddenly the book took on all new meanings  Salinger captures humor and despair of loneliness a city of millions  with a crisp honesty  For me  the book inspires a feeling that you d get watching the Royal Tananbaums or Bottle Rocket  two of my favorite movies   Holden Caulfield is such an endearing character  that he has become one of my favorite protagonists of all time   As she wrote it  suddenly she realized that what she had written was true     The general consensus of this book ever since this book has been published has been that you either love it or you hate it  Which many people tend to believe is the equivalent of saying that you root for Holden  or you loathe him  I for one  am a major proponent of JD Salinger and have loved Catcher along with his short fiction about the Glass family  However  this sole full length novel is by far the most prolific work of the genius author  and rightfully so in my opinion Although I love this book dearly  I don t love it for the reasons one would suspect  Although I am 16 years old  the age group that Holden symbolizes  I never once could put my self into Caulfield s red hunting hat  In fact  Holden himself isn t the entire reason that this book will forever remain amongst my favorites  What makes this book stand out is Salinger s vivid description of the time period through the eyes of a naive teenager  If this were a third person novel  we have to wonder if this work would remain as poignant and earn its place amongst some of the great Bildungsroman novels of classic literature  Everything from Holden talking about the football game at Pencey Prep  the museum  the carousel  and even the skating rink just gives the novel that sanguine feeling of the time period  I did  however  find Holden s antics to be absolutely hilarious and his wit to be top notch even though I found his coping methods of problems to be deplorable Growing up in a time where it s commonplace for teenagers to drink  do drugs  and have sex  you d swear that all my peers base their lives off of Holden Caulfield s  The sad thing is that most of them would think catcher in the rye is about a baseball player hanging out on a farm  Holden is docile compared to kids these days  sounds strange coming from a teenager   Yet  there s something about Holden that makes him stand out as being among the greats of literature and I will never quite understand it  As much as I despise his behavior and incessant whining  I love him and I love that book   gonna read it again for motivational purposes Alright either you agree with everything that Holden says or you don t  If you don t then I applaud you and you are properly going to get far in life  For those of us that understand the struggle that Holden is facing  completely get the book  I agree with everything that Holden has said  I am losing my own battle with myself  I am a hypocrite and I try not to be  I do see the faults in others and I do rarely correct my mistakes  Holden is just a confused man that doesn t know what comes next  Holden is an inspiration to all of us that have felt confused  If you didn t like the book I am sorry  but maybe you are better off than understanding   geeenial   Dann  nach den Rockettes  kam ein Typ im Smoking und auf Rollschuhen  der fuhr unter einem Haufen kleiner Tische hindurch und erzahlte dabei Witze  Er war ein sehr guter Rollschuhlaufer und so  aber es machte mir keinen Spass  weil ich mir immerzu vorstellte  wie er ubte  ein Typ zu sein  der auf der Buhne Rollschuh lauft  Jedenfalls stelle ich mir dabei immer lauter kleine Kinder vor  die in einem grossen Roggenfeld spielen und so  Tausende von kleinen Kindern  un dniemand ist da   also  kein Grosser    nur ich  Und ich stehe am Rand eines verruckten Abgrunds  Und da muss ich alle fangen  bevor sie in den Abgrund fallen  also  wenn sie rennen und nicht aufpassen  wo sie hinlaufen  dann muss ich irgendwo rauskommen und sie fangen  Und das wurde ich den ganzen Tag lang machen  Ich war einfach der Fanger im Roggen und so  Ich weiss  es ist verruckt  aber das ist das Einzige  das ich richtig gern ware  Ich weiss  es ist verruckt   First of all  I love Holden Caulfield  Gosh  I really think that he s just the sweetest  I read this book on my early twenties  not when I was a teenager  full with anger just like Holden  one thing I regretted so much  why I didn t read this book earlier  because I also have a slight phase in my life when I was a frustrated teenager seeing phonies everywhere  Even when I was in college  I still saw phonies everywhere  even clearer  I guess the older you are  the more you realize that you just have to deal with all the phony people in life just to keep being on what they called normal society track  But the thing is  this book s not all about Holden being cynical  rebellious  or ignorant  but him being so care about even the littlest thing that people could care about  That s what made me fell with him on the first place  And I love that when he was asked about what he d like to be if he had the goddam choice  he said he wanted to be the catcher in the rye  He simply wanted to save kids from falling into painful process of being an adult  I love the way everything in this book s described  I love all the edgy slang used  It s one helluva book  Oh wow  This book is amazing  Simple but amazing  WOW Definitely one of the best satires I ve ever read besides Catch 22 and Gulliver s Travels  It is a combination of satire  humor  drama and adventure  You ll be hooked with the  hero  of the story  one Holden Caulfield  a somewhat disturbed teenager who seemed to lose interest in life  inc  school and hopes for future life  His only consolation was his kid sister  whom he worshiped very much  His story drowned you into what it felt like when you got the feeling of being alienated from the world I totally love the fact that this book gave me such a good time  Laughing my  ss off reading of what Holden said and thought  I have at least one similarity with him  i e  hate for phony things and people I also like the language used in this book  Not the fancy words you find in lots of novel  but just daily stuffs  y know One interesting fact   Thirty years after its first publication in 1951  The Catcher in the Rye was both the most banned book in United States as well as the second most taught book in public schools    I m 15  a girl who s not typical but not to mysterious  Depression is a fetish and mental illness is a big 4 thumbs up  the Catcher in the Rye is a complete catch for teens coming of age  The depressing cold life of a 16 year old alcoholic dropout is relatable to all types of teens  Holden Caulfield faces isolation  grief  and the loss of innocence  The popular  the ordinaries  the misfits  the outcast  the athletes and even the inbetweeners can all relate one way or another  Yeah  it s frustrating and annoying at first to hear a depressing teen bitch about everything  but  at the end the books resolution is totally worth the putting up with  Holden is like a little cable show  he might not have a budget or marketing but he is interesting and getting in with the right peeps  People that get him and care what he thinks  Yeah not everyone is going to stay around to get to the end   The ultimate literary faux pas  a pleasant  screw you  to the conformists  This book dared to defy the society of its time  showing just how hypocritical rest of them were This book was so good that Salinger didn t write another book in his lifetime  That he became a reclusive retard is beside the point   My all time favorite book  It is nice to keep re reading this one  I learn always something   An other book about growing up  findng yourself and the  relationship between the society and you   So much love for this book  really  go read it   I heard this book recommended by my idol so after hearing a little about the content  I decided to read it   I cannot live without this book As a teen  I can relate to how Holden feels and what he experiences over the short period of time the book is set over  It is probably one of my two favourite books of all time and I cannot recommend this enough to anybody  Some people have rated this book low and claimed that it s just a short piece about a whiny teenager that doesn t really DO anything    If you read into it  you ll soon discover that Holden has a lot going on  especially if you look on the Wiki page and read a little into the backstory  and I m sure you ll fall in love with it just as much as I do if you give it a chance   Highly recommended to teens and just about anyone  There is no way around the fact that this book is about teen angst  It follows the days leading from fifteen year old  Holden Caulfield s expulsion from school to his expected Christmas break  trying to avoid his family and inevitable confrontation  Told from first person perspective  this book is steeped in the culture it was written in  colloquially written for a rather cynical view of the 1950 s  but still just as relevant today is it was the day it was written  The action is nothing to write home about  the story is mostly about life  and how  regardless of how many idiotic things we do  it still keeps going  Holden is at once an unreliable  antiheroic  oddly tragic and perfectly charming narrator  and his wanderings through a snowy New York City are by turns very funny  sad  and immensely insightful with regards to human nature This is an interesting book to read multiple times  due to the character of Holden himself  He is complex and it is interesting to view his mindset  as it were  from different vantage points  Many people find themselves agreeing with him upon a first read  only to discover  years later  they pity him  but for any person  they will find their thoughts  past or present  echoed in this quiet  funny  sad  and terribly wonderful book   Prima di leggere questa nuova traduzione ho riletto la vecchia  e questo e il mio verdetto  trovo la traduzione precedente  quella della Motti  molto piu affascinante  con un linguaggio particolare che nella mia fantasia e diventato il linguaggio  alla Holden   La nuova traduzione non toglie niente al personaggio  anzi  Holden e sempre Holden  ma penso che tutti coloro che hanno fatto la sua conoscenza nella vecchia edizione  difficilmente potranno preferire quella appena uscita  Certo  il racconto di Holden e talmente immersivo e coinvolgente che ci vuole un bel po  di concentrazione per notare le differenze fra i due testi  ma mi son mancati tutti quei  vattelapesca  e  compagnia bella   Son piccolezze  ma il mio Holden le dice in continuazione  one of my favourite book The writing of JD Salinger flows like we are having a conversation Holden Caulfield hates phony people and wonders about things like where would ducks at central park go at winter  his insane but genuine thinking of things  his search for answers and struggles with confusing times of being young is presented in a absolutely brilliant way  This book was awesome  I really enjoyed viewing the world via the eyes of Holden Caulfield  Although gloomy  depressed  and having slightly more reared sad thought  Holden is a great character to represent all teenagers lost in an in between world of adulthood and being a child  Holden  unadmittingly  is obviously confused as to if he wants to grow up or stay in the realms of childlike activity  Although Holden runs away  Salinger is being very significant throughout the book  For example running away from his boarding school Pencey to go to the city signifies that he wants to leave the safe cages of education and childhood to go to the city where he meets Sunny  a very young prostitute  and goes to a night club  Holden has many epiphanies and realizes that he must run away and hide from everyone on the safe of earth West  His lost younger brother is his idol and it seems that he does not want to leave him or his memories of him to grow up and leave it all behind  so he might want to  run away  or go  west  to be with people who never escaped childhood  Holden rather be dead and still in his perfect brother than be in a world of misery as he sees in the city    I LOVE THIS BOOK  I read this book because I had heard it had been associated with the shootings of Ronald Regan and John Lennon and I was just so curious  I wanted to know what could be possible themes that would be related or whether I would think the connection was just a fluke  All I can conclude is that the main character is angry  isolated  and pretty disgusted with humanity  My favorite quotations  At one point the main character asks a cab driver about how fish survive in a lagoon in Central Park in winter  The cab driver says   Listen  if you was a fish  Mother Nature d take care of you  wouldn t she  Right  You don t think them fish just die when it gets to be winter  do ya      Holden Caufield responds  no  but     and the cab driver says   You re goddamn right they don t   and drives off  In the end of the book  a wiser man says   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   Absolutely loved this book The Catcher in the Rye follows a young man named Holden who is having trouble in school  Holden has dropped out of many different schools and has just gotten kicked out of Pencey  a very high quality school in New York  Readers experience Holden Caulfields journey to adulthood and his struggle with mental issues and problems coming to terms with his family and his life  I would recommend this book to older readers because it has suggestive thenes and very explicit language  I did not think that the reading level was terribly high though  Other than the bad language  I thoroughly enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye   This is perhaps the most honest  the most genuine book I ve ever read  When I started reading it  I immediately thought about how I d missed my chance  how I should have read it earlier  in my mid to late teens  not in my early twenties  The age difference isn t that great  but the mind framework is  But  then I realised that  like so many readers before me  and  doubtless  like so many in the future   I d fallen into Holden s trap  Everything he d said resonated deeply inside of me and it was so vivid  so strong and so clear that it almost scared me  I guess it wouldn t have scared me so much had I read it earlier  but  here I am   a twenty two year old  reading The Catcher in the Rye and understanding it so deeply it almost hurt  I should have developed a more mature attitude by now  I should be able to read a novel like this  smile condescendingly at it and scoff something like  Kids      but instead it feels like I ve written every single sentence in the book There are very few books out there that I ve read and that have left me feeling so confused and scared for my own life and my own future  Holden is intrigued by the world of the adults  he is frightened by it  he resists it  He has built a wall of cynicism around himself and the only thing capable of drawing him out of his fortress is a sense of harrowing loneliness he carries within  His notions of childhood and adulthood may be overly simplified  but at least he acknowledges the difference between the two  the gaping pit that is never easy to cross  The way he talks  the way he thinks  the way he dresses  everything is designed to shape him as a non conforming individual  one that has seen through the  phoniness  of the world and has successfully managed to avoid it  But  it is a lie  a form of self delusion  one that very few people remain innocent of For Holden  it is his red hunting hat that he uses to stand out  For me  it is talking to myself in public on purpose  or wearing socks that don t match or starring at the sky too long or walking as slowly as I can in the pouring rain  while everyone around me is rushing to get away from it  I m starting to think that this book couldn t have come in a better time for me  I m afraid of the world  I m afraid of growing up and fighting for my future  I m afraid of carving out a future and then realising that it is not as extraordinary or magical as I had imagined it to be  This quarter life crisis I m having is never far from my mind  my decisions and my actions  I feel like there is a straight line between my legs  a line separating adulthood from childhood  and I have one leg on either side of it  To put it simply  as Ben Braddock would say   I guess I m a little worried about my future  I want it to be   different  I almost fell out of my chair just now  after realising a few things that are too precise to be categorised as coincidences  The irony keeps striking  Where am I  I am not at home  I am writing this in my mother s cabin in the woods  far up in the mountains  with no neighbours around for kilometres and kilometres  Instead of being home  studying  working  going to college and hanging out with friends  I ve come up here alone  in the middle of November  to a cold house where  no matter how many logs I shove into the fireplace  the house can never be too warm and cosy and I m wearing double pants  double shirts  three pairs of socks  that don t match  and two sweaters  Talk about isolation  Holden Caulfield isolated himself emotionally and  in some cases  even physically  but for me  even that wasn t enough  No  I had completely adopted these youthful fatalistic ideas and taken them to the next level  I could get snowed in  I could run out of firewood  I could become a victim of some malevolent passerby  I ve isolated myself completely  no phone  no internet  no neighbours  with only dormice to keep me company in a cold cabin in the woods and all for what  Believe me or not  even I hadn t realised why before reading this novel  But  now  it seems like the answer is jumping out from the pages in fluorescent colours  I  Don t  Want  To  Grow  Up  I m not ashamed to admit it  I m afraid of growing up  So  instead of being in my warm flat with my family and friends  going on dates and parties and attending college  I ve run up to the mountains and isolated myself  The irony is so strong I feel like I m about to cry Never before has any realisation struck me so strongly  I suppose that Holden s decision to stay where he is signifies some sort of a breakthrough  He has progressed from a selfish little bastard we all love to someone who is capable of putting somebody else s needs before his own  That s growing up  right  I don t know  What does it even mean  being an adult  There are so many rites of passage nowadays  with new ones being invented every day by shrinks  Most of us dream of achieving some sort of a goal  one that will  inevitably  require growing up  sooner or later  I feel like I m always digging my heels into the ground beneath me  trying to  if not stop  then at least slow down the passing of time  desperately clinging onto the ideals of childhood  Not a pretty quality in a twenty two year old  I know  but it is what it is I can still vividly remember something a friend of mine has said to me more than three years ago  It was the last time I ve seen her in person since  The next day  she moved away to another country  We were sitting by the river  talking about life and things in general and  among other things  about growing up and moving on  I ve always felt like a late bloomer  trying to postpone the inevitable  holding on to childhood  mostly though juvenile behaviour  I foolishly thought that if I didn t acknowledge or say out loud that my friend was leaving  then it wouldn t be true  As if  She could see that I was having a hard time and that her moving away was  in a way  tougher on me than it was on her  So she told me that she thought that being  a successful grown up  meant keeping as much of our childhood in us as possible  That as long as you re able to laugh in dire situations and admire the beauty of trivialities  you ve got nothing to worry about  And  I guess I agree with her definition  I ve always felt like I was missing on something or being late for something  because one of my legs always remained on the other side of that imaginary line  the one separating childhood from adulthood  But  now  after reading this book and delving into some serious thinking  I think that I kind of like it that way  I like being stuck  with one leg on each side of the line  I m slowly beginning to realise that this is one bridge I don t have to cross  I don t know what the future holds for Holden  or thousands of other Holdens out there  but I like being here  with that line between my feet  taking the best of both worlds  Just great There s not much going on  What I mean is the real plot is really simple and short The whole book is made up of Holden s memories and impressions and opinions and thoughts  indeed  That s what makes you empathize with him What s magnificent is the way you really get to know Holden  You can t help but become his friend I m not sure what critic says about the book but here s the way I see it I ve come to consider Holden a special individual  He s not like everyone he meets and has met He does deal with society and people  He does get in touch with a grown up world  But he doesn t belong there  he never will Everyone has tried to push him towards the world of adulthood  but he has resisted or hasn t been accepted eventually  when he tries to do the things grown ups do such as drinking booze or having sex with hookers  he fails  During his whole travel and the whole book he s also off to the world of childhood  he wants to go visit Phoebe   but at the very moment he sees it  he realizes that s not where he belongs any longer At the end of the book  he doesn t join  Old Phoebe  on the carrousel  but doesn t join the adults trying not to get wet in the rain Holden is an observer  He sees there are these two worlds  adulthood and childhood  he just stays in between In fact  he does get wet in the rain  He wants to live the world  He want to live life  He wants to feel it He interacts with these two world  but he never becomes a part of them  not for good He glimpses at it all from afar He is wiser than all the people he meets  even though he has flaws too He has a major awareness of things  Sometimes he tries to influence other people with his unique point of view  He tries to save them from their dreary lives  He s the catcher in the rye  Even so  he cannot seem to get any response from the people he interacts with  At first  I thought there was also a pessimistic side in The catcher in the rye  for Holden won t achieve his dream to get away and so on But now I have reconsidered my opinion  Just because he cannot go to the West or whatever  it doesn t mean he s going to lose what s special and unique in him He ll probably have to live inside society  but he ll never be a part of it  An all time favorite   It s one of those books that I come back to and re read every now and again  This is really a timeless book  contrary to what some may believe i don t think you have to necessarily see yourself as Holden to enjoy this book  There s a bit of him in all of us  I think  I especially read while going through a kind if quarter life crisis which again made this book even more special for me  I had to read this for my sophomore year class in HS  I had no idea what to expect as i had never heard of it before  but man I LOVED IT  There is a lot of debate surrounding Holden s character  and I know some people think the story is  boring   but I never felt bored while reading  and I think Holden  whether a spoiled brat OR an emotionally messed up kid  is so raw and honest in the way he sees life  Everything about this book is great in my opinion  I haven t read it in a few years but I think I will soon   Bu kitabi da cozumlemesini yapmayacak kadar seviyorum  Ozgun  One of the most spell binding books I have ever read  Taking a subject that everyone can relate to  the teenage years of uncertainty  angst and rebelliousness  Salinger draws a incredibly vivid picture by describing a few event filled days in the life of the teenage protagonist  Holden Caulfield  The writing is sharp and brilliant I suspect that adult readers and teenage readers may interpret the book differently  The younger you are  the more idealistic you are  You are less compromising and more disposed to make rash judgments  Idealism co exists with cynicism and self righteousness  All these traits exist in Caulfield s behavior and  if that is what you are looking for  he is your hero  But if you are an older person  you have made your peace with the real world   less idealism  more pragmatism  You empathize with the tortured soul of Caulfield  but you want him to come to terms with reality  a redemption that the novel only partly bestows upon him The mental journey that the book takes you on is strange  At times  you feel exhilarated  Sometimes  you are saddened and left shaking your head  You wait for a conventional end  but it is not forthcoming  The first time I  read  this book in high school  I was pretty committed to not liking it due to all the hype  I skimmed it mostly  just picking up a couple points so I could pull them out during class discussion This second reading  however  was much different  Holden truly is unlike any other character I ve encountered in literature  His way of thinking and relating to the world around him is uniquely tragic  He s funny  too  probably without meaning to be  He tends towards hyperbole and his usage of  goddamn  is nothing short of poetic He s a kid who s gone through too much and feels more deeply than everyone around him  He can only relate to children  like his little sister Phoebe  or his younger brother Allie who died before he could get  phony   Every day injustices cause him existential sorrow  Even when I was giggling at his turn of phrase or occasional melodrama  I could feel his terrible struggle to fit into the world and the pain it caused him What really gets me about this novel is what is left unsaid  The  perverted  stuff that happens with Mr  Antolini and how that s happened to him  about twenty times since  he  was a kid   The classmate who  falls  out a window at one of his boarding schools  How Phoebe is maybe a bit too affectionate  Jane Gallagher The mark of a great story is one that you can get something new out of every time  This is that sort of story  mrwz bry br dwm khwndmsh br wl wqty bwd kh tzh wrd dnshgh

book is my favorite one atm because is the best I have found when both are put together  not that I rate any of them the best all alone though First what it tells At simple sight this may seem a simple book  but If you care to think about it you will find it deals with a lot of major topics in a very short amount of pages and at the same time  and this is the most difficult imo  it doesn t it make it feel like a brick or a wall like lots of other writers would  you can actually enjoy the reading  with is after all filled with jokes and irony and really feels  for me at least  totally like I could be living it  But in the end this book is just like one more chapter of lifeI won t go into details of why it does touch this topic like this and what is so great about it  there is a lot written about it already and who really knows what did Salinger intend to do anywayAlso there is all this stuff about the book actually being a message about WW2  I do think there are a lot of references about it  and some topics are heavily influenced by it  but I don t think the whole book is about it  Anyway I don t know what the hell did he intend to do  but I know I do enjoy reading thisSecond how is told This is one of the best books for me because I always feel like reading it again and when I do I really enjoy each chapter  Nor hard to read  nor boring to read  nor without a point  that is how I see it  And this one nails it for meI like the way Holden thinks  but not the way he sometimes acts like a  rebel   but I can understand it and still enjoy it because I have acted the same way  and I have to admit sometimes I still feel like it and you may say I do act kinda alikeAlso there is a pessimist feel over most of it  which I think helps to immerse in the story and feel the contrasts better  I don t have a problem with it and I actually may like it unconsciously  After all I prefer something realist over a phoney happy storyAlso I love the end  simple love it  The little sister felt so moe in the end and I was so into it I felt like crying  For me the way he changes his choice and thinks about the scribbles is a well done example of leaving childhood and becoming and adult   Then the carousel started  and I watched her go round and round   All the kids tried to grap for the gold ring  and so was old Phoebe  and I was sort of afraid she s fall off the goddam horse  but I didn t say or do anything  The thing with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it is bad to say anything to them   Here s the thing  Is Holden a rich white boy who is annoying and whiny and generally awful  Yes  But the thing that makes Catcher universal is the experience of growing up and that s something everyone can relate to  I ve been teaching this book for a few years  and ss someone who spend her days with kids and watches them enter what is really the last year of their childhood  I see how relatable Holden s can be  I can also see how off putting and terrible he is  Yeah  I mean everyone is phony  I mean not all of them  but yeah  most of them are  They do things they wouldn t need to do  they say stuffs they are not supposed to say and discuss  they think that you are their best buddies and all  But  the truth is they are all phony  Wish I could be as Holden and just get the hell out of it  People are phony  jerk bastards in the workplace showing themselves off  always selling them out  People in the group are always acting like they are the leader  It just sort of screws you up and down if you are Holden Caulfield  Heck yes  I am an introvert and I am proud of it  I enjoy myself being an introvert  I don t like phony snobs and sometimes I do HATE them deeply  But I also know that I live in a world where I have to survive  So  I sort of manage doing it and that makes me phony  Even if I want to go right and lash at it  I can t and the fact is there I don t have the guts to lash it just like Holden didn t have guts to clear the  Fuck you  writing in school  But he tried  same way I try  not so vehemently but I do try  Guess  do I feel like a little string pulling me and Holden alike  in the same side of the street  I would like to  You get the point right  I don t want to go into much deeper detail  It doesn t matter anyway  If you have time not to be a phony and not to go with the ludicrous tide  go give this a read  You wouldn t want to be a phony again  Yeah  being immature and introvert is much better than talking with boys who think they are the biggest hot shots and girls with show off makeup and hushed phony tone on phone while they are talking  I greatly enjoyed the book  Being a sixteen year old at a prep school I can in some ways relate to Holden s character  He encounters many different things in one night  Things most teens never have to deal with  which makes him an even more interesting character as the book goes on  The character that is Holden is a very trapped in many scenarios  When I say this I mean to say that he constantly finds himself alienated and excluded  He uses this to his advantage and disadvantage  in some ways he uses it a defense technique or mechanism that way he can never be let down  Different characters throughout the book are drawn to him  he sees this and for whatever reason he pushes these people away  It was especially entertaining and interesting to see how he handles his situations  It was a tremendous read and really made me think  I would suggest this book to my friends if they asked   So far am enjoying the Catcher in the Rye  Even though it was banned a while ago  I enjoy the point of view of Holden Caufield  THe part that is most interesting is how Holden can be so heartless at times  and at others so heart ful  This is a book revolving around the eyes of Holden  THe beginning is interesting because it jumps right into the story line with almost no introduction  It starts off on Holden s last week of school because he is flunking out and he will be returning home for good on Christmas vacation  Holden was known for flunking out of school s  Since he hasn t told his parents yet he plans to leave early and have a vacation by himself in New York City  The Book the catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger is 214 pages long and was published by little brown and company When i first saw the tittle of the book it actually did spark interest in me because i really didn t know what it ment so it made me want to discover what  The catcher in the Rye  meant Also the picture at the front of the book interested me because i wondered what kind of connection a horse had to do with the title  Now that i have finished the book i realized the tittle of the book holds the entire meaning of the novel and that the horse at the front of the picture had a meaning also The catcher in the Rye is a fiction novel that uses real life and exhibits some aspects of reality People that like to read non fiction novels or fiction would like to read this book for the novel contains some reality in it  I usually like to read these kind of books because I enjoy a lot of fiction novels that contain a some reality I enjoy these type of stories because they allow me to interact with the authors thinking and allows me to study my own individual understanding as a human In the Catcher in the Rye the top two characters are Holden Caufield and Phoebe Caufield  Holden Caufield is important because he is the main character of the book Holden Caulfield is a teenager growing up in 1950s New York he has issues interacting with adults he believes that the world he lives in is fake and decides to live in his own childhood memories Moreover Phoebe Caufield is Holden s 10 year old sister Whom understands Holden much more than any other person does Holdern loves Phoebe and is his only source of happines Also phoebe is a character with great maturity  The Catcher in the Rye is a novel of a young teenage boy named holden Caufield Holden has issues interacting with adults and usually lives in his own world since he thinks that the world that surrounds him is  phony   His struggle to make interactions with adults is u hard for Holden and he feels that no one understands him after the death of his younger brother Allie Holden is tormented by his death and believes that no one else will be caring and friendly to him as Allie was The only person that understands Holden is his younger sister Phoebe she always listens to him and tries to convince Holden out his immature thoughts Through his conversation with phoebe Holden is able to understand his self as a person Therefore two major themes in this novel are maturity and loneliness Maturity is a major theme in this novel because Holden has issues realising the real world but instead of being mature her decides to stay in his own little world where everything is nice and easy for him since he is too scared to confront the real world In chapter 9 holden states that   sex is something i just don t understand  I swear to god i don t  Loneliness is also a major theme in the novel since Holden has trouble interacting with adults in his life and usually keeps his problems to his self to protect himself from the world I have to be honest that i really liked and enjoyed this book because i was able to interact with the characters attitudes and feelings I would definitely recommend this book to a friend because im sure they will enjoy it like i did The reason why i think I really enjoyed this book was that i was able to connect to my life for i can agree my life has been somewhat like Holden s  This was a completely different book for me as an adult vs  when i read it as a kid  THIS BOOK  This freaking book  With all of the author s colloquialisms  his tendencies to drag on a bit  and the way that he constantly voices the character s thoughts is absolutely wonderful  I know it doesn t appeal to everybody  but the persona that shines through the main character creates the same amount of lucrative lies as I do  The books commentary on what it s like to fall out of the educational system is one that has absolutely inspired me  I would recommend this for any inner city teacher desperate to get their kids to read or even be slightly interested in school  The main character s story can be applied to so many angsty teenage issues  so I would recommend this to everyone  So many people have given this book a bad review  Well  here is an honest one    You can read this book and either be blown away or it falls short of expectations  I have personally grown up hearing such amazing things about this book and the first time I skimmed through it I fell less than impressed  Actually  I barely got through the first 50 pages before practically burying it under a pile of dirty clothes so I wouldn t have to look at it until the next week Going into sophomore year in high school I had to read this book again  Some years had passed and I personally gave the book a second chance  not something that I do very often  And  keeping with an open mind  I found the book to be exceptionally enjoyable  Although I do not appreciate all of the cursing  this book is totally relatable  And being on the other side of the reviews once  I realize how this book can be difficult for a person if they are too young to appreciate its meaning Holden Caulfield can t find anything to like  nothing is quite right in his mind  Only the young and the innocent who are oblivious to the worldly issues around themselves are the closet thing to perfect  All Holden wants to do is to stay in school until Christmas break  But too many bad grades send him packing for his home in New York City where he rents a hotel room and spends the remainder of his walking money on sodas  women  and his younger sister  Phoebe  But in a world where so many things are tainted in Holden s mind  is there a place for him to find his own inner piece  Or will the infamous Holden Caulfield live out the remainder of his life trying to find the happy medium that may never exist A book full of adventure  life lessons  and a sprinkle of stupidity  J D Salinger has brought to the world a novel that we must embrace and in doing so  find our own inner happy medium where we learned that perfect may just not exist  It is one of those books which you either hate or love  I found myself to enjoy this book so very much  Holden  the teenage boy in the book is someone who hates hypocrites and tries to stay as far away from them as possible  Although I do not completely like the role of Holden as I found myself disliking him from time to time  I get why he did all those things that he did  I might say that I went through the same phase as Holden did in my teenage days  or even now at times  You cannot find anything extraordinary about the book  atleast I didn t  It s just a normal book about a normal boy and about all the stuff he did when he seemed lost in his life   The Catcher in the Rye is a truly marvelous novel by JD Salinger that to me reverberated teenage angst and feelings of alienation as main themes throughout the novel  The Catcher in the Rye is not a happy book by any stretch of the imagination  It is particularly despairing right from the start of the book  in fact  Holden is expelled from Pencey Prep because of his inability to  apply himself   One can sense feelings of teenage depression and rebellion within Holden  as he is perfectly capable of applying himself  yet he chooses not to for some eclectic reason  This becomes a standard characterization for Holden throughout the novel  as he often tends to put the blame for his problems on other people  He himself is never at fault  in his mind  He constantly deflects feelings of failiure off on the indiscretions that society holds  He consistently labels people  especially adults for that matter  as  phonies   Any success in the society which he lives in  the piano player from which Greenwich Village  Ernie  the football players of Pencey prep  even his own brother who writes a children s book called the  Secret Goldfish  and strikes it big in Hollywood    he tends to label as culpable acts of trying too much to conform with normalities  Therefore  this novel to me at least  is not just an examintaion of an outsider looking within  We all experience feelings of alienation and degradation throughout our lives  To me  it is a psychologic examination of how humans cope with the feelings that arise from this  depression  sadness  anger  loneliness   The  teenage angst  theme of the book is the result merely of the age of Holden  Teenagers and young adults in general are the perfect culprits of experiencing these feelings of alienation  so it was only logical for Salinger to pick a young  rebellious youth at the crux of his sociological break down  Young adults in particular experience these feelings as we are turning from kids to adults  It is indeed a natural maturization process for teenagers to feel confused by the ever approaching magnitude of the adult world  Holden s actions throughout the novel  failing his classes  accepting a prostitute into his room and only wishing to talk with her  the fight with Maurice  are all an acute examination on the sociological stature that young adults have from their transformation from kid to adult  Holden holds an ideological  almost child like innocence about the world  yet through his experiences he becomes more aware of the cynicism and hyprocisy that is around every corner  These feelings intensify  up until the very last chapter  where Salinger wraps up the book in a beautiful way  Though some feel the ending of this book is lackluster  I believe it is a perfect ending  not overdramatized for the sake of overdramatization  It leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction and keen relflectiveness Numerous other themes are discussed in this novel  Holden s encounter with the nuns reflect his desparity of money and the false hope that religion gives  his interaction with the various girls throughout the novel are reflective of the ever dynamic balance growing boys and girls give each other  his dislike of Hollywood and actors in general show how he believes pop culture ruins the simpicity and innocence of a pristine society  ect  There are indeed countless themes to be discussed in this novel  if the reader looks hard enough and reads in between the lines  For me  the book was an enjoyable adventure that made me think deeply about myself as a person and as a growing teen   There are a few books that transforms one if we read them at the right time  catcher in the rye  or rabbit run for the other 80   is one of them  along with the stories and his other two collections of stories about the glass family  Seymour  franny  Zooey  It s written for the youngest child of any family  the one that is just a bit too sensitive  a bit too different to ever feel quite at home  This book is about a boy named Holden  He gets kicked out of school and starts to chill out all over new york city  He faces alot of adventures and adversity while he is just wondering around the city  This book reminds me of Rule of Bone because both boys in each book where troubled children and always got in trouble  That is why I think the connect  I rated this book 5 stars because i really liked it  I recomend this book to anyone who likes adventure books   Neyse  D B  nin

masumiyette bulmak  Great book about growing up and the struggles that teenagers face in the transition to adulthood The book was also very entertaining   humorous at some points  and compelling at others  Being a teenager myself  I could totally relate to some of the issues addressed Salinger is an absolute genius  and the structure and form of this book is particularly interesting  and the voice of Holden Caulfied sounds so real that you couldn t stop reading it This book gives a great insight into the human nature and it is a definite must read    Certe cose dovrebbero restare come sono  Dovreste poterle mettere in una di quelle grandi bacheche di vetro e lasciarcele  So che e impossibile ma e un gran peccato lo stesso   Volevo leggere questo libro da secoli e  finalmente  ci sono riuscita  Che dire  Sono felice e soddisfatta di averlo letto Ognuno di noi  dentro di se  ha un Holden  Piu o meno nascosto  lui c e o c e stato  E va bene che spesso risultata essere un po  insopportabile  ma anche questo l ho trovato normalissimo  Chi  ogni tanto  non lo e  Certi suoi pensieri o atteggiamenti  li abbiamo avuti e fatti tutti  almeno una volta  a mio parere  Ps  Credo proprio di aver deciso che libro presentare per l interrogazione di inglese  si  Throughout the book The Catcher in the Rye  teens see how one teen goes through hell and how Holden is not the person he wanted to be  He needed to grow up  Some teens might get something good out of reading this book  They will see the struggle and understand how hard life can actually be  When I was reading this book at first I didn t really understand it and I couldn t really compare my life to the main character  I thought it was boring and that it was a waste of my time reading a book I knew I wouldn t finish and a book that I didn t recommend reading  Even though it was a struggle reading the book I had seen the life a teenager had lived and how they seen life and what all they went through to get where they ended up  I had seen the struggle and the way life could have been  I had thought to myself  That could be me   I had also thought to myself I m actually getting something out of this book I think teachers should teach this book to their students because honestly even though it might seem like a boring book and how it could be a waste of the students time but it s a really good book to learn something from  I never thought that I would like this book but when my teacher explained it to me  I started to see the truth behind this book  Students reading this book and them getting taught this book will be good for them  Holden s life can be compared to their life s and maybe they will understand it and see it like I did    The catcher in the rye  is a monologue of Holden Caulfield  a young boy in his adolescent years  Unlike any typical literary work it is written in spoken English which makes you fall deeper into the abyss of thoughts of the protagonist Holden seems to possess quite an enigmatic personality  he has a knack of being getting expelled from schools and the novel begins with him being getting axed from his current school  After his expulsion he decides to live off some of his days alone in the hotels and streets of New York till the news of his expulsion reaches his home  The book revolves around his experiences of these lonesome days in New York J D  Salinger has portrayed Holden as a young teenager struggling with the dilemma of preserving the innocence of his childhood  because all he sees in adults is lies and hypocrisy  Though coming from a wealthy family  materialism does not interests him  he seeks purity and honesty in a person   of which he now finds even himself lacking  adding to his fury and depression  Lost in the maze of such desolated thoughts  he alienates himself from the outside world and begins to loathe the society which takes him closer to the abyss of misanthropy  But even though Holden s character seems to be ill disposed sometimes  his love for his little sister and his deceased brother underlines the fact that somewhere underneath all the loathing and hate  was buried his kind and affectionate heart for the pure and the innocent  With The Catcher in the Rye  Salinger has certainly produced one of the best bildungsroman novels of English literature   In Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger  Holden Caulfield is a sixteen year old boy growing up in the 1950 s and is the epitome of pure teenage angst  Sent from one boarding school to another  Caulfield struggles to find his place in this world  In the process of said struggle  he concludes numerous times in the book that he simply hates the world and the people within it  A factor of this book that strikes me as interesting is the repetition of the word  phonies   Holden describes many people in the book as phonies  I believe he calls people that  because as he grows up he finds out that people always wore a mask of pleasance when it came to communicating with children  Since Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age story  one can see that Holden finally crosses the gap between childhood and adulthood and finds out what people truly look like under their pleasant  phony masks  All in all  I felt that the repetition of the word phonies was a very effective move on JD Salinger s part  because each time he utilizes the word  it feels like yet another stab in the reader s back as he she realizes that yet another person wields a mask of artificial pleasance  I recommend this book to anybody who is willing to read it  However  if I had to pick a specific demographic of people to read this book  I would pick freshmen or sophomores in high school  The reason why I would pick that certain age group is because I feel like they would be the age group which would be the most able to relate and empathize with Holden s challenges as he finds out what the adult world looks like  In my opinion  this book clearly defines the challenges that every teenager undergoes as they see the world for what it really is  Although Holden takes a very negative view on the adult world  negativity is the optimal way of connecting with teenagers  I say this  because as a teenager I know there are times when negativity overcomes my other emotions and I feel angry about everything  A particular quote that really stood out to me was when Holden says  People never notice anything   This quote stood out to me  because it s truly how I feel sometimes  When I turn on the news and find reports about petty things that cover up the real problems in our world  that is when I truly feel that people never notice anything  If I needed to modify it  I would say that people willingly never notice anything    I finished this book quite fast  It s the kind of book that keeps you reading  suddenly you ve read 20 pages without noticing you read so much  but you don t have to keep reading  like with page turners  I really liked this book  I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower before this one and I noticed a lot of similarities  Since The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my favorite books  I loved this one too I think Holden was quite a difficult character to figure out  At first he seemed really mean to me  I didn t like him to be honest  But after a while I really started caring for him and I was able to relate to him in a way I surely did not expect  He reminded me a lot of myself  but at the same time we were complete opposites  That was very strange and new to me and I think it made me like the book more  I sort of liked the way he saw the world  but I thought he was also very pessimistic and that made me kind of sad  I agreed with him on many things in the book  but I think there are more optimistic ways to have the opinions he has  On the other hand  the pessimism made the idea behind the story more clear and understandable  It wouldn t be as good if Holden would have been an extremely happy and optimistic person The swearing bothered me a bit at first  but once I got used to it  I didn t care that much anymore  It contributed to Holden s personality and gave his opinions more strength I think It s funny how books always seem to answer to the mood you re in and the things that are on your mind  This book did this more than any other book I ve ever read and it completely blew my mind  This is a strange book  in terms of the effects it delivered  It is not merely a personal message or a lesson  but the narration has a totally strange effect that creates waves of melancholy and nostalgia at certain points that makes readers feel so dear I was brought close to tears  something no fictions ever made me experience  JDS managed and succeed at making it so that the images  the world  and what lay before the the boy s eyes were effortless for readers to imagine and feel  Getting through and making sense out of the early parts were a little tough  what made me continue flipping the pages was my impatience to discover why on earth was this piece of work marked as 20th century best  and indeed  it is phenomenal   Well  Holden Caulfield is certainly a colourful character to remember  After getting a few opinions from my friends  I realized that this book is at opposite ends for many people  being that you either really love it or really hate it  It basically boils down to whether you like the way the narrative is told  that is from a very brash and opinionated boy s stream of consciousness who sees only ugliness and disillusionment Thankfully  I did enjoy the book very much because I identified with many of Holden s irks and annoyances  I liked the ambiguousness of the sentences at times  which only shows how little Holden understood of his own behaviour at times  which perfectly reflects a mind of someone unsure of what he s doing  or why he s doing it which god knows how many times I ve felt the past year  Yea  the book  killed me    No doubt it is my favorite book  i know  what a cliche  a teenage girl who loves The Catcher in the Rye   I don t know yet exactly what makes this novel so special  what I think is that each of us can relate to Holden  one way or another  What I like the more about him is how spontaeous and honest Salinger made him  that is how I would like to be most of the time  One of the few books that left me thinking  which is what literature is suppose to do with us  leave us thinking  I started thinking about the people who surround me  about the bunch of phonies I live with  some of them are my friends  I don t know  it left me thinking about tons of things  I fell in love with Holden  I m crazy  I know  and with lot s of his ideas  This is a book I can t stop reading  overtime I finish it  I start it again two months later  or whenever I feel sad  I open it and my problems are gone for a while  If you haven t read it  what are you waiting for  This book is different from anything I ve ever read  I loved it  I fell in love  instantly  with the sarcastic perspective and humorous observations  I usually cannot stand long descriptions  I like it when books just get to the point  but the way this was written  was hilarious and I loved watching Holden s thought process in the different scenarios that came up  There s so many great lines in this book  I ll have to buy it  read it again  and highlight all of them because they are too good to forget  I had only heard of Catcher In The Rye  I was actually at the library to get Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  but I saw Catcher In The Rye  read the first page  and took that instead  One thing that constantly shocked me throughout the book was how it took place in the early 50s and the language was really pushing it  but even with some foul language here and there  the decency of the characters was more obvious than how they spoke or what they were thinking  Everyone s a little evil  and I m not saying any of the characters in this book are evil  just a little    edgy  which I enjoyed  Great book  definitely one of my favorites now  Dear Lord  I can t even begin to count the ways in which I fell in love with the book  The themes  the motifs  and most of all  the symbolism It was tremendous  The moment I realized the title of the book itself was symbolism  my mind was blown The book perfectly depicts the conflicts and inner struggle I think anybody goes through during the transitional phase from teenage to adulthood  and which I am in the middle of  right now   It is very comforting  knowing you re not alone Apart from the red cap s significance to show Holden s desire to stand out  he claims he hates the movies because they re  phony   and by God  they are   but nevertheless when Maurice hit him in the crotch  I loved his innocence when he refrained from calling the spot any name  but only insinuated it  he went to the bathroom pretending he was shot  exactly like the movies  and I think everyone imagines they re in a movie at some point in their lives or another  This certain part is a good depiction of silly  unnecessary teenage rebellion and so forth I think this is the best coming of age pieces of work I ve ever encountered  even though Holden kind of didn t accept his coming of age anyhow It was a great read  Al parecer este es de los libros con los que solo tienes dos opciones  Lo amas o lo odias Y efectivamente  debido a la puntuacion que le otorgo  lo ame La  historia  transcurre en menos de una semana  y mas que una historia son las vivencias de este chico  Holden  quien acaba de ser expulsado del instituto por 9a vez   Que mente  A decir verdad  comparto varios pensamientos con Holden sobre la sociedad y la vida  Lo que me parece curioso es lo viejo que el libro es y lo controversial que debio ser al ser publicado  First read this exact copy of  The Catcher in the Rye  when I was 15  My teenage handwriting in the front cover takes me right back to Grade 11 English  I decided at that time that I would read it every 5 year for my whole life just to gauge whether or not my attitudes changed toward it  Well  I ve missed a few years in there  but I was right    it has been fascinating to see how  I  have changed through my reaction to the book When I was 15  I  was  Holden Caulfield  Every word resonated  When I was 20  I felt like his kindly older sister wishing I could offer him a shoulder and an ear  When I was 25  I was frustrated with the whinging and the negativity and could not believe that I had ever identified with him  At 30  15 seemed like such a long time ago and I in a mad scurry to get somewhere fast  At 36  I was just looking for answers to the practical questions of my daily life  and Holden doesn t have any more answers than the rest of us  And so it went  This year  at 42  I find myself full circle back to loving Holden  and identifying with every breath he takes  Perhaps it is because I am the mother of children approaching Holden s age and see the goodness in the world through their eyes  trying to make sense out of the confusion and greyness of life  not black not white  I would not change a word of this book The day after I finished re reading  my cousin told me that J  D  Salinger had died  I was so glad that I had just read it  When I worked in bookshops  I always hated it when masses of people would come in looking for the writings of a newly dead author  I know it s because people are reminded  or nudged  or curious enough when the name is in the news  but it seems so sad I can t stand it  And I thought that Holden would get that  Recently re read this novel  and still highly enjoy the stream of consciousness narrative structure and unreliable voice  I have always interpreted Holden Caulfield s journey as an attempt to avoid a descent into madness  not only does he lie to the world  but lies to himself as long as he can  So his words in the epilogue  after I get out of here  have always suggested to me that he is in an institute Phoebe  his little sister  is his only anchor to reality  the true titular  catcher in the rye   Holden avoids going home from boarding school not to avoid the wrath of his parents  which is a regular occurrence from all accounts  but from the recognition that he can fool everyone but his little sister  who will reflect his insanity back at him  Avoidance is the name of his game  but what feels like freedom only spins back around to loneliness and despair at who he is The most touching moment is when he is standing in the museum and Phoebe brings her little suitcase to meet him and run away with him  He knows then that running away is not the answer  that not only can he not take care of his little sister  he cannot take care of himself  The spinning of the carousel symbolizes the endless cycle in which Holden is caught and the rain is the release of the lie that has been his existence  Phoebe is the best character in the novel  People tend to be split on this novel  they either love it  or hate it  but I personally enjoy it every time I read it   Every time I read this book  I learn something new about Holden Caulfield and myself  Fantastic    J D  Salinger introduces the world to a book called Catcher in the Rye  The narrator and main character Holden Caulfield  Tells a story about how phony the people are at every school he goes to  He is a sixteen year old young man Trying to find where he fits in everywhere in life He shows us that school is definitely where he its because he has fails every class except English  He ends up of school because of these very horrible grades His family is obvious very fortunate when it comes to money  Its this way because Holden Caulfield attends a boarding school  The sort of unfournate when it comes down to family because Holden s brother Allie died and no has really healed  That is the sort of thing that time will heal  Holden decides to leaves Pency Prep before his parents are scheduled to come  Just before he leaves him and Stradlater  his roommate  get into a confrontation  Once they fight he looks for comfort from Ackley  Ackley is known as the outcast  Holden describes him as pimply  Ackley being the phony that Holden knew he was felt no kind of sympathy for him  Holden finally left Pency Prep for good  He had quit a bit of money s money came from from his grandmother with bad memory  She thought that he had three birthdays  He got on a train to finally end up in a crummy hotel  He goes from dates with a old classmate by the name of Sally Hayes to thinking about a neighborhood friend by the name Jane Gallagher  Sally is a girl that is pretty phony  She says words like grand which Caulfield absolutely hated  He was more sexually attracted to her  He thought she was just to beautiful for her own good  She wore little skirts and was nevr on time to any of the places met her She likes him but she doesn t really know how much after they go skating in Radio City  Holden Burst our every bit of emotion into their date and it sort if scares her  She then get a late niht call from him and it makes her even more frightened  He is drunk and want to know if she still wants him to trim the tree because it is around Christmas time  Jane Gallagher is the only character that Holden does not bash  H trashes everyone in some way or the other  Jane was special to him  He had deep feelings for this girl  She was described as beautiful and just a wonderful person  He tell how he wanted to just almost strangle her stepfather because he was absolutely a jerk  Her stepfather made her shed tears while they were playing checkers  He didn t touch  He just walked into the room and asked her where something was  Then when he walks outs she lets a tear drops on the checkers board  Holden respects her so much too much to point where the fight that he gets into with Stadlater circled backed around to her name  I absolutely loved the book  It gave me a real sine of imagination  The book helped me to place myself in the streets of New York  I felt what he felt even though I wasn t raised in the time that the book was written  It was hard to believe what the narrator was saying because his started off by saying he was a liar  I liked how he was so close to his siblings  He cared for his brother Allie till the day he died  He admired his brother  He also looked after his by attempting to bring her gifts and settle her when she almost went crazy after worrying about her   I would recommend this book for young adults of all ages  The book is good for teenagers because the rebellion can related to more by them  The book just may be a reflection of what Salinger was like growing up in New York  He seems to give a feel that is almost to personal  The drinking  running away  relationship problems are normal issues that we face today  The Book Catcher in the Rye gets five stars for its excellent play of drama and adult issues  It s been a few years since I last read Catcher in the Rye   and then I was a lonely  drunk  ex pat living in New York hating and loving everything in kaleidoscope of equalness  Five years on  baby boy  house in England  wife to be  good job  Different mind set   although my mind set back then was liable to change rapidly  after my initial month or two of New York I settled in  had a good base of friends and fell in love with the place  Was still a drunk and prone to hating phonies    Would I still connect to the book and the protagonist  Well   yeah  of course  Anyone that s been a teenage boy  boy    anyone that just doesn t understand why some people do certain things and why certain people do some things   anyone that s thought too much and let things get them down The Catcher in the Rye is good on a lot of levels   the childish teenage angst of prose  the humour  the ability to tell a story  And the character descriptions  They re all fantastic I m goddamn crap at reviews  but boy I still like to do them anyway  Anyway  just read the goddamn book  bilen bilir  bu kitabi 3 ydir okuyordum her seferinde de 1 2 sayfa okuyup birakiyordum ama bu kitabin icerigiyle degilde lanet puntosuyla alakaliydi neyse bugun aldim elime kendimi zorlayip 10 sayfasini okudum ve kitap bitti bloguma uzun yazi yazacagim icin burayi cok kisa tutacagim ama bence hepiniz bu kitabi okumalisiniz holden da kendinizden bir bircok parca bulacaksiniz kesinlikle kitapta en sevdigim alintiyla basbasa birakiyorum simdi sizi  I know he s dead  Don t you think I know that  I can still like him  though  can t I  Just because somebody s dead  you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake  especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all     Holden Caulfield  a college dropout  finally learning to grow up and take responsibility for his actions  This is basically a simple overview of The Catcher in The Rye  a compelling  heartwarming novel that I personally loved  If you were to go deeper however  you would notice a lot of things  One thing really caught my eye was how well this masterpiece was written so well in first person by J D  Salinger  and it really makes it feel like you are walking beside Holden  Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic book because of the way it portrays multilayered characters  creates a meaningful journey for Holden  and how it illustrates how a teenage boy realistically thinks   When Holden is on this life changing journey  he meets people that  like an onion  have many layers and are very unique  And with all those odd people  he learns something new about the tough game of life and how to win it  Salinger does a tremendous job of not only thinking up these special characters that are thrown into Holden s life  but giving them a great background and life story too  For example  he spends an evening dancing with three tourist girls  only one of which were good looking and dances with her  but turns out none of them are interested in him  He also has a clumsy encounter with a prostitute  who he tries to have a conversation with that gets him nowhere  and with whom he refuses to do anything with her and tells her to leave  because he has not ever done anything like this and didn t know what he was doing  He does agree to pay her for her troubles   She demands more money than was originally agreed upon and when Holden refuses to pay he is beaten by her pimp  Maurice  This is a turning point for Holden that strangers can be dangerous and he should spend less time showing off and more time figuring out what he wants to do with his life   When Holden  a high school student  gets thrown out of Penecy Prep  his life slowly goes into turmoil  and he does everything humanly possible to stay away and keep the news from home  and so that he doesn t have to face his parents  This is what instigates the meaningful journey  On this journey  he goes on an adventure that completely rocks his crumbling world  This adventure he goes on shows him that he needs to start maturing and that he must take responsibility for failing college  and that it is no ones fault but his own  Salinger then has Holden share with the reader his fantasy  which was based on a mishearing of Robert Burns  Comin  through the rye  he pictures himself as the one leader of numerous children running and playing in a huge rye field on the edge of a cliff  His job is to make sure that the children would be okay  and so he would be a  catcher in the rye   This is the drastic turning point for Holden as he realizes its time to come home  This is huge for Holden  because for most of this journey  it was spent being drunk and lonely  wasting away the best years of his life  depressingly   Lastly  this twisting journey portrays what goes on in a troubled young adults mind  Holden wanted to move out west  but when he relays these plans to his little sister  who is the only person he has stayed in constant connection with  she wants to go too  When he says no  she gets very upset  So he tells her he isn t going and takes her to the Central Park Zoo  He watches in fascination as she is so joyous on the carousel  He matures by the end of this adventure and has really formed into a respectable adult  Readers will feel proud of Holden and happy that they were with him the entire time to watch him go from rowdy dropout to a charming young man   Catcher in the Rye is a righteous story that describes a college drop out learning to stop blaming and getting into other peoples business and start realizing that he isn t perfect either  This heart warmer is guaranteed to make anyone  young or old  to cry and learn how valuable life is  and that WE are in charge of our own destiny  Not for everyone s taste  but believe you me  totally worth the read  Kdo chyta v zite jsem cetla podruhe a pocitam se mezi Salingerovi fanousky  Tentokrat jsem ale misty vahala mezi 4 a 5 hvezdickami  protoze to Holdenovo  ja vam ho skoro az zacinal nenavidet  mi misty uz tolik nesedelo  Nevim uz presne  kdy jsem knihu cetla poprve  asi v sestnacti  mozna o rok dyl  a mozna uz nejsem ve fazi sloziteho dospivani  i kdyz o tom by se dalo s uspechem polemizovat  protoze me uz nektere pasaze tolik nezaujaly  Holden  jako kral smutku a nespokojenosti  floutek  kteremu neni nikdo a nic reacht  az na jeho malou sestricku a mrtveho brasku a mozna dve jeptisky  se kterymi jednou snidal   je mi svym zpusobem porad blizky  ale mozna nejvic pri tomto cteni me oslovil proslov Hodenova byvaleho uchylneho ucitele anglictiny o to  ze vyzrala osobnost se pozna podle toho  ze si najde neco  pro co stoji za to zit  ne umrit   Kazdopadne Holdenuv pristup vypraveni a vzpominani na situace a lidi ma v sobe porad  i po vic nez polovine stoleti  neskutecnou silu a je to jedina necenzurovana kniha o zivote  kterou jsem cetla a myslim  ze jako Holden ve skutecne aspon obcas uvazuje nejeden z nas  a kdo ne  tomu zavidim  protoze musel mit perfektni detstvi a jednoduche dospivani a vubec  jeho zivot je pohadka  a ostatni  kdo knihu odsuzuji  to delaji  protoze se jim nelibi co ctou  neb je to do pismenka realne a protoze si nechteji priznat  ze obcas taky nekoho nenavidi pro nejaky nesmysl  ale vlastne ho maji radi a protoze obcas maji taky pocit  ze zivot stoji za pendrek a chteli by odjet nekam  kde je nikdo nezna a zit tam v chaloupce uprostred lesa  A tihle predstiraci a odsuzovaci by me umrtvili  receno Holdenovym slovnikem   Holden Caulfield je cista esence nespokojenosti a  bezduvodneho  smutku  osamelosti a ztracenosti  rekla bych  ze dnes se podobne stavy leci antidepresivy a rozhodne je zdravi skodlive mit dlouhodobe postoj  jaky ma tenhle antihrdina The Catcher in the Ray je jedna z tech knih  co jsou o nicem a o vsem zaroven  bud ji budete nenavidet  nebo milovat  Po jejim precteni taky pochopite  proc nebyla nikdy zfilmovana  proc patrila mezi zakazane knihy a taky vam bude Salingeruv zivotopis davat vetsi smysl  protoze Salinger je proste Holden  a taky vas napadne spousta duvodu  proc ji mel u sebe Lennonuv vrah  Po docteni jsem chvilku brouzdala po netu a nasla tento clanek http   www citarny cz index php optio   A tahle citace myslim sedi  Mozna  ze ucitele devatych rocniku  zahrnujici tento roman do povinne cetby doufaji  ze jejich zaci si vezmou z knihy prave toto ponauceni   ze pocit odcizeni je jen docasne stadium a jednou je prejde  Jenomze lidi neprerustaji Holdenuv postoj  nebo aspon ne uplne a ani ho nechteji prerust  protoze ten postoj je docela uzitecny  Jednim z cilu vychovy je naucit lidi  aby usilovali o vsechny odmeny  ktere jim zivot nabizi  Ale dalsim cilem je naucit je i to  o tyto odmeny zase tolik nestat  Americane  obzvlaste ti citlivi a inteligentni ze strednich vrstev  vnimaji odmeny zivota jako neco  co jim po pravu patri a proto pocit zklamani prichazi k nim mnohem casteji  nez pocit uspechu  Ale jestli se nenaucime o statky nestat  pak nase selhani nas jednou znici  Kdyz davame svym detem precist Kdo chyta v zite   je to jako bychom jim davali psychicky stit  Me tak hrozne stve  ze Salinger uz nezije  je to asi jediny spisovatel  se kterym bych se vazne vazne chtela setkat  I think Salinger made her point in The Catcher in the Rye a very unique way  All of the rambling Holden does throughout helps make a strong statement in the end of the book  I think this book can connect the 1940 s style theme to modern issues  For example  in the end of the book  I believe that Salinger eludes to Holden s consistent flashbacks  either good or bad  to a mindset of forgetting the past to focus on the future  Good memories  or bad  can stray your focus from what you need to do in the present  This applies to modern issues because many struggling Americans need to focus on the task at hand in digging themselves out of the economical hole they are faced with  Countless themes give the reader a the ability to take away one that is most meaningful to themselves  Overall the classic novel is one of the ages   One of the few books I wanted to read before I die  Very depressing  more or less tragic  but interesting  Holden Caufield is probably one of the best fictional characters I ve ever encountered  His point of view is refreshing and unique  unlike most of the Y A books I have been reading lately  He is naive at the same time really perceptive of society and the world around him  He is very resentful towards adults  rebellious and cynical  One of Holden s most striking and quintessential qualities is his powerful revulsion for  phony  qualities  a catch all term for all the perceived hypocrisy that irritates him  I totally loved that aspect of the book  It shows his keen mind and intelligence  even though he continually fails classes and calls himself dumb The plot was entertaining  and I loved the way he thought  plus the great narration  although the story line was a little confusing to me  The whole book is simple yet complex  and until now I havent really made up my mind about it  I m at a point in my life where I can clearly understand what Holden feels and why he feels that way  yet I also find him too whiny and full of complaints and think that he should just accept the way the world is and try to enjoy his life a little  He is the portrait of every confused  self absorbed and angry teenager across the globe  but I also think that at his age he should be more responsible  He s seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people But still  reading this has brought back all the angst I felt once upon a time  So the book is beautiful  so much depth and meaning  such a classic  I can see why this is one of the required readings in a lot of high school  Im sure most of them can relate to Holden  as I did  I have never met a character I could more relate to  Holden may be a stupid  arrogant and childlish  but he has a big heart  And by the way  isn t it true that we love people for their defects istead of loving them for their advantages  Holden is not perfect  but he is REAL  And I love him  One of the best books I ve read  The prose is rather plain  but that s not necessarily a detriment  One of the more memorable passages in the book is Holden s conversations with Mr  Antolini  you know  the whole  dying nobly for an unworthy cause   That part resonated with me in particular  I felt as though Holden behaved not exactly as I would  but rather how I wished I would  Fancy that  This is my third time reading it and it s certainly one that you understand and appreciate more the older you get  My first time reading it was the summer before 7th grade  or was it after   and the second was Sophomore year of high school  I m a year out of college now and I think I have a much richer understanding and much more sympathy with for Holden When I was in high school we talked about stream of consciousness  but we never discussed how fractured Holden s mental state is  He is someone clearly suffering from depression  potentially PTSD  I never noticed it before but there s a single line near the end of the book  after Holden wakes up to find his old English teacher petting his head  where he alludes to potentially being a survivor of sexual abuse  Boy  I was shaking like a madman  I was sweating  too  When something perverty like that happens  I start sweating like a bastard  That kind of stuff s happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid  I can t stand it  That s the very last line of chapter 24  but he never makes any direct reference to it anywhere else in the novel that I can think of  J D  Salinger  all i could say is   Thank God for this book   Written in the World War II  but even though it was written way back then  this really summed up my whole teenage years  I don t really get people who would want to strangle up Holden Caulfield and tell him to grow up  This was the purpose of the book  to show that Holden Caulfield doesn t want to change  The Ducks  The Carousel and everything  come on people  It is one of the best  don t let other people tell how bad this book is  you just ought to understand it and realize it better yup  phonies   Izchetokh si ia  za ne znam koi p t veche  sled porednite obiasneniia kak nishcho ne sa razbrali ot taia kniga Ne smiatam da obiasniavam zashcho e

I guess so many books  too little time So glad I finally got to it  via the challenge   I had a lot of preconceived notions of Holden  and I was surprised at how sad this book is  I m not sure I would ve gotten it in high school  and I m not sure I would ve appreciated studying it either  There s a lot to recognize in this book  and it hit me square in the chest  Read it  if you missed it in high school   To be frank  most of the people who say they didn t like this book freely admit that they didn t understand it  A lot of them hide the fact that they didn t  get it  or they believe they got it  but honestly did not I don t claim that everyone who dislikes it didn t get it  but it is a pretty large number  I include having faced a tragedy in life as part of what you need in order to  get it   If you haven t faced a major loss in life  the story isn t going to make sense period To those who have lost someone or had another major life event send them reeling without direction  this book is for you  If you ve ever driven around late at night stopping to cry at every place you used to visit  this book is for you  If you ve ever pushed everyone away when you needed them most  then gotten angry at them for not helping or giving up  this book is for you I recently finished it for the second time  I wanted to make sure that my love of it wasn t just misplaced teen angst from the first reading  It was not  This story is a masterpiece  If you really want to know   Why I read this is because of J D  Salinger  I was intrigued by this man s mystery of his life  I finally got to see the documentary and knew I had to read this Did you know the author incorporated himself in this book   I think this is one of the best literature I ve ever read  it was so moving  so relatable to how I felt when I was Holden s age  As you read the book you will start to really get inside his head and understand him  I was so moved at the end of the book  the closer you got to it  then Holden s point of view became powerful  I was crying for him at the most powerful  unforgettable parts toward the end and you will too Holden Caulfield is the lonely boy who you felt everything for  He wanted to do everything in the world but couldn t  One of my all time  Top 5 books of my life  Sotto l apparente semplicita  questo romanzo nasconde tesori inestimabili  E alcune parti sono poesia pura  Si deve leggere  da soli o in compagnia  e consigliarne a tutti la lettura come rimedio a molti mali   A note from my sporadic diary gives an indication of my reading interests   Thursday  Jan 28  2010  Big news last couple of days  J  D  Salinger died    It was on page one   of the Sacramento Bee    What impact for an obit   I was not saddened by the news but realized there should be a mutual moment of silence between some of his fans over the loss of the recluse writer  if you know what I mean  Many of us admired his expose on adolescence from the day it was published in 1951   Catcher in the Rye was one of the first books I completed in its entirety  Friend Danny Rogers and I were taken in by Salinger prose  We would have a quoting contest  trying to remember all the bits and pieces we regurgitated through the years   The phonies are coming in the windows   Here are a few stolen words from Catcher that will jar your thinking cap  if you now what I mean  Ackley kid    These are feud for thought   Grand  There s a word I really hate  It s a phoney  I could puke every time I hear it    I hope to hell that when I do die somebody has the sense to just dump me in the river or something  Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery  People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday  and all that crap  Who wants flowers when you re dead  Nobody    If a girl looks swell when she meets you  who gives a damn if she s late  Nobody   Salinger was the catalyst in getting me into books  I read some other Salinger books but nothing hit the cerebral nailhead like Catcher did  I have reread it several times  and it always keeps me turning pages  The book was kept out of many schools for a long time because of the appearance of the F word  But it is a true study of adolecense in the fifties  Holden Caulfield is a mixed up teenager trying to cope with life  He is more confused than most of us were at his age  but we still relate to his frustrations  The book may be outdated today  but I doubt it  Seminal work  I disagree with some of the negative things people have to say about The Catcher In the Rye some of you have never even read the book before  In my opinion some kids shouldn t read the book depending on their mental health because they might take the things that Holden talks about in the wrong way    I felt miserable  I felt depressed you can t imagine  What I did  I started talking  sort of out loud  to Allie   This can make any kid think about suicide or how their life is  I think people also  don t like The Catcher in the Rye because they ve learned from the lessons Holden was going through so they can t really connect with the book  but you think they would  This book has taught me how different someone s life can be and the things you have to go through with growing up  As a child  we are protected from life  There isn t many choices available  and we are certainly sheltered from a lot of the harder parts of life  As you grow up you get a slap in the face with how ugly the world actually is  I loved The Catcher in the Rye  and everything I ve learned from it  I took away a lot from this book  how hard it is to go through things alone and even though life s hard you don t give up  Favorite book ever   3 Mi vida esta compuesta de cliches  asi que las palabras no me alcanzan para describir todo lo que me interpreta e inspira El cazador en el centeno  Lo lei por primera cuando tenia 17 anos  en una edicion terrible con modismos espanoles para matarse   y siempre quise leerlo nuevamente cuando mi ingles mejorara  Y aqui estoy  con un sindrome de peter pan de la puta  cual Holden  Es increible como  diciendo muy poco  este libro captura la experiencia universal del adolescente y me hace volver a aquellos turbulentos anos en que todo era terrible  aunque nada pasara  Que bueno que pase esa etapa  Ahora a seguir leyendo a Salinger porque es un seco culiao  3 Re reading this as an adult really gave me a different perspective on it  I remember feeling so in league with Holden  reading it as an angsty teen  Now it s astounding to see how very much my own perspective on the world has changed  When Phoebe confronts her big brother  asking him what  if anything at all  he does like  and he comes up blank  I remember my angsty teen self grinning and feeling so proud of him that he didn t think of something just to placate her  I thought he was being bold  and honest  If you don t like anything  then stand by that  you know  And don t back down  Now  reading that scene again  I felt so sad for him  He really didn t find any joy in life  Everything around him was tainted  because it had all been done before  That s so stifling  the idea that every movement must be heart breakingly original  We re raised in a society with a myriad of stories  art  and ideas  Everything you create can be broken down  assigned to your possible influences  and deemed phony  The answer is not to give up  but to keep creating  But  I suppose  that s a lesson that takes a long time to learn  and even longer to implement Also  seriously  is  ironical  a word  Because he uses it all the time  and it drove me batty I m Heather McNally  and I like to write book reports     This book has changed my life in so many ways  I could relate to Holden  probably more than anyone else around me  Sometimes his thoughts echoed mine  I m glad i found it last year and not when I was in my late thirties or something  because I d probably have a different opinion   First of all  notice that I put this on the  defines my existence  shelf  Honestly  if you really want to get to know me  the actual me  instead of that two dimensional version of me that you ll only see if we re friends  just read this book  It ll tell you everything Catcher is more therapeutic than listening to Bon Iver on a rainy road trip  which is  you know  my second or third favourite thing to do in the whole world  From the first sentence towards the end I connected with Holden Caulfield on an spiritual level  Entirely  from his angsty  prejudiced  naive thoughts to his heartfelt ones  It s like Salinger had been watching me all my life  trying to decode all my actions and reading my thoughts and wrote this book so I could feel less like an outsider  so he could show me that   Hey  there s nothing wrong with you  There are actually people that feel this way  and it s okay  I get it  Please feel good about yourself  because not everybody understands things the way we do  not everybody feels this way  and that is one hell of a privilege  Be safe  Have a nice day    What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though  The majority of this book was read while I was waiting around in airports  so my expression remained rather stoic  in an attempt to go unnoticed by other passengers  except for the few times I couldn t quite suppress my laughter and it slipped out like a chuckle or a cough  I didn t much like how people were staring at me while I was reading  I am a bit paranoid though  Anyways  the point I wanted to make is that I felt rather involved yet withdrawn while reading this book  and then for some reason  after reading the last page and putting the book down  I felt my eyes stinging and I didn t know what to do with myself 5 stars because I m not really sure what is so great about this book but I do wish that the author was a terrific friend of mine   A lot of people  especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here  keeps asking me if I m going apply myself when I go back to school next September  It s such a stupid question  in my opinion  I mean how do you know what you re going to do till you do it  The answer is  you don t  I think I am  but how do I know  I swear it s a stupid question    Pg  213  Go ahead  then  I ll be on this bench right over here  I ll watchya   I went over and sat down on this bench  and she went and got on thecarrousel  She walked all around it  I mean she walked once all the wayaround it  Then she sat down on this big  brown  beat up looking oldhorse  Then the carrousel started  and I watched her go around and around There were only about five or six other kids on the ride  and the song thecarrousel was playing was  Smoke Gets in Your Eyes   It was playing itvery jazzy and funny  All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring and so was old Phoebe  and I was sort of afraid she d fall off the goddamhorse  but I didn t say anything or do anything  The thing with kids is if they want to grab the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and notsay anything  If they fall off they fall off  but it s bad if you sayanything to them    pg  211 The quotes above are the main reason why I loved this book so much  Yes  I am aware of the fact that most people either love the shit out of this book or hate it  I  obviously  am on the side of those who love it  This book is genius and I Don t think I say that a lot about books  But this one is  it measures up to the genius present in one of my favorite books The Great Gatsby and The Fault in Our Stars  There really is no way to describe how much I loved this book  I could relate to Holden  I could understand what he was saying  I cared about what he had to say  and I am proud to say I was never annoyed with him at all  I can definitely say this book is among my top 5 favorite books  up there with Gatsby and TFIOS  One of my first favorite books  Found this on a bookshelf at my parents  house when I was 15 and just  got it   Changed the world for me  this is why I love literature  The reason I got hooked on Salinger  I read this book twice  My first copy is long lost somewhere in Norway  The language  the social controversy  ah  Just amazing  Sirs and Madams Hopefully there will come a time when I can tell you about this book  or write something more about it  The only thing you really need to know for now is that  despite all the hype and all the teenagers  this actually is a great book by what  I hope  is one of the great American writers of the last century  Full of references to Russian literature  this book is the product of ten years  For any writer that s a pretty long time to mull about something  For Salinger it was his best swing at himself  Slashes V So  there is this book called The Catcher in the Rye  written by this guy  you know  the writer of this book  so anyway  the book is written by this writer named J  D  Salinger  Boy  I hate it when somebody hides their real name by just writing their initials and all  and if you want to know  this guy s real name is actually Jerome David Salinger  in case you like to know all that stuff  Now I m not gonna fill this up with a bunch of David Copperfield crap about what kind of guy this Salinger was and what kind of life he led  because I don t feel like it  if you want to know the truth  You have to be in the mood to write these kinda things  you know  All I want to say that I m gonna review this book and all  I think some of those reviews are phony as heck  if you want to know the truth  but I ll have to try to not let that happen to this one So this story  it was about some funny bastard called Holden Caulfield  or whatever  I never could remember all those funny names  He got the ax and got kicked out of this really phony school called Pencey  and so this guy then bummed around in New York for two days  till he had to get back to his home  It killed me  No kidding  The guy was really depressed for half of the book and he kept going around and around and meeting all of these phony guys  It killed me  It really did  And there were all these funny things that happened in it  like  he has these fights with his roommate in Pencey and some elevator operator and he asks this girl to run away with him and realizes that he was actually mad all the time  Some funny things also happen when he goes to his little sister s school  he also has this bigger brother called D  B  who  like the freaking writer himself  uses his initals  and hangs around with some phony hot shots in Hollywood and he also has one other brother who died  and asks her to come to a museum  where his sister gets angry with him for not letting her go with him and then he decides that he will not run away  and they end up going to the zoo  There even is this red hunting hat which Holden wears  which I think is the symbol for the  catcher in the rye   It makes sense  too  as this Caulfield teenager I told you about  he tries to be an adult while still being an innocent kind of guy and he tries to find some traits in other adults like kindness and innocence which are in kids  and he misunderstands this poem by some bloke called Robert Burns which has a line about a body meeting a body through the rye or something  so he reads it as a body catching a body through the rye  and so he becomes this  catcher in the rye  who has to save kids from falling off a cliff or something  In one part  the part where he goes to his sister s school and all  he sees these bad words written on a wall and he is  like  totally mad after that  because he doesn t want those little kids in school to be harmed by it or anything  It really knocks me out  all that stuff about somebody twisting or distorting something  Anyway  I hate all that analogy stuff  it is just so phony  so I m not gonna talk about it more  The one thing you need to know is that I thought this book was real fantastic because I enjoyed it and not in a phony way  I wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of mine and I could call him up on the phone whenever I felt like it  Now can you believe some freaking phonies tried to have it banned  for goodness  sake  and called it a bad book and all  Like  seriously  these phonies are always making a big deal out of nothing  But even then  it got many reviews saying it was good and got listed in some  Best Novels  list or something  but if you ask me  those lists are phony as heck  if you want to know the truth  just like those prizes  Boy  I hate prizes so much  I also hate those phony guys who give prizes  But what do you care  You re a phony for even reading this  You re all phonies  Boy  I hate phonies  This book was a  game changer  for me  When I read it  years ago   I had no idea such honesty  and rough candor existed in literature  It s a good read  Try it out if you ve not read it yet   The genre is fiction Summary   The book is about a teenage boy  around sixteen  who gets expelled from four high schools and then runs off to New York City   It centers around Holden Caulfield and as he narrates the story the reader learns everything that goes through his head    Holden wanders around New York  often times getting drunk   A huge chunk of the book is what he thinks of other people  since he is pretty critical and cynical  A theme in this book would be growing from a teenager to an adult because that is the root to a lot of the problems that Holden Caulfield faces I would recommend this book for teenagers because it is really easy to relate to what Holden is going through  The writer s style is that he writes exactly what goes through Holden s mind  Word for word  He uses a lot of slang that they used back in the sixties  which really makes Holden s character more believable  Example   Awesome  I appreciate this book much more now than when I had to read it as a summer reading requirement in middle school  Salinger captures teen angst in all of its glory in this truly great book The Catcher in the Rye is about a boy named Holden and he is expelled from the school he attends so he decides to go back to Manhattan early  where his parents live  but before going home  he makes different stops  This book is about Holden trying not to grow up but at the end of the book  he realizes that he has grown up  The character development is seen through Holden who is immature and a bad sixteen year old that goes and talks to various people and he develops into a better person just by listening to what they have to say  The setting is in the 1950 s and in New York  The tone in the novel seems to be very pessimistic and negative until the end where Holden suggests that he will go to another school and try to make the best of things  This book is appropriate for student in the seventh to ninth grade level  They could relate to the character and perhaps feel that they do not fit in at times   Anytime something great is created  as much praise as it may receive  there will be just as much backlash and people out there to find some reason to destroy it  I think this may be one of the reasons why Salinger decided to pull back from the public  That  and he may have been a little nuts  I don t really care if he was though  because he changed the voice of literature and I appreciate the hell out of him This is one of those controversial books that people would secretly read when it first was published to find out what all the fuss was about  It has been banned because of the cursing  cussing  sexual innuendos  alcoholism etc  It is also usually required reading in high school  Most people who haven t lived under a rock and read on a regular basis know about this book  And surprisingly after all these years it s still highly debated and controversial I m not saying that people aren t entitled to their opinions when it comes to hating this  but it seems to me that a lot just want to go out of their way and hate it just to hate it  I don t care if Holden is an angsty  ungrateful  spoiled  smug  whiny  rich boy  He s also very lost  troubled  confused  angry  hurt  unstable and protective of his little sister  He s unsure of his place in the world and keeps everyone at arm s length  Yes  he s a hypocrite in every sense of the word  but isn t everyone  If he was honest with himself as much as he is with the reader he would realize that I just can t bring myself to do anything but love this kid  Because as screwed up as he is  he still has a knowing view of the world   Incredibly vivid and real  The narrative made me feel Holden s loneliness and the vague fear of freedom that comes with being lost in the world  When I think of this book  what stands out the most is the strange feeling of detachment from society  from familiarity  and yet being impossibly close to it all  It scared me  it saddened me and it opened my eyes  Most of all  it brought a surreal amount of nostalgia  especially near the end  I felt connected to Holden  maybe even seeing some of myself in him  I don t know  The feelings that washed over me during the read stuck to me more than the plot itself  It wasn t a story as much as it was an experience  Led by Holden Caulfield  an adolescent that deals with extreme amounts of angst and alienation issues  Takes place over the course of a day and shows his reluctance to attach himself to anyone through his conversations and interactions with others  Holden is a quick liar and has little to no respect for authority figures  the journey really begins when he leave school after being expelled  something that has happened more than once  His brother had died a few years before this story takes place and the readers soon learns that Holden finds his motivation through his inability to accept his younger brother s death  In fact  the only person that he seems comfortable with is his kid sister who seems to recognize the inner turmoil that he faces  Written in a stream of consciousness format  Could be difficult for readers due to the content or the way in which it is written  The text allows the reader to connect with Holden and understand his motivations  Not much happens in terms of plot but it is truly the journey that takes place that makes this book enjoyable   qbl z ynkhh yn khtb rw bkhwnm   yn mtn rw twy wblg  lHZh   khwndh bwdm   hwldn khlfyld bwd khh my khwst bly Skhrh bystd w dst hysh r bz khnd w

bshd     I found The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  to be a wonderful book  one that I truly enjoyed  I thought it was fascinating how the author got inside of the main character s head  Holden Caulfield  a sixteen year old boy from Pennsylvania  The novel takes place on a long weekend during the late 1940 s or early 1950 s in Pennsylvania as well as New York  The story begins where Holden describes his stay at the fancy boarding school in Pennsylvania called Pency Prep  The story is told through the voice of young Holden  who is reflecting on the events that have recently occurred  He is dealing with a psychological conflict where part of him wants to grow up and mature as an adult  while the other part of him wants to act and remain a child  We see a good example of this as he tries to interact with other people  he becomes conflicted whether to interact with them as an adult  or as a child The title  Catcher in the Rye  has to do with the song   Comin  Thro  the Rye   by Robert Burns  I that Holden begins singing as he is walking through the streets  When asked what he wants to do with his life by a friend  Holden replies with an image from the song  He states that he would like to protect the children from falling off the edge of the cliff by  catching  them if they were on the verge of tumbling over I enjoyed this book  and I would defiantly recommend it  It is a sad book during some parts  and very sad at others  but overall  a great book  As you read the book  the main theme of loneliness and self protection  never feeling  good enough  about oneself  The inability to know when to grow up from childish acts is also demonstrated throughout the novel  as shown by the example of various interactions with other people  Please note  English isn t my first language and I m too lazy to check if everything is correct  so please forgive my eventual mistakes Maybe I m just weird  but the reason why I put five stars is that  at certain points  this book made me feel almost uncomfortable while reading it  Holden tends to find the bad in everybody  and he s always so pessimistic that I felt weird readding about his thoughts  But if you start thinking about it and go a bit deeper than the actual story  you realizhe how Holden is going through the hard transation from childhood to adulthood  and his dream of saving innocence  Also  the book is really well written and it makes you feel what the main character feels in the different situations  I had to read the book for my english class but I m happy I did because this book made me think a loto  and I have to admit that I ended up looking for some explanations on the internet because I really wanted to fully understand the meaning of many things that may seem unimportant but acutally have a deep meaning   With a great  unforgettable first person narrative  Holden Caulfield magnifies the bittersweet adolescence we all went through   with  in my point of view  a sort of exaggeration Salinger employed to get his point across  as though he s shoving in Holden all the snottiness he possibly can  in an effort to make him the archetype of adolescent negativity  All with the mood swings  urges  shooting hormones and yes  of course  that unique quality teens have that makes the rest of the world just want to punch them in the eye Holden  however  showed some endearing traits that sometimes escaped in between all the arrogance  That  to me  served to prove that adolescence fades  Those traits felt like little bits of maturity already starting to sprout Even if you can t relate to Holden specifically  this novel is nostalgic  I get why this is a classic  Though I haven t read it in years  Catcher in the Rye is one of the only books I ve re read multiple times  Some of the other reviewers here talk about revisiting this book as an adult and not enjoying it as much as they did at sixteen  I don t think that would happen to me if I once again re read Catcher  There are some memorable passages in this novel  including one part where Holden Caulfield describes becoming depressed after seeing a classmate s beat up  cheap luggage  To read about that kind of sentiment really struck a chord with me  Salinger crafted one of the finest protagonist anti heroes in modern literature with Holden Caulfield  I think this book is a classic for good reason  Easily one of my favorite books  will read many more times  I can literally relate to this book and most characters in so many levels  Loved it I guess it s one of those books that you don t really know what to expect  and when you realise where the story is going  you get all too excited to know what the character is thinking and what they are going to do  Holden is always too lost in thought  and he s always too annoyed with everyone around him  He lies and he doesn t care about what anyone thinks  His vocabulary and foul language made me grow fond of him  and the lack of knowledge I had on the plot before reading it  sure made it a hell lot more interesting I see how this is such a popular book  God damn after watching these two videos from John Green  I learn to understand the depth and the loneliness Holden carries  Being an amateur metaphor enthusiast  I tried to understan much more of what words said and after the videos I watched  I also understand much more i might ve looked over the first time I read the genius novel  video 1  http   www youtube com watch v kqfThm      video 2 http   www youtube com watch v QUnQ w      When I picked up this book  I didn t know what I was expecting  All I knew was it was about some kid named Holden Caulfield and everyone raved over it  I can honestly see how some people might really hate Holden  He s whiny and seems to hate everything  but there was just something so true about him  Everything he said and described was eerily accurate  He would say things that seemed to come straight from my head  The feelings he describes I ve had  and I just felt such a connection to him as a character  I know what it s like to feel like nothing s going to ever be good and feel so hopeless  I thought Holden was such a troubled boy and I loved the very last chapter  Even though it was definitely heavy at points  Holden was hilarious most of the time  I laughed out loud several times while reading  which I didn t expect from a book written in 1945  I just absolutely love Holden  and I m so glad that I read it  There were so many different connections I found with this book and character to other books  Holden The Catcher in the Rye reminded me of Chris McCandless in Into the Wild  Esther Greenwood from The Bell Jar  and most of all Charlie from Perks of Being a Wallflower  but with less pessimism    The Catcher in the Rye is a novel by J D  Salinger  In this book narrator Holden Caulfield doesn t apply himself  He still acts like he is 13 years old because of his Brother Allie s death  He calls everyone phony but he doesn t see that he is phony too  Holden gets into a fight with Stradlater because of Jane  Holden thought Stradlater give Jane the business  Holden got mad because Stardlater wouldn t tell him about the date  Holden jumps on Stardlater punch Holden in the nose Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of pencey Prep and his mom and dad don t know he got kicked out of pencey  He takes the train back to New York  He meets this lady on the train and her son goes to pencey  He stars telling her lies about her son that he is smart and funny everyone likes himBut Holden thinks her son is phony and Holden lies about his name  He tries to get with that lady  Holden Caulfield doesn t act like he is 16years old  Holden gets to New York he finds apartment to stay  The guy in the apartment asked Holden if he wants a prostitute  Holden didn t even think about it he just said yes  When the prostitute comes and he thinks about it he doesn t do it with her  He tells her he can t and he gives he  5 dollars and she said he owes her  10 She got mad and told the guy and the guy came into Holden s room to get the rest of the money back  Holden can t stop asking the tax diver were the ducks go when it s snowing the ducks go to south Holden wants to be like the ducks Holden sneaks into his mom and dad s house he goes into his sister room phoebe asked him what are you doing here Dad is going to kill you he tells her he got kicked out of pencey and everyone was Phony  his teacher Mrs  spencer  He tells her he need to make a phone call he calls his teacher that lives in New York  He goes to his teacher s house his teacher tells him that you need to apply yourself  He sleeps over at his teacher s house and he wakes up in the middle of the night seeing his teacher touching his hand he thought his teacher was being homosexual  He tells him he left his bags at the train places and he needs to get them Holden hasn t ate for days he gets sick because he has been depressed his eyes are red and big he goes to the coffee shop all he drinks his coffee  He goes into the ally every time he goes into the ally he stars to think he is disappearing and he stars saying allie don t let me disappear he thinks of his brother allie  Holden goes to Phoebe School to give her note so they can Meet at the museum  She comes and she has a bag with her she tells Holden that she wants to go to the west with him she was sad because she couldn t go so they want to the zoo  That was the first time Holden has been happy he was with sister phoebe  This is a really good book I like this book but Holden doesn t act like his age I really like this book I thought it was great  I have uber nostalgia for Holden Caulfield  For so many teens  he is the first voice in literature that speaks outside of the canonical language that we have been used to  He had me at  the first page   If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  He talks about hypocricy and isolation in a way that rings true to 14 year olds   atleast me  I think this was the book that made me think   I m reading this book in school  He said crap  I like books  I want to read more books like this   This year as an English teacher  I introduced a bunch of banned or challenged books to my classroom and Cather in the Rye was  mad hot  as I hear it from proficient 8th grade readers  The struggling readers  on the other hand might say it was  crusty and bootleg   Holden e um adolescente de 16 anos  Ele e o narrador e o protagonista desta historia Holden e expulso e uma escola  nao foi a 1a vez  devido as suas notas  so uma positiva   a Ingles   Em casa so o esperam na 4a feira  a historia comeca a um sabado  e Holden decide  vaguear  por Nova Iorque nos dias que lhe faltam ate o  confronto  familiar Este e talvez um resume muito tosco da premissa do livro  a historia nao e mais do que as aventuras e desventuras de Holden em Nova Iorque  uma cidade que ele conhece muitissimo bem   mas talvez mais do que isso e a historia da forma como ele ve e se relaciona com o mundo   Holden parece incapaz de gostar de muita coisa  alias se analisar o livro so pela historia diria que este e um livro um pouco deprimente    no entanto  a forma como esta escrito  a linguagem que autor utilizou  a de um jovem de 16 anos em  conversa de cafe   suavizou a historia   mais do que isso deu lhe humor E um classico da literatura  e eu consigo imaginar o impacto que teve quando foi lancado na decada de 50  no entanto tenho algumas duvidas em o considerar intemporal  Penso que se tivesse de ser escrito hoje para alem da linguagem ter de ser necessariamente diferente  de um jovem de 16 anos nos dias de hoje  nao sei se iria entender o livro   mas tambem algumas situacoes vividas por Holden em Nova Iorque teriam de ser alteradas Li algures   uns tempos antes de ter lido o livro   que ou uma pessoa se identificava com Holden ou nao e consequentemente gostava do livro ou nao  Confesso que nao me identifiquei muito com Holden  com algumas excepcoes em 2 3 situacoes mais para o final do livro   no entanto a medida que o ia lendo pensava   hmmm  como posso estar a gostar do livro sem me conseguir identificar com a personagem principal       Eu penso que este e um livro que facilmente se consegue os extremos  ou se gosta ou se detesta Num periodo em que ando a ler menos e a um ritmo muiiiiiito lento  este foi um livro que me deu imenso gozo ler  e devo dizer que em parte o merito foi sem duvida da linguagem utilizada     Mas atencao nao quero ser redutora em relacao a este livro e resumi lo unicamente na linguagem  este e um livro que tem muito sumo  e Holden e sem duvida uma personagem fascinante Nota  embora a linguagem seja a de um jovem de 16 anos e frequente encontramos por la algumas perolas     uma entre muitas  O que realmente me enche as medidas e um livro que  depois de acabarmos de o ler  nos faca desejar que o autor que o escreveu fosse um grande amigo nosso e pudessemos telefonar lhe sempre que nos desse para ai       Mas peguem na Servidao Humana  do Somerset Maugham  Li o o verao passado  E um livro bastante bom e tudo  mas nao me dava para ligar para o Somerset Maugham  Nao sei  Nao e o genero de tipo para quem apetece ligar  so isso         Vubec jsem necekala  ze to bude takhle dobre  No  mozna malicko cekala  ale stejne me to prekvapilo  Zahanbene priznavam  ze jsem dosud o tehle knizce vlastne moc nevedela  krome toho  ze ji cetl ten blazen  co zastrelil Lennona    a tak jsem si myslela  ze je buhvi jak pekelna nebo co    A pritom je to tak obycejne pekne poskladany pribeh  Dovedu si predstavit  ze ve sve dobe byla trochu kontroverzni  ale libi se mi  jak je nadcasova  Poprve vysla v padesatych letech minuleho stoleti a porad funguje  Obcas na vas sice vyskoci slova jako mazavka  prokrindapana nebo ostopero  ale Holden je pubertak jako kazdy jiny a tyhle male pripominky  ze knizka neni uplne   dnesni  me vlastne moc bavily  The Catcher in the Rye is a peculiar and comical novel about Holden Caufield and his turbulent days before christmas vacations  In these days  Holden is once again kicked out of collage  this time from Pency Prep  a boys school  Holden is telling his stressful experience about his lone days in New York City  In his High School  Holden finds many people phony  even his only friend  Ackely  One night  after a Softball game  he is beat up by his own roommate and decides to leave Pency immediately  this is when his adventure in cold New York begins  As nights of drunkenness and loneliness pass  Holden becomes depressed  His distress with the stupidity and phoniness of the world makes him spend his last day wandering about  he visits his little  sister s school and remains bothered with the world  for it is a cruel world to grow up  Holden begun to see himself as a saviour of children  this is when he had the vision of The Catcher in the Rye  A guard at the edges of a field where children are running  and he sees himself catching them if the children fall over the fields edges  Holden s adventure has many moments  and although we cannot see the whole journey until he reaches the mental institution from which he tells his life  it is a compelling story   Probably my favourite book and one that I never tire of reading  which has been around 5 times now Reviews of this novel often simplify it as  teenager vs   phonies    which is a shame because it is about so much more  It is a book that many people in the world can really identify with In fact  identity is one of the key themes in this book  as the protagonist and anti hero Holden Caulfield struggles to find his  The first person narration  complete with 1950s colloquialisms  which always seem to subconsciously drip into my conversations the next few days   give us Holden s take on a world full of lying  selfishness and corruption  which he gets inevitably  perhaps hypocritically involved in  It is this feeling of alienation and identity crisis that I find people can relate to  and appreciate they re not    alone in their alienation I suppose This is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging read and a book I will no doubt pick up again very soon  Sleep tight  ya morons   In the 8th grade I was surprised about the stuff Holden was doing at a young age  But he was doing bad  On his 4th school and on his way of being kicked out again  Holden was I would say a 2 faced person  He had his caring side for some people and he also hated or disliked them at the same time  Like Ackley for instance But beside s that this book is one of my favorite books  I d most defiantly put this book in my Top 10   Easily one of the best books I ve ever had the pleasure of reading  only a handful of books have left me with a smile on my face and that sense of inner gratitude for having witnessed first hand what true literary genius really is all about  Couldn t recommend this more  This book was one of the best ones from my school reads list  Read it in two days and it really intrigued me  I hope that I will read it someday again    I admit  I cheated  I read up on the theme of Catcher in the Rye while I was halfway through The point here  though  is that I actually understand it  and I understand Holden  even though I disapprove of most of his habits It s fun to talk to your friends about The Catcher in the Rye  it really is  The language  and the over the top hyperboles  And the casual ease with which the entire story comes  It made me feel giddy  depressed  terrified and relieved in almost the sam breath  It s been a long time since that happened All in all  an awesome book  It is one of the greatest books that I have ever read First I read this books in 2009  I read it for fun then  My husband recommended it to me saying that it is such a book that whether you like it or not  The author s style was so different  I have never read such a book  I loved it  10 days ago I took the book to read to cheer myself up  I must confess that this time I understood the meaning of the book  There are so many things told between the sentences  Holden says that Ackley  wouldn t get out of his light   but he himself stands right  in Stradlater s light  He calls almost everybody  phony   but he himself is a phony  We are all phonies  Only kids are not phonies  That is why he wants to become a catcher in the rye There are a lot of qoutes I like in the book  But one about cheap suitcases  killed me   And Mr  Antolini s advice about human behavior To sum up  it is a great book to read    I highly dislike Holden Caulfield  This book was interesting when he was leaving school and there was hope that he was going on an adventure  In the end all he ends up doing the whole book is complaining  It is all I don t like this and movies are boring nothing is good enough for him  Holden comes off as a petulant child  if it doesn t matter to him then it doesn t matter  While his story about his little brother Allie tugged at my heart strings I feel that this should make him realize how precious life is and instead of always finding displeasure in everything find the things that bring you joy The end of the book was a surprise  but lets be honest there is not a person that reads this book that doesn t think he is at least a little crazy  The fact that he is slightly insane does explain a few of the rants he went on in the novel along with constantly changing his opinion about everything  One minute he would be in love next minute he would hate everything around him  At the end of the day I found Holden Caulfield extremely exhausting  While I believe that this is a book that should be read by everyone due to the weight that it carries in our culture it will bring you to your wits end trying to figure out why anyone would associate with Holden Caulfield   Definitivamente ame este libro  usualmente me suelen aburrir las historias que no tienen mucha accion o un problema grande el cual resolver pero  sin duda  este es mi excepcion  Ame a Holden  su manera de percibir el mundo  las personas  los problemas y sin duda su personalidad  Jo  es que aunque hubiera veces que me pareciera un cretino extranamente me agradaba  supongo que fue porque tenia motivos para serlo con ciertas personas que en serio lo merecian   Si alguna vez me preguntaran a que personaje literario sacaria de un libro evidentemente seria Holden  sin pensarmelo dos veces  5 5 outlook on life and peoplepiss of doubt and superiority complex Oh yeah  and fuck you  John Green  John DixonIt s a book that will leave you in the middle of the desert with nothing and no one but yourself and your goddamn internal narrator  I love and hate this arrangement of words  The Catcher in the Rye  by Salinger is definitely an excellent book  which pleasantly narrates the story of a 16 year old boy called Holden  The story recounts the days following Holden expulsion from school  after fighting with his roommate because of a girl  In New York  he finds the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him almost unbearable  and struggles trying to protect himself from the pain and disappointment of the adult world  Holden stands on the cliff separating childhood from adulthood  trying to be the  catcher in the rye  by not letting children fall in this gap between innocence and hypocrisy   The book is perfectly written  and like every other Salinger s book  everything is there for a reason  With a lot of inter texts  Salinger makes it easier for the reader to understand  During the whole book the reader knows what Holden feels and thinks  which makes the book more interesting and descriptive  Holden s struggle in the book make you think about life in general  and how the world is far from perfection  full of hypocrisy and people trying to take advantages from others  You can also see a lot how Holden misses his dead brother Allie  which was the most intelligent in the family according to Holden  In this quote for example  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   You can see how Holden talks directly to the reader  talking about what he learned with all the bad things that happened to him  Finally  I really would indicate this book to other people  as every page will make you reflect in a different way and you ll think about things you never though   My experience with this book has been quite singular  I read it for the first time during my angsty early teenage years  and felt utterly disappointed  I thought it wasn t anywhere near what I had heard it to be  There is my first mistake  I stupidly built up expectations in a complete wrong direction  because I believed what others told of it  which I later discovered to be utterly wrong  they just didn t pay any attention   My second mistake I guess  was that I read it in my native language  Spanish  I don t think there s a way to convert Holden s personality correctly by means of a translation  I m simply not sure there s a way to do it  Anyway  after all these years I begin to comprehend the fuzz  After all these years  much older  much more mature  I can relate a whole lot more to Caulfield than I did when I was supposed to  It brought me back to the times when I was still absolutely clueless about myself  but shedding light to it  I thought   now I get it   And indeed I do  Both the book and myself   Possibly my favorite book as a teenager  but I was never sure why  I know it had something to do with the language   the free wheeling use of swear words and such  There was something freeing about the unfiltered track of Holden s thinking and Salinger s narration style  My youth was not one of teenage angst  so that aspect didn t apply  It was a new style of writing  different from traditional lit  Today s Diary books have a foundation from Catcher Reading it for a second time several decades later  I was still enthralled with the use of colloquialisms and  inappropriate  language  I m not sure it stays at the top of the heap of my books  but still worthy of 5 stars  This book was overall good  I kept my attention the whole time  I loved how it has an underlying meaning and so much of the books connects with the time period it is written in  It was an interesting book and I would recommend to read it   More of my reviews at http   itisabookthing blogspot com OVERALL Plot 17 20Characters 17 20Creativity 17 20Writing 19 20Pace 9 10Ending 7 10 86 100 B 5REViEW I began reading this book after one of English professors recommended it  Therefore  I was in the thick of essays and tests when I began reading it  However  this book  through revered as a  classic   did not add extra stress as I originally thought  Instead  this book was a super fast and fun read  I must say that this book has no defined plot  but this book did not need it  This book chronicles Holden as he treks around New York trying to find his place in the world  This is not a unique premise and  to be honest  this book wasn t spectacular  However  this book did have something that not that many books have  hilarity  Numerous times throughout the novel  I laughed out loud because Holden says some hilariously stupid and witty things  Plus some of the scenes in this book are just gold in the laugh department  like when Holden hired a prostitute  I just about died laughing   Basically  the best thing about this book is that it is straight up funny  However  I do believe that this book is much funnier the younger you are and the more able you are to relate to Holden s confusion on life  Moving on  Holden is the leading man of this book  Many critics think Holden is annoying and whiny  and while I can t say they re completely wrong  to me it added to the hilarity of the novel  This is most likely because I  like most college kids  have felt lost and confused about my future and my life  I did especially like how Holden is not just a crazy  stupid kid that dropped out of school  On the contrary  his character goes a little deeper than that  The most moving scenes in this book occurred when Holden talked about his brother  Allie  or interacted with his sister  Phoebe  I absolutely adored Phoebe and Holden s dynamic and even just the characterization of Phoebe  She is just like the little sister I always wanted  Quite honestly though  if you pick up this book  you re either going to laugh out loud and enjoy Holden s spontaneity  like me  or abhor this novel  like most of my friends I personally believe you should give this book a chance  It is a quick  easy read and is easy to dive into  This may not be the most emotional or deep book you ve ever read  but Salinger did not fail to meet his goal of entertaining the reader  This novel encompasses a feeling of confusion that everyone faces in their life  Sure  the events of this novel are a tad outlandish  but what fun would a novel be without a little bit of adventure  My Favorite Part  The hilarity of this novel ALL iN ALL Do I recommend this book  Yes  however  I do believe it is best suited for adolescents  As one of my English professors put it  If you want to have a chance to enjoy this book  you have to read it while you re young  because once you get older you miss your opportunity to relate to the confused Holden   For a book in which nothing much happens it has certainly caught many a readers imagination over the years I first read the opening page in an Eng Lit class as an example in how to set the scene and draw the reader in  I asked the teacher what the book was as I was interested and you could see the glint in her eye as she thought  I ve got through to one   And thank goodness she did  Again this is a book of texture and tone rather than content and plot as there isn t a great deal of the later two  Mix up teen goes on a bender  that about sums things up  But the book is more than simple plot as the voice  main character Holden Caulfield  and the way it describes things is where they joy is to be had   I thought this was book was quote good  I really enjoyed reading it and thought the plot was really good and was something I could really relate being sixteen myself to Holden Caulfield and his journey throughout the book from Pency Academy all the way to the carrousel in Central Park  At the same time though I felt that things could be taken away from this book no matter what age you are  Also the writing really flowed well and was put together in a way that just really seemed to fit with the plot  I would recommend this book to everyone  but especially those reader who are fifteen of sixteen because the novel will carry the most weight with you  I found one of my best fictional friends with this book  Read this and you ll be able to know him  Holden Caulfield was talking to me  and he made me feel understood and not so lonely  though he was pretty lonely himself it is books like that that makes one feel understood and not so lonely  it assures you that there are people out there  who think like you and feel like you even if you have never met them  they are there  and no one  is alone  I was pretty sure it was a good idea to re read the books I had to read for school  not that I REALLY read them  more like got a summarized version and since they were compulsory it automatically meant I wasn t gonna like them  Especially the case with  Catcher in the Rye  and  The Great Gatsby  because I had to study them in two separate subjects  Anyway back to the book  it s one of the hardest things for me to scrape up some semblance of a review for books that I really  really like  simply because you can never adequately put in words the way something makes you feel and make the others feel it too  This book definitely deserves several re reads because there are so many things inside it  That s the exact reason why I absolutely love Salinger  his writing seems so simple but it all goes so much deeper behind that veil of simplicity  On the surface the book seems like Holden Caulfield s very long rant but when you get into it you just notice it s so much more  And Phoebe  I just adore her  she s this little kid with the brain of an adult and every time I try to picture her it makes me melt inside  All I can say is quote Holden Caulfield and say   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though    One of my very favorite books  I have re read it a few times  This book breaks my heart  The part at the end  where Holden watches Phoebe on the carousel trying to grab the gold ring  I know this scene has been dissected in countless high school English classes   but the hope of this moment is restorative  All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring  and so was old Phoebe  and I was sort of afraid she d fall off the goddam horse  but I didn t say anything  The thing with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them  Holden realized that he cannot be the catcher in the rye  preventing all the kids from falling off the cliff  He had to let Phoebe live and risk   and he had to start doing the same  too  He had to let Allie go  There wasn t a damn thing he could have done to stop the leukemia from killing his brother  You can t control life  Its funny  how people either love this book or hate it  if you want to know the truth  I don t know what to think about it  Just the way holden didn t  At some part of the book I thought caulfield was the luckiest kid on earth  then I pitied him  then I hated him  then I fell inlove with him  Now  I don t know While reading this book I had an incident though  we were in this shopping center  and suddenly the people all around me started on looking super phony and pointless  It depressed the hell out of me and we had to leave immediately  I m not saying anything   Also we were talking about holden with my psychiatrist and he pointed out his  obvious  loneliness but even worse his anger  Eventhough my psychiatrist is convinced otherwise I find my and holdens anger pretty similar  I also see his confusion about people  about his future and the sad thing is I see it cuz I have the same confusion  Anyways  eventhough I gave this book 5 stars  its cuz I give every book 5 stars  I don t know what to give this book  rwy  wSfy  l qS  Hdwdh   lbshr l  shkl lhm l wSf   HDrwn b smy hm w shy in mn Tb hm   kl m kn HDr an fy hdhh lrwy  hw lskhry  mn

You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose   I have to be honest  I ve never wanted to punch someone on the face as badly as I was reading this book  Holden Caulfield  the main character of the story  is this 16 year old bad mouthed  cigar smoking  minor drinker who s currently having an identity crisis and had a lot of angst  He mainly concerned about how to escape from the eyes of his parents because he got sacked from his school and it s not his first time  He is this sort of teenager who has a serious trust issues and couldn t fully believe on any of his surroundings  I have to say that I did felt a connection there and he may be an exaggeration version of myself  I really did pity him  A truly honest coming of age book  that should be read especially by teenagers but I m already in my 20 s now so I guess it doesn t really matter     This novel has been one i ve intended to read for some time  and the hype it has received is not undeserved  An interesting dynamic character who is realistic  and a plot line in a small time frame but full of interesting event  Definitely one of my favorite reads  I think that the more I read this book  the more I like it  I m currently teaching it for the second year and am realizing the controversy that comes along with it  I didn t realize I would be fighting the administration and parents of my school to keep this book on the sophomore reading list  It s about a 16 year old boy in the late 40 s early 50 s who is completely lost in the world and is nervous about the transition from childhood to adulthood  He is a character that the reader is supposed to dislike  he cusses  he s negative  and he does some down right idiotic things  The story begins with him in some type of hospital  looking back on the a week of the past year of his life when he thinks everything went wrong  He gets kicked out of his prep school and decides not to tell his parents that he has to come home  He leaves before winter break and has about 3 days to kill before his parents will receive notice that he has been kicked out  The majority of the book takes place in these 3 days where the reader follows Holden around NYC while he is trying too hard to be an adult  drinking  swearing  hanging out with older women   but at the same time trying to preserve his  his kid sister Poebe s  and other children s innocense  The end of the novel comes full circle to where he is at the beginning of the novel  It s a great book for boys because it has a typical 16 year old boy narrating  discussing school  girls  sex  drinking  and the pressures of being a teenager  While the book does have a lot of profanity and some adult issues  the whole purpose of Salinger putting Holden in these positions and making him cynical is for the reader to criticize his negative outlook  immaturity  and poor decisions   I chose this book from the summer reading list for Honors English 11  American Literature    partly because it was one of the shorter ones  I ll admit  I was aware that there was a lot of hype about this book  though   it s supposed to be great for teenagers  I wasn t as impressed with it  though  Maybe because the main character was a male  I had trouble relating  Nevertheless  it is a good book  a classic  and I think everyone should give it a shot  Edit  My review after reading it for a second time  four years later   September 15th  2015  This time around I read this book for Young Adult Literature  Whereas before I thought it was  overrated   now I think it is  appropriately rated   In my first review  I stated that I had difficulty relating to the protagonist  Holden  because of his  male  gender  However  this time I found myself definitely relating to him   and I was almost in tears reading a certain part  I think the experiences I have had since my first reading of this novel have shaped my connection to Holden  Additionally  I really enjoyed Holden s narration  I found myself laughing at some parts  He is very easy to listen to  conversational   just like a teenager   and hilarious  The close insight into his life is a special experience   This is my third time reading it  The first was in high school when we got to choose a classic to read by ourselves and keep a journal about our thoughts and feelings about the book as we went though it  I felt like it fully captured the teenage angst I was feeling as a twerpy overdosed on hormones teenager  I read it again when I was around 23 or so because I remembered how much I enjoyed it the first time  Maybe I d built it up too much in my brain but I didn t enjoy it that time  I m reading it again and loving it again  It s a unique book from others I ve read in that it s not about anything  It s very stream of consciousness  which would typically annoy me  But it has some  it  factor that I ve never been able to place my finger on  It has something that depressed  angst ridden people relate to and it s somehow soothing  I can t describe what it is I like about it because I don t really know  at certain times in my life and when I have certain mood shifts Holden Caufield just gets me    or I get him  I m not sure which             5 5           GIF   note below inserted on April 2015 Today  I browsed my copy and reread some parts I FOUND THIS CRUCIAL IN HIGHSCHOOL  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody    April 2015                REVIEW  SUMMER 2014This summer  i intend to read a lot of literary winning books like those that students abroad study for their English classes  you know  like The Great Gatsby and the likes The Catcher in the Rye is deeply realistic  it would make you realise that all the things stated in the book are achingly true  in life  Thus  making you learn more  and appreciate  This fits a lot for young adult readers  for this could inspire students and lousy ones who don t wanna study for a good cause  anyway i m not saying this as some sort of motivating guidance counsellor  i m just a high school student too so i really know how it feels to be lazy doing home works and all  Anyway  let s get with the characters  Holden Caulfield is the center of this book  thus being the main character  He was introduced as a student who flunked all his subjects at his school called Pencey  aside from his English subject  He got kicked put from his two other schools  He has this two babes  Jane Gallagher and Sally Hayes  And his sister Phoebe  a ten yr old girl  his brothers Allie died  and D B who s a writer and lives at Hollywood Everything in this book achingly depicts real life  all i did was read it continuously and agree to what it says  Most of the parts inspired me  like   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one     I loved hated this book  loved it because it vividly explains the mind of a teenager and a few young adults  including myself  I get the dude  cause a LOT of people are phony one way or another  hated it because Holden Cauflield was a grumpy sour bastard at the ripe age of sixteen  and yet as I am writing this  I can t help but love it more with each keystroke  cause in the end  we ALL have a little Holden Caulfield within us  an antisocial disposition with a desire to live free and careless in a cabin  forbidding any semblance of phony ness in our presence  She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass   Strictly a phony   The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to ve met each other  Which always kills me  I m always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though   Like fun you are   If you want to know the truth  I can t even stand ministers  The ones they ve had at every school I ve gone to  they all have these Holy Joe voices when they start giving their sermons  God  I hate that  I don t see why the hell they can t talk in their natural voice  They sound so phony when they talk   I took a look out the window before I left the room  though  to see how all the perverts were doing  but they all had their shades down  They were the heighth of modesty in the morning   Then I watched the phonies for a while   These intellectual guys don t like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless they re running the whole thing  They always want you to shut up when they shut up  and go back to your room when they go back to their room       the thing he was afraid of  he was afraid somebody d say something smarter than he had  It really amused me   All of them swimming around in a goddamn pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and being charming and phony  I wished to God I hadn t even phoned her  When I m drunk  I m a madman    It s highly probable   he said  Witty bastard  All I ever meet is witty bastards   He didn t know what the hell I was talking about  so all he said was  Oh  and took me up  Not bad  boy  It s funny  All you hav eto do is say something nobody understands and they ll do practically anything you want them to do   Old Phoebe didn t say anything  When she can t think of anything to say  she doesn t say a goddamn word   You can t teach somebody how to really dance   I kept wishing  though  that he d continue the conversation in the morning  instead of now  but he was hot  People are always hot to have a discussion when you re not    While I was walking  I passed these two guys that were unloading this big Christmas tree off a truck  One guy kept saying to the other guy   Hold the sonuvabitch up  Hold it up  for Chrissake   It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a Christmas tree  It was sort of funny though   I folded it about ten times so nobody d open it  You can t trust anybody in a goddamn school    People in my class very much disliked this book  But  as a person with ADD and Depression  I somehow connected with the things that the main character was thinking and that made this a very enjoyable book for me  We read this while exploring the american dream in my American Literature class  I loved the book  I read this book many years ago when I was in high school and I just read it again recently and it still holds true A lot of people are making reviews because they hate the narrator  but in my opinion I think that was the whole point of creating such a character  Holden Caufield is the kind of individual that people in society hate  one that doesn t assimilate and cannot accept the culture that we live in and chooses to rebel  oftentimes melodramatically  to situations  What people don t seem to understand  what I noticed a lot of negative reviews came from people who didn t read this book with an associated literature class and of course didn t interpret a lot of the meanings   Holden is an unreliable narrator and spews out whatever he happens to come to mind  He s just the sort of person that you want to grab and say  THIS IS LIFE DEAL WITH IT  but he won t listen to you The book is fantastic when you take the time out to look at it and spend some time outside of the reading to look up the themes and motifs  Sparknotes I believe has it on their website   But if you re looking for light and easy reading while you re on the subway or right before bed  it s not your book   I can t believe that I m giving a classic 5 stars  I usually hate classics   but lo and behold  I am  This book really does deserve five stars though  I mean  it s not something that I d pick up normally at the library or the bookstore  It s cover isn t pretty  though it s still intricate and beautiful   it doesn t have a blog at the back  so there s no way of knowing what it s about  There are many reasons that this book wouldn t be read by the average Young Adult  But if you read it for school or something  you realize that it s well worth the read This book is actually banned in some states  meaning that it s not provided by public places like schools and libraries  Cool  huh  Of course it is   That s  cause the main character  Holden  uses so much bad language in this book it s funny  When it first came out  all the parents were scared of how it might influence their kids  That one point would have been enough to make me this book  Did you know that Harry Potter is also on the banned book list  Who would have thought    not me Okay   I m way off topic  But it s not like anyone s gonna actually pick this review to read   right  And if you re reading this boring and nonsensical review  then hats off to you  And by the way  you re crazy   and probably one of the first people to read any of the stuff that I write  But enough with the compliments  we don t want you becoming an airhead So basically  this book makes you laugh and cry and sneer and snivel  and  ignoring the middle two paragraphs   I just want to say that this book is amazing and should be read by all young adults and forced on high schoolers all around the world   but only where the speak English  of course     I just finished reading  Catcher  for the second time and it s more of a haunting read than what I first imagined  It s a very good book if you can tolerate the legendary protagonist and anti hero  Holden Caulfield  Holden s narration is obnoxious as he tends to repeat himself  A LOT  But his narration captures the breathtakingly bleak world of postwar New York City in which he lives in  This is a classic example of teenage alienation and angst  this book And it couldn t have been written at a more perfect time  Just a few years before James Dean hit it big in  East of Eden  and  Rebel Without A Cause   the latter in which angst and alienation are very dominant themes   Catcher  was published and gained notoriety amongst the country  Nobody had ever read anything like it  Was it a book for children  or adults  Was it a psychological book or just a shallowly written piece of garbage  The book was arguably the first book that changed the way we looked at the world  And the most haunting part of the book is that we see the world in which we live in through a teenager s eyes Say what you want  but I think this book is a timeless classic  5 stars  i love this book more than i love smoothies Holden Caulfield is a troubled boy in a boarding school  This is one of three boarding schools he s been to  The story is about him  being kicked out of boarding school and him  trying to make a life out of what little he has left  He tries to act older and goes to bars and has a drink  he walks around at midnight trying to figure out what he wants to do and whether he should go home early and tell his parents  One of the reasons he really tries to contact home or even go home is because of his younger sister  who he really cares for  He wants to know what she s up to and wonders if she s ok  He uses his judgment and makes up his mind  The Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books I have ever read  I liked this book because its realistic and the events that happen in the book relate to what happens or can happen to other people  Even though I can t really relate it to my life in all the events that happens to him  it seems like in many ways it does relate to my life  z mn prsyd drbrhy yn chyzhy y khh hmyn ln bry shm t ryf khrdm   chh fkhr mykhnm

empathize with Holden as he gets mistreated and approached by phonies from his school and the adulthood who nine out of ten approach him with ulterior motives  Holden wants to be a catcher in the rye  so when kids are playing carefreely in the big field he can protect them from falling into the cliff  as he  approaching his unavoidable and fierce adulthood  vanguards Phoebes  innocence from the corruption of experience   I cannot even begin to emphasize how important that every person in the world should read this book  Catcher in the Rye is one of the greatest novels ever written that showed all things controversial  sex  mental illness  depression  vices  and failure  Holden was an anti hero that I found myself rooting for  and secretly admiring despite his obvious shortcomings  The idea of him choosing to exist  and fighting through life despite everything was truly admirable  His love for his sibling also resounded in my heart on a personal level   The truth is  I don t like doing book reviews on literary pieces that have touched me on a personal level  The objectivity disappears into thin air  and the point of doing one becomes useless  However  this isn t really a review in its literal form  but rather an endorsement  This book has to be read by EVERYONE  This literary gem is a classic that should be read many times over because the more you would dig through its meaning  Wonderful book   I really liked this book  I could go on and on about the deep philosophical meaning of he book and its very good message  but I won t  The writing style of the author is probably one of the best things about this book  and it s pretty much impossible to forget  Holden is a wonderfully animated and dynamic character  His cynical perception of everything around him is just wonderful  and is actualy underlined in those few moments when he is actually positive  i think this is one book that i will remember for a long time   Catcher in the Rye  By  J D  Salinger Review by Talmadge Irvin J D  Salinger did not grow up in the same time period as I am in now  but through his character Holden Caulfield I could really identify with the problems that frustrated him on a daily basis while he was in or outside of school   Catcher in the Rye  is the story of Holden Caulfield telling of his past experiences while preparing to make his journey back home from the school he is being expelled from  Holden Caulfield tells things how they are and what they should be according to him  The book introduces you to many characters  but the nonchalant  what ever  attitude of Holden is what made this book really hard to put down  Holden really goes deep into his problems instead of leaving you wondering and just scratching the surface  Holden constantly thinks of a girl named Jane Gallagher that he grew up with  He sort of had a secret crush on her but was very nervous to talk to her   I think I ll give old Jane a buzz   He first mentions Jane to us when his roommate at Pencey Prep  Ward Stradlater  comes back from a date with her  This constant reminiscing of Jane gives the reader something to anticipate in future chapters of the book  Holden talks of his actual encounters with his peers at school  People like Sally Hayes  Robert Ackley  and Ward Stradlater were big parts of Holden s school life  Holden has his fun by going to bars  hanging with associates  and smoking cigarettes  He seems to hate school but have two encounters with teachers that made a difference in his life  Mr  Spencer was the only teacher whose class Holden liked at Pencey Prep  Mr  Antolini is the other teacher that impacted Holden by giving him great advice  Robert Ackley is a supposed character that irritates Holden  but Holden uses him as a companion for help and advice  Holden was very descriptive of the characters that we are introduced to giving us stimulation in our creativity to be able to actually picture them  He describes Ackley as   He was one of these very  very tall  round shouldered guys  he was about six four with lousy teeth   Family is very important to Holden  You would infer that I mean his parents  However  Holden really cares for his sister Phoebe and little brother Allie  Holden also mentions his big brother D B  that is away in Hollywood  Many characters are mentioned but Holden being the protagonist is the most important  We get to know him the best and the way his mind works  The overall theme of the book is one of rebellion that is demonstrated through Holden s actions and words  There is also a big sub theme of being real with people  Holden complains terribly of phonies that engulf his surroundings giving the reader the opportunity to identify their problems with his  Holden doesn t directly address always being real which is why this book opens up the possibility to interpreting your own life lessons  Holden was your typical rebel  He came from a very good background  His family was pretty wealthy and his parents cared a lot about his education to send him to three good schools  His sister was very intelligent and could relate to Holden although she was very much younger than him  His little brother was perhaps the brightest kid that he ever met and always kept a positive outlook on things  His older brother served in the military and became a successful writer  Holden is very interesting but you will also grow to love his sister Phoebe  She was Holden s best friend and was willing to do anything for him  She was the ideal sibling by being someone Holden could talk and enjoy himself with  She was very loving and understanding of Holden and was ready to go where ever with her big brother  Catcher in the Rye was published in 1951  but the things that went on in Holden s life seem to have foreshadowed things that you find in your everyday life  Our world today is full of phony people that do not intend on being real with people  Holden ideas about life did not agree with the standard ways of living  This is and incredible adventure about the journey Holden Caulfield takes from leaving Pencey Prep to returning home  He has many situations where he demonstrates lessons he have learned  If you want to find out if Holden matures as a character or remains nonchalant about his future  I strongly encourage you to read this book  This is the type of novel that makes you want to know what happens next   I ve never really been interested in reading this book but after falling in love with salinger s Glass family I thought I d give it a go and just wow  Catcher in the rye is the definition of coming of age novel  centred around angsty teenager Holden as he sneaks off to New York for a few days  It s funny and beautiful and real and lovely and tragic all at once  Holden is such a wonderfully dandy lovable character and everything about this story is just fantastic  jd Salinger is nothing short of a modern genius and I m pretty heartbroken I m almost done with reading all his stories  Kiriar KimballAmerican Rebel 1stMay 9  2008 J D  Salinger s  Catcher in the Rye  is an interesting story regarding a teenage rebel  named Holden Caulfield  set about fifty years ago  Holden begins by telling you about his school  and the fact that he has flunked out about four times  A couple days before Christmas break  Holden learns that he will not be attending Pencey Prep the next semester  and decides to go ahead and leave  The story goes on to describe his different activities and interests over the next couple of days in New York City  some of which include alcohol  sex  partying  girls  and his vivid imagination   I loved Catcher in the Rye the very first time I read it last year in my AP Language and Composition class  I loved it so much I decided to take American Rebel where we were required to read it again  This second time reading this book  I found some new things I did not notice before  or had just completely forgotten   Things such as when Holden reads the magazine article talking about if you have sores in your mouth that stay for a long time  you may have cancer  or what you should look like if your hormones are in good shape  I love how easy this book is to read and understand  It is a very easy read and I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading  This book is very different from all of the other books I have read  As much as I love this book  Holden Caulfield gets on my last nerve  He constantly repeats himself  which is somewhat aggravating  and is often very contradictory  He often says things such as   I m crazy  or  I really am  or  It really does   at the end of every sentence  The way Salinger has Holden speak as the narrator is the way people actually speak conversationally  however  it is somewhat awkward to read  The book really has no actual plot and no surprising things happen  It is just a story about a teenage rebel  who is searching for who he truly is  Holden describes many things and people as  phonies  and claims to hate them  however  I find Holden very phony himself  mainly with his contradictions and hypocrisy  Holden claims to not care what others think about him when I believe he actually does  He constantly worries about it and his various adventures in New York prove it I still have found this an interesting book to read because no matter how aggravating Holden is  practically all teenagers can relate to him  Teenagers these days do not know who they are or what they want to do in that point in life  just like Holden  however  most are not as lost as he is  The main conflict in this book is Holden trying to find himself  Catcher in the Rye is filled with many other interesting characters  none of which are like Holden in any way  His sister Phoebe is the most understanding and his favorite person throughout the course of the story  Most of the other people Holden encounters he considers phonies such as his roommates at Pencey  some old friends from other schools and even some teachers at Pencey Prep Another interesting thing about Holden Caulfield is his ability to lie  This is one of my favorite things about this novel  Holden is definitely  one of the most terrific liars you ever saw in your life   He does it without thinking  it is just completely automatic   If I m on my way to the store to buy a magazine  even  and somebody asks me where I m going  I m liable to say I m going to the opera  It s terrible   The thing is  Holden realizes he lies all the time and really does absolutely nothing to stop it  This is another very common thing throughout the book  I love how sometimes it is hard to tell what he really means when he says certain things  Holden is very sarcastic and playful  and often likes to try to mislead the reader and characters in the book  This is possibly one of my favorite books of all time  The difference in character and writing style are some of the most intriguing parts of this book   The one thing I really enjoyed about the Catcher in the Rye is the first second person point of view  On all of my notes I found myself simply talking back to Holden  asking HIM questions and using words like  you  and  we   I also felt to have some similar feelings as Holden  I have similar senses to see the phoniness in everyone around me  The difference is that I realize that I have some level of phoniness myself and do not deserve to be better than anyone else  The main parts that stuck out to me were the generalizations that Holden made about people  1   People never notice anything   2   People never believe you   3   People always ruin things for you   4   People never give your message to anybody   5   People never think anything is anything really   These 5 things I called Holden s rules of truth  Although they are considered generalizations  they are very specific at the same time  Holden had all of these perks that drove his attitude  and he made these generalizations based on specific experiences that he had encountered that are actually pretty common for all of us  Most people would not make these statements because of the fact that they are too specific to be generalizations  I liked how he got down to the small facts of the youth experience  I found myself going   OHH YEAAAHH  that happened to me too     So  I really liked his perspective  but he was still selfish and did not realize that he was the same  He was trying to inspect everyone else rather than himself  which is MOST important in your teenage years  Overall  I really liked the book  Catcher in the Rye is the story of a teenager  Holden Caulfield  who tells us about a few days of his life after he got expelled from school  it is a marvelous story with a unique style and an intriguing plot  I believe this is one of my favorite novels Even though I loved this novel  I cannot say it would appeal to everybody  For one thing  its language is not proper  and is full of all sorts of swearing  Additionally  nothing much really happens in the story  so people who like stories with lots of action might not like it  The interesting aspect in this novel is the depth of character that Holden had  and your own reflection on this character  At least that s how I see it I liked Holden  at least towards the end  It s true he is a failure  and he is so negative  yet there is a good guy inside him  His main problem is that he lives in a society with a different value system than his own  which is something we stop very little to think about  What the majority thinks is right is not necessarily the right thing  the best way of life might not be wasting over twenty  or maybe even thirty  years in formal education  I think the thing I loved most about this novel is that it is very real  Holden really exists  and we rarely even listen to guys like him and see how they think  The author made us hear Holden  and not just that  I felt bad when Holden decided to stop telling us more  I wish he did  This book is amazing  i ve read this one so many times even though i don t really reread books  every time i read it it feels like i m getting something new from it like i m feeling everything even more  like i m understanding another part of it each time like layers of an onion Even though i m not really much of a crier  I cried the first time i read it  not that it s too sad or anything because although there are some sad parts they re all pretty relatable and cool so it s more or less okay  i don t really like self pitying tragic heroes all that much but it s okay because our main character  when you get to know him properly is anything but I know some people might disagree with me here and think the main character is too angsty or  moany  but he s not  when you actually read it properly and take the time to think about it  and to think about what he s actually saying  he s really not  The messages in this book are beautiful and surprisingly really pure  yeah there are some mentions of sex and things but there s nothing too explicit really  it s about the main character Holden  who in my opinion is a pretty cool guy when he s not on a date with a hot girl or talking to an old peer from a former school of his  taking us through a couple of days in his sixteen year old life  just after he s been expelled from his prep school for not applying himself  or trying to  at all  it s not his first time being expelled from a school like that either  The book is really grounded in reality  the teenage Holden observes the world around him in a way that just makes sense  not like other books were the character s feeling alienated or is looking at the world with a childlike freshness that gets boring after a while  not even a little  it s something you just connect to  i guess because we know a lot of people like some of the ones he s describing  not exactly  but like them anyway  and when we don t we can imagine exactly what he s saying  it s powerful writing and it says a lot more in a sentence than some writers can say in pages of descriptions  Holden has a really dry sense of humour and the tone of the novel is really honest no matter how grim the reality of it is  no euphemisms  he just says it like he sees it it really speaks to you  He s going through a lot of things one of the things that really got to me was the part that talks about  the catcher in the rye  which is the title  I wont give too much of anything away but i will say this  he struggles with not wanting to grow up and become a phony like the ones he sees around him  he doesn t want to be a hypocrite to be false even though he s got a real bad habit of lying  it s that contradiction that makes him so interesting so human and real although i think you kinda have to read it yourself to get what i m saying here it s the fact that he wants to protect the innocence of children before everything crashes down around them  before bad things happen to them that makes them see the world the way it is too holden  before theyre forced to be adults and become phonies too  it s so desperate and impossible and real  like wanting a baby sister to go on believing in santa or fairies or magic for even just one more year i dont think i really articulated what i wanted to say right  here but what i really need to say about this book is  that i found this book to be really beautiful  and real  and relatable it was one of those books that you finish reading and the world just doesn t seem exactly the same to you  like the world won t ever be as good as it could be until everybody out there has read this book  and read it the right way  unbiased and unprejudiced  and just read it and felt it  Coz a good book isn t even something you read really  it s something you feel  or something you just    know  it s something that can change you and can make you think differently for maybe the rest of your life coz that what this book was for me  all that and more The first time i read it i started in the evening and stayed up till 5 a m  unable to put it down  and i looked out at the morning sky from my window it was that strong light blue colour that s just shy of light enough for morning but deep like there was a dose of midnight still in it  and i stood by my window ledge right after reading it and looked at the sky and thought about The catcher in the rye for a good few hours until the sky was full of birds being noisy and stuff and when it was all bright and daylight like  And i felt it  That the sky would never really look the same as it had before to me  that i d been changed  but not too abruptly and not in a bad way  i was just different after i read it that time And that s what the Catcher in the Rye was to me    E in parte e vero  ma non del tutto vero  La gente pensa sempre che le cose siano del tutto vere   Non posso dire di essermi trovato in sintonia con le scelte di Holden  ma dopo questa lettura ho una gran voglia di mettermi una cravatta  un soprabito e andare in giro per New York Ho apprezzato particolarmente il linguaggio  i nostri   ma dai   e   che figo   odierni impallidiscono di fronte a   infanzia schifa   e   tanto di cappello     ma anche il modo di pensare di Holden  di saper cogliere il bello e il brutto delle persone P S  Ho letto questo romanzo praticamente nello stesso arco di tempo in cui si sono svolte le vicende  ovvero nel finesettimana e successivo lunedi prima di Natale  Assurdo  This is probably the only book out of my favorites that I would not immediately jump to defend when somebody criticized it  I totally get why some people dislike it as much as they do  It s not for everyone  Holden Caulfield can be a pain in the ass and the writing style is very different  so I get why it just didn t work for some people But for me it just clicked  I have a lot of memories and  first experiences  attached to this book  it was the first book I read in English for example  while constantly looking up words in my Dad s old German edition  D   It was also the first book that showed me how fun classic literature can be  and how much fun it can be to take apart and analyze literature  Back when I was 14  I also identified with Holden Caulfield on so many levels  I found it absolutely fascinating how a teenager who grew up in such a different time and under completely different circumstances could have so many of the same thoughts that I had  That s still one of my favorite aspects of literature to this day by the way   the ability to make us feel connected to people we would never expect to connect with So  yes  This book means a huge deal to me  even though it s not something I would ever actually recommend   D Does anybody else have this slightly weird relationship with a book  Let me know  The Catcher in the Rye was first published by J D  Salinger in 1951  At that time it was a controversial publication  and a lot of people fell over it due the swearing and sexual content  Even 60 years after the first publication the topics that Salinger discusses are really relatable to every adolescent  and to my opinion  this is a must read  I believe that the Catcher in the Rye is the kind of book that you either love or hate  Personally  I LOVED it The narrator is the cynical sixteen year old Holden Caulfield  who is just expelled for the third time from prep school  He pretends that he is too cool to be associated with all the others in the world  They are either all phonies  or just boring  and too mainstream to waste too much time on  The combination of the cynical way of describing situations  and the humor that he uses to mask his insecurities  make Holden a wonderful protagonist to describe the insecurities every adolescent has  We all want to be unique  be loved  and be admired for who we are  and being regarded for the things we are good at  In our search of our talents and the choice of the direction in life where we are going  sometimes it seems easier to push all the others away  Just to avoid being confronted with your own faults and insecurities  And when you ve been pushing everyone away  and face yourself in the mirror  sometimes you must admit that your deepest desire is to be just like the others  and that you are actually looking for a way to fit in  just like Holden  What really knocks me out is a book  when you re all done reading it  you wished the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  The Catcher in the Rye Holden Caulfield in Chapter 3 I really relate to this book in my life right now  I feel the loss of innocence  the pressure of growing up  and not having an ambition to do anything other than save others from feeling how I feel   Love  love  love this book  Absolutely my favorite book of all time  Must read for anyone to describe a character who is as real as all of us  Holden Caulfield  you are the man  Pencey Prep School is like a machine that produces  little soldiers for the Emperor   See Little Shirley Temple s first movie But just like the kids on the merry go round  it is against the rules to let them know that some of them won t make it   Some of them will never reach the golden ring and some will fall off   but it is against the rules to warn them of this It is against the rules to tell students that they are only qualified to die in some phoney war   and some students will learn to treat their superiors like princes and be phonies and succeed because you will know how to play the game  But as these phonies rise to the top it will make a very crazy world to live in  The world that Holden finds himself in  The crazy world that Salinger lived in   The pretend that everything is alright   world  The phony world  Audiobook 16 february 2012  I read some of the other reviews  which was very interesting  and it seems to me  you need to be feeling or have been feeling the same as Holden  to appreciate the novel  I understand the critique of the book  but much of it expresses a lot of loathing to Holden  because he has issues and can be a pain in the ass  mostly because of these issues  And sure he undergoes a little change through out the novel  but in my opinion  he doesn t really get over some of his problems or start to understand all this fear  pain and anger he feels most of the time  This was also  in my opinion  what I see as a possible reason for hating Holden  Personally reading the Catcher in the Rye was like reliving some of my adolescence  And some of it also spoke to me the way I am today  The novel describes how alone you can feel in the world  How alienated you can feel from everybody else  which is a feeling I recognize SO well  and that s one of the reasons I really liked the book  Just like how you sometimes have to struggle to communicate in the most basic ways and even then it might not work  This was a HUGE problem for me as a teenager  and still is  to some extent  today  The way Holden feels trapped in his own mind  filled with confusion and rage over the littlest things  was very beautiful in a way  And especially the parts where he talks about the future and how he wants to live in a remote hut and fill peoples gas tank  or be a catcher in the rye was touching  And it s not a mystery why  it s because I frequently have the same turmoil in my head  about just leaving all behind and go live away form all the people that makes everything so complex  And I understand what a crazy person he is  and how paradoxal and double standarded he is  but that s not the point for me  The point is that many people feel this anxiety  and that Salinger was one of the first ones  to write about it in a language of modern young people  I heard this book on audio and the reader was great  I think my experience would be been very different if I had read it  He spoke excactly how I imagined Holden would talk Read 15th of october 2014 I still love this book  I think there are so many things i didn t get by listening to the audiobook version  Many small details that I probably wasn t listening to at the time  Yet I can t believe it s only two years since i heard it I wish somebody had given me this book when I was sixteen  It was a time in my life where I thought nobody else felt like me  And I see so much of Holden in myself  and all the stupid stuff you go through in the teen years  Both the phony stuff and the real stuff hehe  I got so pissed at him at the same time though for never realising the people who cared for him  getting pissed off when they showed him how much they needed him  Like Pheobe and his parents  Wanting to go away and never see them again  Some people do go away like in Sunset Park by Paul Auster and it pisses me off  It s so selfish towards your parents  but I understand that it s all you can t imagine when you re only sixteen    anyway that s why the book s so brilliant   it has to double sided story and the double standard of teenage angst mindset  and both sides are so true in my opinion  I think it s great that it s a classic and I hope many people in the future will read this book  How can you NOT love Holden  I first encountered the name  Phoebe  in this book  This book also taught me about prep schools  I thought they were an odd concept  This book was an enjoyable experience  I expected something on the John Lennon conspiracy and politics talk  yet I was wrong  There were funny parts  and the character was easy to relate to which he was meant to be   Still sometimes Hawthorne got on my nerves for complaining too much and  honestly everyone is phony at some point   Just finished my premier 2016 book  The Catcher In The Rye  i swear  there s No book i ever read made me feel lonely as this one  This book totally make you lonesome  that Holden kid  He really Did make you feel his loneliness  Such a great book   After all the different reviews and comments that I have read about this book  I am so glad I read it myself  It was ironic  I just started reading David Copperfield a few months before and the first sentence of The Catcher in the Rye  Holden Caufield states   If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth   Wow  did I laugh out loud when I read that  This book was meant for me to read now  I thought I had read it back in high school  and put it down in goodreads as  read  and only gave it three stars because I couldn t remember if I liked it or not  Well  of course I didn t remember because I had never read it  This rating has changed This was a journey through four days in Holden s life that was very interesting  Life in New York  hum  nice place to visit  but don t want to live there  The different comments I read earlier about The Catcher in the Rye was  Holden was a complaining spoiled kid    The dialogue was too repetitive   I empathized with Holden  really felt for him  Many of his statements were true  His main theme of phoniness was right on  It was too repetitive  That s what this story is all about  Holden s thought process His relationship with his sister  Phoebe  was the warmest and happiest parts of the book  His interaction with the nuns at the coffee shop counter was priceless  and the little boy walking along the curb singing was a significant scene  You could see the small windows of happiness within Holden in pieces like these  And it s funny that in reality  these small windows of happiness are out there throughout all of our daily lives  but we overlook them many times  In fact  the way he described his feelings about the museum was so accurate to the feelings I have had of past experiences  His appreciation of the simple things in life was evident in many instances Holden s sympathy for the kids at school who weren t as popular  who had the pimply faces  Holden seemed to be more compassionate towards them  In fact  he had compassion towards many of the unfortunate  and brought it out in descriptions of clothing and food  But  I interpreted an envy of those people in Holden because their lives seemed more simple  not striving for the big bucks  not keeping up with the Joneses  just living life  Not phony Now I have to say  I did not  get  The Catcher in the Rye title at first and did not understand the carousel horse on the front page  but as I read on it became very clear and the tears came streaming down my face  I love this book for so many intimate reasons that I can t get out here on  paper   I can really relate to Holden  Excellent read  Five star  Read this when I was considerably younger  and have reread it since   gives off the sensation that  Jesus I didn t know anyone else felt this way    I still end up finding some of its wisdom pop into my head  That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall half in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are  Girls  Jesus Christ    You think if they re intelligent and all  the other person  and have a good sense of humor  that they don t give a damn whose suitcases are better  but they do  They really do I know a few people who read this book and were bored by it  then month and months later they decided they liked it  I think those people can go to hell  Man I remember pulling down a smoke detector and having someone write  fuck you  on it   I envy my Goodreads friends who are able to dig deep beneath the surface of a book and give you insights to the themes  motifs  symbols and whatnot  Unfortunately reading between the lines is not my forte  I have enough trouble reading the actual lines themselves  I ll just ramble on relentlessly as usual then The Catcher in the Rye is the easiest to read complex book I have ever read  It is easy to just read it at face value  as a straightforward  bildungsroman  story and just get off the ride at the end of it with a sigh of satisfaction  or alternatively frisbee it into the bin   I am always happy to do that when reading for pleasure  Still  at certain points in the book things insist on jumping out at me  Holden Caulfield s thought processes are interesting  Here is a teenager who resents everything and everybody  including himself  Sound familiar  He is clearly an unreliable narrator but he can also be very perceptive and insightful  not to mention goddam hilarious  For example  Every time you mention some guy that s strictly a bastard  very mean  or very conceited and all  and when you mention it to the girl  she ll tell you he has an inferiority complex  Now I don t necessarily agree that this is true  every time  but it seems true enough to make me laugh  Certainly the novel starts off being just a funny witty silly irreverent story  Gradually the humor becomes darker and there is a tonal shift into melancholia  The narrative never entirely shed its sense of humor though  but there is usually a bitter undertone to all the sarcasms If you don t enjoy character centric fiction this book is probably not for you  It is all about characters  Not just Holden Caulfield himself but his sister Phoebe who is amazingly well developed given her brief appearances in the story  Then there is the kindly teacher Mr  Antolini  whose observation about how an academic education will  give you an idea what size mind you have  will always stay with me Salinger s flippant colloquial narrative style  via Holden Caulfield  is a pleasure to read and comes across as quite heartfelt and sincere  It is very tempting to start aping this style and write a crumby phony review  but it would kill me I swear it would  so I won t  I ll just tell you I got a big bang out of reading it and while I don t like to spend a lot of time analysing books The Catcher in the Rye made me think about certain issues so hard I wanna puke For some reason I am now in the mood for some Van Halen  The Catcher in The Rye is indeed a terrific story  You may wonder about the title  Well  that s the best part you need to find out yourself when you read this extraordinary book  To be honest  I have to say I didn t really think it was great as people said it was at first but then I still wanna finish it no matter what  And it s no doubt one of my sound decisions ever  You can easily see yourself in Holden  Well  maybe not all of you but at least me  yep This story actually is a simple story of young boy who has been struggling a lot about what he wanna do  about this chaos world with lots and lots of curses and swears The way he judges people is too cruel  He drinks and drunk  he smokes  he hooks up with lots of girls  schools kick him out so many times  he thinks about sex quite often  he lies about his age to come to the night clubs  He even judges religions too cynical  But the thing here is  you can t think Holden as a bad guy He just simply hates phony conversations  phony people  I am always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though    Lawyers are alright  I guess    but it doesn t appeal to me   I said   I mean they re alright if they go around saving innocent guys  lives all the time  and like that  but you don t do that kind of stuff if you re a lawyer  All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot shot  And besides  even if you did go around saving guys  lives and all  how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys  lives  or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer  with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over  the reporters and everybody  the way it is in the dirty movies  How would you know you weren t being a phony  The trouble is you wouldn t  Well  that s so true  I must say  Holden smile emoticonCharacter Mr Antonili said to Holden Don t you think there s a time and place for everything  I guess Antonili is a kind of person who lives by rules and standards as might like phony people that Holden doesn t really fond of Holden said to him   I mean you can t hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants you to  It s like a statement that a society and even a government can t force people to do something or act in some certain ways  There are too many complexity you can t just simply make it all the same And I love it when Holden donated the money to two nuns even he himself doesn t really like religions but he knows these two nuns are good people and they about to do a good thing for charity and that s all he cares about And I love the most about his sister Phoebe  She s the reason why he chooses to stay and tries to find a way through his messy life even in the end he still confused Just like young people  always need something or someone to hold us back to the ground  stay away from immediate and fancy but toxic thoughts and dreams And I truly love this part  It s so so like me  I don t hate too many guys  What I may do  I may hate them for a little while  like this guy Stradlater I knew at Pencey  and this other boy  Robert Ackley  I hate them once in a while  I admit it  but it doesn t last too long  is what I mean  After a while  if I didn t see them  if they didn t come in the room  or if I didn t see them in the dining room for a couple of meals  I sort of missed them  I mean I sort of missed them   Well  there are lots and lots of exceptional quotes I wanna post here but I don t wanna be a spoiler  You will feel all of it when you read this  You don t want to miss this one out  I m sure of it  Tengo que reconocer que siento una fascinacion especial por los libros prohibidos  En general los libros son unos objetivos peligrosos ya que nos hacen sonar con otras realidades y encierran ideas  pero solo unos elegidos se llevan el Sambenito de ser catalogados como prohibidos  Este libro de Salinger es uno de ellos  algo que no esta exento de ironia ya que es a la vez uno de los libros mas leidos y mas recomendados y su lectura forma parte de los estudios secundarios y universitarios de Estados Unidos El guardian entre el centeno narra la historia de Holden Caulfield  un adolescente de familia acomodada que no esta pasando por su mejor momento ya que acaba de ser expulsado del colegio  Antes de volver a casa decide pasar un par de dias en Nueva York  En estos dos dias conoceremos todos los pensamientos de Holden y las relaciones que mantiene con su familia  amigos  companeros del colegio y hasta con un antiguo profesor  unas relaciones marcadas por la peculiaridad de su caracter Holden es un chaval inteligente con un alto concepto de si mismo que le provoca dificultades para sociabilizar y relacionarse con los demas  un sentimiento de superioridad que destroza amistades y noviazgos  A eso tenemos que unirle un nulo interes por los estudios  falta de metas y una gran reticencia a aceptar la autoridad que hacen que el chico tenga un futuro bastante oscuro  Si  querido lector  basicamente tenemos una bomba de relojeria andante a la que normalmente llamamos adolescente Y precisamente ahi reside lo que hace tan popular a esta historia  Salinger nos muestra sin tapujos en un lenguaje directo que utiliza con naturalidad palabras mal sonantes lo que vive y siente este adolescente  con sus vicios y sus virtudes  desde sus estudios hasta su relacion con el sexo  Nos permite a nosotros  los lectores  asomarnos desde los ojos de Holden y recorrer con el las calles y algun antro de Nueva York buscando chicas e intentando conseguir alcohol mientras se fuma un cigarro  lo que precisamente trajo tan mala fama a la novela  En una sociedad conservadora y puritana que irrumpa un escritor con un personaje tan alejado del ideal de lo que tenia que ser la juventud tuvo que levantar ampollas Por si esto no fuera suficiente  El guardian entre el centeno cuenta con su leyenda negra  Parece ser que es el libro que todo buen asesino psicopata tiene en su mesilla  como lo fue en los casos de John Hinckley Jr   que intento asesinar a Ronald Reagan  y de Mark David Chapman  que asesino a John Lennon y quien se veia reflejado en Holden Caulfield en parte  La otra parte era en el Diablo ni mas ni menos Pero con leyendas negras o sin ellas  a este libro hay que acercarse y disfrutar de la historia que encierra  Hay que conocer a Holden  un gran personaje de la Literatura Universal  Ademas creo que esta historia hay que leerla dos veces en la vida  una cuando estas en plena fase de adolescencia y otra cuando ya eres un adulto hecho y derecho y tienes en el buzon facturas a tu nombre  Y es que al final todo depende del punto de vista Mas resenas y articulos sobre literatura en http   tiempoletras blogspot com es  Superbly ordinary  This is a book that resonates with everyone s experience of teenage hormones  Although there is nothing extraordinary on the surface in this book  it still keeps you wanting to read that one extra chapter a day  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a light read that still lets you think a bit Yep  I m one of those people that must always have a copy of this book on their bookshelves  Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   For the disenfranchised  the dispossessed  the lost ones  nuff said   Catching Adulthood Are you afraid of growing up  J  D  Salinger creates a perfect depiction of this thought through the mind of a teenager in the eyes of young Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye  A theme of obsession of preserving youth and preventing adulthood can connect with many different readers  beliefs  Although a rough and tough exterior is publicized  Holden Caulfield is truly just a young man afraid of moving on into adulthood  The theme of staying young is evident throughout Salinger s classic story  and young minds can definitely correlate to this thought process  Early in the book  Holden exclaims to himself   Boy   I said  I also say  Boy   quite a lot  Partly because I have a lousy vocabulary and partly because I act quite young for my age sometimes  I was sixteen then  and I m seventeen now  and sometimes I act like I m about thirteen  It s really ironical  because I m six foot two and a half and I have gray hair  I really do  The one side of my head   the right side   is full of millions of gray hairs  I ve had them ever since I was a kid  And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve  Everybody says that  especially my father  It s partly true  too  but it isn t all true  People always think something s all true  I don t give a damn  except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age  Sometimes I act a lot older than I am   I really do   but people never notice it  People never notice anything   Salinger 22   Holden tries desperately to act as if he is an older person  as if he is actually a maturing man  but in reality  the reader cannot believe this is true and neither can Holden  For instance  The name  Holden  even sounds like  hold on   This can extend the amount of evidence that Holden has no real intention of ever becoming an adult     SPOILER    All Holden really wants is to be a catcher in the rye  saving kids from falling off of cliffs while playing a little game  Therefore  this shows that he doesn t really want anyone becoming an adult  he wants to keep children from becoming adults  falling off the cliff of youth into adulthood     SPOILER    To conclude  Salinger perfectly depicts the inner mechanisms of a teenager s brain  The idea of growing up can be frightening to new young adults  and this book can definitely help show that denying advancement in life isn t really the best option  Catcher in the Rye is a timeless classic that perfectly portrays the life of a young adult  and should continue to be a classic for years to come   How can I comment on this book  I think I will first turn to my earliest recollection of it  my mother telling me that it was banned at her Catholic high school  I must have been in sixth grade  and the idea of censorship had never crossed my mind  How could people decide to restrict what other people read  I was so naive  now I know better  I immediately checked the book out of the library  still in sixth grade mind you  and embarked in a life long friendship with one of literature s consummate teenage iconoclast    Holden Caulfield  Caught in a world that is perhaps too much or too little  Holden  like everyone  must find out what he wants while sifting through the past  the present and the unknown future Every moment in this book  when I re read  is magical and poignant My favorite thing to do is make literary connections  and C in the R was the first text that helped me learn what an allusion is  It is fun to see who will dip into Salinger s genius for literary or monetary reasons  1  The awesome monologue in Six Degrees of Seperation by John Guare  2  Jake Gyllenhaal in The Good Girl  and 3  That weird Julia Roberts Mel Gibson film Conspiracy Theory Please add more notable C in the R connections  The book starts out a little bit slow and Holden kind of seems like an ignorant kid who just hates everyone  But once the book picks up you realize he is struggling internally which can really relate to certain young or even older readers  The authors writing style is very realistic and the characters talk just like they would in that exact time period and setting  Holden acts like a typical teenager who knows it all  but you find out more and more about his internal conflicts with himself  I loved the book  I m 17 and I don t relate to Holden in any way but it was really relevant to a lot of other teens  I liked it all together  if you wanna read this book you need to look past the cocky persona the main character gives off and try to figure what s actually going on  No khac biet voi tat ca nhung cuon sach toi da tung doc truoc day  thu hut toi ngay tu trang bia va den tung cau chu an chua ben trong  Co le chinh no

all time  Holden Caulfield is a fifteen year old boy who is kicked out of his boarding school  Instead of going home and informing his parents about the news  he goes to New York City for a few days  Here  he meets several different people who he does not really establish relationships with  He is a very serious and dark character  I m sure anyone would like to read the story about his experience and about his character  I highly recommend for everyone to read this book  If it helps in any way to encourage you to read it  I read this book in one week  That s how great it was  It s also a classic   Holden Caulfield has been described as an ancient child of sixteen  It would seem I am an ancient child of sixty five  I just finished this book today and while reading it dawned on me that I am Holden Caulfied  Holden s tumultuous three day epiphany in New York has taken me a wee bit longer  It has only been a short time since I have adopted the true perspective of an adult  I am an old child of naivete  whimsey  impulse and frozen with old losses  Just as Holden s acceptance of adulthood is finalized by his interaction love for his little sister  Phoebe  mine is in the endgame of becoming a grandma  I now am very clear as to who I am as an aging adult  One of the most moving couple of lines in this book for me is a thought of Holden s near the end of the story  He is watching Phoebe riding the carrousel in the park   All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring  and so was old Phoebe  and I was sort of afraid that she d fall off the goddam horse  but I didn t say anything or do anything  The thing with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   And so I shall let my grandchildren grab for the ring and smile  without comment  I now understand the difference between  catching  and  meeting  in the rye  A truly great read   2003  2005  2006  2007 i read this book once a year at least  its the quintessential angst book  it s highly trite that i identify with holden so much  but i can t help it  i have this crazy admiration for him and feel this bond  everytime i read this book i can t help but feel complete and content and i examine my life  i read it near the end of the year when it s cold outside and there is nothing better  i feel  holden stays the same year after year  while i change and i can look back at prior reads and notice the change in me  it s a pretty significant book within the chronology of my life  also  salingers writing is dead on  i hardly read anything where every word is prefectly placed  SLEEP TIGHT  YA MORONS     I LOVED IT AND ASHAMED TO SAY HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO GET ROUND TO READING IT KEPT HEARING ABOUT IT YES WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE PHONINESS BUT LETS SAY I LOVED IT WOULD BE UNDERSTATEMENT   I SUPPOSE U HAVE TO LOOK AT WHE N FIRST CAME OUT AND THE SCANDAL IT MUST HAVE ERUPTED WHAT SEX ALCOHOL TEENAGERS NEVER     TAKEN ME AGES TO WRITE THIS REVIEW AS ALWAYS STUFF TO DO I COULD FEEL EXACTLY AS HE FELT    THOUGH    I THINK THE BIGGEST CLAIM OF FAME IS THAT IT WAS MARK cHAPMANS FAVE BOOK HIM OF SHOOTING JOHN LENNON BUT REALLY SHO ULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM ANYMORE NORTARITY     If this book was being released today i doubt we would feel the same out rage we know what goes on and the big fascination to me is Salinger himself only written one book and then disapears umm reminds u of anyone harper lee    perhaps    we will wait and see who would dare do a follow up and on the whole think it is a good think  salinger never wanted a film made of it well done that man book is best     J D  Salinger s book   The Catcher In The Rye  was a fascinating book to read  As Holden would say   People never notice anything  this quote shows how Holden feels  he is basically saying that no one cares what he does which is very tipical from him because most of the time he keeps on saying how bad he feels and how lonesome he is  J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye astounded me with his simple and unique style The Catcher in the Rye is a perfect selection for all teenagers  this book talks about a tipical teenager who has a lot of conflicts in his life  This book illustrates a life lesson so teens could understand the basic idea of the need to connect with other people or simply other teens in order to make living in this world a bearable construct  Also the style of the author makes the book even greater for all teenagers because its written as if it was a sort of daily diary with an usual teen s phrases The characters in this book were really good  their lines make the story like if it happened like if there was really a holden who experienced all of these conflicts  One of my favorite characters in this book is Phoebe who plays as Holden little sister  Phoebe is a tipical school girl who is so adorable and wo loves Holden  J D Salinger made this book a real diary with real people in it I recommend this book to anyone but specially to teenagers because is a book we can all read and at some points we can somehow relate ourselves wit Holden  I honestly think this book was a masterpiece  Age hasn t affected this great classic at all  The main character is Holden caulifield  He s teen that really doesn t care about life  He leaves school with money and runs the streets  He takes part in underage drinking prostitution  and many other lewd activities  Holden is probably one of my most favorite characters ever in a book  I wouldn t really recommend this book to anyone nowadays  Mostly because my generation lacks the brain to understand something good  Really knocked me out It s too frustrating for me to try and get this stuff right so I m gonna leave my old review as is  I just wanted to add that my twin tells me all of the time about learning not to get so torn up about motivations of others  and everything else  that I forget how to move  She says it s being like Holden Caulfield  I have no idea how to do that  I m going to have to reread this   Laur put it better than that  Sorry  Lauren  for always making you sound dumb in my head when I remember stuff you ve said  For one thing  she is a lot less vague than that   There are just some things I never learned how to penetrate I think not getting the depression and loss of Holden Caulfield is the lack of knowledge what it means to feel like that on a regular basis and not being able to stop it  Not always with  good reason  that ll make someone else go  Ah  and feel it too   Your son died  Understandable  take the day off from work     Someone who thinks saying  Cheer up  or  Don t think like that  works probably doesn t know what it is like to tune into those particular frequencies  I know what it feels like to flail uselessly and end up right back where you started  or worse  I envy people who don t know that  actually  It s not a bad thing not to get that  if anything it just means you re probably lucky to not be wired that way   At least I ve always been able to give a shit about things  unlike my mother  That s a black hole abyss I m terrified to look into  The neverending staircase circles of getting absolutely nowhere  I did read The Catcher in the Rye in my teens  late teens  Nineteen  almost twenty   I don t have my finger on the pulse of trendiness  I can t even keep up with Morrissey s cool o meter  but I think they always love him in Mexico  at least   I didn t read it because of the supposed to do teen thing  I d not read school assigned books if I didn t feel like it  I also related to that feeling of not doing what you re supposed to do to make things easier on yourself stuff like doing homework  And then not having a very good reason for why not  Doing something else had made me happier  is all  I really needed the happiness of that moment  I d worry about later later and then I regretted earlier  You could say  Well  why didn t you just do that the first time  then   and you d probably be the person who really hated  Catcher   I remember reading  Catcher  during one of those depressed not knowing what to do times  have had so many I can t recall the exact one   It did help  At least I got that needed outside glimpse that wasn t telling what to do  but showing what was happening  and relating instead of feeling outsider  cause someone actually thought merely saying  Cheer up  worked   If only my grasps of getting it ever lasted long    If  Catcher  is ever forgotten about  someone is still probably loving it in Mexico  Don t ever forget about Mexico  A good friend of mine recently told me that teenagers are overrated  I d said something about not growing past that supposedly teenager Holden Caulfield stuff  Is it just settling  then I had a Holden Caulfield moment or two in my life  One time a Catholic Indian  from the country  not so dubbed  cause a white guy got lost Indian  My father would be the latter kind but I never talked to him so it s not him either  abruptly stopped speaking to me when it came out that I wasn t the same  I m not like the gr reader who often talks to prostitutes  though   I m seething with jealousy  don t you know it  Holden is wrong about the great author being the guy you d want to call up and be friends with  I d never wanna hang with Elizabeth Bowen or Virginia Woolf  I d hang with Bowen s husband and the Mexicans wearing Morrissey t shirts   Bowen s The Death of the Heart is my number one book for relatability for looking at the world and feeling left behind  though  I don t need to hang out  I m usually going to go into one of my shutdowns into books anyway so I can restructure again   Cause I still don t know what the right thing to do is P s  It did irritate me that Holden overuses  corny  and  crumby   He could pick on me for overusing  but   and  butt   and  awesome   I liked Holden a lot when he enjoyed the digressions of his classmate  But I digress   p s s  I related to Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind film but I felt less    mean  Not mean  I m not confrontational  I d not have been scornful  I d just have gone quiet  Like how Jane Austen s commentary feels hateful  sometimes  Holden wasn t always that way but I do feel one thing different now than from my teens that I feel more like going quiet than getting annoyed   Maybe I learned how to give up   mn wq  dr Hd w ndzh y yn nystm khh dr mwrd ntwr dsht bnwysm bbyn mnw    lyh khwd khwdshh mwq y khh bh Trf dr myrftmfyby gft

gets a little weird  The narrator is a young man and his name is Holden  He is in a mental hospital  but the story begins in a Prep School called Pencey Prep School in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  I love the author s writing style  and the flow of the story   I personally like J D  s writing style because I believe Salinger pays attention to the rhythm of speech  The rhythm of speech is mirrored by the rhythm of thoughts or ideas and the paragraphs are broken up by subject matter but also by emphasis of thought  Shorter paragraphs get implicitly more emphasis in the reader s mind  and Salinger uses this fact to his credit  I like Salinger style because it is brilliant and it is unique  The setting takes place in a Prep School in Pennsylvania and the author is very descriptive  Salinger makes you feel you are there at school  For example  here is a quote from the book  There were never many girls at all at the football games  Only seniors were allowed to bring girl with them   Salinger 3   I can relate to this because when I was in 6 grade I went to a prep school for a year and there was not many girls there  I also like that the Salinger puts you there in the scene of the book  but I feel like you don t see it through the eyes of the characters  but through third person  It is almost as if you are there watching what unfolded  The conflict is all in Holden s head or his psyche because part of him wants to connect with people on an adult level  while other parts of him wants to reject the adult world  He also calls them phonies  and he likes to look back into his own memories of childhood For example  from the story of Holden calling people phonies  One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies  Salinger 13   Here you see proof that Holden does indeed hate the phonies  I Would give this book 5 stars  Because of the style and the flow of the book  I would recommended this book to people that like to read older books and classics  I would only recommended this book to people that are active readers  Overall this book is fantastic because Salinger s unique writing style  and flow   The Catcher in the Rye  J D  Salinger  0 316 76948 7115   He was singing that song   If a body catch a body coming through the rye   173  Phoebe corrects Holden that it s not a song but a poem by Robert Burn  also  it s not  catch a body  but  meet a body 187    This fall I think you re riding for   it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom   I was a teenager in a highly conservative country when I read this  It was mind boggling   couldn t put it down and it caused me to seek out all other writings by Salinger  No wonder he went into hiding  Holden is dropped out of Pency prep on the day he has a football game with another school  He misses the game  As the manager of the team  he loses his team s equipment on the subway and is forced to leave the school  He now lives in a hotel In New York until Christmas Vacation  He would have to break out the news to his parents then  which isn t a good sight  He meets all different people  from nice to mean and he feels like there is something missing in his life  He wants to go back and see his sis  Phoebe  But under these circumstances  he couldn t  Having to spend his life in the hotel  his life gets worse and worse as he gets into one trouble to another  After reading this book  I felt quite happy with my life  After just experiencing Holden s life through a book  I kind of felt sorry for him and his life  The school is just too strict with what they have  I mean like expelling someone for misplacing their equipment  Well I guess  that s what makes this a so so school around his area  I felt that life should be treated with more respect and that people should have more right and chances to make up for the mistakes  Everything should be given a second chance and they would realize what mistakes they caused and fix it  I read this book twice in the 1970s  when I was a young man    loved it  Even wrote a stage adaptation  just for practice  Coming back to it many years later  as a no longer young man  I wondered whether I would again fall under Holden s spell  As you ve already noticed the 5 star rating it is obvious that I did  Holden Caulfield is perhaps the most vividly realised 1st person narrator in literature   I cannot recommend his story enough  A must read for any serious reader   as amusing   moving as any tragi comedy should be  Catcher in the Rye is coming of age novel  The story is told of a few days of Holden Caulfield s life after being kicked out of yet another prestigious boarding school  This novel had rich themes  symbolism and settings that lend itself to an extensive novel study  It could be accompanied with an ear study of the 1950s as much of the setting  jargon and references are not common knowledge to our students  Additionally  there could be a clinical analysis to the protagonist and whether or not his narration is reliable based upon his actions  Students could diagnosis him as well as use this diagnosis as a frame or reference for evaluating all narration for reliability   To those who rated it lower  this if for you if you are interested in reading it  I had the privilege of reading it as a teenager  as a college student and then in the rat race  Each time was different  The first I was appalled by his irresponsibility and brashness  Later his truth became iconic to me as a source of rebellion  I believed his anger and his fighting and his words  The second time I read it was nostalgia  seeping in  I no longer needed Holden  but respected the character s role in my previous thinking  The third time  I read it critically and dropped it from shock after four chapters  The hypocrisy of Holden Caulfield   everything out of his mouth is a lie   was so beautifully crafted I did not see it before  It was beautiful and tragic  I urge you to look at it slowly and critically  even those first few chapters to see how this can be read so differently particularly by that great divide of youth and experience  I believe this is why it affected so many people  such as myself and I can easily put it in the pantheon of American literature  Date of read was first reading  It s true what Holden Caulfield says about certain things  about how  phony  they are  but there s nothing phony about this book  I remember picking it up back in high school when my younger brother pleaded me to read it for him so that i may summarize it for his english class assignment  I was initially asked to read the first 50 pages or so but i just could not stop  In a way  it seemed Holden and i were going through the same things  not exactly the same  but we were going through the same experiences and emotions that come from that stage in our lives  which in both of our cases  high school  Sadly i couldn t finish the book back then since it had to be returned back to his teacher but it was definitely one of those books i told myself i d read eventually and i did  It s funny when you put down the book you start feeling like Holden too  if only for a little while  It just shows how his unique personality and experiences really brushes into you  dr tmm Twl khtb  ngr dshtm byprdh twy dhhn ykh

by Salinger  The sardonic Holden Caulfield and period cues  especially language  mores  customary social practices like prevalent smoking  drinking  etc  are all interesting to me as I enjoy the WWII era and post war glimpse into society  Obviously a very fast read  you ll miss the important parts if you read too quickly   so don t  Take your time  step into the sad  painful shoes of Holden and the dim perspective he has  The dreary reality of his state is telling  the writing is thoughtful  minimalistic  not self congratulatory or sappy and authentic  Probably for many readers  the  F   you  graffiti section towards the end is offensive   I found it hysterical and sadly poignant   I felt I could relate entirely  Maybe only those who likewise expect to find such descriptions scratched into their final resting place can likewise enjoy the bitter sweetness of that kind of curse  As I could tell I was approaching the end I wondered to myself how Salinger would conclude  and was happily impressed with the thoughtful conversation of Mr  Antonlini   again not sappy but insightful and with wisdom that helps me see through the dark times   like Antolini hoped for Holden  In short   a staple work and personal library must have   I read this at the beginning of my freshmen year  I had found it entertaining  but nothing great Then  after a year of high school  growing up  and  with no better words  phonies  I have found that this book is sort of my life Yes  I am a girl  Yes  I am not as anti social as Holden  Yes  my asthma might keep me from smoking  along with the fact I m underage to buy them and it s unhealthy   I still feel that this book is a little bit of me  I realize Holden is not a role model  more of a hey you re not the only one going through this model You either hate him because you see that he is you  or if your a lucky bastard and didn t see that he is  or sympathies with him Maybe it s the period of my life I m in that makes me appreciate this book  I dunno But I do know that this passage will say with me forever  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry  And that is why I read  What turns people off about this book is the character of Holden   his self centered  anti social and skewed outlook  It helps to know that Holden is the ultimate unreliable narrator  in that most of what he says on his journey home is part of his veneer of cynicism  a mask that slips only occasionally throughout the novel To me this is authentic  Teenagers learn quickly what roles they need to play to be accepted  and Holden hasn t learned this even though he wants acceptance  He feels affectionate towards others but has trouble showing it  His affluent life has left him spiritually hollow HC is extremely flawed  but his touching relationship with Phoebe is what forms the emotional center of the novel   the one time when he lets his guard down  I get a little misty every time I read this   This book  It was even more amazing the third time around  I thought I really sympathized with Holden and his struggle the last time I read it  And maybe I did  But this time  it felt even more real  Which book captures what it is to be a teenager more than this  The Catcher in the Rye is one of the books I plan to read multiple times over my life  The second I stop sympathizing with and understanding Holden  I ll know I ve grown up  Aren t we all just lost  Who of us knows what he s really doing  Am I the only real one in the sea of phonies  Or am I just as phony in my feeble attempts to differentiate myself from the herd  So I m probably not on the verge of a mental breakdown  but I understand Holden s whims and emotions  Being on your own after being surrounded by people  making random decisions just because you want to  Seeing something beautiful and just heading for it  Seeing something mysterious and deciding to investigate it just because  I wish I could do that more  Random things that touch you and just make you want to burst into tears  I thought I d outgrow my love of this book after I got out of high school  but it endures as one of my favorite books ever   OBJECTIVE RATING  my best stab at looking at the book s merits  regardless of whether or not I enjoyed it all that much   4 5PERSONAL RATING  how much the book  worked  for me personally   4 5 What can be said  It s that book that changes your life as a 16 year old  and stays with you probably until the day you die  Reread it the second time and I still love love love every single sentence in it  All I wanna do now is call Salinger up and hang out with him or something   I loved this book  Salinger writes this in a very realistic way  the way a mind would work for a young scatterbrained boy  People will criticize this book by saying it s about a boy who  does nothing for 3 days   This is a very idiotic statement because the book has absolutely nothing to do with what he is doing its about what he s thinking  By the end of the book I loved Holden s character  This is probably my favorite book I ve ever read   A wonderful story that is way different than anything I have read before  Salinger is an amazing writer  but beware of foul language  He has a few choice phrases he uses throughout the book that uses words some may be uncomfortable with  But it is a great story nonetheless   my twnm wqty z fyby Hrf my zd t khr  mr  shq fyby bmwnm   hmyshh fkr my krdm prkndh nwysy mzkhrf tryn

schools  banned books list  I think it was on mine  too  I was a bit worried that I might not like it  since I m not a teenager anymore  but I found that Salinger s  voice    Holden s voice   was very genuine  as if he was actually conversing with the reader  and he was a really nuanced  layered  often contradictory character  The book left me with many questions about his relationships with various characters   for example  was his English teacher coming onto him   and his mental state  but I don t think it would have been as good a reading if they d been cleared up  They ll have me thinking for a while  I suspect  I find Catcher in the Rye a very well written novel that greatly expresses the adolescent stage of life  Quite true to belief  teenagers have an  I hate the world  attitude  especially in today s culture  There s even irony in the already posted reviews of those who said to have hated the book Salinger provides for us a very dynamic character that embodies deep down the very same desires we have  to gain back childlike innocence  This idea comes from Holden s personal interpretation of Robert Burns  poem song  Comin thro  the Rye   The poem reads  Should a body meet a body  when Holden believes it to be  body catch a body   I don t believe Holden s interpretation is merely a mishearing  though  Holden desires to  catch  kids before they fall  or in other words  stop kids from trying to grow up before it s too late  In a way  all can relate to this feeling of wanting to remain in childhood because of the reality of the world and its faults  Read this book when I was 13 years old  Haven t stopped thinking about  phonies  since  It changed the way I look at people  for better and for worse  Another reason I became a writer  How well I remember that maroon colored cover  Read it in high school  at age 16   the perfect time to be introduced to Holden Caulfield  CATCHER was the first book from which I got that  letter from a long lost friend  feeling  It was also the first book at which I can remember laughing out loud  I remember envying  as a writer  Salinger for creating such a living  breathing character   and for writing such an insightful  funny book  Now  I just respect him  He set the literary standard to which I try to measure up to  Emphasis on the word  try   The man is an artist  for sure   I probably picked this one up extremely late  I am no longer in my teens  but then  nobody ever got out of their teens completely  I have met octogenarians who behave like teenagers at times  So  this book is not just for young adults  But  it is for someone who has never read it and even for someone who has read it  So much wisdom and so many uncanny observations in one place  coming from a gullible young boy make them so believable and him  so endearing Like Holden says it  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though   I read this book during my sophomore year in High school with covers all worn out and old ishh  The text on the version i got was so freaking small too and i hated books with small fonts  they give me headaches  But that wasn t really my concern then  my concern was i didn t want to read it  Actually  I didn t want to read  Period  I didn t use to dig reading  It s like a pain in the ass  So i was like illiterate  Lol  j k  Well  anyway i avoided reading unless the book was specifically needed to be read for educational purposes  But this book was pure awesome that it changed my mind about books and the worlds in them  I mean  after reading freakin  The Alchemist  by Paulo Something with all its  cliche concepts  probably not so cliche when he was writing it because no one has yet delivered his piece of mind   i couldn t really blame myself  The world inside the book was Holden Caulfields   a seventeen year old young man with all the angst and rebelliousness a teenager could ever possess  and it was about his cynical ways of viewing things  He always thinks that everyone around him is fake or phony as he referred to it   Now  he says that because he basically shares some of the characteristics those he calls fake people have  and i ve come to a conclusion that he hates the  him  that he sees within those people  And the dude obviously has inferiority complex that needs amending  And sometimes he just assumes  His mentality  if you pin it down  is like this   You re like that because I m like this   The boy is freakin narrow minded Along with the topic mentioned above  he also thinks that it s better if all the people in this world would just stay as a child forever  The way i see it is that since he views everyone he encounters as fake  he thinks a child would turn into something of a  fake  when he she grows up rather than staying innocent as a child should be  The man s perspective is a bit screwed in my own subjective opinion  Yes  it s inevitable that a person would change as she he grows up  but transformations that would take place would not necessarily be bad  I think the reason why he perceives it in a way that s so wrong is because he has low self esteem and that he thinks everyone judges him as he is  And probably because he thinks that it s easy for a child to get away with some grievous sin or whatever because of ignorance whereas when you re a grown up that word just doesn t apply anymore  The word would be replaced by  stupidity  When he couldn t solve his problem  he runs away  He couldn t take how the world is so imperfect and that he s part of it  and is probably wondering why he d have to grow up and face things when he could jst be a child with no worries But life doesn t go that way  You cannot not have changes  The world does not adjust to the way you work  it s you who do the adjustment  You can t have a staring contest against the world and wait for it to give in because it won t  It will keep staring and you just wasted your time  Try your luck with something productive  i guess  HAHA So anyway  this master piece gave me things to ponder and think through  Though the boy is irrational and pathetic in some ways  I still liked him  And it s so sad that deep within my heart i find myself nodding to some of what he s saying  I m so immature  LOL  Leido en castellano Holden Caulfield es un adinerado chico de 17 anos sin grandes aspiraciones en la vida  Su singular mente hace que este personaje se encuentre constantemente encerrado en su peculiar mundo  el cual es  probablemente  el mas disparatado que podamos encontrar  Su monotona vida cambia por completo el dia que decide huir de Pencey sin saber muy bien lo que le depara el futuro   Que pasara con su mente ahi fuera Para empezar  es una novela muy famosa que ha dado un giro en la literatura  Tenia muchisimas ganas de leerlo gracias a su fama y no veia las horas de abrirlo y sumergirme en sus paginas  No tuve prejuicios antes de leerlo del tipo   Estara sobrevalorado      Su fama sera cosa del azar      Y si no es mi estilo   etc  Quizas por culpa de eso me decepciono un poco Narrado en primera persona contiene un comienzo es de lo mas inusual  lo que es un punto a favor  Soy una enamorada incondicional de los comienzos extranos  por eso  este primer parrafo me cautivo al momento  Pense que despues de ese perfecto paragrafo llegaria una historia emocionante  que ingenua    Lo que me encontre fue una historia de lo mas normal sin nada que destacar  Ahi mi primera decepcion A medida que continuaba con mi lectura comenzaba a pensar que el propio protagonista estaba loco  cosa que me saco de mis casillas  Repetia constantemente la palabra  jo  y cada persona que conocia era una  falsa  o una  salida   sexualmente hablando  Al principio hace gracia  pero a medida que lees es muy pesado  Como dije anteriormente  al ser una narracion en primera persona  encima sabiendo lo perturbado que estaba el protagonista todos los pensamientos e ideas eran 100  de Holden  Estaba lleno de coloquialismos y mal redactado pero no por eso es mal libro  recordemos que esto era lo que pretendia hacer el autor desde el principio  En cuanto Holden habla sobre su pasado o sobre lo que piensa  el libro se hace muy interesante y el lector comienza a darse cuenta del porque de su fama   Por que nadie habia escrito antes una novela tal que asi sobre la psicologia adolescente  Es increible como sin tapujos habla de su sexualidad  su experiencia con el alcohol  el tabaco  sus relaciones    Todo desde una perspectiva de lo mas realista de la mente de un joven americano  Sin palabras El impacto social de este libro es mas que justificado  Holden es un personaje ficticio que consigue revolucionar el mundo real con sus ideas  Ahora casi entiendo la razon de que estas casi 300 paginas hayan llevado a la locura a personas como Mark David Chapman para asesinar a John Lennon  Si  el asesino de John Lennon se volvio loco tras leer este libro Tras leerlo  ya no distingues el bien del mal  lo real de lo ficticio  lo aceptado de lo rechazado  Ya no sabes si el que esta loco es Holden o tu mismo  Pensamos que Holden esta loco cuando habla con su fallecido hermano pero   acaso importa cuando quieres de verdad a alguien  Creo que este libro da para mucho que pensar  pero lo considero trabajo individual de cada uno de nosotros  Para terminar  una recomendacion mas   a que esperas para ser  El guardian entre el centeno  que salve a los demas del precipicio Recomiendo totalmente este libro a las personas mas experimentadas en la lectura  sobre todo si se encuentran en la etapa adolescente de su vida  Aunque sea complicado de leer  vale la pena   One of my favourite books Anyone who s ever been a teenager can probably relate to Holden in this book  The complexity of the thought process of a teenager that helplessly comes to light every now and then through Salinger s simple first person accounts is totally exquisite  One feels sad for Holden   yet amused by Salinger s descriptions   all at the same time  It was my favorite book as a teen  still  I want to read it again today as I turn into a woman  just to see if Salinger is such a great novel writer after all  Fingers crossed  I ll get back to you on end result shortly     I have read this book many many times and I relate to and love Holden Caulfield a lot  I own two physical copies of this novel  I bought the other copy just because it had a different cover from the one I already had  and it s on my Kindle  Boy  can Salinger really write  This book and Holden influenced me to the extent that at one time I began writing and speaking like Holden  No kidding  I really did I wouldn t really review this book  there already are thousands of them here on Goodreads and I agree with each one of the 5 star reviews  I d recommend this book to anyone who is sensitive  desperately lonely  or has been at some point of time   good at English composition  and only good at that  and anyone who d love to catch little kids  if they start to go over the cliff     anyone who d love to  just be the catcher in the rye and all     when I finished reading it  I was confused and wondered what all the fuss was about  I understood his confused teen spirit and going against the grain and I found myself either laughing upset at his overly cynical narration  I did more thinking and research  thank you spark notes  and i have a better understanding of the book  I never read books before when I was in school  I didn t apply myself either and was  more or less  like holden caulfield in my youth  I wish I read this in highschool and took it to heart  I may have shaped up to have a different outlook  I really wanted to find out what the hype was all about when it came to this book  It was banned due to the offensive language found inside and yeah  almost every page had offensive language or words that were deemed offensive Well  it certainly was a great experience reading this book  Holden Caulfield is an extraordinary character  I already knew the ending and read on to see how it went Holden is a depressed kid who only sees the pretentious side of everybody and everything  Therefore  he uses the word  phony  loads of times  He also kept saying many things depressed him It s told from the first person point of view  It s also not like any book I ve read  Some might call it a depressing book since the protagonist is so pessimistic and all  But I would definitely recommend this book to everyone as it is really thought provoking  When I hear people say that Salinger tried to hard to make Holden sound  universal  and that the character is too  unreal   I strongly disagree  If Holden was so much a mystical creature  then Salinger wouldn t have gone into hiding to get away from the fans of Holden  The fans feel directly connected to Holden because of similar views and because of the things that are happening in their lives  The more I think about it  the more I agree with Holden  Although  I am not in Holden s state of mind yet aka in a psychic ward  I do not intend to deal with phonies anytime soon  People who talk behind your back  betray you for a higher position  or leave you when you are down in the dumps  They are all legitimate phonies  It s just that we give them different names because we are capable of having a wider vocabulary than Holden  whose vocabulary consists of  phony    goddamn it   and  I really did   Another thing is  I really liked that Holden tries to preserve the innocence of children  That really got to me   A coming of age book  where the protagonist  Holden Caulfield is disillusioned with the world and the  phonies  that comprise the adult world  His pubescent frustration towards the fake world is reflected in such a genuine manner that we cannot help but sympathize with his feelings and even reminisce on our youthful defiance of the world  The only thing that Holden still holds dear are the traces of innocence that is left in his life  which are reflected primarily through his love for Allie  who was never quite able to reach adulthood  and Phoebe  who is still just a child   His yearning for innocent adolescence is felt greatest when he describes how he wishes to be a  catcher in the rye   where he explains how he wishes to prevent innocent children from falling over the cliff into the dark abyss of adulthood  A great book which captures quite profoundly the inevitable fall from purity to deceitful disposition that comes ultimately with aging in this  phony  world  I like reading books I have no expectations from  I think it gives me an honest judgement  I think if I would of read this book about two years ago when I never knew the beauty of reading  I would of said this book was about a guy with anger issues  But reading after the books I have read  I kind of understand books a lot more now  I found this book to be very powerful  but it only really hit me after I found out where Holden had been for the whole book  I didn t find it depressing like others  and I didn t like it because people think it s about teen angst  I actually don t know why I liked it  Unfortunately I am once again caught that web of not being able to review books I really really like The story was simple but Holden s character made it so much more complex  It was interesting to see his character throughout the book  to see how his non caring  arrogant attitude really masked how lonely he really was  It was nice to see how the story ended with his sister and how he reflected on the story he told and feeling kind of sad because thinking of those people made him miss them  I don t think that would of made him go back into himself as he was  I actually think it will help him to come out of his shell he has made for himself and to move himself forward and to have a good future It simple but the story was so well written  the author did a fantastic job I highly recommend this book  especially people who like books that make you think  This is one of my favourite books I read it in different periods in my life  The first time I read it I attended middle school   12 13 years old   and Holden bacame my crush  I cannot explain why but I was so enamoured by him  I have to admit it took a while to understand the real plot   I was little  don t judge me   but I fell in love with his way of speaking and thinking  I felt sad when he was sad and happy when he was happy  I think this is what you expect when you draw a character s personality I read it again in high school and I liked even more because I found meanings I totally ignored as a little girl  I appreciated the way in which it was written despite it was a bit messy  Everything  anyway  contributed to give the book this catchy atmosphere I am looking forward to reading it again  definitely  I discovered with this re read that I remembered almost nothing from when I read this book in high school  I also highly doubt that I understood much of it then  It was written as an adult book  not a book for teenagers  and I think adults are still the most appropriate audience  although teens can appreciate a lot of the angst that comes with transition to adulthood I think this book presents much more than a few days in the life of a  rebelious  teenager  I see Holden as a teenager who suffered a terrible loss and became depressed  His behavior is that of a boy who no longer feels he has anything he can count on in life After posting about a million discussion points  I decided I needed to increase this rating to 5 stars  SPOILERSso i read this book for school but also because i wanted to read it in the beginning i thought the book was a little boring but it was good you know  not that boringat the end i was quit shocked  i didn t know he was in hospital and i read the shapter again and i was like wtf hahaso i asked my dad about it cause it s his book from 1970 haha and he started to give me this explanation and i was like yeah that makes sens  so my dad said  Holden was someone who can t live in this world cause he hates everyting and he just can t take this world you know what i mean  in the book he keeps saying i hate that person and i fucking hate it and stuff  he is not ready to live in this world and to graduate and live a normal life  he can t live in the world so something like that hahaha oke sorry for my weird review but i m not the best in it okay i had to write a review for school as wel but it s in dutch so that sucks but you know maybe i ll put it up sometime we ll see  I am rereading this with my seventh grader  I was impressed that his teacher assigned the book but to my delight  my son seems to grasp the humor and the book s implications  Naturally  he loves Salinger s language    goddam this  sonnavab     helluva  crap  He s also rather enthralled with Holden s seeming independence at the start of the book  I might have forgotten some of the details in this classic tale  but its impact is forever ingrained  All these years later  it s hard for me to put the book down   Qual e o enredo  Nao sei  Nao tem daqueles enredos  assim muito rebuscados e tal  Tem situacoes banais  contadas de forma banal  sem estar a armar  nem nada Quem sao as personagens  Um jovem  um velho  eu  tu O estilo de escrita  Poderia ser o meu diario  se eu o tivesse  ou assim Adorei cada frase  cada palavra  Um Livro Fascinante que me aprisionou desde as primeiras letras  Se estao mesmo interessados nisto  entao a primeira coisa que devem querer saber e onde e que eu nasci  e como foi a porcaria da minha infancia  o que faziam os meus pais e tudo antes de eu ter nascido  e toda essa treta estilo David Copperfield  mas nao estou para ai virado  para dizer a verdade   Soy fan de los Beatles desde que era una adolescente  asi que este libro ha sido mencionado en la historia de la banda mas veces de las que puedo contar  porque Mark David Chapman   el asesino de John Lennon   lo leia la noche que decidio acometer contra el cantante  Y fueron tantas las veces que escuche que no se deberia juzgar al clasico literario con la pesadilla de 1980 que me propuse algun dia leerlo  y ese dia por fin llego  diez anos despues  pero llego  Holden Cauldfield nos narra su historia desde el momento en que   de nueva cuenta   lo expulsan del colegio un par de dias antes de que el curso comenzara  Y es asi como decide pasar unos dias solo en Nueva York con el dinero que tenia  para no llegar a su casa antes de que las vacaciones comenzaran y evitar lo mejor posible que sus padres se enteraran de su fracaso escolar Al principio pense que el libro seria un clasico sobre valorado ya que Holden no me gusto al principio  pensaba que se quejaba de todo  que nada le gustaba  pero luego recorde que era un adolescente en los anos 50 s y sus quejas sonaban casi identicas a los adolescentes de hoy en dia o como sonaba yo cuando era adolescente  como si no hubieran mas de 50 anos de por medio  los adolescentes siempre sufren de lo mismo a pesar de las generaciones y comprender eso me gusto mucho  Holden encontraba a sus companeros de escuela como unos falsos  de hecho  consideraba que todo el mundo era falso  ya sea por una razon u otra  pero siempre falsos Su forma de expresarse es un poco repetitiva utilizando muletillas un poco desesperantes  o al menos a mi me desesperaban  pero eventualmente me acostumbre a ellas  El personaje de Holden tiene un desarrollo perfecto  que logro que al final del libro no solo le tuviera carino  sino que tambien llegue a comprenderlo   Que hubiera hecho yo en su lugar  Nueva York no es una ciudad cualquiera  es una ciudad enorme con una diversidad impresionante de personas  no sabes con quien o con que te vas a topar al pasear por sus calles No se que esperaba del libro  porque lo unico que sabia de el  consistia en un adolescente vagando por Nueva York  y de eso trata  de eso trata especificamente  Aventuras de un adolescente por Nueva York  Los lugares que visita  las cosas buenas y malas que experimenta  y muchas cosas mas  Podria considerarse un libro lento o poco entretenido  tal vez a mi me llego de forma especial  pero al final de cuentas me gusto mucho y le di una calificacion perfecta en Goodreads  Se lo recomiendo a las personas dispuestas a leer aventuras sin sentido  I read this book as a young teen and have been wanting to read it again for some time  So at the age of 46  I have finally re read it  I won t bother with a synopsis as I m sure pretty much everybody knows a little something about this book  Anything so controversial piques the interest of the public and this book has certainly been talked to death   so   skipping it What is interesting to me is what a different take I have on the book now than I did as my teenage self  Back then the cussing didn t bother me  but this time around it got tiresome  Every other word almost was GD  I thought it thoroughly unnecessary  not being a prude   I also found that many of the references and verbiage was lost on me as a teen  I got so much more out of it this time  Then I thought Holden had it so right and I loved his rebel attitude  This time around  while I certainly understand Holden and how why he feels the way he does  it just makes me sad  I don t think Holden is wrong  there is much hypocrisy  or as he calls it  phonies  We deal with them everyday and if people are really honest with themselves  we are not honest at all  We pretend we like people we don t  We put on airs  I can understand the frustration and confusion this would cause on a young person  All I can really say to sum it up is that by the end of this book I was just very sad  and my heart hurts for Holden  I hope he lived up to his potential  as smart as he is  and I hope he found the happiness he was looking for  and not in a phony world  Ahh the classic that got away from me  I have been meaning to read The Catcher in the Rye for ages  There are plenty of classic pieces of literature I have yet to read but this is the only one I feel really guilty about not having read until now   Would someone like to recommend to me a new book to take it s place   The only prerequisite I had was the claim that as a reader I d either love Holden Caulfield or hate his whiny ass  I surprisingly managed to tread a middle ground  His witty observations of society resonated with me more often than not  yeah  occasionally I found his annoyances petty and a little trivial  But I think that s what captures the adolescent spirit so well in this novel  As a teenager it s our first opportunity to become fully cognizant of our society  You can only understand human nature for the first time once  from recognizing the phonies to realizing your true potential it takes a lot of raw experiences to fully appreciate life  Holden s journey is a fantastic representation of just that  5 5 stars   That killed me  When this book was put in my hands in 9th grade   you can rest assure I did not want to like it  It wasn t that I didn t want to read the book for school  but more that it seemed so cliche  It seems every other person lists off Catcher in the Rye as their all time favorite book and I didn t want to fall into the trap   another person unremarkably in love with this novel  Ah well  my plans were foiled as I really did love this one and will likely be reading it again in the not so distant future  xx THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK  Has anyone read the Glass series  Holden Caulfield made this book for me  He s one of the most memorable characters I ve ever come across as well as one of my personal favorites  I personally interpreted his complaints about society that we see quite clearly in himself as a self deprecation vanity issue that I think is very relatable  His repetitiveness and hypocrisy is so teenage like in a way that I  myself a teenager  see very readily but could never articulate  I can t wholly explain why I enjoyed this book so much  but I just really appreciated how Salinger portrayed Holden  Read it for that  if anything else  even if you hate him at the end  you won t ever forget him  Go get your bike and meet me out the front of Bobby Fallon s house  The first time I read this I was 18 and I felt marginalized and lonely and alienated so I figured I was supposed to  At the time  the book didn t really get to me  I just thought  Okay  this kid is marginalized and lonely and sensitive  big deal  Later in college I was assigned the book after having read 9 Stories and having learned a great deal about Zen Buddhism  Under those circumstances I found myself opening up the book and plowing through it in one marathon reading  It s a remarkable book that I m more and more convinced is about Eastern philosophy  Holden seems like a very real character to me  though I don t particularly like him  And his troubles seem real to me too  though they re not mine anymore   I don t think   The writing is masterful  Salinger is the sort of author who doesn t waste a word or a comma  doesn t waste an italic  Great little book  I don t see how psychos end up using it to validate killing a Beatle though  This book is a character study of a very cynical  yet terrified young man  who is intent on alienating just about everyone he encounters  You do not have to completely identify with the main character to recognize the merits of the book  I can sympathize with Holden for being fearful of joining the  phony  adult world  yet part of me would like to tell him to shut up and endure like everyone else  The fact that Holden can be very unlikable only adds to the realism of the book  I found the Central Park duck pond to be just as meaningful a symbol and the famous red hunting cap  this book was damn depressing i had to stop reading like 7 pages before the end and laugh  i didn t know why i did it  it was either i burst laughing or I burst into tears    everything that boy did  said or most importantly thought touched me in a way i should be too ashamed to acknowledge what i like the most never the less was how much i found John Green books in it  or how much i found it in John Green   Holden s sister wrote a short story about a girl detective just like Margo in John s Book  Paper Town  the detective s name was Hazel just like Hazel Grace from  The Fault In Our Stars     the way Holden thought about everything was a lot like the old mighty Will Grayson in  Will Graysin Will Grayson  and the way he talked about Jane was a lot like the way Miles talked about Alaska    and eventually the end the open end where the character finds himself with choices and an open future is a lot like the end of  Abundance of Katherines   now I know someone else has probably said all that before  heck maybe John himself said it  but am glad i found it myself am glad i read the book   I honestly have absolutely nothing bad that I can say about this book  I read it for the first time as a junior in high school  and it has truly made an impact on my life  I feel I can empathize with Holden  and that what he s feeling isn t the  whiney teenage bullshit  that everybody seems to claim it is  I think  rather  that Holden is feeling lost and confused  He has given up  which is a feeling in which alot of people can relate  Though I will caution that if you don t like symbolism  or analyzing the symbolic meaning behind something  you will not enjoy this book as much because you will not be capable of seeing the full story as it was meant to be told  This is one of those books I wish I had written instead  I wasted many precious minutes now and then thinking and asking myself why I didn t read this book before and then realised instead of wasting all those precious time thinking why I didn t read  I should have spent it reading  You see that s the problem with small brain  When I mean small brain doesn t mean I am stupid or so  I am talking about age  I didn t read it because this book is for adults only  At least I wouldn t let my children read it until they are 18  Oh please  when I say this book is for adults only  don t bring dirty thoughts into your mind  Its nothing like that  Its just that I am more concerned about the languages used in this book  So  now since I am adult or so  mentally   this book came in perfect time  You know someone said the way its meant to be  Normally  things don t happen if they don t want to happen  I think this time  it wanted to happen  Boy  this is crazy life  I think I am going mad here  I tell you beforehand  I am a madwoman When I write this review and you read it  I assume that you all are adults and that means you have all experienced your teenage life and you know what I am talking about  Now lets all go back to our teenage time  Do you remember when things were better and you were smarter  when I say that  it doesn t mean I mean to say you are not smart and things are not better now  You are but there are times when you think you are smart even though you are not  You believe you know everything  You are annoyed with people around you  You make rules for yourself  You want to be rebellious  You may or may not be wrong but even if you are wrong  you don t care  We have all been there and we have all seen that sort of things  So  this book talks about the mind of teenage people  Holden Caulfield  our main character has just been expelled from a school  He has his own meaning of life but the thing is he doesn t know what to do with his life  He decides to leave home for change but later changes his mind to stay home just for his little sister  Holden is very protective of his younger sister even though he himself is bit careless about the life  He is worried about her future  That certainly reminded me of my teenage time  I don t remember much about my teenage time apart from some things such as I was always worried about my future  I was always nervous about it but when I was not nervous  I used to get nervous thinking why I was not nervous  I tell you what  teenage people are the most vulnerable people  When you become parents  you have to make sure to handle your teenage child well  Wish there was some formula on how to do that  where you can just substitute something and find the value of  x  and you know what to do like  tadaaa   I had a bunch of close friends I used to hang out with all the time  You see this was the thing  some of my close friends had elder brothers and sisters  When I read about Holden and his sister  I remembered them  Whenever we wanted to go out  we either couldn t go out or even if we did  we had to come home early just because my friends were scared of their elder siblings and because they were scared  I was scared too  Boy did that annoy me  Thank God  I don t have elder siblings  Oh may be its bit harsh  To tell you the truth  there were some times when I wished I had elder sister or brother  specially those times when I needed guidance in my career and those times when I needed a family talk about my problems  You can t discuss everything to your parents  Most of the time  you are scared you will be grounded  The funny thing is  I totally understand those siblings of my friends because I am also an elder sister of two brothers  I tell you what  one of my brothers is already married but I still worry about him  I swear even when we reach to the age when I can t walk on my own  I would still worry about them  Its hard to be an eldest child  Parents always blame you for your siblings  mistake  Once in a while  I went crazy and wished I had elder siblings just so that I could blame them for all my and my brothers  mistake  Boy  am I madwoman Once I was asked a question   how do you decide what is wrong and what is right    Boy do I know that answer or does anyone know that answer  You see the way I see is  we have our one life  and in this life  there are so many ups and downs  Sometimes you have to be strong but sometimes you have to let it go even though you are strong  Sometimes you have to be harsh but sometimes  you know one of those times when you don t want to do anything but sit by the river and stare at it flowing or sit on bench in the park and watch people passing by  Just let your life pass it like that  Sometimes  we make decision ourselves but sometimes we make decision based on our surrounding  Its not a sin to be rebellious  Specially in the place where humans are ruled by the society  where you have to think about the society before you think about yourself  But what I don t understand is  some crap man made rule just because it was convenient for him that way  now everyone has to suffer for that  I mean obviously I don t mean to go against everything  There are obviously things which are good but there are also bad things  The funny thing here is  the things I find bad may not be bad for other people and vice versa  I don t mean to sit here and give lecture on what the societies should be  the thing is you have to first think about yourself and families  then society because you make the society not the other way round  But the problem here is  people make the rules but they don t obey themselves  What I say is  no one knows your life better than yourself  You have to work on it yourself  You have to decide what is wrong and what is right yourself  When I say this  I didn t mean to disobey our parents  Family is important  I am just talking about general things here  I was meant to write a book review but I think I got carried away  Boy  was I bored  Just don t sit here reading my hopeless crap  Go and get this book  I warned you right  I am a madwoman  I mean it and I mean it when I mean it Published on  http   pchhantyal blogspot de 2014 11    I own two copies of this now and lost one to Katrina  However  I am not a serial killer  I swear  I just love this one  I ve read it at least 13 times   Spent the day re reading this book because it s just been one of those days  and the only way you can take solace is by going somewhere else  even if it s only temporary  This book is possibly my favorite of all time  Of course I identify with Holden  you either do or you don t  Holden is full of angst and disillusionment with the world  He lost his brother as he was entering adolescence  which is the worst time possible to suffer a huge tragedy  The story resonates partly because it reminds me of my brother and of course evokes every type of nostalgia for him and for being young and naive  But it also makes me look introspectively as good books tend to do  Every time I read it  I feel differently about Holden  which is satisfying on so many levels because it tells me that I am changing and have grown each time I pick it up  I think there is a balance between being cynical and idealistic  which is pretty fucking hard to reach for most people  We all have bad days and good days  we can t be perfect all the time  because the world is full of ugliness and hate  People are phonies  And more importantly  people are temporary  But the right people  good and bad  open you up to parts of yourself that you never thought existed  And I think that s beautiful  This book gets so much hate because people think Holden is an angsty little bitch  but I disagree  Holden s brother died  When you suffer a tragedy like that  it is unequivocally draining  But what most people don t see is that Holden is teeming with hope  When he asks about ducks in the pond  and where they go when the water freezes  and if they still exist  he s holding on to the fact that they do exist even when they re not there  I think he s just good at hiding it to protect himself  Vulnerability seems unfathomable after putting up walls to make sure you don t break down   Somedays I wish that I could just do what Holden did  run away and be by myself because maybe that s the only way to ensure you are never lied to  But we lie to ourselves all the time anyway  so why spend your days lying to yourself and being lonely  Sometimes we make up the biggest lies to protect ourselves because the world is ugly and we need hope to counterbalance it  so if we have to lie to ourselves to preserve hope  I think that s ok  How else would we survive  I like how Holden is an unreliable narrator  because all people are unreliable  and he recognizes that he isn t that different from everyone else  What I know for sure  truth is never tangible  it may be a hallucination  and it is always abstract  And other people s lies might be their truths  so who am I to discredit them  I dunno  I love this book  ntwr dsht stthnyyh    mn shyfth shkhSyt qhrmn yn dstn y ny hwldn khlfyldm  After reading this book  I felt kind of sad in a way because Holden was always feeling depressed and stuff  But it was nice of him to decide to stay home for his sister  What I learned was that most happpiness comes from being with family  Holden was happy when he spent time with Phoebe and always got into fights with his roommates at school  Even though Phoebe is way younger than Holden  she made him happy and cheered him up a lot  Throughout the 3 days while he was in NY  I think he s grown up a bit  He saw different people in the city and had various thoughts on them  I was really hoping that he would phone Jane at some point  but he never did  Maybe it was becuase he never got the courage to face her or something  Who cares if he got kicked out of school at the beginning  What he really wants is to be a guardian to all children and  catch them in the rye   This shows what a caring guy he really is inside  Anyway  this was a really good book and I really like how each chapter was written short like a little story  This book really expresses a teenager s thought and I can see why it s one of the great books of the list of classics   D NOW I see what all the fuss is about  Absolutely loved this classic novel   brilliantly written and characterised  complex  nuanced  authentic and moving  While most reviewers highlight the themes of teenage alienation loss of innocence  I was impressed by Salinger s depiction of the sensitivity that accompanies intelligence  those people that feel things more deeply  Holden Caulfield is beautifully drawn  and reveals what it s like to be one of the sensitive minority in an insensitive world  I loved Mr Antolini s speech on the consolations of study and literature for Holden  You ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry  In addition to the death of his brother and the other traumas in the story  I thought a key part of Holden s breakdown was the suggestion of sexual abuse  reflected in his mistrust of people  his hatred of  phoniness  and his ambivalence about sex  All these imply Holden has been seriously deceived betrayed by an adult  He also has an extreme reaction when Mr Antolini tenderly strokes his head  Boy  I was shaking like a madman  I was sweating too  When something perverty like that happens  I start sweating like a bastard  That kind of stuff s happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid  I can t stand it   Finally  I loved the poignancy of the merry go round scene  where Salinger perfectly conveys the sort of pivotal  small  moment that happens in real life  The sort that moves you  bolsters you  makes you happy in your bones  I d been waiting for some kind of revelation about Holden s defining trauma  but the subtlety of this ending made me reflect on how skilfully Salinger had already shown all the factors that culminated in Holden s predicament  What s really impressive is that the author did this in Holden s voice  without Holden s awareness  at 16 he s too young to see the big picture  as most of us were at his age A real tour de force of a book  Truly inspiring  This is a classic for a reason  Holden is one of the best caricatures of adolescence I ve read and highlights the sentimental and often contradictory nature of taking the first steps into adulthood   Reading this book is indeed like riding a carrousel   round   round  you go up and you come down  They don t call this a classic for no reason  Go and read it if you haven t  It makes me happy to think that there is a character out there named Holden  One of the best  goddamn  books I ve ever read     Este tipo de caida a la que creo que te diriges es de un tipo muy especial  terrible  Al que cae no se le permite ni oir ni sentir que ha llegado al fondo  Solo sigue cayendo y cayendo    Pocos libros juveniles acumulan tanta controversia como esta novela de Salinger  y no precisamente por su contenido  a pesar de hablar con demasiada claridad de temas completamente tabu para la epoca en la que fue publicada  sino por los escandalos en los que se ha visto envuelta a lo largo de la historia  llegando incluso a prohibirse su venta en ciertos lugares de Estados Unidos  lo cual  sin embargo  no logro frenar su distribucion La mayor polemica sobre este libro viene dada por su reiterada coincidencia en escenas de homicidio  entre las que destaca el asesinato de John Lennon  lider de The Beatles  cuyo asesino  tras hacerse con un ejemplar de la novela  escribir en el   Esta es mi declaracion  y firmar como  El guardian entre el centeno   siguio al musico y le asesto cinco disparos  para luego sacar el libro y dedicarse a leerlo hasta la llegada de la policia Ha sido tambien foco de numerosas teorias de la conspiracion  como la idea de que fue un instrumento utilizado por la CIA en su programa MK Ultra para realizar ciertas actividades y operativos de control mental  usando senales electricas y drogas para cambiar el funcionamiento del cerebro  Pero para un lector corriente   resulta realmente tan descabellada Critica  claridad  concision e incomprension son posiblemente las tres palabras que mejor definen la esencia de esta novela  la cual ha de entenderse en su contexto  pues si olvidamos el que  como ya he dicho antes  su mayor virtud fue la de hablar sin tapujos sobre temas tan vedados en los anos cincuenta como el sexo  la delincuencia o la codicia  asuntos acerca de los que hoy en dia no es extrano leer  lo mas probable es que no logremos entender en profundidad la importancia social que se oculta tras esta historia aparentemente corriente El tono desenfadado de las palabras de Holden Caulfield  personaje principal de la obra  contribuye eficazmente a que su lectura resulte rapida y amena  dando a entender Salinger su sencilla y poco rebuscada prosa como un indicio de la incapacidad del propio protagonista para comunicar sus ideas y sentimientos  empleando reiteradamente muletillas como  jo    por el amor de Dios    maldita sea    tio  o  y eso   Es en este hecho  el que no solo las acciones o ideas expresadas por Holden perfilen su personalidad  sino tambien la prosa de la novela en su totalidad   al estar esta narrada en primera persona    donde queda patente la destreza del autor para la elaboracion de personajes humanos y complejos Tras esta prosa falsamente plana se esconden  sin embargo  reflexiones existenciales de lo mas interesantes  pues nuestro autentico guardian entre el centeno no es solo un Holden incomprendido  sino tambien uno al que le resulta imposible comprender todo lo que sucede a su alrededor y que rechaza tajantemente cualquier convencionalismo social o comportamiento regido por la mas minima norma  resultandole completamente falso e hipocrita Otra de las peculiaridades de la novela es la ausencia de la habitual evolucion en la personalidad del protagonista  inducida por los acontecimientos vividos a lo largo del libro  Sera el mismo Holden Caulfield impulsivo  indiscreto  mentiroso  exagerado  vulnerable  inmaduro  solitario  indeciso y critico que nos dio la bienvenida a su lectura  quien nos despida de ella  No comprendia y no comprende  Nihil novum sub sole Trascendental  profunda  simbolista y compleja  Una elaborada vuelta al pasado que refleja fielmente lo poco que dista en realidad nuestra sociedad de la de aquellos reprimidos dias  y el irremediable temor del ser humano a la muerte y el inexorable paso del tiempo Mas resenas en mi blog Constelaciones asimetricas Young people long for beauty  truth and goodness  I heard the Pope once say and I believe that s goddam right  Yes  there is quite a lot of swearing  I didn t mind though because the goddam s and hells and whatnots were authentic and somehow conveyed his honesty and sincerity  It showed he wasn t enslaved by what other people expected of him  it showed he wasn t like all the goddam phonies I love this book because it describes those black and heavy moods you can have when growing up and when you become conscious of all these ugly things inside and outside of yourself  This book describes those crazy but heartfelt outburst of affection and those moods where you re ready to leave the whole goddam place behind  and you mean it too   And the panic attacks where you feel you re about to disappear into thin air  I think everybody should read this book Plus  finding out what the title was about just about killed me  I read this book for my AP Literature class and I absolutely dreaded it  Others in the class had read it earlier and detested it  But I read it and honestly  I fell in love with it  Holden Caulfield is so messed up that it s ridiculous  but if you can get past that and look deep into its meaning    gosh  Such a great coming of age   loss of innocence novel  While Holden likes to sound grown up with the language he handles  his obvious misinterpretation of the Robert Burns poem  Comin  Thro The Rye  signals him to still be a little boy trying to come to terms with an adult world  Honestly  don t let the language deter you from reading this  I fell in love with Holden Caulfield and have no regrets   There is nothing more interesting than a peek into the mind of a teenager  Spectacular  J D  Salinger s  The Catcher in the Rye  is a novel about teenage angst  It focuses on representing the thoughts and feelings of a fictional teenager  Holden Caulfield  who is alienated from the mainstream society in which he lives  depicting these thoughts and feelings in a manner in which young readers can readily identify Personally  I thought the book was magnificent  and I don t think that I could fault any of it  My favorite aspect of this book  is that it would be credible to regard the protagonist  Holden  as an alter ego of the novelist himself  This is because the novel delves so intimately into the thoughts and feelings of an alienated youth  and provides a perspective on society from his own perspective  that it leaves an impression that the author also conveyed these views and opinions in the early stages of his life  Moreover  it is highly likely that the novelist remained in touch with the sentiments he had as a young man  and he drew on this residue of attitudes to create his own central character  Holden Caulfield is not a typical youth  He is a very distinctive one  Yet at the same time  he possesses qualities which make most people identify with him at some level  This is the beauty of Salinger s writing  highlighted in his ability to do these sort of things  and for this reason  the novel has quickly become my most read book For the novel  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  I rate it a 5 5  I personally loved this book  as it is beautifully written  and there are deeper meanings than what meets the eye  Fiction  writing  prose were not the hide bound property of the past but something that could belong to me and include me  The very bedrock of the Counterculture this book  for us  back then  Now kids today say  ehnn  They ve read better  what s so special already  And I say  YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN THERE  back in the Eisenhower Fifties  You can t imagine how nailed down everything was  Everything   I know there s a lot of hate towards the book on here  Holden Caulfield especially   and I can see why that might be  But what I think people don t realize is that Holden isn t supposed to be a voice of reason by any means  He s supposed to be a portrait of youth manipulated by society  but at the same time trying to distance himself and other youth from it  thus all the angst  Also  he realizes at the end of the book that you can t preserve innocence forever  and you have to let go eventually  and maybe being the Catcher in The Rye isn t the answer  I think those who aren t parents or teens have a hard time sympathizing with Holden  and to them he seems like a bit of a whiny asshole  All in all  one of my favorites   This story damn near killed me  The story telling killed me too  Especially the story telling  Just for the simple fact it was swell  Or may be I just connected it in some way  Being 16 n looking at the world with that mindset n opinion and we never come out of that phase v much  do we  It just grows with us  The part where Holden says  may be I want to be a catcher in the rye  may be it s just that I want to really do in my life  killed me  I felt like I got him in that moment  Like I ve lived those moments from time to time  I felt so damn happy  if you want to know the truth  I don t know why  It was just that she looked so damb nice  the way she kept going around and around  in her blue coat and all  God  I wish you could ve been there   I don t know what brought me to read this book  I had no idea what it was about  since there isn t even a summary on the back cover  but I soon realized that the only way to describe this book is by saying its just a long rant  Holden doesn t seem to be too likeable and all  look at that  I m even talking like him now  Anyway  he s negative and he s a hypocrite but there s just something that draws me into the story  Maybe it s because I can relate to Holden more than I d like to admit  Because other than that  it s not the most EXCITING read  I loved it still  though  but like another review said  you either relate to it or not  you either love it or hate it   catcher in the rye is one of my favorite novels by far  however  of salinger s works  it s not my favorite  still  catcher is a hugely important and relatable text  yet i feel like a lot of people miss the message of the book  holden is not intended to be the role model that salinger is holding up for all teenagers to worship  holden is a troubled kid dealing with grief and having no outlet  holden keeps trying to reach out  but his attempts often end up isolating him further  catcher is about the difficulty of asking for help  the ephemeral innocence of childhood  emotional fragility  the frightening imminence of adulthood  social interactions  and the masks we all put on to get us through the day  it s about hypocrisy and human nature  it s not about a whiny little kid blasting every  phony  he sees  and if you read into catcher like that  you are missing one of the great classics of 20th century american literature  Favorite book of all time  Holden Caulfield is the voice of youths generation  Either of teens in the 1950 s to 2050 s  Holden is an idol to everyone  Read this book when I was 13  and now that I m 21 I can still feel the connection between Holden and I  No matter how old you get you will always feel the connection  Even though Salinger was a grown man when he wrote this  it feels like you are the one writing this  It doesn t sound like an adult who wrote this story  it feels like Salinger is writing the story for you  JD Salinger is Holden Caulfield  I didn t get catcher in the rye theme tatttoos for nothing  This book is very special to me and always will be   This book is real We are flooded with phony books that constantly try to impose on a reader some sick ideas in a golden wrapping  That full of banal views  that crafted to strengthen ideals  give positive role models  success in life and so on  All such creations just forcing you to accept somebody s standards  somebody s views of life  and become somebody else  become like everybody else   All in all you re just another brick in the wall   Hypocrisy does not change this much But this book is real  and it becomes even more so  I do believe that this book is not for teens  at least it needs to be not just read in one s teen years  marked as  read  and forgotten   this book is for adults  I myself read it when I was  well  seventeen  liked it  was quite different on the background of the sugary moral inoculations  and forgot it  Now  the way later  I can see that the depth of it  the depth that cannot be described but felt  experienced This book is not for everybody  Some are quite happy with beer and TV  or whatever  success in life  means for them  as one of the writers said   a private version of Fudzi  though quite minuscule and puked on  exists for everyone    Those who will look for  ideas  and such will be disappointed   their mind does not let them feel a thing  And those who too much concerned with morals    well  it is better for them to keep reading their Bibles But this book is real  SPOILER WARNINGThe Catcher in the Rye was the first   classic   novel I read  and it introduced me to the world of classical literature  If it wasn t for it  I would have never read Faulkner  Nabokov  Heller etc But  The Catcher in the Rye is not just some shitty book that I am greatful to for introucing me to better things  It is a genuinley great and well written novel  Overrated  sure  and Salinger did write some far better things  but that doesn t change the fact that it is a fantastic read Holden is a very likable character  Admittedly  some of the language he uses is pretty dated    phony      that kills me   etc   but his ideas are very interesting  Holden s relationship with his sister and his memories of his younger brother    he was great  you would have loved him    are so well writtenI felt sad when I reached the last chapter  Like with all good books  I felt sad to say goodbye to the characters  I longed for a sequel or a film adaption  and yes  I know that there was an unofficial sequel written by someone else  but I want something more than that   but that would probably end up butchering it  The last chapter  though  it s so great  It honestly made me emotional  So yeah  as overrated as the book is  it is really great and well written  and recommended reading for all humans I read Catcher in the Rye my senior year of high school after hearing a friend say she loved it  I loved this book because I felt for Holden and all he goes through  Rereading it as an adult  I can see why I felt that way with more detail  Holden really is a kid who has been through a lot and his having trouble dealing with it  He really is a sensitive kid who does care about some people deeply  We see him for a few days dealing with the problems he is having in many ways  most of them not the best ways  As a teacher  this is interesting for me to look back on to think about how my students are dealing with troubles in negative ways  A kid behaving like Holden could have serious problems that aren t being dealt with correctly  Perks of Being a Wallflower is compared to this text and Charlie reads this text in Perks  Now rereading Catcher after Perks  I really can see many plot  character  and structural comparisons   The Catcher in the Rye has been one of my favorite books for years  I know it s not everyone s cup of tea  my husband got halfway through and asked what the plot was  Upon telling him there is no plot  he stared at me incredulously and probably questioned his reasons for marrying me  but I digress   I love books that express the raw emotions of life  and in my opinion  this is one of the best examples of that writing style  Holden is so easy to relate to  each sentence makes you want to turn the page and find out where he finally ends up  It s just such a beautiful coming of age tale  a story about growing up and finding your place in the world  It s a classic  and it s not too long  so I think everyone should give it a read at least once  brkhy mntqdyn mshkhl hwldn khlfyld r bHrn nshy z blwG  y ntwny z

read it  With constant hype and controversy within it s notorious pages  the phenomenal character development and the provocative nature of the main protagonist  Holden  is something that never fails to intrigue me  Set in the 1950 s  the book tells the story in the eyes of Holden Caulfield  an angsty and rebellious 16 year old  Reading the book  you are able to relive the most awkward  tragic  and gawky memories experienced by Holden in a matter of two days  Holden   a character which I d grown to love by the end of the book  provides these stories with a cynically beautiful tone  We discover the reason for Holden s pessimistic outlook on events occurring around him  and that s something I really admired  In a sense  Holden was so real  and relatable  which made the book all the more enjoyable for me  Not only do we see his growth  but we see his ability to react and respond in ways that challenge the reader  I enjoyed the way the events  even the most subtle  dovetail into each other to create different impacts  From him being expelled to hiring a stripper just to talk  the two days that we get to live as though we are Holden are packed with ironically hilarious and distressing events  I d highly suggest this book to anyone   Don t ever tell anybody anything if you do  you start missing everybody  The catcher in the rye     I don t believe in the kind of magic in my books but I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book  LOVED the book  had to read it in highschool  but have read it a couple of times since  sure it has it s basic conventions  but the voice is so clear and of a time when romance was dead  The voice of Caulfield resonates with so many people for one reason  Honesty Characters Introduced by ChapterChapter

everything is so goddamn bright and shiny and sunny and meaningless  FUCK  life is so full of crap there is one good thing in my life though  just read this book Catcher in the Rye  blown away  i don t know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say  it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book  things i didn t even realize i felt were right there on the page  I LOVED IT  i think this is my favorite novel of all time  which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs  durham will force us to read it all  man i hate that bitch journal entrytoday i am 20 years old  life is great as usual  just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake and bake session with j p  the sun is shining  the san diego weather is beautiful  and tonight i m off to rob   gregg s to destroy them at bullshit  love that game  gregg says that joelle will be there  yes   but she ll probably bring that prick pete with her  one of these days i m going to lose it and kick his ass   i m in a band    fuck you  pete  i will never spin your records all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik s american lit class  it is not a bad class  although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam  or davidoff s survey of modern postmodernism last semester  now that was a class  it blew my mind  so many things to think about  the reading in american lit has been okay  but we ve been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible  can t believe i ever liked this book  caulfield is a whiny little bitch  the book has no depth  there is literally nothing going on with the narrative  style  theme  characterization  it is just one rote cliche after another  he thinks he is such a rebel without a cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless  stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism  completely inane and without meaning  i think my essay will use some acker style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite  classic  truly is  i m going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel  baby journal entrytoday i am 25 years old  another gray  drizzly san francisco morning  i wish christopher would wake up  i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night  notes on my pillow  really   time to grow up dude  i will never  complete you   well actually i m glad he s still asleep  my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him  plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready  john is probably hard at work already  typical over achieving behavior  i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor  it s time for them to leave  they ve seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road  or learn to take a shower  this apartment is not the world s crashpad i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye  i remember hating this book in college for some reason  probably wasn t po mo enough for me  or  challenging   feh  what a pretentious idiot i was  this is a beautiful book  it changed my life as a kid  i m not sure how i would have survived orange county without it  just re reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked up shit in the world that kids have to deal with  i m not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful  or funny  that part with the clipping of the toenails is hilarious  ackley is such a douche  this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved  a perfect novel  it is so     human   i guess journal entrytoday i am 30 years old  man my head hurts   so hungover  my birthday party last night was awesome  even got to spend some time on the turntables  thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once   i must have made out with a half dozen people  sadly  no real action  i think last night s party will be the last big party i will ever throw  things have got to change  no more partying like the world is about to end  i still have my entire life ahead of me  tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice  i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter  that is not me  fuck them  if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House  than i am set  although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun  i m 30 years old now for chrissakes  still  i ve got to do something meaningful with my life  it cannot all be about booze  drugs  hooking up  and paying everyone s rent when they re broke  things have got to change i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts  what an inspiration  seriously  that is a classic novel  it is packed with meaning  i m twice caulfield s age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way  my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change  i love you  holden caulfied  it s not too late for me to learn from you  to find some meaning in life journal entrytoday i am 35 years old  another intense  sad  but deeply fulfilling week has passed  every day something meaningful happens  something so emotional and real  sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i ve seen  working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY  but it is also beautiful  it s hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too  thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things  anyway  so now marcy wants to have a kid  i just don t know how i feel about that  this is such a fucked up world  do we really want to bring new life into it  i dunno  it seems    selfish  somehow  she should just quit her job with the d a  s office and get back to her roots in the public defender s office instead  does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life  my life has meaning enough already  and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday  after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby  it was not an inspiring read  caulfield is so full of misplaced angst  i m not sure i even understand him anymore  why is he so pissed off  he s seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people  i want to like him  i want to re capture that feeling of affection i had for him  but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless  so naive  he really does not have it so bad  there is so much worse out there  i don t know how i would handle a kid like that  i hate to say it  but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it  oh the emotional self absorption of youth  just you wait  caulfield  it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up journal entrytoday i am 40 years old  when did i become a boss  it is like i woke up one day  mysteriously transformed into an old man  am i really a  leader   what does that even mean  sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me  last week i made a huge play on the Council  i had all my ducks in a row  and all the votes came in just as i had planned  everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact  some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in  even council members who voted against my motion   feh  phonies  the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd  almost disconnected from myself  is this who i am now  a public policy figure  a community advocate  a mayoral appointee  ugh  i can t stand the mayor  i don t feel like me  there is accomplishment there  and some satisfaction    but i am missing something  something visceral  something real  sweet Jesus  is this what a mid life crisis feels like  it is a weird feeling  like i know everything that i need to know about the world  about the people around me  how everything connects  but yet i still feel like i know so little about life  oh  such angst  mark  surely you ve outgrown this i ve started re reading A Catcher in the Rye  it s so strange  during different parts  i felt like crying  a wonderful and moving novel  i feel like i really understand holden  like he is my guide  my son  my brother  my friend    myself  i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen  it just has to happen  that s life after all  right  The Catcher In The Rye  Book Review I have known many people like Holden Caulfield  who is the main character in J D  Salinger s wonderful novel The Catcher In The Rye  Holden is 16 years old when the actual story takes place  but he narrates it at age 17  During the course of this novel  you will see the many changes that he has to adapt to in his life  and the way he adapts and thinks will probably come over as strange to you  This novel is a perfect example of how all teens struggle at some point in their life  and how the choices they make will effect the rest of their lives  I would recommend this book for anyone  especially teenagers  since they are going through some of the same things as Holden  This book is not limited to teenagers  since everyone in their life time either has been or will be a teenager  so anyone can somewhat relate to Holden   Holden lives in New York  when he is not at boarding school  He has two living  and one dead sibling  D B  is his oldest brother  and he lives in Hollywood  His little sister is Phoebe  who is very mature for her young age  Allie is Holden s brother who died of leukemia  There is one thing that Holden really cherishes that used to belong to Allie   The book starts out with Holden looking out over the football field at Pencey Prep  where he has just been expelled for his grades  Holden does not go to the bleachers with his class mates  instead he goes to his favorite teacher s house  Mr  Spencer to say goodbye  After Mr  Spencer  Holden s history teacher  lectures him about the importance of an education  he goes back to his dorm         Once at his dorm  Holden tells you about a truly odd character in Robert Ackley  Then you start to see Holden s true character  when he gets upset at his roommate Ward Stradlater  and wrestles with him  Holden is given a bloody nose  over the fact that Ward went on a date with one of Holden s  best friends   Jane Gallagher is a girl that lives next door to Holden in the Summer time  and there is a reoccurring theme that Holden identifies her with the whole story  that makes her different and special to him  After the fight  Holden waits in Ackley s room for a while before deciding to leave the school for good  He left the school three days before he was supposed to  and he decides to go to New York  On the train ride to New York  he meets a lady named Mrs  Morrow  to whom he tells lies to  The way Holden lies to her is by telling her that her  bastard  son  as he thinks of him  is a really great guy  This is the first example of Holden being something that he truly hates  a phony   Once Holden finally arrives in New York  he has nothing to do but  waste time   He spends all his  birthday money   that his grandmother sends him several times a year  Most of the money he spends goes towards buying alcohol  illegally since he is under aged  and taxi rides  On the taxi rides  another reoccurring theme takes place  Holden wonders the answer to the question   where do the ducks go in the winter   Another symbol that shows up in the book  is Holden s red hunting hat  and the object that reminds him of Allie also shows up several times during the story  Holden goes on a date with a girl named Sally Hayes  whom he used to hang out with  Holden claims that she is stupid  but that she is very attractive  He says that she is incapable of having an intelligent conversation  He meets several people while staying in New York  He meets several other characters while he is roaming around New York  Some of these characters have a positive effect  while others have a negative effect on him  These people he meets help him to find who he truly is inside  A major thing that Holden will have to deal with as his three days run out  is what to do next with his life  If you are interested in finding out what Holden does with his life  and the people who he meets that influence that decision  I highly recommend that you read this book  The Catcher In The Rye is truly one of the best and most entertaining books that you will ever read  Great use of the stream of consciousness writing  Holden is a great character for those who need a realistic but intellectually significant protagonist  The life and mind of a somewhat troubled adolescent comes to New York to find something he doesn t know at all  himself  I just wish that some of my friends had also read this book  so that we could sit around chewing the fat and shooting the shit about it all goddamn afternoon  This book kills me  It really does   The dominant thing I drew from the book  which I hadn t actually read before  but listened to the audiobook instead  was that almost all of the complaints I ve heard about it  even many of the ones I had  can easily be explained One major complaint people seem to have is with the character s style of speech  which is very repetitive and at times  meandering  The thing to keep in mind is the character is 17 and  we can safely assume  is speaking to the reader  not writing  Both of these are going to affect the depth of his vocabulary This helps develop the character further  because he feels like a real human being  Regardless of how slang has changed over the years  you still feel like a high school kid is telling you one long  rambling story  He s also used to show how adolescence  specifically apathy  labido  confusion  etc   can affect a person Another complaint people reference is the fact that Holden s more or less bitching and moaning throughout the majority of the book  That s his character  and although he is in the wrong most of the time  there are times where another character attempts to point it out to him  He s human  He s not designed to be likable or a hero  he s designed to be mentally flawed and close to reality  He drove me crazy at first  with his shit attitude toward life  until I began to realize how spot on it was  As I began to realize what the author was shooting for I began to enjoy it not for the entertainment of it  it doesn t matter how big of a literary buff you are  we re all suckers for the almost hollywood parts  but for the way it was crafted Keep in mind I m by no means any kind of expert in writing or  uh  anything else for that matter  so take what I say with a grain of salt  Either way it was much more enjoyable than I expected it to be based on memory  This book is about a boy named Holden  Holden is an extremely troubled young man  attending boarding school  Holden likes a girl named Jane  they used to date   Holden s roommate Stradlater is on a date with Jane and when Stradlater returns Holden and him get into a fight  Holden decided so leave boarding school early  On his way out he says goodbye to Spencer  his history teacher   Holden meets several people over the course of this book and the interactions are very strange  Holden eventually ends up at a hotel in Manhattan  his home town  after a train and taxi cab ride  Holden calls up a series of people from his past throughout the story  Some people he hasn t even met but has heard about  At the very end of the book it strongly hints that Holden is mentally ill do the loss of his younger brother  Holden ends up in a metal institution but he plans on going to a new school in the fall  it looks as if he might be on his way to full recovery   This is my favorite book of all time  This book really speaks to me  Holden is a really funny guy and he keeps the book very entertaining with his actions  but unfortunately Holden is dealing with some serious issues in his life  This books main theme is that life goes on  You cannot spend so much time letting the past effect you present  The death of Holden s brother is causing him so much pain that he almost takes it out on everyone  I believe Holden is looking for happiness throughout the entire book and never truly finds it until he embraces his present  his sister riding the carousel    Catcher in the Rye is the story of a young boy named Holden Caulfield who is Kicked out of boarding school and struggles to deal with the realities of the real world Catcher in the Rye has been one of my favorite books that I have read in school  I really liked Salinger s unique writing style and Holden s singular view on the world  When I read this book  I was feeling a little burned out on all of the required English curriculum books however  I soon found that I was able to connect with this book on a slightly weird level  This book caught me at a time of transition in my life where I was wanting to be more grown up than perhaps i actually was  This book deals quite a bit with the idea of innocence and the lose of it and I was really able to connect with Salinger s ideas  Once I started reading  I had a hard time putting it down and I quickly grew to love all of the characters  This book reminded me of the joys of reading and how fun it is to read a great book   SPOLIERS I LOVED this book  I had never read it for school  and I thought that I should give it a try  I had heard a lot of good things about it  even though I still had no idea what it was about  And I had no idea how to judge this book by its cover  So I just read it  And I loved it  I know that there were many things repeated  and that phrases were used over and over  but that s the point of the story  It s written by someone who is young  Someone who is telling you his story because he feels like it  I think that the writing really helps you see Holden s character   That killed me   He probably said that about 40 times through out the whole novel  But I loved it  I got depressed reading the book  Just because I got into how he was feeling  It was this loss of hope  and of pride  and of joy  And sometimes  I felt like that  And a lot of times  it had to do with school  and with people  and with not liking anything  And I could relate to what was going on  But I could also relate to the end  where he felt so happy just sitting there in the rain  getting soaked  Where he just felt like crying because he was so happy  Because he let go I loved it I love this book  And I would want all schools to make it a requirement   but sometimes   people hate books just because the school makes them read them So maybe   people should just find the magic of this book on their own   What can I say  One of the most controversial texts of its time  One of the most read and loved books of the youth Men  why sometimes do you want to leave responsibility behind for a life of adventure Women  why does your male partner refuse responsibility from time to time  and sometimes secretly resent  settling down  It s our inner Holden  this book s protagonist Holden probably reminds most people of themselves during the teen years  If you didn t have a little Holden in you  you may have been wise beyond your years  or a truly stifled  controlled childhood  So why does Holden represent a good part of male youth  Boundaries  Expected versus Perceived versus Actual Duty versus living loosely Masculine independence versus a childish dependance Listening versus teaching Leading versus following Sober versus Drunkenness And these boundaries  associated with the behavioral  filters   depend on the people that are around  teachers  parents  older friends  younger friends  peers  former teachers  and siblings  They even change depending on the moment s inter socioeconomic relations  And I d be guilty of whitewashing my own truth if I said that these feelings do not carry on through adulthood  they are just better suppressed and the outward identity firmed  But what male can read this and not say that Holden was alive in them in their youth  and still yet is a small voice in their mind  What woman can read this and not have an  Aha  moment about their adolescent relationships and the confusion of  boys  And when  in life  are these boundaries so variable  During the late adolescence when maturity is expected to overcome the inner child in Western culture  The hormones that stir and sift can almost be felt through regression  thanks to Salinger s handling of the subject I m not going to give any more spoilers to this book and the subjects it deals with  They are more numerous than I have enumerated Read it if you haven t read it  Reread it if the above doesn t stir memories of the book within you  I feel  sorry as hell  for the person who doesn t relate to the protagonist  and more sorry for the Junior or Senior in High School who isn t assigned this book  or decide to pick it up and read it  It is an unusual book which could only be liked by those who identify with the teenage character of Holden Caulfield  Either you can relate to his resentment with the world around him or you can t  The most appealing part of the book is that the lead character perceives everyone around him as a phony or a crook and is kind of a cynic but he himself suffers from some of those flaws  He is in that transition period between adolescence and adulthood  between immaturity and maturity and that s where the essence of this book lies  If you were a rebellious teenager who picked on the tiniest of flaws present in other people  you would have a great time reading it  Otherwise  it s a lousy book with a whiny lead character  5 stars   Really good book  It s about a 17 year old guy telling us about what he gone through after he flunked at school and how he doesn t give a damn about it and his rants about where he went after and all the people he met along the way Initial thoughts1  Holden Caulfield kills me  I really like him  3 I thought he s very very funny  And sweet in a way  I found it really interesting reading about a male s perspective on issues regarding people and their behavior 2  Lots of swearing  It didn t bother me though  I just feel it s overused 3  Not a typical straightforward story line  It s kinda difficult to tell where the story is going  But again  it didn t really bother me  The places where the events took place is very interesting and entertaining 4   spoiler  I really wished he did gave Jane Gallagher a buzz before he finished the story  He rants about that almost in all chapters then he didn t even call her at the end  Meh  because of that I did feel a little hung up about the ending  Or it s just me  Or it s because I want more hahahahaGaaaaah I think I developed a little crush on Holden   3 I m very fond of him  It might take a couple of days to forget him hahahaha  no  seriously  shq wn tykhhhyy hstm khh hwldn drh dr

bry wlynbr mykhwndmsh  This is a book that I think you need to read at the right age  right around the age of Holden  The first time I read this book ten years ago  I immensely enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye  I took Holden s account of reality as a credible account of looking upward into the ugliness of the adult world  I completely identified with his sense of being an outsider  as well as deep sensitivity toward other people Now ten years later  I have much less sympathy for Holden  I ve grown up since first reading his story to us  and with time my perception of Holden has shifted  I no longer can take his account of reality seriously and find fault with him for not improving himself  despite his antipathy for the world around him As it stands  this is still a wonderful book  Salinger successfully depicts the difficulties of coping in a society where you do not fit in  Its message transcends time and space  as many of my students in Slovakia enjoyed the book and its wonderful misanthropic protagonist  Holden Caulfield   I first read I first read this book when I was in junior high  And I think I read it again in my 20 s  I must have  because I remember so much of the book s details  When people argue about the impact of books on the development of young minds  I go back to this book and to Little Women  They both influenced me  but I had forgotten how much Catcher influenced me until I re read it  Now I know why I see people in two ways   their good side and their  phony  side  And why each winter I wonder where the ducks go  And how it feels to be confused and not know it  And how hard it is to ask someone for help  Holden does all these things  Even though the language and setting is a little dated at this point  I still feel so much a part of everything that happens  I guess Little Women taught me that  the poor will always be with us   And Holden Caulfield taught me that the world is full of phonies  but sometimes they just knock you out with their humor or something  I wish I could write this better  I really do    Besides  I m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything  I ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run down and had to come out here and take it easy  I mean that s all I told D B  about  and he s my brother and all    p 1   No  everybody s fine at home   I said   It s me  I have to have this operation   Oh  I m so sorry   she said  She really was too  I was right away sorry I d said it  but it was too late  It isn t very serious  I have this tiny little tumor on the brain   Oh  no   She put her hand up to her mouth and all  Oh  I ll be all right and everything  It s right near the outside  And it s a very tiny one  They can take it out in about two minutes  Then I started reading this timetable I had in my pocket  Just to stop lying  Once I get started  I can go on for hours if I feel like it  No kidding  Hours    p 51 You should see her  You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life  She s really smart  I mean she s had all A s ever since she started school  As a matter of fact  I m the only dumb one in the family  My brother D B  s a writer and all  and my brother Allie  the one that died  that I told you about  was a wizard  I m the only really dumb one  But you ought to see old Phoebe  She has this sort of red hair  a little bit like Allie s was  that s very short in the summertime  In the summertime  she sticks it behind her ears  She has nice  pretty little ears  In the wintertime  it s pretty long  though  Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn t  It s really nice  though  She s only ten  She s quite skinny  like me  but nice skinny  Roller skate skinny  I watched her once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park  and that s what she is  roller skate skinny  You d like her  I mean if you tell old Phoebe something  she knows exactly what the hell you re talking about  I mean you can even take her anywhere with you  If you take her to a lousy movie  for instance  she knows it s a lousy movie  If you take her to a pretty good movie  she knows it s a pretty good movie  D B  and I took her to see this French movie  The Baker s Wife  with Raimu in it  It killed her  Her favorite is The 39 Steps  though  with Robert Donat  She knows the whole goddam movie by heart  because I ve taken her to see it about ten times  When old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse  for instance  when he s running away from the cops and all  Phoebe ll say right out loud in the movie  right when the Scotch guy in the picture says it   Can you eat the herring   She knows all the talk by heart  And when this professor in the picture  that s really a German spy  sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing  to show Robert Donat  old Phoebe beats him to it  she holds up her little finger at me in the dark  right in front of my face  She s all right  You d like her  The only trouble is  she s a little too affectionate sometimes  She s very emotional  for a child  She really is  Something else she does  she writes books all the time    p 60 61 I got up closer so I could hear what he was singing  He was singing that song   If a body catch a body coming through the rye   He had a pretty little voice  too  He was just singing for the hell of it  you could tell  The cars zoomed by  brakes screeched all over the place  his parents paid no attention to him  and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing  If a body catch a body coming through the rye   It made me feel better  It made me feel not so depressed any more    p 104 The part that got me was  there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture  The phonier it got  the more she cried  You d have thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell  but I was sitting right next to her  and she wasn t  She had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom  but she wouldn t take him  She kept telling him to sit still and behave himself  She was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf  You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies  and nine times out of ten they re mean bastards at heart  I m not kidding    p 126 I was crazy about The Great Gatsby  Old Gatsby  Old sport  That killed me  Anyway  I m sort of glad they ve got the atomic bomb invented  If there s ever another war  I m going to sit right the hell on top of it  I ll volunteer for it  I swear to God I will    p 127 There was this magazine that somebody d left on the bench next to me  so I started reading it  thinking it d make me stop thinking about Mr  Antolini and a million other things for at least a little while  But this damn article I started reading made me feel almost worse  It was all about hormones  It described how you should look  your face and eyes and all  if your hormones were in good shape  and I didn t look that way at all  I looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones  So I started getting worried about my hormones  Then I read this other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not  It said if you had any sores in your mouth that didn t heal pretty quickly  it was a sign that you probably had cancer  I d had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks  So figured I was getting cancer  That magazine was some little cheerer upper  I finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk  I figured I d be dead in a couple of months because I had cancer  I really did  I was even positive I would be  It certainly didn t make me feel too gorgeous    p 176 The Christmas before last I took her downtown shopping with me  We had a helluva time  I think it was in Bloomingdale s  We went in the shoe department and we pretended she  old Phoebe   wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes  the kind that have about a million holes to lace up  We had the poor salesman guy going crazy  Old Phoebe tried on about twenty pairs  and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up  It was a dirty trick  but it killed old Phoebe  We finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them  The salesman was very nice about it  I think he knew we were horsing around  because old Phoebe always starts giggling  Anyway  I kept walking and walking up Fifth Avenue  without any tie on or anything  Then all of a sudden  something very spooky started happening  Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb  I had this feeling that I d never get to the other side of the street  I thought I d just go down  down  down  and nobody d ever see me again  Boy  did it scare me  You can t imagine  I started sweating like a bastard  my whole shirt and underwear and everything  Then I started doing something else  Every time I d get to the end of a block I d make believe I was talking to my brother Allie  I d say to him   Allie  don t let me disappear  Allie  don t let me disappear  Allie  don t let me disappear  Please  Allie   And then when I d reach the other side of the street without disappearing  I d thank him  Then it would start all over again as soon as I got to the next corner  But I kept going and all    p 177 178 That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under you nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive  in fact    p 183 l shy lyql  mn l  ml lty stuqr  mr  thny  wthlth  n bqy  mr  wstkhrj mnh bnTb  mkhtlf fy kl mrHl   mry  lk khll qrth At first  I m finding a direction to Holden s story because I don t have a clue of what will happen to him  and so after reading the first few chapters  I quit reading  But after a month  my friend encouraged me to continue reading it and so I did  Guess what  I read the book in one month because I don t want to let go of Holden in my life  It was like I m traveling with him and he s conversing with me  He is one of the most smart literature characters ever created  thanks to J D  Salinger  After reading every chapter  I will pause on reading and rethink of Holden s experiences and decisions  My favourite part in the book is the ending  I think it s one of most beautiful ending I ve read and it brought me to tears  What a terrific book and it deserves to be categorised as a classic and enduring novel   This is one of the most significant and personal works of literature of I have ever read  I understand when people say Holden is annoying or that the book is annoying repetitive  because it is  But this is not without a purpose and a meaning  For me at least  it was so accurate and realistic in every aspect  and absolutely necessary  I know I will be thinking about this book for a long time   The book that I read was The Catcher and The Rye by J  D  Salinger  This book is about this college student named Holden Caulfield who has dropped out of college and goes to New York to stay there for three days  I liked the way that the character main character narrates the book it just seems as though he is talking directly to you  The character is a disillusioned guy who believes everyone is who he thinks they are  The character is a person that doesn t really listen to what other people have to say he just thinks of what he believes things are in life  This book is the most unusual and pleasing books I have read  it s interesting to really get to learn a lot about a character especially in this book because the thoughts of Holden Caulfield are some much different than any other persons  So it makes you see things in life that are true but mostly not  The plot of the book was very interesting for me it is just a unusual topic  and the writer just writes the story in a way that makes it very good  He also makes this weird  kind of mean  insensible guy and makes him into this likeable character  I would give this book a thumbs up  it is a very well written and well thought out book  But if you don t like stories that don t have action  suspense  romance  mystery in them you might not like this book  For me it is a fast pace book that everyone should read even of you don t like the style of book  because it is a book that is kind of hard to not like   Holden Caulfield  a seventeen year old prep school adolescent relates his lonely  life changing twenty four hour stay in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of the adult world while attempting to deal with the death of his younger brother  an overwhelming compulsion to lie and troubling sexual experiences  Holden Caulfield es un adolescente que se encuentra en el proceso de convertirse en adulto  nos cuenta un fragmento de su vida mientras pasa por diversas situaciones  tiene indiferencia hacia muchas cosas que la sociedad dicta debe prestarle importancia  Con una narracion sencilla Salinger a traves de Holden nos regalan un buen libro  A este libro le tengo mucho carino debido a que desencadeno varias recomendaciones que hoy son parte de mi vida  Lo lei porque lo encontre en una lista que se encontraba entre libros de culto  queria leer algo diferente y lo hice  me parecio como ya lo dije muy sencillo y cuando lo termine  investigue un poco sobre el y me encontre con que era el libro de los asesinos  se me hizo absurdo puesto que no encontre alguna relacion entre cometer un asesinato y las vivencias de Holden  Posteriormente escribi un tuit en alusion al libro y a lo que estaba relacionado que fue   Acabo de leer El guardian entre en el centeno y no tengo ni tantitas ganas de matar a alguien importante   Despues de eso recibi un favorito de un Holden Centeno  me resulto gracioso  entre a su perfil  tenia buenos tuits  decia que tenia un blog sobre literatura y musica  que en el blog tambien hablaba de un chica que conocio  la cual al igual que el su grupo favorito era Los Planetas y a raiz de eso vino una gran historia  Inmediatamente entre al blog llamado Holden tiene twitter y me encontre con una entrada maravillosa que rapidamente me hizo querer leer todo su blog y asi lo hice  en varios dias termine de leer todas  me enamore de Holden centeno lo comence a seguir en todas sus redes sociales  En cada entrada coloca una o dos canciones  espectaculares todas  habla de libros  no se si directa o indirectamente  pero casi todo lo que recomienda es bueno  ahora tengo una nueva banda favorita gracias a el  que es Supersubmarina y otras maravillosas bandas y solistas espanoles  tambien lei El palacio de la luna y El curioso incidente del perro a media noche y tengo varios pendientes  En fin todo esto gracias a El guardian entre entre el centeno  It truly is a inspiring book  I enjoyed the great amount of reality that plays in this book  Holden Caulfield reflects how most teenagers are today  we are confused at adulthood and childhood  Some of us teens are not ready to make that leap  because to us its a major step and its a change that s quite overwhelming  Holden reminds me of myself and teenagers at my high school  We all face depression  we all cry our eyes out and we sometimes just don t know what to do and our only option is to blame others for our uncertainty  I read this book in school and I can honestly say I am glad I had the opportunity to read and experience the hardships faced upon Holden with in the 3 nights roaming around New York  I recommend all students in high school to read Catcher in The Rye  once you start reading it  you wont be able to put it down  Although its explicit in some parts  it was worth reading because the most important thing is realizing reality and knowing that life is a learning experience  Like they say  you don t stop learning until your heart stop beating  I thought I should read this book since I am probably the only one in my generation who didn t read it while they were young  Besides Holden s narrative dealing with teenage angst and alienation  it also tracked his progression towards a nervous breakdown  To that extent  the book brought a darker book  Sylvia Plath s The Bell Jar  to mind  When Holden found himself crying for little reason  I couldn t help but remember Esther Greenwood   khtb r chndyn br mHmd w ms wd pyshnhd khrdh bwdnd khh bkhwnm m hr br khh s y mykhrdm nskhh PDF r bkhwnm t

relationships with family members and  friends  and above all his witty  dark  sense of humour  I m glad I finally got the chance to read it and I m happy that I was about the same age as Holden and could empathize with the character and his life more  This is a great book     This book instantly became on of my favorites  The protagonist  Holden Caulfield  is so straight foward an honest  I can say whole heartedly that it has affected my own writing style as an amateur writer  This book presents a troubled teenage boy who is growing up  and as he s growing up he s beginning to see the world differently and it makes him depressed  In fact  almost everything makes him depressed  The only thing he could think of that doesn t make him depressed is his little sister  who looks up to him like a father Salinger s novel takes the reader through alcoholism  prostitution  sexual inuendo  and  flitty  advances In many ways  The Catcher in the Rye reminded me of A Clockwork Orange  both being told by first person narrators who have almost given up on life  walk the streets at night  constantly seeking alcohol  sex  and companionship  But Holden is certainly not as terrible as Alex And  dare I say  Salinger is certainly not as terrible as Burgess In the end  this novel tells the very relatable about teen angst and rebellion  I think all teenagers who feel this angst should read this book and live vicariously through Holden to really see what life could be like  and to appreciate fully their own life   I started reading it cause basically because Wikipedia lists hell lots of people who killed somebody else based on a principal  had mentioned reading the catcher in the rye in their  good reads  list  So  I wanted to who I m going to kill after reading it   As I said before you keep me awake at 3am reading  I ll give you 5 stars in my over applauding rating system  However  it definitely suffers from the same inflated intellectual ability that the  Extremely loud and incredibly close  was suffering   They were actually quite similar in style I bet Foyer had read the Catcher in the rye  it was just minor case of that  I doubt there many 17 years old with so much awareness of their surroundings I can relate to Holden in some sense  During all years in school I was an outlier more or less  I got the 2th worst GPA in the whole class one semester then 3rd best next semester  I really couldn t give a damn when I wasn t in the mood to study  But I wasn t so aware of what is going on in my head to the level that Holden was At the end I will see that how the book can intensifies the hatred feeling of the society outliers to do something heroic  Even though  Salinger puts that message in Holden s pervert teacher  Immature dies for noble cause but mature lives humbly   I guess it is too subtle for the principalist murderers  freedom fighters  terrorists etc  The best goddam book I ve ever read J D  came out later and said it was mostly autobiographical  You will think it was biographical to your life in many ways  A language was unbelievable annoying but that was a true adolescence which anyone could have been through  Old Holden was surprisingly sensitive  sometimes act like a grown up man  sometimes like a feeble minded child  Overall I had a good time spending moment with this book  No wonder this novel is a classic  It may not have a climax or even an elaborated  interesting  plot  but this goddamn book has one of the most fascinating antiheroes I ve ever ran into  This book killed me  it really did   I am sure everything that could be said has been said about this book  so I am writing this review mainly for my own benefit Holden Caulfield seems to be loved or hated  I really liked his character  From the first paragraph I felt I was being pulled into the mind of a person who couldn t keep still  a twitchy type that had a nervous laugh and talked too fast  I found myself reading really quickly almost tripping over the words as the style of prose made me feel that s how Holden would be talking The language that was so shocking when the book was published is tame compared to modern standards but you can understand how this would have been controversial in it s day  However it was the constant use of the word  phoney  that was the only thing to bother me in any way  I can see how it was necessary for the book to be written in this style to get the feeling of a teenage boy across  He was trying to act tough and grown up on the outside but underneath it all was a huge sense of loss and grief  He was a good kid  someone who treated people generally with respect  other than the language that gets him in trouble with Sally and late night drunken phone calls   he didn t like to see women taken advantage of or other kids bullied and was man enough to stick to his beliefs  a tough thing to do as a teenager  which is why he didn t fit in I got to the end of the book wanting to read more of his story  to see how he did in his new school and further on in his life  I really wanted him to be well and grow into a happy young man    Non facevamo che tenerci per mano  ad esempio  Vi sembrera una cosa da niente  lo capisco  ma era fantastica quando la tenevate per la mano  La maggior parte delle ragazze  provate a tenerle per la mano  e quella maledetta mano o muore nella vostra  o loro credono di dover continuare a dimenarla tutto il tempo  come se avessero paura di annoiarvi o che so io  Jane era un altra cosa  Andavamo in un dannato cinema o in un posto cosi  e subito cominciavamo a tenerci per mano  e non ci lasciavamo sino alla fine del film  E senza cambiare posizione ne farne un affare di stato  Con Jane non stavi nemmeno a pensare se avevi la mano sudata o no  Sapevi soltanto che eri felice  E lo eri davvero    One of my favorite books  Thankfully  it was written long ago and I was able to give it to my son when a school teacher took away a C  S  Lewis book that he was reading   That was made into a movie    the teacher complained  There was only one thing left to do  and this was to give him Catcher  He loved it  Read it every year until he was a senior  His final review was so sophisticated  it got him into a well known private college  Today  my son is a successful lawyer  I credit his success at least in part to this wonderful book that all kids should read in the sixth grade  It is a real story about getting through life  despite grown ups who get in the way  Bless J  D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Rye is a book that is very important to read in adolescence  I feel like I have read this novel at a very important time in my life   There is a reason why this book is a classic  It has all the components of greatness  So worth the read  It should be taught in every high school in America   I remember dreaming as kid how exciting it would be to know how to drive or maybe be in the twelfth grade  Now I just want to stop growing up because I m afraid of the responsibilities that world throws at me  and I m expected to hang on  I believe that s something every adult experienced  but doesn t seem to tell their secrets  In the novel  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D Salinger  Holden struggles through his teenage life because he is so naively fixated on childhood  Holden wishes the world would be frozen between innocence of childhood and the complex adulthood  He hates change and would rather be frozen between the transitions   Then  finally  I found it  What it was  it was partly frozen and partly not frozen   Salinger 200   This presents a vision of an ideal world Holden can understand  a changeless Siberian atmosphere  so this way  he could never grow up to be an adult   Holden states he enjoys visiting the museum because it is always the same each time he visits   The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move  You could go there a hundred thousand times  and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish  the birds would still be on their way south  the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole  with their pretty antlers and their pretty  skinny legs  and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket  Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   Salinger 158   To begin explaining this oversized quotation  I want to point out Holden uses  you  and not  me  at the end of the final sentence  This is so significant  it was italicized in my copy of the book  If Holden would have chosen to use me  that would necessitate him to change  to encounter the real world rather than remain fixed in his imaginative construction of his own   This is the end of my essay  I think that s how Holden would have said it  knowing him  He would not want things to remain unthawed  Meaning  he would not want this essay to continue to something much more complex than it already is  I have reached the required two hundred words   Nevertheless  Holden struggles with this and narrates like an old man at a nursing home wanting the hell out  how ironic for someone who is considered childish  Other than that  we see his more genuine side for curiosity for the ducks at Central Park   You know those ducks in that lagoon right near Central Park South  That little lake  By any chance do you happen to know where they go  the ducks  when it gets all frozen over    Salinger 78  He is often concerned where the ducks may go when the lake freezes  He wonders if a guide would lead them or they leave by utter instinct  Holden s thoughts and concerns are childish  but those such qualities led me to love this character  The catcher in the rye is that guide to help from falling under  Finding a home in a world of ridicule  A guy that worked for my dad was living with us in ND while he was going to school  At 4 30 each day  we would watch Jeopardy and compete to answer more questions  There were several references to Catcher in the Rye so I read the book so I could beat the guy  Turns out that he had to read the book for a class he was taking so it was a wash  Bottom line  really good book  I read this in high school  and recently re read it  The voice is captivating and timeless  The issues are relevant even today  Such a great book by a talented author   SO RELATABLE  I thought people were being dumb when they talked about how a book from the 1950s could understand the struggles of adolescence and life overall but it definitely does and captures these things in a gripping way   I loved this book  How could I have not  This man described me perfectly  I totally relate to him  This book was an amazing book to read  I couldn t put it down  I am new to Good reads  and haven t up till now submitted a review  So where better to start than with my all time favourite book  Okay  so this probably means I can t give a too objective a review but then I guess there is a reason that it is my favourite in the first place  I have met two types of people  The people who hate this book  and the people who love it  I fall into the latter  I guess as a character  Holden doesn t make himself easy to love  I can understand the haters  Holden is damaged goods at best  At worst he is winey  annoying  and thinks the world owes him something  I can also see why it was such a controversial book in its time  It may not be too shocking by today s standards  but you wouldn t exactly want Mr Caulfield to be a role model for your own children  So why do I love him  As much as he may be all those things mentioned  he is undeniably one of the most interesting literary characters I can think of  Despite his moaning and complaining  there is something about him that makes you cheer him on  I also want to give him a big hug and tell him everything is going to be all right  Something that would probably do him the world of good  The story is set over just a few days  and every detail is described with beauty and detail  So despite it only being a short book  there is plenty of time to get into Holden s head and get to know him  He is bitter and complex  but underneath it all I am sure there is a big heart hidden away  I loved this book so much  The writing style of Salinger is really great  and I was able to finish this book in 2 days  Now that says something  really  I really got attached to Holden  and still refer to him in daily life sometimes  which might be kind of sad  actually    In the beginning  I admit I did not like Holden Caulfield  I felt I couldn t relate to him  After the first 15 chapters that changed  I realized that  boy oh boy  I am way too much like Holden Caulfield  So much that I almost want to post a list of how we are alike  but that is not the point of reviews and I doubt it would be interesting reading  There are few eye opening moments in Catcher in the Rye  The line that most sticks in my head is this    The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   I will be honest  lines don t really stick in my head and this one doesn t either  but its meaning does I can understand why this book is a classic  There is so much that I don t think I fully grasp everything yet  it is one of those books I think should be reread every so often  I wouldn t have read this book if not for Nerdfighters  Blurbing Book Club  so I thank author John Green for picking it  The Catcher in the Rye is indeed a classic novel  full of symbolism for the teenage mind and also for the adult mind  The reason people dislike this novel is because of Holden Caulfield  the protagonist of the book  they claim he is whiny  annoying  and generally boring and depressed  The truth is  at one point in our life  we all become a scent of Holden  they bit of the mind that makes you hate everybody and question everything  And at one point you are cured from it Great Novel  go ahead and read it   Aqui esta a minha opiniao em video   https   www youtube com watch v WdU1p    lezzetlimi lezzetli bir kitap  As I said in my last update  I really enjoyed this book because it made me think  Holden expresses his distaste for many of the adults in his life or that he sees around the city because they are  phony   He also talks about how his favorite person is his little sister  who brings a freshness that only unadulterated innocence can  Holden then expresses that his goal would be to protect the innocent from the cruelness of society and growing up  but then implies that this is impossible  This really made me think about myself and the society that I have grown up in  While I agree that children often grow up too quickly  I thought that Holden was quite harsh judging the adults around him  He always blames the person he s judging for being phony  but after all  they are just a product of the personality they have always had and their surroundings  Therefore  do they even have control over how  phony  they are  He always just assumes that he is the only right one out of a bunch of people  which makes me wonder why he didn t ever question if HE is in the wrong  I feel that many teenagers think that it s them against this corrupt society that they live in all the time  which is basically what Holden believes  This explains why this book is so popular among young people and how it became kind of a manifesto for an entire generation of teenagers   I have loved and hated Holden Caulfield like I have loved and hated myself  Now that I m over all that teenage angst  I can only feel sorry for the protagonist of this book  Ah   the stupidity of acne  Ah   the sadness of no facial hair  You ll get over it  Holden  In the meantime  the world is coming to an end  Isn t this on everyone s list  Initial thoughts after finishing Whoa  That was one hell of a book  Holy I don t know what  This is The Bell Jar s twin brother  all right    Actual review I put off reviewing this for the longest time  partially due to laziness and partially because I didn t feel like I could do it justice  But here I am now So  The Catcher in the Rye I won t blather on about the plot  because there really isn t much of one  or the writing  because that s nothing special  What I will do is gush about the main character  As deeply and intimately as I love Heathcliff  my other favorite fictional character   I love Holden I don t know how I love him  Sometimes I think it s more like as I would a boyfriend  other times as I would a brother  Either way  Holden Caulfield  with his judgmental  pessimistic  somewhat unlikable  yet observant nature masking a more caring  thoughtful  sensitive side  will always have a special place in my heart What makes this book timeless  Why is it considered a classic  Because it deals with emotions teenagers experience today  pain  fear  loneliness  depression  and confusion  In a sense  their psyches have split in half  the innocent  carefree child and the mature  clear thinking adult  Teens are stuck in the middle  in the process of leaving behind one and becoming the other  Some never make it Because I can My Mostly Nirvana Catcher in the Rye Playlist  featuring Rush  Lorde  and the Beatles  1   Lounge Act  Nirvana2   Stain  Nirvana3   Presto  Rush4

vien am anh vcd  suyt ngat      This is very nearly the quintessential coming of age novel  I find it hard to imagine a person reading this book and not identifying with how isolated Holden is and how valid his interpretation of the world can be  Holden s worldview and his status in this worldview are oftentimes the product of things interpreted as being black and white  this or that   There s so much to say about rebellion in Catcher  but that s interestingly not what impacted me the most after reading it  What I find interesting about Catcher is that these few days of Holden s life are narrated and purposefully  black and white   yet there is this natural littering of fantastic tinges of  grey area   Salinger almost forces the reader to know Holden as THE epitome of  phony   he narrates in a black and white worldview as if he s trying to get the reader to believe that s who he really is  but he ends up being the most  grey  of all the characters  For example  and a more poignant part for me  are chapters 25 and 26  Holden s slew of emotional turn of events since the beginning of the novel culminate in his decision to move to a cabin in the country  But he s stopped almost dead in his tracks when  after his sister walks up to meet him at the park holding a suitcase  she tells him the suitcase is her s and she wants to go with him  Holden gets mad at her  tells her to shut up  and she gets very upset with him Just like every interaction with his sister  this affects Holden in a significant way that seems to cause him to let go  a little bit  of his black and white worldview for a short period of time  He becomes the Catcher again  this time because his sister tells him it s okay To me  moments like these represent Holden s very gradual evolution   How much less black and white can that be when compared to Holden s narration    Even though the last chapter has Holden almost completely returning to his natural tone  I like to think it is blatantly obvious that Holden has been affected by his last few days  His tone doesn t seem to indicate a dramatic shift in his worldview or his attitude  But he s just written his recollection of the days prior and he acknowledges  in his own way  that some very important things have happened to him along the way  even if he doesn t understand them yet It s entirely likely  even obvious  that Holden is changing  just very slowly   Like any other human being  no one changes who they are in a matter of days  even if the events are significant  That is what makes this novel most relatable to me   No  he is not a brand new person  But he sure seems to be at a crossroads   D B  asked me what I thought about all this stuff I just finished telling you about  I didn t know what the hell to say  If you want to know the truth  I don t know what I think about it  I m sorry I told so many people about it  About all I know is  I sort of miss everybody I told about  For all that Holden interprets as and tries to convince us is black and white  he turns out the be the most grey character of the book  In the book  Holden goes through many dramatic changes in life from getting kicked out of Pencey Prep to wanting to flee to the west to seek solitude  These different changes affect the way Holden views the world and what make him the person he is  On the way  Holden meets people that also alter his way of thinking whether it be the loss of innocence or the harsh fact that everyone grows up  Holden seeks comfort and companionship from old friends and also wisdom from his trustful old English teacher  The way how Holden perceives the world as filed with phonies is very relatable to the common person because in society people don t do things usually out of the goodness of their heart  but usually for something in return  Holden also talks about society and how its corrupted and how  it s hopeless  anyway  to change it  Overall  i give this book a 5 star all day because it was very enjoyable and relatable how Salinger uses a unique style of writing that gave the book its own unique characteristic  I never read Catcher in high school  According to common opinion  and I mean common  I can think of only one person who read the book as an adult and did not say this   this is a book that is best read and is only appreciated when one is a teenager  This is  of course  not an entirely groundless sentiment  Holden is the prototype of teenage angst  But while the common opinion would seem to see nothing of substance to the novel when the perspective of adulthood can no longer identity with the essential youthfulness  or immaturity  of Holden s perspective  I saw a great deal of humor and the incisive and entirely truthful representations of the many pointless peculiarities of human behavior in modern society  This is a social novel  It is  indeed  notable that Holden s only real source of immediate passionate engagement with the world is his little sister  a symbol of spontaneity uncorrupted by the trappings of social life and its demands on authenticity  This is the real source of the fault I find in the book  it is essentially the brief chronicle of a kind of saint who is also a kind of idolater  Holden cannot be touched by the corruptions of social life  his authenticity must remain stainless  Like all saints  Holden projects his hatred of his own failures of authenticity onto the world around him and becomes a moralizer  Like all moralizers  there must be an ideal to which he and the world can never fully measure up  in Holden s case  this ideal is represented by his little Sister  an idol pure authenticity  That is the kind of story that offends against the sentiments of atheism and realism  but there is something all too familiar in the dynamics of Holden s saintly worship  a residue that was not entirely expunged when we grew up and stopped going to church  But Salinger offends those sentiments so well  one can t help but go in for it  I couldn t put the book down   The best book ever    Salinger haven t created just a character like Holden Caulfield  he lived with him  so readers can feel all of emotions about him It is alive book which is never die  Reviewed by EnriqueThe Cather in the Rye is a story of a boy named Holden Caulfield when he drops out Pencey prep school in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  He leaves and goes on an adventure and talks a lot of shit about people  One of the things I love most about Holden is the fact that he is straight forwarded  sarcastic and makes me laugh while I read   That s a HUGE thing   Holden doesn t really do anything productive and is  the bad seed  of the family  His parents are rich  his older brother writes children s book and his little sister Phoebe who he is really close to is still in school  In the end of all the booze  and drugs Holden finds himself stuck in a place he can t get out of   The book that got me to love reading and appreciate it for all it can do  At the time of reading  I connected so well to Holden that it was creepy  I never connected to a character in a book so deeply than when I read  Catcher in the Rye   I could barely put it down out of anxiousness for wanting to know what was going to happen to Holden while on this adventure through NYC  I won t argue with anyone who hates this book  It wasn t written the best  It didn t quite make sense at times  And it definitely had characters that could piss you off  But I enjoyed every minute of it  and that s all I care about  and that s all I require of any book to which I grant 5 stars  This is not your typical coming of age story  Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of a private prep school at age 16 and spends the next few days in New York City  The character may have been the original rebel without a cause  He is cynical  like all teens  but unlike so many of todays teens he has no want for social status or popularity  This was a very polarizing book at its 1951 release  Young people who could identify with the main character loved it  The older generations  the greatest generation in particular  hated it and the characters rambling around for days with not particular goal  The book made it back to the top of the sales list 3 decades later when it was one item being carried by Mark David Chapman at the time of his assassination of John Lennon  And though the book gets a bad rap for being in that killers backpack  that very real incident has nothing to do with the actual plot of the book  It is still very polarizing today  although less so than it was 60 years ago when it was originally published  That staying power alone makes it a classic  It is definitely a book for teenage people  it shows every problem that hides under adolescence  I think that every teenager can find this book a little comforting  as they can relate to the character s feelings and mind  I personally enjoyed every part of the book  reading it felt as if my thoughts were away and I only focused on the things happening in the book    A book by an author I have never read before for my popsugar reading challenge This book was     Why had it taken me so looong to finally read it  I don t know  But I m so happy I finally did  It was pure luck actually that they had it in our library  because the first thing the woman there told me was that they don t have any at the moment  But they did  Yay  Back to the book    Even though it was written many years ago  the writing style felt like from this decade  Salinger portraits Holden s life brilliantly  I laughed a lot  I stopped sometimes to re read a sentence or two and think about it again  It may seem that the book is about nothing but the story s got a kind of deep meaning  You just gotta read it  Just do so if you have not done so yet  I m so glad the new bio of Salinger got me rereading his books  This one knocked me out  When I first read it some 50 odd years ago I suppose I identified with Holden  judging parents  siblings  teachers  and fellow students  and missing the love  wisdom  and compassion that creep in at first and then permeate the whole story  This time I felt so sorry for the poor boy  wanted to hug him and mother him and ended all misty eyed  Salinger carried the first six chapters of _Catcher_ with him as a survival charm through 299 days of combat beginning with D day and ending with the liberation of one of the worst corners of Dachau  There will never be a movie of _Catcher_ if Salinger s will holds  he would never forgive Hollywood for what it did with one of his stories   I read this book two years ago  and did not necessarily fall in love with it upon first read  However  I enjoy it because the story is about someone who seems alone  and yet goes on this journey to discover himself  It shows an interest and true insight into the mind of someone who wants nothing more than to no longer be burdened by the pain of his past  One of the things with which I identified was how whenever Holden would talk about his past  he would say  you   instead of saying  I   because it was something that he did not want to experience again  Now I found many things that were still inherently wrong with the book that I do not agree with  but I do like how the novel provides me with the ability to empathize just a bit better with people who feel alone because they have not yet discovered the Truth  Embarrassed that I hadn t read it until my 38th year  but it was worth the wait  Surrounded by angry teens  it still holds up  All of them lurching around  searching  hating  wanting  dreaming  Sometimes people  in silence  write  fuck  on a bathroom wall  Sometimes they scream it   I enjoyed this book a lot  When I started to read it I had different expectations regarding it  but it did not disappoint  Holden is an amazing protagonist and I m sure many people can relate to him at some point in their lives  as did I  From the first chapter you can sense that something is up with him and that this story is not going to be an easy one  His character alone was so complex and such a joy to analyze  but also very sad For author to reach his readers in such a way is truly remarkable Anyway  this book gave me a lot of thought about the world and people  our society in general  also about people like Holden  I truly gained a lot from reading it and highly recommend it to others no matter what age you are  It goes a long way in living up with it s name for creating delusions  the confusion sinks into you even before you know it  gripping and powerful  albeit subtly   That s all I d do all day  I d be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know It s crazy    I had read this years ago    it brought back many memories of my thoughts in the past  a coming of age realization of how much I have changed  Salinger was able to reach and connect with how many young people think even sixty years after catcher in the rye was written  This book is meaningful to me personally because many of my friends think how Holden does especially the part of how every around him is  fake   Very well written  I enjoyed the journey that Holden went through and felt like I was a part of the story  Talk about behind the return of a teenager  Holden Caulfield  from the boarding of Pencey  which has been expelled  to New York where his family lives  His parents do not know who has been expelled far that has returned to the city  Holden is a young man with severe relationship problems and some psychotic feature  which serves the author to show the anguish of adolescent misfits  The story lasts for three days when the hero shows his aversion to social conventions and all types of relationships with former colleagues and acquaintances  whom some considered hypocritical  Only this characterization escapes his sister Phoebe  who loves truth and that is the innocence of childhood  and Allie  another brother who died of leukemia  who remembers and who has a positive short conversations that demonstrate his psychic disturbance  In the end  the novel is just writing the psychiatrist has asked him to do these days and we have asked him in secret  If I read until the 3rd or 4th chapter and stop there  I will give this book a 3 star instead of a 5  But I continue on and I am glad I did  Salinger crafted Holden so brilliantly that I was so absorbed into his world  That s how realistic the novel is  Great read  Definitely need a re read in the near future  Now I understand Holden Caulfield  I read this way back in high school and couldn t identify with Salinger s Holden centric world  What a difference a decade makes  Not only should this book be read  it should be re read every fifteen months or so Holden may be the most realistically rendered character in modern literature  In his story  we find a man who is personalbe yet frustrating  inconsistent yet uncompromising  We find a boy who can t stand other people  but repeatedly longs for personal connection  Holden is hypercritical and flawed  yet he is fiercely compassionate and good hearted I have never read a book so thoroughly about being human  This is quiet an interesting book  what with it s history  controversy and content  It is a medium sized book  but I found that it does not take that long to read  I think that I finished it in about 8 days  so just over a week  Bare in mind that not much happens in this book  Having said that  the development of the characters is quite in depth for such a short story  I would really recommend it  J  D  Salinger has done a magnificent job capturing an era and  moreover  human emotion  I cannot recommend this book enough  It is amazing and definitely a favourite  I could not put this book down  Every spare second I had  I was reading  I enjoyed it that much  I think everybody should read this book at least once in their life  Anyone looking for a good book  read this  It s quiet easy to read and it is very addictive   Readability  I find this book eminently readable   I ve read it a few times now and it s always been one of those books than can suck me in so I finish it in one sitting  or at least get very annoyed that I have to stop to eat or sleep or work or talk to people that aren t Holden Caulfield  He s an example of really unique first person narrative and a way of speaking that strikes me as incredibly realistic   probably even more so now than it was then  that way that a lot of teenagers and young people speak  repeating the same kind of words over and over  using favoured slang phrases  I still do it now  to be honest  and I m doing all those responsible things now that I avoided entirely at school and at university  The language might not be perfect  and it might be repetitive and littered with swearing  but it s real  no doubt about it  for better or worse  The kind of stream of consciousness that Salinger uses here  with all its tangents and diversions  is  in my opinion  endlessly entertaining and completely immersive  but I m sure that while it fascinates and exhilarates me personally  it can be grating and irritating for others  Impact  For me personally  the impact of this book was huge  I first read it when I was about fourteen and it was probably the first book that made me sit up and realise just how much someone else s writing could speak to you  I wasn t even going through a lot of existential angst  or anything  but there was something about the weird mix of antipathy and idealism that makes up Holden Caulfield s psyche that I loved  and have loved  ever since  I re read it every so often  not quite once a year but close  and if anything it becomes more relevant as I get older and see more things  and disappointment becomes that much sharper and delight becomes that much warmer  I don t know if my opinion will change in future years   I ve heard a few people say they like it less  or that it is a book best appreciated if you read it when you are young rather than looking back on that transitory period between no responsibility and responsibility   but I hope not  I hope it always reminds me of starting to love literature and identifying with an incredibly vivid character  I get that a lot of people don t like Holden  that his self obsessed  existential  frightened angst is dislikeable  even repulsive  but even then there s something there that s important  and it s a reaction to his desperate depression even if it s one of disgust and scorn  For me  I wouldn t want to be Holden Caulfield   who would    but that doesn t mean I love him any less  He s smart  he s scared  he s failing  and he s funny   he pretty much killed me   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though  This book has become my instant favorite  without any doubt Biggest book hangover ever  I feel like I ll be living in Holden s world forever The real power   beauty of this book is not particularly its story  but rather the way it s been written  Although it covers some quite depressing events  it was full of sarcasm and you could often relate to Holden s radical views on society I laughed so hard  Ahhhh it literally touched every inch of my heart I just couldn t seem to put this one down  Never read a more powerful written novel  The Catcher in the Rye is a classic  The main character  Holdyn  looks at life differently than the average teenage boy in that era  He realizes that everyone isn t who they say they are  including himself  Personally  my favorite part of the book is when he decides to stay in New York  I would recommend this book to people who enjoy a deep  thoughtful story with complex characters  The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move   Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   The Catcher In The Rye  is marked by a recognizable desire and pursuit to bring together the intellectual  the aesthetic  and the emotional aspects of growing up  It takes us through some of the most complex emotions a person will experience  and through the different situations  reactions and perspectives  it became therapeutic for the modern world  The main character  Holden Caulfield s mannerisms  compulsions and neurotic behavior depicted a young child generated in frantic fear of becoming an adult  his disgust with the vulgarity of the  real  world  and his dormant need to protect the innocence of those younger than him  Salinger wrote in a way that everything Holden did or avoided doing was in essence an effort to escape  to return to a long lost innocence  and to hold society accountable for an unnamed hurt that took that innocence away in the first place  The heart wrenching events are masked by humor  wit and irony  making it impossible to fit into a singular genre and more so in a constant hover between comedy and tragedy  Using these writing techniques Salinger created one of those most controversial yet timeless and beloved novels of all time when he wrote  The Catcher In The Rye   Holden is a troubled teenager whose worries are always sort of charming  hilarious and sad   Excuse me for the  sort of  stuff    or for the  stuff  stuff just now   I ve really picked these up from Holden himself   All through the book  however  I kept worrying something tragic was going to happen to him in the end  And I didn t know exactly why I had this presentiment until I reached the part where Holden speaks to his former English teacher  Mr  Antolini  The teacher is as worried as myself and quotes for Holden the following line from Wilhelm Stekel  The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one Clearly then  Holden belongs to the first category of the immature  Yet there is something so attractive  so romantic about his dream to become the Catcher  Nobody wise enough  however much they loved their children  would run after them  all day long   to keep protecting them from  going over the cliff   They simply can t  As Holden himself observes nobody can protect the children from the obscene carvings onto the school walls  Nobody can keep them safe from the world s ugly truths for too long  And perhaps nobody but Holden has ever volunteered to do so  Sadly  this cause is only the impossible dream of a passionate moralist  a tender romanticist  an unwitting young poet  Ma olen suur Salingeri austaja  aga ma utleksin  et  Kuristik rukkis  ei ole parim  mis ta kirjutanud on  Mulle meeldivad ta luhijutud ja  Franny ja Zooey  oluliselt rohkem  So I read this back when I was a junior in high school and really my only reaction was  BUT WHAT IS THE POINT   Now that I m a freshman in college  and apparently much more mature  who knew   I appreciate this book in an entirely new way  and I can now honestly say that I count it among my favorite classic works  Holden is a heartbreaking narrator who  while somewhat insane and infuriating  offers a legitimate look at the difficulties of growing up in a world that isn t nearly as pleasant as we would like it to be  The symbolism is extraordinary  but apparently deserving of a second read  because I would be lying if I said I connected with it the same way on my first read through  Indeed  my biggest complaint from my first reading was that there was no  point  to the novel  and yet on my second reading the  point  became apparent on the very first page  I have no idea how I missed the idea of where Holden is telling his story from  or rather who he is telling it to  on my initial reading  but suffice it to say I get it now  and it adds so much more to this novel than I originally took away from it  All in all  this is  quite completely  the quintessential coming of age novel  and I highly recommend that everyone read it at least once   but maybe twice Rating  5 stars I learned 3 things from this book 1   Innocence2   Phony3   AlienationI think reading  Catcher in the Rye  must have felt like visiting the office of a shrink   i have never visited a shrink  but it must have felt that way J   JD Salinger has made it so strikingly real that you feel like you are Holden  and you are going through what he is going through  For those who are smart  those who think before you leap kinda guys would see it like Holden sees it It s kinda scary for teens to go to the world of adulthood unarmed  Some people just take the plunge and flow with the strong current into that world where everything is phony  that s the impression   Some ppl are like Holden  who has gone through pain in his childhood through the lost of Ally  think deeply about that big leap  as if we can prevent it   It s like stripping off all the innocence of childhood only to find that the world of the adults is nothing but superficial  Then as individual who was experiencing transition he felt alienated and all alone Later  through Phoebe his little sister  Holden s crumbled world got saved  Because of Phoebe he wanted to start over  he would try again and he was willing to get help  He wouldn t want phoebe to experience what he went through   when the time of the feeling of alienation comes  he would be there for Phoebe  It is the world of the innocence childhood that helped Holden to want to embrace life again  a life that he found to be phony and wanting  Holden must live in order to save Phoebe  Holden would be the catcher of the children that coming out of the rye At the first glance people might get the impression that the book is depressing  However when i look deeper  JD Salinger has helped me described myself somewhat into the line   the line that says  i have contributed to this phoniness somewhat   So  I think it was Phoebe who was the Catcher in the Rye  by giving Holden the will to start over thinking that he would be the catcher for Phoebe when in fact it is the other way around I believe even in the choosing of the words or the way he expressed the plot  he has tried to be honest  as in opposite of  phony   Either  JD Salinger was a genius or The Catcher In The Rye was exactly about his life  This has become one of my favorite classic novels  I love the pure intents of a seemingly corrupted boy  I have to keep this review short though to prevent myself from going into a analytical rant about everything that I picked up in this story  although many might disagree and state that this book is  boring    not interesting   and  makes no sense   they could not be more wrong  The subplots within this book are well developed  the protagonist is so faulty that he is perfect  and the overall novel is fantastic  It is impossible not to be drawn to the difficult pasts and hope for the best towards the characters  I love this novel and applaud the author for his genius  Ever since Salinger s death  I ve wanted to comment on my feelings about his writing  When I was 16  The Catcher in the Rye knocked me out  I also wanted to escape from the phonies in my prep school  and the thought of just going AWOL in the city for a few days seemed very exciting  Plus  like Holden  I had rather high standards for authentic behavior   and was also baffled and hurt by adults  shortcomings  Over the next few years  I repeatedly devoured everything Salinger published  My friends and I speculated about whether more masterpieces would be revealed after his death  But since college  I never re read any of it  How would I perceive these books today   25 years later a second reading still captivated me  As a teen  young adult I was surprised by the strength of the voice and strong identification with the character and now as a middle aged mother I m equally amazed  It s still strong  original and personal  but this time I couldn t stop marveling at how well the character is constructed  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye is one of these books that are timeless and will stay timeless as long as there are teenagers around  When I was reading through the book I would often think about how it might as well have been set in today s timeline  save for obvious references to the late 40s  of course   But the emotions and thoughts of Holden Caulfield are very much real and young  and old  people today can relate to him just as much as 60 years ago  That s why I like his character so much  I have seen many reviews that state that Holden is very unlikeable and that made the book unenjoyable for them  To me it s quite the opposite  I enjoyed reading Holden s narration and could more often than not relate to him  and if not today  then I remember what my thoughts were when I was 16 and I realize that I was pretty similar  Maybe not to the extent that Holden resents society and adult life  but in every teenager there s a moody and whiny side which hates everything and everyone  I wasn t quite as cynical as he is  but the sentiment is the same  I don t want to grow up and become a part of this world full of phony  hypocritical adults  And yes it s an immature thought  And yes  it s sad and unrealistic and stupid because try as you might you can t stop time  But it s clear that we are supposed to see Holden as very immature and still growing and learning  He s not a role model  or someone you d like as a friend  or someone you d even want to hang out with  Rather he s a part in many of us which never wants and wanted to lose the innocence and simplicity of childhood  which fears the loss of integrity that comes with adapting to society norms  and chooses to ignore the process of growing up  And Holden does realize  at the very end  that this is not possible  He accepts that we must let children live their lives and not inhibit them in their actions  even if it might mean that they fall and fail  We can t be catchers in the rye  Some time after this realization past 16 year old Holden presumably checks himself into the mental hospital present 17 year old Holden finds himself in  which shows how he matured at least enough to get help and find someone who will listen to him  He can t fight time or adulthood but he can start to take responsibility and make life easier for himself  In any case I loved the book and the plot  It s not action filled  it doesn t have explosions or chases or even a love story  it barely even has a climax  It s just a telling of a teenager wandering around New York City for two days  drinking and smoking and trying to talk to people  I realize it s not something for everyone  that some might get bored with this rather simple storyline  but in the end it reflects life the way it is  That s why  to me  it feels so authentic  Who did never wander around a city alone  or stay in a hotel room alone  and feel alienated and lost and sorry for themselves  We all at some point have moments of complete loneliness that  if bad enough  can make us feel dead inside  I know what it s like to do nothing for hours but sit somewhere on my own and reflect on my life and experiences and what might still come  This book is not something that can make me feel detached from my life like so many other books do  It feels too real and personal for that  And maybe that is the reason why I loved it so much   In a world that doesn t make sense  Holden Caulfield is an American hero  He s tired of a school system that doesn t make sense  and tries to explore life liberally through the dark side of NYC  while being and meeting interesting characters along the way  In the beginning pages  you can tell his talent  discussing how the book isn t supposed to be like David Copperfield  The book s style is a beginner s guide to finding a voice in American novels I don t want to spoil things for you  but the structure of the novel is interesting  Literary themes such as repetition  and subtly  such as having the second and second to last chapters play out the way they did make one ponder the intelligence of J D  Salinger and his wonderful work  A book everyone should reread at various points in their life  As a teenager you feel a bond  the older you are the more the whining annoying you till later  you understand and have compassion on a whole new level  People love or hate this book it seems  I ve read it at least three times that I can remember  Why do I like it so much  Holden Caulfield is a very bright young man  He s jaded  worldly  smart  and he has a bad attitude  He sees adults as phonies and children as the innocents    they haven t had time to grow up and develop their facade or veneer  Holden is a relatable character  especially for those of us who maybe didn t fit in during high school  I felt I could relate to him  not being a big fan of the whole teenage experience and having trouble with authority figures myself Catcher is full of symbolism  like the ducks  or absence of ducks  on the lake in Central Park  and Holden s hat with earmuffs    his security blanket or touchstone  It s an interesting book  Holden is caught in the middle of becoming an adult  yet he really seems to want to be a kid  Salinger portrays the conflicting emotions that seem to be such an integral part of growing up  Ultimately  Holden Caulfield is a tragic figure Growing up is tough and sad  Bittersweet leaving childhood behind and having to face the cruel  boring world of adulthood  I don t want to overanalyze Catcher in the Rye  though  I just want to enjoy it   So  its basically a journal like book What really annoyed me is that its very repetitive  It has neither a start nor an end  not even a decent plot I liked Holden though  he understands people  I go like  THANK YOU   When he talks about phonies we meet on a daily basis What I liked the most is when I finally understood the title  Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean  except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know its crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know its crazy   editwhen the hell did i write this  the book is absolutely brilliant never mind the above i d reread it hundreds of times  I re read this book with trepidation  because so many people nowadays seem to hate it  But I loved it  It s such a small  poignant gem  an American existential novel about a snotty 16 year old who can t express his dissatisfaction with the world  a world that couldn t save his idolised little brother  a world that lets kids suffer and die  a world of adult  phoneys  who can t protect you  who don t have the answers but make you do what they say  a world that he s on the brink of having to become part of but whose ranks he can t face joining It s Jean Paul Sartre s  Nausea  crossed with Rebel Without a Cause crossed with Beverley Hills 90210 I loved it  but then I ve always been a fan of Salinger s style  which I appreciate isn t everyone s cup of tea    I love re reading this story  It seems I find something new each time to enjoy about his book each time I read it  A classic  must read for everyone  Un libro molto intenso per la bravura con cui l autore e riuscito a descrivere quello che passa per la testa di un adolescente  un ragazzo di buona famiglia che si trova alle prese con le prime difficolta della vita  a cavallo tra il senso di liberta  l indolenza  gli affetti e i veri valori della vita  Un romanzo definito giustamente  di formazione  e che mi sarebbe piaciuto leggere all eta del giovane  simpatico e sconclusionato Holden   I just loved it       I don t know why  exactly  but the moment I started to read it in the bookstore I COULD NOT put it down  By the end of it I felt emotionally attached to Holden  the narrator  Trust me when I say that that kind of thing does not happen to me often enough  The only regret I have related to this novel is lending it to a friend who never gave it back  I read this while out of town for my wife s grandmother s funeral It was a sad trip  She was a beautiful person I was in the proper mood for this book At first I thought it was going to be a comedy  everyone has told me how funny it is and it started off that way Then  a short way in and after having to laugh out loud several times  I learned something about the main character  Holden Caulfield  that made me pity him and made me try to understand him The book is written as though he  a foul mouthed  jaded and insightful teenager  is telling you a story Holden is a damaged kid What he s wrong about tells half the story and when he s right  it s funny  heartbreaking and poignant You shouldn t diminish someone s abilities by saying they have  the right build  for what they re good at  you shouldn t drink Tom Collinses in December and you should cry for those who want to be the catcher in the rye  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  SalingerReview updated 30 05 2015 It s sort of like The Catcher in the Rye is always a hit or miss  Either people hate it or they love it  But considering that I rated it five stars  you would assume that I was the latter  And I am  this is definitely one of my favorites The biggest complaints that you hear about this are that 1  it has no plot  or it has a lame plot  etc   and 2  the MC  Holden Caulfield  was annoying or just an asshole  Part of why this is a hit or miss is that either you identify with the character  I m not calling myself an asshole  okay   or you don t  It s not really a plot based story  instead just covering the couple days he spends in New York City  It s almost entirely based off of the character  Well  it has a plot  but it s just more of Holden wandering around after he was expelled  But I like that shit  So  if you hate the character  you re going to hate this too But this is the thing  if you relate to the character  and his cynicism  and his worldview  then it s going to be very different  It honestly helps if you can understand  empathize  or whatever  with Caulfield  But I do  and when a book seems to be written in such a timeless and relatable fashion  it s quite difficult to not enjoy it Another interesting point  this is written in the first person  in a conversational manner  too  which makes it seem more   personal  excuse the redundancy   But either way  one of my all time favorites  Would definitely re read  While Holden is a whiny  unambitious teenager  his observations on life and the world around him suggest a sadly wasted intellect  As a teacher  this is the aspect of the novel that draws me to it In the beginning  Holden is telling his story from an unnamed place  where he claims he  came out here to take it easy   He confesses that he doesn t want to share his life story  but rather a few interesting days in which he was expelled from a prep school and made the concious decision not to return home  to roam the streets instead  He cleverly describes that day as  that kind of crazy afternoon  terrifically cold  and no sun out or anything  and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road  5   And so Holden s misadventure begins  One of the most common complaints involving this novel is its negative language  This is simply a reflection of Holden s pessimistic and negative outlook  Regardless  he is surprisingly insightful Perhaps the most outstanding scene of the book is when Holden has discovered graffiti at his sister s school  the  f word  in fact  He is angry  thinking of his sister discovering it  Holden rambles in his own way about how nothing is sacred   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  F    you  right under your nose  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born  and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  F    you  204  In spite of Holden s whiny  negative personality  it is the spark of hope and wasted intelligence in him that gives this novel its life  Brilliant and impressive  I love it  I hadn t read it since I was a teenager and I appreciate it more now than then  I d forgotten how funny it is  or maybe I didn t even know it was funny the first time  The first time I read this book was in the mid 80 s  in high school  I went to a French speaking high school about a hundred kilometers west of Montreal  At the time  everyone was listening to U2 and Tears for Fears and The Cure and only the anglophone minority of which I was a part actually understood the words to those songs  That used to kill me  You d have a high school dance and everyone would be kind of surf dancing to  Boys don t cry  and most of them had no idea what the song was about  but it didn t keep them from adopting that pouting stance with their front hair hanging over the left side of their downcast faces Claudia had that look too  She had this shock of really blond hair that hung down about to her cheek  She didn t pout  though  She ruined the goddamn look by smiling all the time  God  she had a beautiful smile  She was part of the anglophone minority too on account of her parents being German  so we d trade cassettes and joke about song lyrics and that tv show Moonlighting  I d seek her out in the recreation hall at lunchtime  I could recognize her from way back at the end of the hall just from the set of her shoulders  even though in the mid 80 s in private schools everyone wore these jackets with huge shoulder pads  boys included  and some even went as far as to roll up the sleeves of their jackets even when they were wearing a shirt and tie  like they were in Miami Vice or something  That fad died pretty quick  but you can be sure that the French speakers were among the last ones to maintain it  So I d seek out Claudia  she had a really straight back and she always stood with one leg straight and the other kind of bent at the knee and slightly in front of her  and this being a private school she d be in a skirt  which was just torture  and I d sidle up and act real cool and bored with both hands in my pockets wrinkling my blazer at the hips like I hardly cared about anything and was just passing by to talk to her because why not At the time I was a huge cynic  the way teenagers can be when they want to appear older  and all my jokes were cynical  and Claudia would laugh at them anyway and she d add  oh  Renaaaay  Renaaay  Renaaaay  like that  pronouncing it like  heyyyy  and I d drop the cynical act for a moment before returning to it later Anyways  my English teacher recommended we read the Catcher in the Rye and told us we d find it very funny  I don t think anyone else in my class read it  just me  and I didn t find it funny much  but I really identified to Holden Caulfield  I think you have to be an adult to find it funny  I mostly read it and pictured myself as Holden getting kicked out of school and wandering around New York and being simultaneously charmed and repulsed by humanity  Just the opening page was enough to grasp my attention  and though the school I went to didn t advertise with horse riding ads  the following paragraph about Holden s school Pencey spoke to me directly   They advertise in about a thousand magazines  always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence  Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time  I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place  And underneath the guy on the horse s picture  it always says   Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid  clear thinking young men   Strictly for the birds  They don t do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school  And I didn t know anybody there that was splendid and clear thinking and all  Maybe two guys  If that many  And they probably came to Pencey that way    And  of course  I pictured my best friend Claudia as the character of Jane  Only it didn t really fit  because Jane had a lousy childhood and Claudia was a happy girl who ruined her goddamn pouty look by smiling all the time  Anyways  there is this scene in the book where Holden describes how he came close to necking with Jane  and Jane s stepfather comes around and asks her where his cigarettes are  and Jane doesn t answer him   Finally the guy went inside the house  When he did  I asked Jane what the hell was going on  She wouldn t even answer me  then  She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all  Then all of a sudden  this tear plopped down on the checkerboard  On one of the red squares  boy  I can still see it  She just rubbed it into the board with her finger  I don t know why  but it bothered hell out of me  So what I did was  I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to her  I practically sat down in her lap  as a matter of fact  Then she really started to cry  and the next thing I knew  I was kissing her all over  anywhere  her eyes  her nose  her forehead  her eyebrows and all  her ears  her whole face except her mouth and all  She sort of wouldn t let me get to her mouth  Anyway  it was the closest we ever got to necking  After a while  she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had  that knocked me out  and we went to a goddam movie   You can bet your boots I read that and pictured myself kissing Claudia  I must have read that single paragraph a dozen times over until it was etched in my mind  There was no way I was going to be around if and when Claudia cried  she was a happy girl  but I goddamn well read it over and over and pictured Claudia putting on that red and white sweater and us going to a movie anyway Claudia actually made an atheist out of me  She sat at a desk just behind me and in religious studies  she d lean forward and whisper in my ear  just to goad me  asking me if I believed in what it was we were being taught  and of course I defended the existence of God as well I could by using Voltaire s argument about there being no clock without a clock maker  and we d have a whispered argument right there in class  Teenagers in religious schools entertain a kind of familiarity toward faith  As in the following passage that describes the guy after whom was named a wing of the school Holden attends    It was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey  He made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey  What he did  he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece  You should see old Ossenburger  He probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river  Anyway  he gave Pencey a pile of dough  and they named our wing alter him      He told us we should always pray to God  talk to Him and all wherever we were  He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all  He said he talked to Jesus all the time  Even when he was driving his car  That killed me  I just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs  The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it  He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was  what a hot shot and all  then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me  Edgar Marsalla  laid this terrific fart   Claudia worked at me for two weeks  we d have these whispered arguments in class  and she actually convinced me that I was mostly praying for no good reason  and I was really impressed by the way she did it and I got even more infatuated with her than I already was Good ol  Claudia  She didn t play checkers that I knew of  She liked ping pong  and she could laugh at losing a game  At the age of 39  I read this for the first time  The story follows Holden Caulfield as we learn he has been expelled from school  This is basically  his narrative as he goes from one interaction to the next with various characters  most of which he doesn t like and considers  phony   It s odd  how familiar this character was to me  His jadedness  negativity and even his sarcastic sense of humor merged into a voice that was as familiar as my own  Reading this book was like reaquainting myself with a long lost friend I ve never known  The ache of his lonliness was tangible and just liquified each page  Even though I was weary of his behavior by the end of the book  I realize that was probably the point  Probably all of the other characters in the book were just as weary and frustrated as I was  He reached out to everyone he could  even people he didn t like  just begging for moments of thier time to help ease his own suffering and lonliness  This kid was in so much pain and no one was reaching out to him except his sister who probably  ultimately saved him  I ve read a lot of negative reviews  a lot of people found Holden to be annoying but people in pain usually are  I thought this short glimpse into a difficult time during this boy s life was expertly portrayed  It was a sad portrayal  but rich and honest and deeply moving  In the 1950s America had just won The War and our economy was set to take off like a rocket  A tall  white  wealthy male would be the apex of power and prestige in that world  And yet we have a teenage Holden Caulfield who is depressed and disappointed by the phoniness and ugliness of his surroundings  If nothing else this novel reminds us that even those at the pinnacle of privilege have death and loss to deal with  Being sensitive and alienated can happen to anyone But it seems Holden takes things too far by flunking out of every school he is sent to and by failing to actually connect with anyone  Only his ten year old sister is able to charm him out of his self destructive moods  Holden is a teen who sees grace and nobility in his younger sister  and in the memory of a younger brother who has recently died  At the previous boarding schools  a tormented student fell to his death  while wearing Holden s borrowed sweater  It s a graphic depiction of the thing Holden seems to want to do  catch children who are falling over the precipice from childhood to adulthood and save them  and therefore himself  before it is too late  Holden can t seem to find a worthwhile adult to emulate anywhere The language and the storytelling in this novel are brilliant  Old Caulfield is not really a phony  He smoked and drank  stayed up all night and traveled alone in ways contemporary teens raised by helicopter parents could never imagine  It was fun to hang out with him and try to understand  J D  Salinger s book  The Catcher in the Rye has been controversial in terms of reader s opinions for many years  There are many readers who find themselves connecting with this book on a spiritual and emotional level  and others who find it tedious drivel The story starts out slow  but there are themes in this story that many can relate to  The wish to save the youth  the desire to understand the world outside the bubble that is school  and the confusion of growing up that stays with you even until you re old and gray Holden presents a blend of philosophical understanding that many may not understand until after High School  well into their College years  Many may finally find themselves wondering why a prostitute becomes a prostitute  or even finding themselves just unhappy with everything around them to the point that they understand the depressive daze that Holden stays in throughout the entirety of the book  In the end Mr  Salinger has produced a book that has two phases to its nature  Reading it in High School where you think everything is perfect  life is swell  and reading this book in College when suddenly you re not sure how taxes work and saving the next generation from living an unfulfilled life of pointless days seems worth so much more than a million dollars   What would celebrating Banned Books Week 2012 be without recognizing one of America s greatest controversial pieces of literature  No matter your age or disposition  The Catcher in the Rye has proved itself to be a great piece of literature that stands the test of time and censorship  Holden Caulfield s lonely voyage from his  phony  prep school in Pennsylvania to the harsh streets of New York chronicles a deep sense of longing that heralds the oncoming disillusionment of the 1950s and the 1960s  Caulfield s paradoxical hero and anti hero narration presents a classic case of teenage rebellion that hides deeper feelings of resentment  loss  alienation  and identity  With a liberal dosage of drug usage  profanity  sexuality  and cynicism  it is little wonder that the book is frequently challenged  Despite the charges brought against it  Salinger brings identity and justification to those looking to be heroes of their own adolescence and presents hope for those going through the teenage phase of estrangement  Whether you read it for comfort and solidarity or a good laugh at misdirected rage  Salinger does not disappoint   To be honest  I almost didn t write a review for this  The book ought to speak for itself  and everyone really ought to read it  It is a book that intrigues and utterly understands its readers I ll forego the usual character review I do  though for all purposes they get 5 AMAZING STARS  since Holden is not just a literary figure  He is so much more than that  a friend who you never have to explain your feelings to    Because he knows  Holden knows what it feels like  no matter what  it  is  That s what is so appealing about him  Well    One of the many things Holden Caulfield is on a constant quest to escape the  phoniness  of the world and to preserve innocence in the midst of it  The corrupted society he grows up in is what really leads to his downfall   view spoiler  The death of his brother Allie really catalyzes this  depicted when Holden punches through the windows in his garage   hide spoiler   However  no matter how hard he tries to find genuineness  Holden instead finds himself stuck in a world full of facade There are quite a few things that make me love Holden so much  For one  it s his undying love for his siblings  The way he brags about them shamelessly is something we don t see often in our world  and it s something I wish we could preserve  There s also the fact that he will never hesitate to put himself at risk in order to defend someone else s dignity  as he does in the case of Jane Gallagher  The scene that touched me the most was when Holden dropped Phoebe s record  breaking it into a million pieces in the envelope that should have kept it safe  Apart from the gorgeous symbolism there  that scene made me cry  I can t exactly say why  though I presume it s because of the message about society that is hidden there   but I have hardly ever cried that much while reading a passage in a book J D  Salinger has written a book that has truly changed lives  and given people at least one  if fictional  person to actually relate to  If there s one thing I could wish for right now  it would be to tell Holden that everything is going to be alright 5 stars My wife calls this  the book with that foul mouth kid   HA  This book puts me in mind of what it was like to be a kid trying to act older and use larger terms and curse words  This is a work of nostalgia  More than that however this is a work that touches the reader on a whole other level  This work takes the reader into the mind of a teenaged kid going through those emotions and scenarios that we can so vividly recall  The truths coming so innocently off the tongue of youth can be very convincing  As is this work Thank you Salinger  Not only have I worn this book out reading it more times than I can remember  but I also named my cat after you  I wish I d have kept track of the number of times I have read this book  Time and time again I have drawn insight into many things relevant to my current circumstances  Everytime I read this book I am going through a different stage in my life and the book draws new meanings for me every time  This book is my all time favorite   Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential American novel for disaffected youth  At first glance  the writing might seem choppy and juvenile  but if you let go of your inner critic a little  it is emotionally spot on  I read this book when I was fifteen or sixteen  and at the time I found the protagonist to be very relatable  which goes to show that it is still very much a text meant to connect with the phenomenon of teenage angst  At the time  I felt a very strong connection with Holden  This book takes you directly into the mind of an incredibly insightful and lost teenager  You struggle right along with him as you follow him through a few nights of being homeless after leaving a school that he flunked out of  Holden did not fail out of this school because he is stupid  It was almost a personal decision not to try  as I type that I can almost hear the voices of angry adults reading it to me  because he saw through the  phoniness  of the school and nearly every adult around him and didn t want to be a part of it   Fully reviewing the book would be redundant with the amount of text already written on it  which still retains it s relevance despite being published in the 1940 s  although some of the slang is outdated  This book is one that requires multiple reads to really appreciate  and since it s so short  I think it was meant to be read that way  Al inicio solo seguia la historia y despues empezo a costarme trabajo entender a Holden  se me hizo muy negativo     pero al final  me senti tan identificada con el y entendi todo lo que queria decir  Esperaba mas al terminar el libro  porque creo que ese sentimiento no se desvanece nunca y tienes que aprender a vivir con el Me parece que es una perspectiva  muy joven  de ver la vida   I loved this book so much  I think I can read it over and over again and not get tired  I love Holden s voice and the way he tells his story  A superb  classic book  It s been more than 20 years since I read this book  It sits with a tattered cover  pages falling from the spine  on the bookshelf with other beloved books  I recall that when I read it all those years ago I knew that one day I would go back to this book and visit it again  I think it s time   Now  if you want to know what a teenager is like  go and read The Catcher in the Rye Cynical  sarcastic Holden Caulfield is clearly the best male character I ve seen so far  He is so honest and real and his opinions are absolutely interesting An unforgettable novel of which I can t say much because all is said  I thought this book was one of the best books I ever have read  I thought this book was really good because I liked the main character s personality and the way he looked at things  The main character s name is Holden Caulfield  Holden is very intelligent and observant  I also think this book says that you can very smart and intelligent but you have to choose the right path in life to be successful  This book also made you realize that you could be smart and not show your intelligence in your work   I absolutely love this book  love it love it love it  Definitely in my top 5 of all time favourites  I read it about 15 years ago and will not leave it that long again    The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move  You could go there a hundred thousand times  and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish  the birds would still be on their way south  the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole  with their pretty antlers and they re pretty  skinny legs  and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket  Nobody s be different  The only thing that would be different would be you  Not that you d be so much older or anything  It wouldn t be that  exactly  You d just be different  that s all   Not a single dull moment   I love this book so much  I read it in high school  re read it later  and this year learned my husband had never read it  I wanted him to read it  but then I was jealous of his reading it  and he loves audiobooks  so I have read it aloud to him in several stints over the last six months  took us forever   We finished it this morning  Parts of it are dated  but I love to imagine how it must have floored readers in 1945 1951 when parts  then the whole  were published  Salinger achieves such an excellent melding of the universal teenager with the specific teenager  of the picaresque with the upper class  of postwar ennui and tradition and the coming of the 1950s and 1960s rebellions  of internal and external conflict  all while seeming to be a story that s just about a cranky kid  Perfect timing  as he gave me the new Salinger bio for Christmas  and very interesting as we ve just re watched all of  Freaks and Geeks  and are in the midst of  My So Called Life     pale impressions of the original master   I finished my reread of Salinger s Catcher in the Rye quite awhile ago  but waited until I d gotten through it with my American Lit classes before posting on it  Part of the discussion they engage in seems to help me take the books I read a little further that just my own reading of them  If that makes any sense I first read the book in college  on my own  when I was about twenty or twenty one years old  A bit older than the protagonist  Holden  but I remember really relating to the story and the character even though I recognized how very non Holden like I was then and as a teenager  Something about his experiences and point of view resonated even with me  the good girl  That and with how the book has influenced pop culture  I was very excited about teaching it this year It didn t resonate  On the whole  with my students  Which bewildered me and also taught me that I should probably not get so excited about a book via teaching again  Some found Holden to be a jerk  which I agree with  and some couldn t empathize or sympathize with him  which I didn t understand   Maybe it s all personality  but I want to hug Holden by the end  I m not so romantic as a reader that I think I would actually be friends with Holden  I think he  with his cynicism and hypocrisy  would probably frustrate me as much as he frustrated those in the book  I don t idealize him  He is was a jerk and pushed people away  but I feel for him and his loss and confusion  It doesn t matter that I never experienced the things he did  prep school  loss of a sibling  absent parents  possible sexual abuse  New York City   At the core of Holden is the viewpoint that adulthood is scary and that phoniness is real  And all that is true  Being a teen is hard  even if it s a privileged life or not  The learning  both in and out of the classroom  at that age is confusing and affecting  There is so much you figure out and so much that you still have to learn  You re treated as both an adult and a child at the same time and are supposed to know when to act like which  That is what Holden s story says to me He breaks my heart  It s probably my maternal instincts  but I think he could use a hug and someone to just listen  He so desperately needed to feel that he d been heard even though he couldn t actually say what he wanted to for the course of the story  I enjoy the voice and how authentic it is  even sixty years later  The symbolism of the carrousel  the hunting cap  the ducks in the pond and Allie s baseball mitt  I like that even with a jerk of a character  Salinger causes me to care for a boy who I don t have a thing in common with except simply  the human condition  One thing I like about the novel is that it doesn t meant to be likable just like the protagonist  At first  I find Holden as a  little whining bummer  but inside that annoying attitude  he is really a lonely teenager searching for something that he likes and makes him happy  I empathized him for that  There are tons of things that he didn t like but suddenly he ended up being generous helping and feeling sad about them  He was not ready to move on with his childhood but he was suddenly exposed to adulthood and that what made him confused  He can t but want to get out of childhood but at the same time afraid of growing up  He is very intelligent  he interpret things in a way different from others at that time and that s why he s always whining because he doesn t understand why they are such things which are senseless because he already loss his innocence ahead from the others  It s hard though  because there s no one who can be with and help in understanding these things  Those are why Holden wants to be the catcher in the rye   defends others from losing their childhood innocence   because he s 16 and based on his experiences  innocence prevents someone from seeing the real world full of flaws and awful things  I wish I had read this 2 3 years ago when I can still relate to the main character  But the pro of reading this now is that I have the answers  The loss of innocence is a natural process but requires right timing to work  Knowing is better when understood  nTwr dsht z

Salinger has captured the essence of the pain of depression caused by loss in this book  The progression of Holdens  fall  is captured in his attitude  language and actions  Initially  he tells his story as if he is a well adjusted kid who has a definite elitist view point  he is critical of the people around him and can see their faults quite clearly  His use of language is initially filled with blasphemy and he swears terribly  these words are a form of bravado  a face he shows to the world  as the story progresses  he begins to take the provebial log out of his eye and truelly begins to face his feelings  his language also improves  its as if facing his pain peels the words off his wound and opens him up to the world he has abandoned  his brother died of leukemia a while before and he is struggling to deal with the pain and loss  He has hidden his feelings behind his words and thoughts  he often comments on his dead brother  db his writer brother and his sister phobe  the love he feels for them is evident in the stories he tells  his sister asks him to tell her one thing that he is interested in  he cannot think of anything for a while  then he says he wants to be the catcher in the rye  although he wants to be the catcher in the rye  it is his young sister that catches him before he falls off the cliff  This book means everything to me  I can t explain exactly how  but it has  I first read  part of  it when I was in 10th grade  I rejected it because I was thrown off by it s lack of traditional story line  When I was in my senior year of high school I finally read it in its entirety  To begin with  this book is ridiculous and hilarious  The humor is so dry and for the most part  in between the lines  However  I re read it over and over again to find the  true  meaning  the one spark notes suggests you find  I ve read this book about 8 times and i ve yet to find the exact meaning  BUT I believe that s what Salinger wanted  He is as absurd as his book and I doubt this man sat down and said  these readers are going to get this from my book   He most likely sat down  mischievously laughing  writing his novels with overlapping themes and confusing motifs  I recommend this book to anyone ever  I especially recommend it to anyone searching for purpose or just bored  Holden will make you feel better about yourself  I promise The last time I read this book  I hated it  I thought it was crass and pointless  I don t believe I made it more than 2 3 of the way through This time  though  Holden s description of the only thing he really feels like doing with his life spoke to me and I accidentally fell in love with this book   What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   Prachtig  Wat een onrust en frustratie en dat zo gedetailleerd en met veel vaart opgeschreven  Mooi ook al die stopwoordjes zoals  and all   en  dough  als het over geld gaat   phonies  voor malloten        You learn so much from reading books  Banning books is wrong because it limits the information people can gain from reading  For example  many books deal with gritty topics  but these issues are relevant in today s world  For example   The Drowning of Stephan Jones  deals with homosexuality  Additionally  Are You There God  It s Me Margret  discusses religion  Lastly   Huckleberry Finn  contains offensive language  One major reason books are banned is because they contain homosexuality  such as  The Drowning Of Stephan Jones   In our day and age  a book shouldn t be banned because it contains homosexuality  This topic has been in the press recently when Miss California was asked about her beliefs on gay marriage  She responded by saying marriage should be between a man and a woman  A media frenzy followed  Also  several states such as Iowa have allowed same sex marriage This proves that many Americans are becoming more tolerant towards homosexuality   Are You There God  It s Me Margret  was banned because the main character was questioning religion and didn t practice any faith  However  that does not justify the book being banned  This is because many Americans are expressing the same sentiments  According to an article in Newsweek titled  The End Of Christian America  The number of people willing to describe themselves as atheist or agnostic has increased from 1 million in 1990 to 3 6 million in 2009  In real life  you re bound to hear at least a few curses a day  Shouldn t books portray real life  Many school districts and cities decided to ban  Huckleberry Finn  because of its use of foul language  One word in particular  was the n word  Huck Finn would definitely loose some historical context if this word wasn t included  During the 1800 s  African Americans were referred to by that term  We cant change the future if we don t know our past  and learning about that time period can play a huge part in preventing it from ever happening again  In conclusion  books should not be banned  Books are there for people to help readers learn and grow  One cant do this if they don t have access to these books  Many books banned deal with today s controversial topics  First   The Drowning of Stephan Jones  was about a gay man s murder  Next  questioning God is discussed  Are You There God  It s Me Margret  discusses religion  Finally   Huckleberry Finn  contains offensive language  At first I was skeptical but then when you really hear what is inside of Holden mind you can t but feel complete empathy for him I really loved Holden and his perspective on life and the people around him It was interesting seeing the two sides of Holden The one presented to that world and the one we know as himself writing  5 5 I loved this book so much  It s definitely a good one to pick up if your just getting into classics or like coming of age stories The main character Holden Caulfield is one that I think everyone can relate to in some way  especially people his age  His struggle through the novel is about him being afraid of facing his future because he doesn t want to become just another phoney adult  I think this is something that all people his age can relate to as society expects young people to figure out  the right way  to live their lives at such a young age  Holden suffers so much during the three days we hear of his life from being abused both mentally and physically and being ignored and degraded by people he meets  His suffering is what ultimately leads to the state from which he is writing the story as a patient in a mental hospital This book has so much symbolism it is insane  The red hunting cap is significant because it s the same colour as his brother s hair which shows Holden hasn t mourned and grieved properly  His curiosity about the ducks in Central Park represents his anxiety to become an adult  The quote about wanting to be a catcher in the rye makes Holden comparable to Peter Pan  He is protecting the children in the field of rye by stopping them from falling of the cliff  the field of rye being childhood and the cliff being adulthood  This particular scene makes the reader see Holden in a completely different light  He is no longer just a whiny phoney who can t see his own faults  but he is instead a caring and protective character who longs to hold on to innocence for as long as possible  To sum it up  Holden just wants to be caught  hmh sh mjsm mykhnm chan t bchh y khwchykh drn tw yh dshti bzrg bzy mykhnn  hzrhzr bchh y khwchykh

w mygyrmsh  tmmi rwz khrm hmynh  ntwri dshtm Don t remember reading it the first time  Love the way Salinger writes  I m glad I reread it  He lost his brother  Don t knock this kid  He went thru a trauma  Unless this happened to you  You will never now how F up u can get   I just finished re reading this book  I had read it back in high school  and it was eye opening and awesome   one of my fav books  I remember telling the teacher that if Holden was crazy  I was crazy Re reading it  I feel soo very sorry for the kid  I do not believe he was a total snot like some people have written   he actually was quite nice  very polite  loved his siblings  etc    His high sensitivity was his curse  along w typical adolescent angst  He talked trash  but seemed to me much like an abandoned dog who would bark viciously but really just wanted a warm bed  Poor Holden brought out such maternal feelings in me this time around  I love this book  I really do  You know  its surprising seeming the summary of this book is simply  a depressed teen wanders aimlessly around New York City   that its so interesting  I love Holden too  He needs a hug  Although he s not right about everything  he does strike a cord with me as a teenager  Its surprising seeming as how this book is over 60 years old  My favorite line of the book   All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring  and so was old Phoebe  and I was sort of afraid she d fall off the goddam horse  but I didn t say anything or do anything  The things with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   This is my favorite book ever  It s main character is raw and real and J D  Salinger isn t afraid to show the reader the dark side of a story  I read this book years ago and even when I was a teenager I understood why it was banned from many schools  But great writing shouldn t be censored  If you ve never read this book take the time to read it  As a teen  ish   maybe i was 12  so a tween  when i first picked up Catcher in the Rye and met Holden Caulfield  i fell in love with him and my love for him  and my attraction to this type of guy  broody  moody  smart   sensitive  lasted for many years  And then  somewhere after college  I totally forgot about the Holdens of the world  My taste in guys changed  Thank God   So I wanted to read this book as an adult  as I mostly try to be these days  and see what I thought of  old  Holden  well  he s kind of what my granny might call   all messed up   Poor  slob   but it s a great story for its intimacy and what i think is a deep feeling for what it s like being young  broody  moody and smart and sensitive  no matter the era  this time around  i noticed Holden contradicted himself a lot  But geez  i just couldn t live with myself if I gave this book anything less than 5 stars  It was such a huge and somehow life saving part of my adolescence    This book is either a love it or hate it  I for one love it  The way J D  Salinger can tell a story through first person with a character like Holden Caulfield is amazing  some people find this book to be a boring story of a whiny rich kid who is pessimistic about everything which is somewhat true but its more important to understand his character development and how beautifully written this story is  Hats off to the author  Teenage writing is an art that isn t gifted to many men  especially when the author himself wasn t a teenager  A must read for people who are still in their teens or who can relate to their own crazy teenage experiences  i am not a hot shot reviewer or anything at all  but the sheer love for Holden makes me type in a few  that guy is so feeble and a heart shaker  and do not tell me he did not remind you at all of anything that ever happened in this stupid lifetime of yours  all the great confusion  the hatred  the stream of thoughts  the tenderness  the childish approaches  the angst of a teenager   all of it laid out so balanced and a slap in the face ly manner  its all eccentric and mind blowing    that guy  holden  you need to feel his pulse to enjoy the reading ride    i got touchy as hell  one certain issue which moved me and beseeched me to pipe out are all those parts in the book related to phonies and the mask which everyone wears to masquerade in front of the other co phonies  how aptly brought out  that too from the point of view of a vulnerable  16 year old teenager  you either get the point  or you dont  there is nothing like i will try to think of the issue  and as far as i see it  it for real IS an issue  a major one for that  and all the theories of friendship  love  cooperation  comradery  patriotism and loyalty boil down to the core of the issue  being true to yourself  and for all those who have read this book  i am sure there are only two types of folks now  ones who hate the book and found it depressing AND the ones who are just crazy to love Holden forever mskyn mn hm  akhryn  wsT m Zm lns  l dyyn  THE GOOD i thought the book was a really good story  no wonder is a classic in literature  it had its funny moments and mostly because the character  don t give a f ck  attitude  or rather when you examine it is more of a pessimistic attitude but he conveys really good story  I think J D  Salinger did a great job at portraying Holden and is really believeable his reactions and his personality it doesn t feel like is an adult trying to write a story about a teenager but it actually feels as if a teenager is writing his autobiography on a certain time  It was really good piece of literature its funny  is sarcastic  is hart breaking  it was pessimist happy  it was a fun to read the book because it conveyed all those characteristics really without any problem and we get a character that changes throughout his struggles and everything that is why i love it  I loved the metaphor of catcher in the rye with the kids  he says it so that kids wouldn t be face the crappy reality that he is facing  like depression  death  dispair of the crappy world we live on  he says that in a way we should protect the innocence of kids somewhat THE BAD I don t see anything wrong with the book  i don t know why people give it so much heat like saying  HOLDEN is just a little b tch complaining about everything  well that was the whole point of the story  he was still getting over the death of his brother and he thinks less of himself that makes him hate the world and be a pessimist as a result  he was depressed and undecisive on his life that is why he made crappy desitions and got kicked out of school after all  I think people who hate the book fail to interpret what is trying to convey THE CONTROVERSIAL MISCELLANEOUSI re read the book for the second time and i could see why i liked it so much was because i was in a similar face on like Holden  but it was still good  book  I d say if you want to get into reading read this book if good stuff  or looking for something to read this is good read  definitely would recommend This book is the most memorable book I have ever read  It expresses Holden s behaviour and feelings as pessimistic ways  His depression spread throughout his family  his friends  his school  generally all of things related to him except his little sister Phoebe  Holden is adolescent and terrified of being aldult  His love for his sister and other kids so strong that he want to protect them from losing their innocence of childhood  I like his sister Phoebe  She make him recognize that he love his family and couldn t live without them  I am going to reread this book when I have time   La traduccion me tenia bastante desanimada  pero con el pasar de las paginas me fui enamorando de ese personaje  Sufre tanto  conoce a persoanjes tan extranos  esta tan solo  ama tanto y siente con tanta intensidad  que al final casi casi me produce angustia  Es un magnifico libro  This book is a masterpiece  It s very easy for some people to say  so what   Holden was the worst character in the whole world  he is a big liar  he is nothing more than a complainer  He is depressed looser  Well if you think like that go back and read one more time Holden is more like a innocent child to me  He is an emotional kid who wants to help children and keep them safe from falling off the cliff of innocence into adulthood  When Holden grew up and comes up to a situation of being an adult with all the expectations and responsibilities he can not deal with it  Although he thinks he is going through a phase  progressing in the novel he realizes that this is more than a phase  it would be his future My favorite part of the book is when Holden opens his windows making a snowball with the intent of throwing it at something  He changes hid mind  While he was doing it  I went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands  The snow was very good for packing  I didn t throw it at anything  though  I started to throw it  At a car that was parked across the street  But I changed my mind  The car looked so nice and white  Then I started to throw it at a hydrant  but that looked too nice and white  too  Finally I didn t throw it at anything  All I did was close the window and walk around the room with the snowball  packing it harder  A little while later  I still had it with me when I and Brossard and Ackley got on the bus  The bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out  I wasn t going to chuck it at anybody  but he wouldn t believe me  People never believe you  Holden always packs his feelings and emotions like he packed the snowball  he has the fear of corrupting the childhood innocence and purity  So he didn t throw the snowball at anything The Novel ending is ambiguous  He says  don t tell any body anything  if you do you start missing every body  this shows that he still feels alone and he can not trust any body but his nostalgia  missing everybody  shows that he is not as bitter as he was earlier in the book  Meraviglioso viaggio nella mente e nella vita di questo ragazzo  Mi aspettavo troppo  per  da questo libro  per cui la fine  giunta un po  improvvisa  quando ancora il suo percorso non si  dipanato In ogni caso  dei tanti bei quadri presenti nel romanzo  l ultimo  con l amata sorellina   secondo me splendido  Ragazzi  cominci a piovere che non vi dico     Ero bagnato fradicio  soprattutto il collo e i calzoni     Me ne infischiavo  per  Mi sentivo cos maledettamente felice  tutt a un tratto  per come la vecchia Phoebe continuava a girare intorno intorno  Mi sentivo cos maledettamente felice che per poco non mi misi a urlare  se proprio volete saperlo  Non so perch  Era solo che aveva un aria cos maledettamente carina  lei  l che girava intorno intorno  col suo soprabito blu eccetera eccetera  Dio  peccato che non c eravate anche voi   I thoroughly enjoyed this novel  The setup was much different from most other books I have read  especially in classic literature  and the protagonist  Holden Caulfield  has to be one of the most enigmatic and troubling characters I ve ever encountered  I love that Salinger never delves into the intricacies of Caulfield s decisions or emotions   the reader is left to fully interpret the meaning behind events and his feelings on their own  The simplistic declarations of his thoughts and real time progression of the narrative provide both humorous and heartbreaking moments  while also portraying the confusion that plagues Caulfield and forces him into such inner turmoil and cynicism  I found myself at times agreeing with him and relating to him entirely but  at others  considering him a hypocritical phonie  Regardless of this back and forth on my part  I still find him to be one of my favorite characters and his story to be one of the easiest and most difficult to follow and interpret  I have no doubts as to this book s legitimacy and relevance to people even today  The Catcher in the Rye J D Salinger Fiction Little Brown May 1991 ISBN 978 0 316 76948 8  pg 234  We all enjoy childhood and the innocence that comes with it  If you want to be in the mind of 17 year old and feel this innocence once more  Read The Catcher in the Rye  In this novel the center character  Holden Caulfield  leaves his prep school because he cant stand all these  phonies  and the liars  After he leaves he heads toward New York with his red hunting cap  In New York he orders a prostitute  drinks  smokes and figure outs meaning in his life  I recommend this to those who enjoy metaphors and keeping childhood innocence  I recommend this to 15     Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of yet another boarding school in the novel  Catcher in the Rye  As he try s to get the courage to tell his parents the disappointing news he voyages alone through New York City  He embarks on a journey that first seems exultant but there is an underlying tone of melancholy and depression  His sister  Phoebe  is the only person in the world that he endeavors to have a strong relationship with  It appears as if Holden does not do anything in his two days of being in Manhattan but those 48 hours define his future   J D  Salinger is the author of this brilliant book  He also wrote Frannie and Zooey  Nine Stories  and Raise High the Roof Beam along with many other beloved tales  Any teenager who is going to head off to adult hood or someone who is entering into an entirely different world will engross this story  Catcher in the Rye is a valued novel in this century and in centuries to come   You know what  I want so badly to give this 4 stars just so that I don t sound like every other Salinger worshiping dodo out there  But I can t  The narrator of this book just catches my heart and doesn t let go  He feels so genuine to me and  I don t know  this book just pierces me whenever I read it  He s that kid you would never take the time to get to know  Or the kid who might fade into the background or blend right in with everyone else  And yet  here is this human being feeling everything so intensely  struggling with the imposition of this world on our boundaries of innocence  In comes experience   whoah  And boy is this kid deceptively eloquent  Salinger is another one of those one hit wonders  huh  Like Harper Lee  I know he wrote others   but none received the same acclaim  Well  I guess when you nail it you just nail it   The great C S  Lewis had opined    A children s story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children s story in the slightest    and who  indeed  would dare contradict him  I had kept myself away from the The Chronicles of Narnia for a long time  believing I had already outgrown that phase of my life that would ve endeared me to this famed set of fantasy tales written for children  Eventually  when I did read The Magician s Nephew  I realized how hopelessly wrong I was  With The Catcher in the Rye  I m faced with the same realization all over again Some books are written so well  so masterfully that you are bound to get the message the writer had slipped in  skilfully  somewhere between its pages for the perceptive reader to find and cherish like treasure  only if you care to lay off the preordained feelings and biases Sure  I agree  nothing ever happens in this book  The prose  in Holden s own overused words  can be described as  boring  and insipid in my own  But that is what Salinger had wanted it to be I m pretty sure I wouldn t have liked Holden had I read this as a teen  I would ve considered him a whiny  nitpicking pain in the rear  A kid trying to sound and behave like an adult and  of course  failing at it miserably  But now that I m a full fledged adult  capable of knowing what I want and what I don t  I can understand Holden much better  And I can t help but feel a sort of grudging respect for Holden s daring act of breaking away even if for a little while  from the compulsions and responsibilities that life threw his way  the expectations of peers and adults surrounding him His voice is so full of recalcitrance  loneliness  resentment and all the amorphous emotions of that age  that it s near impossible not to relate to it  A sense of pure isolation  a feeling of being adrift in the big  bad world  sometimes with barely anything or anyone acting as an anchor  Faced with problems you previously did not even know existed  an ever widening gap with the members of the opposite sex  A mass of confusing  blurry thoughts swirling inside your head that you would rather prefer to push away than disentangle one by one and analyze  Sometimes not being sure of what you want to do and what you are supposed to do  Stuck somewhere in a time warp  on the brink of adulthood yet not quite so  Demanding to be treated with respect and dignity like an adult  yet to be loved as a child  I m sure we have all gone through the same motions at some point of time in our lives Holden reminds us of that period even if we may not see in him the teenager each one of us had been  individually  He is simply a personification of those confusing  bitter  hazy years that precede the surer  firmer  more secure years And if we maybe honest enough with ourselves we ll find a Holden  all holed up somewhere in the darkest recesses of our psyche  eternally disdainful and critical of the people and things around him  It s just that we ve gotten better at keeping  him  hidden and swallowing urges to lash out at the  phoniness  of it all  Holden s appeal is timeless  And I m quite sure  I ll like this book when I read it again  years down the line  And for this reason alone  The Catcher in the Rye rightly deserves a place in the halls of classic American literature This is THE YA novel  And  perhaps  will always be  P S   My love for this book is not to be interpreted as an endorsement of teenage delinquency or rebellious anti social behavior   The first time I read this book  I thought it was a rather heartwarming coming of age story that takes place all in one weekend  Holden is at times the annoying smarty pants sibling and roomie  but he s always authentic as a character  He s terribly unreliable as a narrator  but that reveals so much more about him than if Salinger had chosen to give an omniscient perspective All that is still true on my second reading of it  but this time round  I felt Holden s loneliness as well  He prattles nonstop to keep himself occupied and deflect from his aimless search for something or someone to fill the silence  He is the king of digression  famously failing oral composition because he claimed he had a headache  but like he reveals about a classmate who failed as well  it was because he couldn t stick to just one subject  In many ways  Holden s stream of consciousness narrative is reflective of the fragmented and seemingly directionless discourse that Modernist writers engage in as a comment on the sentiments of an age of uncertainty and cynicism at structure and order  It is an attempt to articulate the quest to forge new meaning and purpose against the threat of all that is  phony   a favourite Holden observation   As Holden observes of a polished skater at Radio City   He was a very good skater and all  but I couldn t enjoy it much because I kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller skates the stage  It seemed so stupid   Holden can t understand artifice  and his unadorned thoughts and feelings often get him into trouble when he articulates them  In a sense  for all of Holden s unreliable ramblings  he is just being incredibly honest Holden  at the end of the day  is a deeply compassionate character whose innocence and simplicity provides him with the most moving connection with his kid sister  Phoebe   I started reading The Cather in the Rye because one of my friends recommended it to me  My mom  too  said she read the book when she was younger and encouraged me to do so  The book follows the teenage Holden Caulfield when he gets kicked out of his high school  He finds his way around New York City and encounters many people that he shares his opinions on  My favorite quote was  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though   I really liked this because I can definitely relate to it  If I read a book that I really enjoy  I would love to be able to meet the author and talk about his her ideas about the book and how they came up with it  The book was in first person point of view  I really enjoyed how J D  Salinger wrote about his personal philosophies through Holden s character  I would recommend this book to anyone of any age who just needs a new perspective on life  because it definitely gave me one  Nearly everything Holden sees or encounters  he gives his opinion on  Usually  the opinion would be different from mine  so I liked having a fresh look on everyday life  The Catcher in the Rye just become one of my favorite books of all time  The first time I read it in high school I thought it was boring  so I never picked it up  But now that I am in college and have re read the book  I understand it s meaning  It s such a powerful book  Holden Caulfield is an interesting characters  In a way it symbolizes each and every one of us  I saw that I used to be like Holden in a way  I found the book is amazing  However I don t really think that high school students will understand it s message until after they are out of high school  Regardless  the book can be read by anyone  but only enjoyed by select few  I am part of those few   If you don t think this is the best book ever written   you re crazy  I m not even kidding   But seriously  a story so uniquely written that says so much with so little  I can t believe this is banned in some places  All teenagers and 20 somethings  and their parents  should read this absolute masterpiece  I can t remember laughing more while reading a book  Holden s hyperboles and truths found me laughing in public at each new sentence while at the same time savoring each paragraph searching for meaning   Read this many years ago when I was a teenager   sigh    I remember loving it then  I thought I would have different feelings on it reading it as an adult and I did in a way but still really enjoyed itCouldn t get as an e book  had to buy paperback   shock  horror   haven t read one in ages     Still   it s a classic so nice to keep and pass onto my kids      my 17 yr son already wants to read  will be interesting to see what he makes of it now this is what i called a classic literature CATCHER IN THE RYE is definitely one of many book that should be read before die actually it is not the story that makes me love this book it is the complex characterization that Salinger made for his main protagonist Holden Caulfield  a disturbed sometimes annoying young boys that just feels he didn t fit in this world throughout the book we are brought into Holden minds with his sarcastic view of humanity  just trying do his own things with his own way forget harry potter Holden Caulfield is my favorite literature character of all time Fa anys  durant l institut  vaig llegir la traduccio al castella d aquesta novel la que publica Alianza  i no em va dir absolutament res  i esta prou llunyana en el tempa com per a no recordar ne res  tampoc   La relectura que n he fet ara en angles  doncs  es gairebe una primera lectura i la meva percepcio del llibre  ja sigui per l idioma en que l he llegit o perque jo ja no soc la mateixa persona que era  ha canviat del tot  Es una de les millors novel les que he llegit i per a mi te una fama absolutament merescuda Aquesta novel la te moltes coses que m agraden i crec que es dificil capturar millor alguns aspectes de l adolescencia  En Holden Caulfield es un dels personatges millor construits que m he trobat i un magnific exemple de narrador poc confiable  Per a mi  aquesta novel la es el seu protagonista  Es una novel la per a rellegir  Algunes idees desendrecades que se m han acudit   En Holden aplica un criteri diferent per a jutjar el comportament dels demes i el seu propi  Odia tot i a tothom  tothom es hipocrita  fals  envejos    pero els seus actes sovint tambe ho son  tot i que ell els racionalitza  A canvi  sovint es evident el menyspreu que sent cap a ell mateix    cosa que no treu que pensi que es el centre del mon   La manera de parlar de n Holden es un intent constant de donar una imatge de dur  d adult i de  tenir molt de mon   pero es tan extremadament afectada que acaba sent patetica  Tot es  old    o tothom  knew a lot for his age   quan ell te la mateixa o menys edat   o  she was really nervous for a prostitute   com si tingues amb que comparar      etc  Vol semblar sofisticat  pero la constant repeticio de el mateix conjunt d expressions el delata  Al mateix temps  aquest seguit de repeticions li dona un ritme curios a la narracio   De tant en tant en Holden es posa introspectiu  sobretot quan parla dels seus germans i germaneta  o fa confessions molt honestes sobre les seves febleses de personalitat  El contrast entre aquests moments i la majoria del temps  que es dedica a ser un autentic idiota arrogant  fa que el personatge sigui molt mes huma i el poguem compadir  El que evita que el condemnem  com a personatge  es la soledat i la necessitat de contacte huma del probre desgraciat   Una de les coses que mes m ha agradat del llibre es com  com a lector  has de filtrar tot el que explica en Holden a traves del que sabem de la vida i de la nostra propia experiencia com a adolescents  Per aixo penso que  en contra del que havia sentit  deu ser mes facil disfrutar aquest llibre un cop sobreviscuda l adolescencia  Es dificil trobar un llibre en primera persona que funcioni autenticament be  pero aquest n es un  Sovint es un pretexte per a facilitar la inmersio del lector en una situacio  pero aixo es desaprofitar la seva potencia real  que es la seva capacitat de submergir nos no en un seguit d esdeveniments  no en un argument  sino en l experiencia subjectiva d aquests esdeveniments d un personatge concret  Suposo  hauria de pensar hi mes  amb exemples concrets   que per a tenir un valor afegit la narracio en primera persona ha d estar basada en un narrador poc confiable  que ens obligui a corregir tot el que explica   Una altra cosa que per mi no s ha fet evident fins al final es que  de fet  en Holden explica la historia del que li va succeir fa uns mesos o  en qualsevol cas  no fa mes d un any   I ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run down and had to come out here and take it easy   diu   El que mes em frapa d aixo es    que el paio no ha apres absolutament res de la seva experiencia  La seva explicacio dels esdeveniments es absolutament demencial  I mira que conforme avanca el llibre es va trobant gent que li suggereixen que la seva autoimatge i la imatge que dona als demes discrepen del tot  pero ell sempre ho racionalitza i culpa als demes  L imparable espiral de desconnexio amb el mon en la que s endinsa es gairebe tragica i juro que he passat mes de mig llibre portant me les mans al cap  figurativament parlar       Now pardon the cliche of every teenage student  but I loved the Catcher in the Rye  Salinger is most famous for this book  and copies are continued to be sold every where  One main reason for my liking of this story are the themes that immerse through out the story  One theme that I think is the most important is the theme of never wanting to grow up  Like Peter Pan  Holden Caulfield wanted to save other kids from growing up  Holden Caulfield may seem an adult but he is far from it  Holden never really grew up himself  One part of the story he encounters a prostitute  now the only thing Holden cares to do is talk to her  Nothing more  he leaves school to go to New York  and meet his sister  I think that is a very important theme because growing up is something we do at different rates  and some times we never really grow up  This book got a little to real for me toward the end  as a big brother to a younger sister  I ve never thought to have that particular relationship represented so well in a book  but the brother sister dynamic between Holden and Phoebe is flawless  and heart wrenching   mzyfwn  ljmy  hn mzyfwn  hdh m yrddh hdh lmrhq klwfyld ldhy  dhshny jdan  shrkth qlqh  l

Caulfield  a teenager boy confused  irritated and lonesome He almost complains about everything and everyone and considers most people phonies  His description and criticism about various characters is sometimes funny and sometimes frustrating  However one can related to Holden s wavering mind and the chaos in his life as he is unable to decide what he wants to do with his life Altogether the book expresses how the only thing Holden wants with life is to save little children from the difficulties of growing up which he was facing up himself The book is more like a journey than the end and is an interesting read  An excellent book  which questions some of the basic assumptions of the Western World  such as the importance of money  Yes  some of Holden s insights are pretty juvenile  as I ve read in many comments here  but the key word is some  Obviously  things like his plan to run away and live in the woods is ridiculous  but there is a deeper question about the possibility of escaping from a capitalistic world which seems to be putting success before caring  such as when Ackley is ignored because he s  boring and pimply   When you consider that this book was written in an era when America was heading towards McCarthyism where the mentality seemed to be that you were not free to speak against freedom of speech  it becomes easier to understand Holden s rejection of his society as  phony   Going into the Catcher in the Rye  I knew that it would be an assigned book that I would enjoy  I ve always wanted to read it because of all the good things I have heard  and I was not disappointed  I like the voice and language in the book the most  It is easy to understand because Holden speaks like most teenagers these days  You can even hear the tone of his voice in the words and it often sounds like the way that I might say phrase something  Other than that  I liked parts of the plot where Holden was alone with his thoughts  I found many of his thoughts and opinions to be very relatable and I think understanding him helped me to overall understand the book  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger was a very different book  I came into the book expecting just another boring school assigned book but slowly and slowly through reading it  I realized this was not the case  The book is about Holden Caulfield who is a teenager who isn t influenced by society s  status quo   He hates phonies and wants to stay a kid so he can avoid the horrors of society  Holden is a soft kid in a society of people who act like they are rock hard  He doesn t really try to fit in and because of this he constantly gets in trouble  Holden s little brother Allie died of Leukemia when he was 11 years old  Holden states in the book  But it wasn t just that he was the most intelligent member in the family  He was also the nicest  in lots of ways  He never got mad at anybody  People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily  but Allie never did  and he had very red hair   The red hair in my opinion symbolizes Allie being different from everyone else  The day Allie died Holden broke all of the windows in his garage with his bare hands and injured his hand  Holden envies his brother because of he died at an early and wishes he had died at that age before he was exposed to the horrors of society This book definitely kept me hooked  I read this book in only two reading sessions and it kept me on the edge of my seat  I wanted to know what would happen to Holden in the book  At times  I felt like the book talked too much about some things but then after I was done reading and I looked back on it it all made sense  The Catcher in the Rye is the type of book that you have too look back and think upon to really understand what happened and the deeper meaning behind it  Holden doesn t usually tell you how he really feels and you just have to infer it  He uses a lot of sarcasm and many of the things he says symbolize other things  There is quite a bit of profanity in the book and it discusses some sensitive topics such as sex  homosexuality  prostitution  and alcohol abuse  These should not be reasons to not read this book however  because in my opinion these add to the story  The target audience for this book  a teenager  will be or has already been exposed to all of the subjects and if they haven t  they eventually will  I personally find it ridiculous that writers have to censor their stories and can t even tell their complete story without it being questioned or banned  Most teenagers these days whether you like it or not  use profane language and have to deal with the topics that are questionable in this book  Holden also uses god s name in vain a lot so that was probably another reason it was questioned  If you can t handle God s name being used in vain and are very strict on religion  you might have trouble going through this book Overall  I thought this was a great read  I would recommend it to everyone from the age of 15 to 25  People in this age range will most likely relate to Holden in this book and will enjoy it  It was a short read and I didn t find myself bored very much in this book  After this book  I have a different outlook on life and I now I don t really care as much what people and society think about me  The Catcher in the Rye was one of my favorite books I have ever read so I definitely recommend this book and I give it a perfect score of 5 stars  Llega un punto en la vida en que te atormentas por algo que siempre habias ignorado  quien eres realmente y quien deseas ser  Te hundes en un mar de preguntas   Soy la materializacion de las expectativas de mis padres   Realmente se puede ser uno mismo   Valdra la pena romper el molde social   Como hacerlo   Para que hacerlo A grandes rasgos pareciera que la obra no va de nada y no llega nada  El arquetipo de adolescente amargado y de lenguaje flojo  Teen angst en su mas pura escencia  Pero al final  es todo eso lo que la pubertad conlleva  lo que nos formo  lo que nos enseno a cuestionarlo todo  Todos hemos sido Holden  y seguiran naciendo nuevos Holden  Es mas  antes de Holden  el ya existia  quizas Salinger lo fue  y antes de el alguien mas  Es por eso que The Catcher In The Rye es una obra casi inmortal  Al finalizarlo  nunca tienes la certeza de lo que realmente sucedio en las menos de 250 paginas  asi como la de lo que sucede despues  Uno de los libros con los que definitivamente descubri lo que el leer realmente significa  Y tambien uno de los mas valiosos  Llego a mis manos por parte de una persona que fue importante en mi vida  a lo cual  la historia de Holden  es tambien un fragmento de la mia   My copy of this book doesn t have a synopsis or anything like that so I didn t know what to expect from this book  however after finishing it  I was certainly surprised in a good way   The Catcher in the Rye  is definitely a character driven book in which we follow Holden s wandering through New York and all the events that follow the course of a couple of days of his life  We read about what s going on in this teenager s mind who s trying to be heard  understood and  above all  is trying to find himself and his place in the world  I believe that Holden  with all of his angsty moments  his unique traits and observant ways  makes us really relate to him because honestly  we re all our own versions of Holden ourselves at some point of our lives Even though not much happens in the book  I found it very entertaining and despite wishing I had read it when I was in high school  I m glad I was able to truly enjoy it now Although this wasn t a traditional read  I ended up loving it and I can now understand why this is a classic and how it influenced so many writers    It is amazing how much more you can pick up from a novel when you read it at different stages of life   Una autentica obra maestra que recoge a la perfeccion la lucha adolescente contra la sociedad El estilo narrativo en primera persona es fantastico y son inolvidables sus expresiones  sus tics  sus fobias  p e   el cine  y sus pasiones Totalmente recomendable  una joya de libro  This book damn near killed me  I don t know why or how it was popularized or if there is some deeper meaning or greater context behind it or something  To me it felt casual and fairly straightforward  the ending was anti climatic  but I did not mind anyway  Because this is a good book by the standards set by the author     a book that when you are all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  And that describes it perfectly  I totally feel that way  His words sound familiar as hell because that s how I talk  on the internet anyway  I m fairly shocked that our language hasn t changed a whole lot in half a century  Given all the progress we ve made in those 50 or so years  I thought we d developed distinctly new lifestyles and hence new styles of writing  Looks like that s not it at all  Either J D  Salinger s incredibly ahead of his time or our language hasn t changed much at all  I m leaning towards the latter  to be honest  And that really amazes me that we can live through so many generations and still be able to relate closely to someone that many years ago  Or maybe I m just making it a big deal  I don t know  I haven t read a good book in a while I ve read some of the reviews and I don t agree with those saying that Holden was trying to save the innocence  Yes  he likes Phoebe and he wipes profanity off of her school s walls  but he s not really going to be the catcher in the rye  He was going to pretend to be a handicap working at a gas station and then become a hermit  He didn t give a fuck about saving children s innocence  I read it again in English  Charming If you like a one man show about chasing meaning  defining the inner self and feeding ones social hunger  then you will fall in love with this book as I have  Salinger has given birth to a story that is so honest that you begin to release yourself from the qualms that hide within the confines of your own mind   After seeing the PBS special on Salinger  I thought I would re read this book  after some 40 years  I read this twice previously  the last time as a young adult  I like it now more than I did then  Some observations The story has a wonderful conversational tone to it  which begs the question  who  exactly  is Holden talking to  His psychiatrist  Ackley  or some other classmate  Himself It is not really a novel  in my view  more like a long magazine article  Almost no character development and very little  action   What is does have is marvelous attention to detail It has a very nice rhythm to it that propels the story   the short narrative sentences  the constant repetition of the words  phony    lousy   old   and the use of the three word short affirmative statements sentences    He really was   or   I really do   The short sentences then set up the longer narrative sections Holden is crazy   suicidal ideation  flight of ideas  mood swings  etc I think this is more a book about childhood than adolescents  The author nails it when describing Phoebe s actions and statements Not sure of the significance of the red hunting cap Parts laugh out loud funny   the scene with Spencer  the history teacher  comes to mind I don t think Allie ever existed  He is a figment of Holden s imagination  The poems on the baseball mitt   poetry written by Holden  which were rejected  The date of Allie s death   the day Holden s childhood died   either he had a poem rejected or an adult pooped on his dream of being a poet  or he realized he couldn t be one  And we know that Holden is a self admitted liar I recalled and was stunned by the section dealing with the Museum of Natural History and the immutable nature of the exhibits  while the people looking at them changed  Brilliant  brilliant  brilliant  Just like someone reading the book  again  will not be the same  while the book hasn t changed  The casual  throwaway introduction of the title by a six year old walking on the sidewalk with his parents   great Holden helping the little girl with her roller skates   Jesus washing the feet of his Disciples A very New York kind of book  As someone who grew up in New York  the references to Central Park and the museums and theaters resonated greatly I think adolescent readers connect with this book and rightly so  In my view  as an older adult reader  it is a masterpiece  As always  Salinger s writing is so brilliant  his characters so real  that he need not employ artifice of any kind  This is a study of the complex problems haunting all adolescents as they mature into adulthood and Salinger wisely chooses to keep his narrative and prose straightforward and simple This is not to say that The Catcher in the Rye is a straightforward and simple book  It is anything but  In it we are privy to Salinger s genius and originality in portraying universal problems in a unique manner  The Catcher in the Rye is a book that can be loved and understood on many different levels of comprehension and each reader who experiences it will come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live  Another great American classic  Each time I read it  I see more and more how JD Salinger shared so much both about himself  I see this book and always have as somewhat autobiographical  as well as opening our eyes to what young people go through in their travels to maturity  A required read for everyone  no matter what the age  The Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J  D  Salinger  I am not a fast reader  However  I started reading this book yesterday and I was done reading it today  From the first line in the book  I was hooked  And then  how can you not be  I mean  it just hits you like a ton of bricks  The only criticism that I have is to myself for not having read it      way  way  way before As you may already be suspecting  I really liked the book  It is as fresh today  some sixty plus years later  as it was when it was first published  Although  I can imagine that it must have been quite a shocker to the reading public when it first came out  I believe the book was banned for most of the twentieth century and it appears that it was only removed from some banned lists  in the past years Generally speaking  I don t like novels that are written in first person  And this one is  But it was written so brilliantly that it keeps you totally engage  wanting for more It is not a sappy or sentimental novel  to be sure  It has a coarse language and swearing all over the place  And kids today don t  by and large  use that slang anymore  But these  at least to me  were not any detractors to the work Holden Caulfield  the novel s antihero  is almost a sociopath that cannot relate to his environment  The novel takes place in New York and it spans not more than a few days in the life of Holden  I would say that Holden is a little bit too complex a character for a seventeen year old  but then again  this is the vehicle that the author chose  to deliver a witty and certainly crazy and entertaining character http   balamabello com I got sick in junior high and had to be home schooled through high school so I missed reading a bunch of the classics  I was reading Michael Critchton books while my friends were reading things like Hemingway and Salinger  I am almost thankful  Now that I am older I get to experience these books for the first time and maybe appreciate them more I read Catcher not thinking about how its considered a voice of the generation or about Salinger s odd behavior  I read it on its own merits and it was wonderful  It is simultaneously funny and depressing  Holden is bonkers but immensely endearing  Salinger holds a clinic on first person narration done right   4 5Why I find this book great  Cause it talks to you in a real wayHolden   the main character   is like that person in your life that doesn t know when to shut up but you still listen to everything he she says and you still enjoy every moment of listening This book was written for you to listen   if your not welling to give you ears then don t bother reading it  The novel  The Catcher in the Rye  written by J D Salinger  is modern classic of the coming of age genre  The main character  17 year old Holden Caulfield  is absolutely relatable to every teenager as the book progresses  it becomes fascinating to get inside the head of the strange  rebellious protagonist  Despite being written in 1951 the book is very relatable for most teenagers still to this date  as they are able to identify with the different themes and events portrayed  The novel was first published in 1951 and the action of the novel takes place in the late 1940s in New York The Catcher in the Rye begins with seventeen year old Holden Caulfield jumping right in with a lot of attitude and dated profanity  he begins venting about all the things that happened to him  around last Christmas   His story begins on a December Saturday at Pencey Prep School in Pennsylvania  where he has just been kicked out for failing all his classes except English  Getting expelled seems to be a reoccurring act in Holden s past yet he doesn t seem to care  The novel is quite strange in the fact that it has no blurb or information about the author  therefore you just have to plunge straight in and read the book  The intended audience and purpose of The Catcher in the Rye is unclear  the most critically accepted purpose of The Catcher in the Rye is to express the frustrations of youth  trying to come to terms with adolescence and an increasingly complex and seemingly confusing adult world  The novella is narrated by its main character  Holden Caulfield and arguably its only well developed character  His narration takes place in an unknown mental institution  which implies that he has recently had a mental breakdown  Salinger uses language very effectively to convey a sense of the character to the audience  In particular  the language that Holden uses is informal in an attempt to imitate the way that real life teenagers talk  Holden makes great use of sarcasm and dry humour  still a favourite language technique that is represented in teenagers  everyday life  This not only has the effect of negativity but also creates an element of uncertainty into what Holden really means  The use of profane language  swearing  is used by Salinger to demonstrate Holden s frustration and anger towards the world  One reoccurring technique that Salinger uses is the language repetition  this is presented throughout much of the novel  At first it gives a sense of limited vocabulary from the narrator s point of view  But then it seems to come across as if Salinger purposefully uses the repetition of particular words and phrases to enhance the expression of confusion and frustration  Some examples of this include the phrase  that kills me   Holden is often saying this throughout the novel after he finished rambling about a certain event that annoys him or makes him feel depressed  the term is used whenever something makes him feel pangs of love or similar emotion  For example  the notebooks of young kids  kill  him in that they push him to open up his hardened heart  This is represented when Holden is standing outside of the museum talking to a young girl and he asks her if she would like a hot chocolate  her reply makes him feel alone and depressed   She said she had to meet her friend  Kids always have to meet their friend  That kills me    p108 Another example of repetition is shown with one of the most important symbols in the entire book  the red hunting hat  at first the hat seems unimportant but then you recognise that it keeps reoccurring in certain specific key passages  Holden tells us that he bought the hat in New York on a morning when he feels particularly vulnerable after the events with fencing team although Holden would never admit a state of vulnerability  There are even hints dropped at the start of Chapter Thirteen where it becomes obvious that Holden wears the hat to show that he doesn t care what people think  I took my old hunting hat out of my pocket and put it on and I didn t give a damn how I looked   p80  When he s wearing the hat he can be as narrow minded and tough and as unique as he wants to be portrayed The intended audience of The Catcher in the Rye is likely to be adolescents and certainly it has been an extremely popular novel amongst this age group for its ability to tap into the emotions and frustrations of teenagers  The heavy use of rude language is effective in making the reader relate to the characters better and make the characters seem realistic  but on the other hand  I would not recommend this novel to anyone under fourteen  It is not just the language used that makes the novel unsuitable for children under fourteen it is also the themes and events J D  Salinger s novel is a wake up call to all teenagers and in a sense  is an inspiring novel because it sends out the message that we should all remain hopeful and true to ourselves as people  Teenagers can relate to it because of its complex themes of rebellion  identity  isolation and independence but I would recommend that people read it before they are too old as otherwise it might seem too rude and Holden s actions may seem stupid and silly  Salinger tapped into something with this depressed pessimist of a teenager  It s something that not every reader will be able to grasp and hold onto  but it s something you ll never forget The Catcher in the Rye I also enjoyed this book  It had everything I enjoy in a book  sporadic protagonist who is an Anti hero and a facade of nothingness that could turn into more symbolism  I loved reading in school and outside of school  First reading 29 June 2011Second reading 13 December 2013I m glad am alive so I could read this one since it s in a list of books u must read before dying  Dwhat I like the most is how he could talk and add all these expressions about such a journey which happened in less than a week  from Sat to Wed  I like how he describes the whole thing as well it deserves the 5 stars I think because he has this sense of humor I have in criticizing others  He also doesn t like all people whom always pretending they re lovely and friendly with u  he calls  em phoniest  he s absolutely right   he could describe them in the suitable way which is in my mind but I can t find the best vocabulary for it   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Ryewell  this is a great book  a great recommendation by my friend Dhiraj again  the above quote goes with this book itself  I d have loved to befriend Mr J D  and certainly called him up to tell that he is a terrificly awesome writer  I saw people rating it with one star  or calling it an overrated one  for them I d say people who are not able to understand the book  are bound to say or do things like this as among my own circle of reader friends  I don t find someone suitable to recommend the book as it can t be understood just like that  but I wish my friends come across the book someday somehow  I loved the nice and meaningful quotes in it  it s a pure inspiration  this man knocks me out completely  nothing phony can be said about him  had a helluva fun reading it  look forward to perusing more works of J D  Salinger     Holden is the best character in any book I ve ever read  The first time I read this book I was only eleven  and I didn t understand or relate to anything in it  I though the narrator was funny  if not whiny at times  However  now that I m older  this book reaches me on a much deeper level  I can easily relate to Holden s thoughts  and even find myself laughing at some of the more deadpan jokes he makes  I get why people call him whiny  but that just makes it better in my opinion  as everyone knows that part of being a teenager is whining about everything  You can t understand it  till you read it  Just like that  you can love it or hate it  there is not a point in between  Any male teenager who hasn t yet ravaged through this monstrously beautiful book is probably disillusioned  There is an optimum age to read this  I d suggest 15 is the best age to appreciate Holden and his problems  I ve certainly felt on par with Holden  and I find him to be an intolerant and shallow minded individual  but one that is so easy to attach to  It s through this bewildered characters fictional eyes that everything is shown to be  phony   which is precisely how most teenagers approach things  Not only is brilliant for precocious adolescents  it s also perfect for quotes  The quote involving  It s History  It s Poetry  I ve looked over and over again recently  and I find it striking similar to my stance on life at the present time  thus making me want to follow a career path ever so much more  The quote has made me want to aspire to be a writer of late  and I think any teenager  nostalgic person or any person of good taste should read this  but remember  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody    Even more meaningful the second time  Features of Holden s personality are vividly depicted in his adolescent ranting  Love it   It s kind of in vogue right now to hate The Catcher in the Rye  and by extension its protagonist Holden Caulfield  The usual criticism seems to be that Holden is an unlikeable narrator   that he is whiny  immature and passive  Holden is certainly these things but he is also noble  afraid and  most importantly  a vicious reflection of the dichotomy of innocence and growth  Whether or not Holden is likeable  however endearing  is superfluous to the novel  Holden represents a boy stuck in the liminal space between childhood and manhood  the numb of nostalgia and the pain of the present  While he may call everyone he meets a phony and claim to hate almost everyone in the novel  even his sister Phoebe at one point  he also shows a deep and genuine compassion for humanity   his longing to be the catcher in the rye  however naive  is ultimately what solidifies this  Holden is someone who acts like a man   drinking  smoking  ordering prostitutes   but who thinks like a boy  He is bitchy and whiny and hapless but what Salinger captures so beautifully is someone whose hamartia is that of clinging too tight to their innocence  To not empathise with Holden Caulfield is in some ways to embody the loss of innocence and detachment from youth that Salinger was trying so desperately to capture  Perhaps we are the catchers in the rye and Holden is the child we must save from plummeting off the side of the cliff Another great quality of this novel is just how funny it can be  Some of Holden s bitchiest and most facile comments are his funniest just for how hypocritical and childish he is  One must be able to distinguish between when Salinger is prompting us to laugh with Holden and when he is prompting us to laugh at Holden  The great irony of Holden Caulfield comes from the fact that while he calls everyone he encounters a phony  he is the biggest phony in the book  Frequently acting out being shot  using fake names  Jim Steele is very suave though  I will give him that   claiming to be older than he is to get served  etc  It s the sharp humour like this that illustrates Salinger s understanding of how controversially Holden will be perceived Perhaps this review should instead be called  In Defense of The Catcher in the Rye   I try to avoid reviews and discussion about books until I have myself formulated a solid opinion but with a book as cultural important as The Catcher in the Rye  it was impossible and before I had even considered reading it I had encountered a wealth of dislike and indifference towards this novel  I don t think those who dislike the book are wrong or that my feelings invalidate theirs   I just want to illustrate how I felt that this book s alleged weaknesses could be alternatively perceived and how  to me  Holden s contradictory and pathetic nature is what made this novel so endearing and touching  When I was in primary school I won a playmobil airport and airplane set  One of my friends found out and became upset that they had lost the competition  When I told my dad I remember him saying that life wasn t fair  Even though I was the one who had won  I felt terrible living in a new reality where things just weren t fair  I haven t thought about that moment since  I probably only pondered the horror of injustice for a few seconds before going back to play with the airplane and forget all about it  A few months back I saw a pigeon dying on the side of the road and frowned to which my dad said   that s life   I said I guessed it was and  again  thought nothing more after that  My point is  there s an innocence and naivety escaping us every day  piece by piece  and we don t even notice it  Most of what Holden says in this novel is facile and his moments of tenderness can be haphazardly idealist  but it s the reflection that makes him relevant  And it s not just that which makes him relevant  it s his ability to remind us of the necessity of the degradation of innocence and of dismissal in order to survive in this world  It is no coincidence that every sane character in his novel dismisses Holden and his idealism  it is no coincidence that Mr Antolini foresees a fall in Holden s future if he doesn t grow up  it s no coincidence that Holden does fall  To dismiss Holden and this novel is to dismiss the pain of hardening to the world  to dismiss the inklings of innocence that will remain in us all no matter how hard we try  to dismiss our comings of age  It s been  wow  almost twenty years since I last read The Catcher in the Rye  My previous read through was in college  for a class on young adult literature  My memory of the book was that I liked it  but I d forgotten just how much  It s easy to forget that J  D  Salinger s prose style has arguably had more influence on American postwar fiction than any other writer  How amazing that this is true despite his relatively small published output  a novel  four novellas  and a collection of nine short stories   Even more amazing is that Salinger s stories  and Catcher in the Rye in particular  are still so timely and applicable to modern life  Holden Caulfield s predicament isn t a uniquely 1950s style predicament  Thanks to reality TV  Fox News  Goldman Sachs  etcetera  these days it seems we re surrounded by more phonies than ever  More generally  and perhaps less controversially  apologies to any Fox News fans out there    Holden s gradual maturation from child to adult  a transformation that  as far as I m concerned anyway  hasn t quite happened by the end of the novel  is a transformation that we all go through  perhaps not as painfully as Holden does  but his own experience touches on the experience many of us had as we struggled to become adults  Who of us didn t find ourselves fed up with our friends  acquaintances  and mentors on a regular basis  Who of us weren t occasionally as irritating and obnoxious as Holden can sometimes be  Who of us didn t feel like we were going to lose it completely at the oddest times  or the most appropriate times  Reading Catcher in the Rye brought me back to my adolescence again and  while it made me so glad those awkward days are over for me  it also reminded me to appreciate the experiences I had at that age because they helped to form the person I am today  I like to think about Holden Caulfield as an adult  and I don t think he would have turned out in any of the three ways that Mr  Antolini was worried Holden might turn out  The adult Holden may despise the phonies he sees around him  but I suspect he would see fewer and fewer of those types the older he gets  In fact  his reassessment of Mr  Antolini s intentions  after fleeing his former teacher s apartment  is evidence that Holden  perhaps as he matures  won t allow his snap judgments to stand as his only assessment of another person s character  Personally  I know that I could benefit from allowing myself to reconsider what I think and feel about others  It s thanks to J  D  Salinger that I am able to keep this in mind  I struggled a bit with my decision to give this book five stars  The main reason for that is because Holden Caulfield may be one of the most detestable characters in all of literature  Holden has an attitude that is nothing but off putting  and he has a view of the world that is sometimes beautiful  but mostly just as pretentious as the people he claims to dislike  Upon completing the novel  however  I began to realize just how perfectly created this character really is  Salinger absolutely nails the mentality of a teenage boy  and  despite my hatred of the character  there are a lot of things he says which are quite relatable  This may be the first young adult novel ever written and I still feel it is an important novel which everyone should read  I feel sorry for whoever is eventually tasked with adapting this book to film  Hacia tiempo que no leia un libro que no relata nada  y  sin embargo  lo cuenta todo Es un increible retrato de la adolescencia y sus vaivenes  El personaje principal irrita y conmueve

significance and impact comes along  Although this book is now a classic   crafted by JD Salinger  it s message and importance is still relevant to this day  By this amazing book s end  we must reach the conclusion that there are times when we all need a  catcher in the rye   We are  indeed  blessed if we have one   I loved this book and would re read it over and over again Brought it with me during a vacation to pass the time at the airport  it was the best decision  I picked it up whenever I had the time  The perfect book for students going through a major life event getting ready to be  an adult     At least  that s when I read it  Blew my mind  Same as it did when I was a teenager   only now I m worried that I ve become one of those phonies coming in the goddam window  The Catcher in the RyeJ D  Salinger This is one of the best books I ve ever read  and I really don t know why  The story isn t really about anything in particular  except for the life of a 16 year old in New York City  I guess you can credit the author for making such a masterpiece  and creating such an entertaining character  Holden is probably the most humorous character I ve ever read about  and it is very interesting to read about his perspective on life  Not only this  but he is a very relatable character to me  being a teenager  If I had to say one thing that Salinger uses so differently from other authors is his use of italics  They completely change the way everything sounds  Es uno de los pocos libros que es fiel a su autor o personaje principal  y no utilizo fiel refiriendome a sus principios o valores  sino a encarar contradicciones de si mismo que enfrenta cualquier persona por ser parte de la naturaleza humana estas fuerzas que pelean y producen fuerza del espiritu  y eso es a lo que me referia  es crudo  escribe conforme a si mismo como en un diario no teniendo principios basicos  ves la evolucion claramente a la que nos exponemos los humanos en la vida  tan llena de cambios de parecer  impulsos  ideas  odio y amor  En  the catcher in the rye  puedes ver el flujo de el personaje y la escritura como un rio viviente en el que chocan sus corrientes diversas pero al final caen todas en un mismo rumbo  el amor a todo  Que desemboca a veces ese odio por ver fallas que produciran dolor a lo que amas  i came about this book in my father s collection at the age of 23  probably not the right age for this book  but in any case i loved it because i could easily relate to it  yes the character in the book is extremely rebellious against his surroundings  but somewhere in life i felt a similar attitude  i would recommend this book to everyone who has passed his teenage as it is quite relatable A great book that captures the confusion of the lonely  disillusioned adolescent mind  A great survival guide for learning to live in a world of phonies      Naah  not really  I think kids of a certain disposition  like me  tend to go through the Holden Caulfield phase  Some recover and others just go downhill from there I read it because it was mentioned prominently in the movie  Six Degrees of Separation  A bit about Salinger as a writer    this is the one really great book he wrote  Most of his books are based around the same related set of characters  the same themes of youthful disillusionment and estrangement  His writing after  Catcher  gets pretty repetitive though  If you want to know the truth  I really liked this book  and I don t mean it in the phony way that some people say that it s marvelous or grand just because it has been around for like a million years and everyone has to read it  and talks about how even now it is the coming of age book for teenagers in the United States  People who say that can get on your nerves  if you want to know the truth I had forgotten how much I liked this book  and what a character and personality Holden is   good thing that the book is only 200 some pages long  because I think that more than that would be exhausting  The thing I have remembered best about it is the voice  if you want to know the truth   One new thing for me on this reading was the fact that the language and circumstances are dated    sexy  is used where we would likely use  turned on  today  for instance  and while this is certainly a kid from a well off family the expectation that there would be a maid in the household  and the professor whom he visits right at the start of the book is described as not having too much dough  hence his wife opened the door because there was no maid  However  I don t think these get in the way of the story Another odd item was Holden s description early on of having read Out of Africa  since he somehow had gotten the book by accident  and had greatly liked   What really knocks you out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though  I wouldn t mind calling this Isak Dinensen up     It surprises me that this would be a favorite book for him as I find it rather ethereal and not likely to be a choice of a teenage boy  certainly not on the same planet as Ring Lardner  and it would be interesting to see what he would think if he found out that Isak Dinensen was actually Karen Blitzen  It could be interesting to simply read through all the books that Holden says he has read and liked  and see if there is a pattern I had forgotten how the book ended  but throughout  perhaps unwittingly  I was reminded of Portnoy s Complaint  which is Portnoy telling his story  then finally ending with his psychiatrist saying  something like   now let s start   I was also reminded of Stewart O Nan s Snow Angels  not the movie  the novel  which is terrific  which also mostly consists of the working of the mind of a teenage boy  although one who is quite unlike Holden  more sympathetic and truly thoughtful  but on the exterior very quiet and mostly communicates with grunts and nods I am still trying to sort out the title  It is referenced in two places  once when he encounters a  poor looking  kid singing the song while walking with his family on Sunday morning  and the other time when he describes to Phoebe that he would like to be a catcher in the rye of children in a game  so that they do not fall off a cliff  The only two characters in the book whom he seems to love and appreciate unreservedly are the dead brother Allie  and Phoebe  so perhaps he sees his role as to protect them  some sort of preserver of innocence I also appreciated one reference to his mother  when he was packing the skates that she had sent him  even though they were the wrong kind he had appreciated her getting them  and at the same time realizes that he will be letting her down  someone who loves him  because he is getting kicked out of school again  Anyway  that s what I thought of old Holden Caulfield  I swear to God  if you want to know the truth    Ne znaiu  chto menia na eto s podviglo  no istoriia retsenzii na knigi beret nachalo imenno ot dannogo romana  Ne to  chto by ia ran she

and connected to be many different readers  Its stream of consciousness style gives students a view of what literature can be from a new perspective   i loved and still love this book more than anything  i have read it so many times  i have it in a phase box  my copy is the best in the world  ask me to see it  I ve read this book three times and still I find new things I didn t notice before  It is a cult classic for a reason  it just grabs your attention and keeps it until the end  Yeah I find some of it very silly and naive as hell but it appeals to the silly naive as hell parts of me   One of my all time favorite books  I really recommend it for High Schoolers  It s about a teen age boy who gets kicked out of school and only takes places over a few days  The writing is wonderful and the ending is a twist and still  after reading it at least 5 times  confuses me  I highly suggest reading it  This was my second attempt to read it  The last time I abandoned it  after losing interest several chapters into it  I found this time that chapters 1 and 2 were a joy  and I felt like I hadn t read tehm before  Chapters 3 7 are something of a pain  primarily because the bad language seemed gratuitous and because Stradlater and Ackley were not characters I liked spending time with  anyone for a description of pimple bursting and cutting nails   But get past there  when Holden gets out of school and the narration takes on a new life  Let me get the issue of bad language out of the way  the reason the book was banned at times  I don t like hearing or reading swearing  it is for this reason I don t rate comedians who do  Take this passage for example   He was finished cutting his damn toenails  So he got up from the bed  in just his damn shorts and all  and started getting very damn playful   However  to get the balance right for Holden Caulfield s character  it was necessary and gives strength to the narrative voice of the novel  Salinger was himself uncomfortable about the reaction this would get from his family and the public at large  However  regardless I found it predictable and I started to notice patterns in the swearing  Damn  check  Goddamn  check  Chrissake  Damn  Hell  Bastard  Check  After a while  it felt like a carousel  which funny enough is the closing image of the book  Coincidence  I think not  The swearing was a way to demonstrate the circularity of Holden s mind  that he couldn t escape from  and was destined to keeping falling off his carousel horse of life  even despite Mr Antolini s clear warning  The book seems to be a strong champion of the innocence of children and how growing up too soon can play havoc with the happiness of their lives  Kids are not ready for sex  there is time enough for that later  Adolescence is a right of passage between being innocent as a child and as Mr Antolini calls being an  educated and scholarly  adult  This book  to use Holden s language  is not phony  it is the real deal and tells an important truth about growing up and the damage that others can do who steal the young s innocence  Second time  I loved it and would highly recommend  Just make sure you read past chapters 3 to 7 though   When I began this book  my English explained to me  and the rest of the class  that this was a black and white book  in a way  Either people loved it or they hated it  there was no in between  The previous year I had read some books that were great  but the majority I didn t like too much  So of course I was worried about whether or not I would like this one    and I ended up loving it  Like so many other novels  Catcher is a book that means more once you understand what it s really about  and the symbolism in this book and the themes it presented were a wonderous portrait with which I could relate to  It really is an amazing book  and while some don t like Holden s voice  I thoroughly enjoyed it  I always love me an interesting narrator  I read this book 3 times  First time in France  and in French translation  when I was a teenager  then in English in my twenties  living in the UK  In both instances I couldn t see what the fuss was about  Then last year Salinger died and someone in my book group decided that we had to read it  I wasn t impressed  but I read it  for the third time  And it happened  this time I understood it  and I loved it  It s 15 20 years since I last read it  Did I need the maturity  Is it because I have teenage sons now and I could understand Holden better  Is it because I ve seen so many people around me having mental health issues  No idea  But now I understand  and I agree with  people who hail this book as a masterpiece  It is  and it was well ahead of its time  Trust me  persist with it   If you neglected to read this when you were 15 you probably missed the boat  As I recall my response to it 46 years ago   I couldn t put it down  Holden s attempts to reconcile his anti social tendencies with his yearning for social acceptance define teenage angst  Finally  a character whose life  despite differences in setting and family status  mirrored mine  It made for an exhilarating read for which I am forever grateful   view spoiler

ljdW  n lbT   this book swears a lot  0Ok um the books sbout a boy names Holden who is in aworld full of phonies  Holden gets kicked out of his fourth school and is wanderig throught the streets  He is going through anger and is feeling depression  He drinks  goes to nightclubs  has a prostitute come over  I know that people can rlate    Well of course I read this book  I went to a Connecticut prep school in the sixties  Like just about every other adolescent smart ass I identified heavily with Holden  And loved good old Phoebe  Extremely beautiful     Lots of swearing Lots of phonies Holden killed me It s nice to read something in a male s perspective Although it was full of curses and really offensive words  it didn t bother me much  The tone was very casual  You feel like the author is directly talking to you  Well he is  in a way I have to say that I really liked this book despite all the things society considers negative in it To be honest  I had no idea where the story is heading  It is not your typical book with its typical plot One of my favorite parts is his conversation with his old teacher  Mr  Antolini  when they were talking about finding the size of your mind and all  It affected me in a way The ending was fantastic  I felt Holden s happiness while he was soaked under the rain  Great novel   D This was one of my must reads in highschool  All around me  every other student in my English class hated this book  Yet for me  for the first time  the studied text was not just enjoyable  it was fantastic  I was blown away at the time that I could actually enjoy a school must read  While it s a little dated for modern readers  it s such a well told story  It deserves being read in more depth than just a precursory overview    The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger is about a guy named Holden  Holden is a 16 year old growing teenager who is desperately failing school and must drop out  Although  he isn t too upset about dropping out because he hates everything about his school  even the people  Holden had a roommate named Stradlater and his neighbor was named Ackley  Holden was put in many situations where he was forced to act as an adult  and wanted to  but couldn t seem to connect at an adult level  Holden has lots of inner conflict with himself and had trouble finding who he was  With Holden s bad luck in girls and interactions with other people he learns lots of things and discovers his decisions influence his family  mostly his sister Phoebe  Holden learns lots throughout the story  This is a great book and is very relatable  It is also very well written  The book is narrated by Holden himself  so it was easy to tell how he felt at certain parts and everything he was going through in detail  especially when he is seeing Phoebe ride the carousel  it explains the emotions that he felt and how he began to cry  Seeing Holden cry was rare because he usually didn t show much emotion so when he did that showed something significant  I suggest this book for anyone over the age of 13 and up   SPOILER FREE If you were once a kid and or are human you should read this book  It may initially seem like Salinger is simply writing about  first world problems   but  considering the fact that he was one of the American writers to experience the most of WWII but instead chose to write about a whiney teenager and his red hunting hat roaming around New York says something about the significance and importance of the subject  You don t need to have been expelled from a prep school or come from a rich family or have even ever been to New York City to benefit from what our narrator Holden Caulfield has to say  hell  you don t even have to like him  Catcher in the Rye deals with several common universal themes  such as the loss of innocence and transition to adulthood  but in a much different way than I have ever seen  Holden s narration is great because it is both frustratingly whiney and also extremely genuine and human  one moment  he ll be complaining about a classmate  a run on sentence later  he ll start to sympathize with him and draw a connection to a greater problem  Overall  this book refuses give any conclusions but forces you to think deeply about the ideas its putting forth at the same time  Anyway  to commit the  Catcher in the Rye reviewing cliche   let me use Holden s words  I got a bang out of this book  I really did  Surprisingly  The Catcher in the Rye is my favourite book of all time  Told to read this book in grade eleven English  I didn t think I would like it  Books that you ve been forced to read are less enjoyable than books that you read on your own  While the class was slowly reading the novel aloud  I read the book at my own pace  about an hour a day and finished the book earlier than the rest of the class  First time I read the novel  my mind was thinking   WHAT BOOK IS THIS   I hated Holden  I had no idea why the publisher would run this book  The book had no climax  no action  no conflict  NOTHING  I was pissed off  cause I learned nothing about English literature  Because I finished the novel  I was practically doing nothing in class while the teacher was reading the book aloud  Somewhere halfway  she handed out a sheet with the all symbols themes in the book  So when she read the book aloud  I started LOOKING for these symbols  Second time around  I started respecting Salinger for his incorporation of thematic ideas in the book  second time I read the book   Do you ever have those moments where you feel like we re over analyzing a book  And then the author probably had NO IDEA what they were doing and fortunately  someone in the 21st century MADE UP all the reoccurring symbols themes motifs  making that piece of literature famous  I NEVER had that feeling reading this book  I had no doubts that Salinger intended the book to be written the way it was  Third time reading this book  I did this for the project related to the novel  This time  I was done finding symbols  I tied the ideas all together and found myself feeling sorry for Holden  He didn t want to grow up  He thought adults were phonies  He wanted to keep children  pure   I found myself in tears when he realized that he would never be able to erase all the profanity on the walls  that he would never stop children from growing up  When his sister was riding the carousel  he realized that he had to let her go  round and round    Final reaction  WHY HOLDEN  WHY MUST YOU GROW UP  I actually wanted him to be who he was  and not what society wanted him to be  despite his uselessness  I grew attached to the novel  and to this day  I can t stop forgetting what a fantastical job Salinger did  I don t understand why this book received a 3 75 rating  I really don t  I really need to buy this book   Holden Caulfield  a seventeen year old boy from New York City  telling the story of three days in his life  The whole narrative is a coming to terms with the past  since Holden tells it from a psychiatric institution It is the adult world that has driven him insane  He just cannot relate to anyone except for his sister Phoebe  Everything and all other people seem  phony  to him  Holden is unable to accept life  Since Holden is becoming an adult himself  he is unhappy with what he will represent  He flunks out of three boarding schools in a row One Saturday night  after an unpleasant experience with his history teacher  Old Spencer   his roommate Stradlater and the boy next door  Robert Ackley  Holden decides to leave Pencey four days early for Christmas break  He knows that he cannot return to his parents because they are not aware that he has been expelled again  Holden spends the next three days wandering aimlessly around New York City  He stays at a cheap hotel for one night  goes to two night clubs  dances with older women  often talks and thinks about sex  even has a prostitute come up to his room Finally  he meets his sister  who tells him she wants to run away with him and that she will never go back to school  Holden sees himself in her  finally changes his mind and decides to go back to his parents  We are able to conclude that Holden then is sent to a mental hospital for treatment I would recommend this book to really good readers because its a difficult book to understand   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior   Sorry John  this is still a great book   This is perhaps one of the most beautiful books I have ever read I think it s a shame so many people misunderstand this book  but I can t say I m terribly surprised  Maybe it s supposed to be misunderstood  it s about a rather misunderstood young man  after all  The most common criticism I hear of this novel is that it s a plotless story about a whiny teenager with few redeeming qualities  I felt the same way the first time I read this book when I was in the 10th grade  The next year though  during a more difficult time in my life  I re read it and was shaken by how strongly I related to it  Holden s story is about coming to terms with adulthood and struggling to make a genuine human connection in a world full of people who are insincere  self centered and have no time or care for others  even when Holden himself demonstrates many of those characteristics  Consequently  his frustration manifests itself as his abrasive  self alienating personality  If I had not read this in school and had not been guided by my extraordinary Honors English teacher  I would have read through this whole novel believing nothing happened  The writing where you wonder why the author put something in there are the places that hold the most meaning  It is a story of a boy afraid of and scornful of the adult world  He wishes that time could be frozen in place  like a museum  but unfortunately that is impossible  Packed with theme and hidden messages  I believe that fully appreciating the story requires great thought and possibly multiple read throughs  I wish that everyone who reads this had my teacher to help him or her  because there are messages that I wouldn t have picked up no matter how many times I read it  The beautiful art and theme of the story makes it one of my favorites   willysbookreviews blogspot comThe Catcher In The Rye was a very unique novel  not the type of book I have read before  It didn t feature a dystopian or Utopian society  but a very interesting novel revolving around the life of Holden Caulfeild You will fall in love with this very obscene story of his life when all goes downhill  Holden hates everything  He does not care what happens in his life  he is a teenager some including I try to be  rebellious Holden is very sarcastic and has to deal with things in his life as a teenager  even though the situations are very mature  Some of which are  sexual frustration  prostitution  debt  tobacco  alcohol  love  role model  and being alone It was awesome to follow him around as he grows as an individual  He goes from avoiding the problem  to going at them head on You will love Salinger s novel  as I did Please visit my book blog willysbookreviews blogspot com I believe that Holden Caulfield is one of the most memorable characters in my reading experience  Nothing about him is particularly original  The sad  lonely  confused adolescent using his intelligence to pose himself as the wizened cynic  I have been Holden  and I believe all of us  for some portion of our lives  have masked great insecurity behind bravado  anger  sarcasm  or plain old rebellion  However  as with all Classics  J D  Salinger executes this truism of human nature flawlessly  The novel is riotously funny and Salinger s gift  maybe his greatest one  is that he allows us to laugh with Holden AND somehow receive the same ephemeral catharses  never permanent  but still a good band aid until maturity arrives  I pick up this novel every few years and enjoy it in a predictably different way  I have  in a sense  grown up with Holden and as I mature  I see his character differently to the exact degree that I have changed  I will probably never put Catcher in the Rye completely to bed because just as Holden cynically analyzes all the banalities and hypocrisy that are inherent in our imperfect world  I see the hurt kid inside him all the more  I see him and am quick to point out that  of course  he is just one big defense mechanism  and for every wall he puts up  I am able to knock one down  I cannot think of higher praise than that  Bravo Mr  Salinger   The Catcher in the Rye By J D  Salinger 277pp  New York  NYBack Bay Books  13 99ISBN  978 0 316 76917 4 The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move        Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   Holden is quite fond of the Museum of Natural History for many reasons  Holden doesn t know how to deal with change and can also be described as a person who is afraid of change  The museum provides him an aspect of life that he can actually comprehend  The museum s display cases were always the same  There is no judgment and difference  Holden however  changed every time he stepped into the museum  Holden longs for a simple life where he doesn t have to deal with changes  something like the display cases  frozen still  Holden Caulfield  the story s main protagonist was expelled from Pencey Prep  a college he attended  Holden often criticizes the students and staff members of Pencey for being  phony   Following a quarrel with his roommate  Holden left the school in the middle of the night  He returns to New York and stays in a hotel  since his family did not yet know about his expulsion  He spent the night dancing with three girls  He even had an awkward encounter with a prostitute  though he did not do anything with her  Holden also ended up at the Museum of Natural History and thinks about the simplicity of the display cases  At last  he slipped into his parent s apartment to check on Phoebe  his younger sister who he loves very much  There  he shares with Phoebe his thoughts as a guardian of children running in a rye field on the edge of a cliff  He would be responsible to catch the children if they happened to wander too far off the precipice  After leaving  he visits his former English teacher and chats with him  Holden was offered to spend the night but leaves after he found the teacher patting his head  Holden then decides to move to the west and when Phoebe finds out  she wanted to go with him  Holden refuses and Phoebe gets upset  Finally  thinking it over  Holden decides not to go after all  At the end  Holden takes Phoebe to a park and watches her ride a carousel with a hint of sorrow and comfort  At this point  Holden stops narrating the story but mentions about him getting sick  living in a mental hospital  and that he will be attending another school during September  He also tells his reader that he missed his roommates and warned them  saying that the same thing could happen to them  I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone because Holden is a very interesting character  He thinks in a very unique way  very different from the typical teenager  He looks really deeply into life and often questions the society that he lives in   The Catcher in the Rye  was also banned when it first came out and is filled with controversy   Where  As I Lay Dying  by William Faulkner is a simple story with a very obvious complicated and depth to its nature   The Catcher in the Rye  is a simple story with an UNDERLYING complicated and depth to its nature  Where  As I Lay Dying  is how the many characters cope deal with Addie s death   The Catcher in the Rye  only suggests that the story is actually about a character s  rather quick  emotional breakdown  It s never obvious  but if you read it as such  it can be very clear that the novel is about how Holden copes deals with his brothers death and how it changes his outlook within society  his relationships with other people   And I did mean his  breakdown   In the beginning of the novel  before I knew of his brothers death  I rather enjoyed Holden s criticisms cynicism  As the novel progressed  I first laughed frequently  then less frequently  and then I found it exhausting  This was before it clicked that my progressive reactions to his criticisms where in response to an actual progression in the criticisms cynicism itself  and I would argue  very intentional  Before his time at the lagoon and again of his brother s death  I didn t quite get how lonely and reactionary Holden was  As I just said  I found Holden s cynicism entertaining and comical  I wanted to meet him  be entertained by him  regardless if I thought he often went too far  Then it hit me  that he might not always have been like that  I m not sure we know exactly when his brother died  but I wonder if he completely changed after that  I didn t care about Holden until the point in the Lagoon  and I do find it hard to care about a character  regardless if I can connect with them  So I appreciate this novel for that  It was a novel that changed HOW I read AS I read  I think that is an amazing feat  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger is about Holden Caulfield  Holden is a sixteen year old minor who has been kicked out of just about all of the prep schools in the New York area  Holden isn t stupid  he reads many books and has always passed English  He just doesn t get interested in the other subjects  and he thinks every school he goes to is filled with phonies  Holden  like the majority of teenagers  is met up with reality  doesn t know where to go or what to do next with his life  When he realizes that reality is trying to tell him it s time to think about his future  grow up  and focus on a good education and job  he does what most teens are known for  Holden runs away from responsibility   With the notification that Holden is going to be kicked out of his school  he decides to leave a few days in advance and plans to stay in New York City for the time being  While in NYC  Holden feels depressed and nostalgic  He tries to ease the depression with drinks at the bar  visits to the club  and smoking through packets of cigarettes   When Holden goes to the bars and clubs he meets up with old friends from all of his past schools  As he and his friends meet up  catch up on things they ve missed  and how things have been going since he left  All of them share their stories  some have graduated  gotten a steady job  doing perfectly well since they last seen each other  Holden realizes they have all moved on with their lives and grown up  He soon stops going to the bars and clubs feeling the growth of his depression  SPOILER Holden decides to run away from everything  move out west  and find the easiest possible job for himself  Before he departs  he decides to say good bye to his little sister Sophie  However  when Holden visits Sophie  she helps him realize to grow up and stop running from problems he faces  She helps him become away that he doesn t have to run away because everything he has is right in front of him  Holden just has to stop focusing on the bad things and appreciate all the good things he has in his life  He doesn t have to run away or go anywhere to find those things in life i actually enjoyed this book  I think that most teens that read this book would very easily mark this book as a 4 5 considering they can relate with Holden every step of the way  However  for adults reading this book  they would most likely disagree with Holden every tread of the way  proclaiming of his naively ways from the way he thinks  acts  and views life  Rating this book all depends on the person who read it  or how your teenage years treated you  haha I Found out about this book because of  the Perk of Being a Wallflower   which is my favorite book  which I think Stephen Chbosky  the author read it and I think he uses the same style as JD Salinger So on the premise the book you can see our main character which is Holden Caulfield  a student who is about to flunk another year at another boarding school which he d done so many times  Although he does flunk many subjects he passed one which is English  He then realized that he need to quit and left the school and wander around  So basically that s the premise  he met a lot of people and even called past friends and acquaintances because he feels alone and depressed at the same time Upon reading this book at first it was very frustrating at some point because I don t really know what the story will take and because the book keeps you reading random things in Holden s life while he narrates past events  I do like the realness of it all and I found it emotional at some parts  This book will teach you the painfulness of growing up  innocence and adulthood I gave this book at first 3 then 4 then 5 because I think the formula of this book is that you need to really understand the message of what Holden is trying to tell you  and believe me it s hard while reading it because the nature of Holden which is witty and have a phony quality  But I do gave it a 5 because it s classic guys and I do really get Holden s point of view towards meeting different people  it s just me   HAVE FUN READING  I really liked this book  I liked this book because I thought that it was really well writen  This is a book that my friend recommended to me and now I can see why it was recommended to me  This is definatly a book that I would recommend to my friends  I would recommend this book to my friends because its a book about this guy that is in college at the beginning of the book then as the book grows so does that man  Its a great read about life basically and how you shouldn t grow up too fast  To enjoy life while your young and dont let yourself grow up too fast  Dont get caught up in be an adult  What i found that was intresting about this book was that the narrator was a guy but how he told the story  it sounded like the book was written from a girls prespective  YOUR GUYS SHOULD DEFINATLY READ THIS BOOK  ITS A FIVE STAR BOOK  This one hit close to home for me and actually I think it does for everyone else too   no matter how exaggerated the comparison may be  Holden Caulfield is confused and alone despite the fact that he had many people in his life  most of whom try to lead or guide him at some point  Holden is most likely suffering from PTSD and or depression but doesn t completely realise this and is in denial  His story encompasses a journey throughout New York back in the 40 s where Holden struggles with growing up  losing his innocence and coping with mental illness  The Catcher in the Rye is a classic coming of age story that focuses on more than just discovering the opposite sex and having homework problems  It s a complex story that shows a person s teenage years are often the most difficult and destructive part of their life  Catcher is timeless as it s themes has rung true for teenagers and young adults for decades  I m very thankful for having been recommended this book and I recommend it to anyone else who s young and needs to be reassured they re not just some stupid kid with problems that don t matter  I would also recommend it to anyone who likes throwing around the phrase  yeah well there s dying kids in Africa  or something similar to belittle the problems of others and frankly  just shut them up   If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  This first paragraph made me fall in love for the book in the library  It was the first time something like this happened to me  I finished reading David Copperfield a week ago  and this made me laugh so hard for being so accurate and true  that I knew for sure that this would be a hell of a reading  And it was  Seventeen year old Holden Caulfield has just been kicked out of his fourth school  After a huge discussion with his friend  Stradlater  and just waiting for his parents to know he had been kicked out  in order to go home  he gets out earlier of the school to spend the whole weekend wandering in the city  thinking about his own life and the future  During these days we learn all about the life and thoughts of Holden  He deals with several situations and shows us his own opinion about them  He isn t afraid of saying what he thinks  and he ends up criticizing society in a very ironic and funny way  No one can imagine how much I laughed with this book   The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to ve met each other  Which always kills me  I m always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  I didn t agree with Holden in everything  though  There were some situations where he was just a moron and I only had his vision of things  the book isn t unbiased in that sense  Oh  and he lies and swears a lot  so I end up thinking if some situations were exactly as he was describing them    This book is just amazing  This inner ride Holden does from the beginning until the end of the book  in order to find himself  well  everyone should read it  I highly recommend it Holden Caulfield  you killed me  Define Regret  not reading The Catcher in The Rye as a teenager  The Book is a Masterpiece  in My Opinion  i guess its pretty much like marmite  either you hate it or love it  You can t help but feel related to Caulfield s frustration of personal dreams and fantasies against society s expectations of what a man s life ought to be  On a personal level  i felt relatable to many of Caulfield Struggles  be it  Academic Failure  rebellion  immaturity  and reluctance to change  I believe we all had that Living in a cabin in the wood sort of fantasy that Society eventually crushed and declared  Irrational   This book would ve made even much more sense to me if I read it as a Teenager  Note  The book hasn t any actual plot  it s mainly the Antagonist s narration of his life and incidents that took place in a couple of days  which

them all about a goddam football game   That s the trouble with these intellectual guys  They never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it   it s really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs    The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one    Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   After completing  To Kill a Mockingbird  and loving it I decided to try out another acclaimed American classic  That is how I stumbled upon  Catcher in the Rye   What makes this book special is not the vivid scenery Salinger creates for the readers  or the intriguing events keeping you turning page after page  Those are just bonuses  its the wonderfully flawed Holden Caulfield that J D  Salinger introduces us to as we follow him along the gloomy winter of New York city  Sure I may have bin a bit annoyed by Holden s phrases like  phony  or other slightly annoying word choice  But otherwise this book was without flaws and enjoyable throughout  Taking this all to mind  I strongly suggest reading J D  Salinger s American masterpiece  I m not sure if I m glad or annoyed I didn t read this when I was younger  But now that I ve read it  I realise that some other books I have really enjoyed star protagonists who are a lot like Holden Caulfield   In  The Catcher in the Rye   there was a boy  whose name was Holden Caulfield  he had a negative thought of the world  He was anxious and suffering an identity crisis  Finally  he ran away from home  but no one took care of him at outside of home  Even some people stole his money and betrayed him  There was his sister whose name was Phoebe  she was only one person who believed her brother  Holden  When Phoebe met Holden  she said to him   Tell me one thing you love   Holden relied   I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  From the book    This is why this title of book is  The Catcher in the Rye    As readers  we can see that Holden s alienation is the cause of most of his pain  He never addresses his own emotions directly  nor does he attempt to discover the source of his troubles  He desperately needs human contact and love  but his protective wall of bitterness prevents him from looking for such interaction  Alienation is both the source of Holden s strength and the source of his problems   For example  his loneliness propels him into his date with Sally Hayes  but his need for isolation causes him to insult her and drive her away  Similarly  he longs for the meaningful connection he once had with Jane Gallagher  but he is too frightened to make any real effort to contact her  He depends upon his alienation  but it destroys him  Some other people claim that Holten is just some moron who is spoiled and rude  but for some reason  these people can t see that they themselves are oversimplifying him  just like Holten does to others  He is not just some deviant  he has a wide array of thoughts  qualities  and emotions  Holden spends his whole life idealizing childhood innocence and believing all adults to be phonies  He alienates himself through lies and deception  convincing himself that he is above their  phonyness   He oversimplifies people because he is afraid of the complexities of the adult world  This book teaches us not to be afraid of the unknown  to truly investigate our own modes of thinking  It shows that we must learn not to build a barrier between ourselves and others and that we can trust others to catch us when we fall  Personally  this book has inspired me not to judge people so broadly  taught me that I should get to know someone before I criticize them  It has also helped me realize that I am not the only one who sometimes feels alone and different from regular people  I know I m not your typical teenage girl  I have realized my thought processes to be much different than those of my peers  but reading from Holden s perspective gives me hope  His outlandish values and morals prove him to be  deep down  an inquisitive and innocent young adult  similar to how I think of myself  This book has helped me to better grasp an idea of who I am as well as how I come off to others and how I can better myself  And for that  I am truly grateful   Having read it twice  I guess I m still not quite sure what it s all about  But I love the way Salinger writes his books  There is always something special in them    I think sometimes it is important to look at the time period a book is published and see what the author may have been trying to say in terms of current social norms of that time  I think this book came out in the 50 s  I believe the 50s was a period of  repression   and depression was a stigma  much more than it is now  Holden is disconnected and struggling to find  his place  in society  and in the end  he has a nervous breakdown I think at the time this book came out  as well as TODAY even  some people come away with  wow  Im not the only person who feels that way   And on some basic human level   we all need to be reminded of that from time to time  delete I don t think I ve ever related to a character like I have to Holden  Throughout reading the book I couldn t stop imagining me in his place  he went to a great school and didn t do so well like I do  I mean  I do okay  but not great  The thing that killed me though was his relation with his sister  Phoebe  It s so much like the one I have with my sister  and I love her so much  at the end of the book it s Phoebe that gets him to stay  I ve thought about leaving a lot of times  just driving and not stopping  but it s always my little sister that helps me stay  I don t know what I would do if I couldn t see her  and I can t even think about what it would do to her if I did leave   I loved it  I m not too crazy about classic literature  but I felt that this was an easy read  I finished it in 3 sittings and found my self too engrossed with it that I finally had to stop everything and finish it It seemed that all creative people will endure a form of existential crisis and such crisis shares distinct familiarity in this modern world  Especially when you are young and understands it but your youthful sanity is rejecting the indoctrination of society s etiquette and dogmas I think the whole book could be summed up by the quote  The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   and  you ll begin to know your true measurements  and dress your mind accordingly     I loved this book  this book taught me about how kids live about their lives  For example  in this book  Holden is constantly learning how to live his life  He always tells himself that he will do something  but eventually  he doesnt  Holden was about to move in the end of the book  but he is too much of a kid and he doesnt do it  I would recommend this book because it shows the reactions of different people  This book would be good for people who likes to read about confidence and much more  Holden in this book has no confidence after he left Pencey  During his living in Pencey  he doesnt even think about fighting Stradlater but he does it  Truly is my favourite book  and I didn t even have a favourite book until this one  I read it in English class  so was forced to look for the messages and symbols throughout the book  but so thankful that I did  Holden s views and opinions and everlasting desire to stay young and simple minded truly did inspire me and was something I was able to relate to  Since reading it for the first time in class I ve read it twice  all in less than a year  Really is the type of book that  not in a bad way  has absolutely no plot whatsoever  and I feel that you could put it down after you ve finished a chapter and pick it up a year later just because you don t read this book for the drama or the climax  you read it to get inside the mind of a conflicted yet sure of himself teenage boy Really a refreshing take on the whole  teenage angst trying to find himself  type of book  because I feel like all of the books that try to do that today are just too fluffy and almost in a way too descriptive  Catcher kept me guessing about what was going to happen next and about Holden  I didn t learn everything I needed to know in the first chapter like in most books  It never went  I m Holden  I m rich  I got kicked out of a bunch of prep schools and I don t even care   Each time I read it I still try to figure out if he does care  if he suffers from any mental illnesses  or if he just feels completely lost and misunderstood  For these reasons I think this book is great for so many people because it can be interpreted so many different ways All in all  just really love this book  I understand it s a love hate sort of thing  but I m definitely a lover  The book of everyone s life  except Lennon s  hehe I read this book due to the fact that my mother had read it when she was about 14 and told me she really loved it  so I figured why not give it a shot  because mother s know best right   and I can tell you I am In love with this book  Holden Caulfield is a great representation of a alienated teen who is trying to figure out who he is and what he wants his life to become  He goes through anger and the feeling that nobody understands him  Which we can all say we ve been through in different periods of our life s  He picks out the flaws in society and by reading this book and going through his perspective all he really wants is for someone to understand him   Which I think we all do  I ve heard from various people that from when they read it at about my age  13  then had re read it when they were about twenty or so that the book had whole new meaning to them so I am truly excited to re read this years from now and see what it means to me then   I thought that I will never enjoy this book the moment I started reading it but once I got to know Holden better and understand him  I discovered that from all of the characters in the different books that I got to meet  my heart goes out with him the most  It was like I m watching a part of me in the past as I read his story Then there are the touching parts with his little sister  I love it  I also love how he view things in his life  I know know why a lot of teenagers can relate to this book  though I m not a teenager anymore  I still could relate   I m so glad I was able to read this book  The Catcher in the Rye seems to be a polarizing novel  People either love it or they hate it  I loved the book  It is quite evident from the beginning of the book that Holden is truly an unwell young man  He is shattered by the loss of his beloved brother and reeling with his unreconciled grief  He not only mourns his brother but also mourns the loss of his innocence  We all go through a loss of innocence as we reach adulthood  which I believe is the reason some teachers hope this book resonates with their students  However  I think many high school students who read the book may not be mature enough to understand that Holden is not in his right mind throughout the novel  He is clearly on a destructive path  making erratic decisions and exhibiting strange behaviors  Many other reviews on Goodreads com seem to describe Holden as a whining complainer  Nevertheless  his feelings of hopelessness and disillusionment are the process of his downward spiral to a nervous breakdown  and therefore  are not the words of a mere complainer  I am sure that if I had read The Catcher in the Rye in high school  I would not have had the same understanding and appreciation of Holden Caulfield  Now  however  since I have more varied life experiences  I strongly empathized with Holden  This novel resonated with me in an impactful manner  This book is oddly funny  written from a teenager s standpoint  I laughed out loud  many many  many times  I felt the author was able to capture what goes on in the mind of a teenage boy very very well  It took me a long time to read it  because by the middle  it felt like it was going nowhere and I had to put it down  The writing style is the same from beginning to end   so maybe a bit monotonous but then that s what keeps you hooked till the end  Because it is so funny  You will be smiling from the very beginning to the end  if not laughing  One of my all time favorites and my go to book when I need a dose of laughter  It s my pick me up when I m feeling blue  Fifty years after it was first published and thirty  something  years after I first readThe Catcher in The Rye  I decided to reread it to see if it had the same impact as the first time  Holden Caufield s lost weekend in New York seemed so risque and daring when I read it as a teenager  I was most impressed with the language he used and wished that I could be as fast and loose with my language  Thirty years later does add some perspective and in view of language use today  The Catcher in the Rye seems awfully mild  Holden is obviously an imperfect and confused hero in search of finding his way in the adult world which he both covets and despises  He is not well equipped for this quest  frequently failing to communicate is desires and feelings to the world around him  Caufield s pathetic attempts to communicate and involve himself with others leads him into further isolation Holden Caufield  the teenager created by J D  Salinger is a strangely vulnerable young man at odds with the phonies of the earth  After being expelled from one more prep school Caufield gathers his resources and spends a weekend in New York City before planning to return home  Caufield is an amusing and obsessive youth who has an opinion about everything  Holden a disorganized and directionless dweeb is true to his own values and morals  He is loyal to those he loves and cares for his sister Phoebe and friend Jane  while despising those who do not live up to his standards If you have not read this book it is high time to give it a try   Dude  I liked this book  I would have guessed that a stream of consciousness adolescent angst book would have really annoyed me but truly I really dug it  It s stream of consciousness but boldly coherent and internal but not overwrought or tortured  instead  I feel like the point of view and style lends a great honesty and purity to the story  Holden is refreshing and honestly  even hopeful  I feel like his formation is clearly progressive and left labeled  unfinished  and  immature  which means we know he s only just begun  Viva la revolution  May we all preserve in our adult minds Holden s annoyance with the phony  appreciation for the small things and compassion for the hurting  I get why this is the flagship novel of youth  We need a copy to live at our house  Holden is an obnoxious  negative teenage dropout who looks at the world with the cynicism of a jaded old f ck  Salinger manages perfectly to get inside the head of this kid and describes the adolescent view on the world as if he was a 16 year old himself  using a no nonsense style  spiced up with plenty of foul language It doesn t take much imagination to understand why this book caused a bit of a stir when it was originally released in 1951  Sadly  people have become far more offensive than old Holden nowadays  making it more difficult to fully grasp the importance of this book I liked it though  When I first saw the cover and the title  I thought   This is going to be depressing  Save it for the last   so I didn t even bother too look for the PDF e pub version of it  for a long time  and told myself I would read it only if I already take a hold of the real book Boy  how I was wrong Here  have Holden Caulfield  As far as I know  he could be a mind twin for Percy Jackson  only a little bit sarcastic and depressed and rebellious and all    or not  He is more than it  for Wikipedia quoted him as  Since the book s publication  Holden has become an icon for teenage rebellion and angst  and now stands among the most important characters of 20th century American literature   Well now  that says a lot  This is a refreshing  really   I remember reading this book for the first  not because I wanted to read it but I wanted to know what all the fuss was about  I wanted to know why so many schools and libraries had banned this book when it came out in 1951  I loved Holden Caulfield and this quote  Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everyone if they start to go over the cliff I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   And this one  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much though   I have to say that this is one of my all time favorite books  You have to read it to understand   Termine   The Catcher in the Rye    de J D  Salinger  Se resume en lo que atraviesa un pibe de 17 anos cuando lo expulsan de la escuela Tiene momentos de mucha depresion  duda de un adolescente con miedo al futuro y con nada en el presente y humor acido Esta repleto de personajes que aparecen de la nada y desaparecen rapidamente y de lugares que visita el protagonista  Holden Caulfield Holden es un chico insolente sin ganas de nada  que ama muchisimo a pocas cosas y odia muchisimo a   todo Dos cosas que sorprendieron  primero que esta escrito de la manera mas simple posible y  segundo  la capacidad de observacion de Salinger Desarrolla sobre la falsedad  amor odio  hipocresia  mujeres  estudio  el no futuro viable  moral y hasta como da la mano una persona No hay mensaje oculto  la cruda realidad de un adolescente profundamente deprimido que se siente al costado de la sociedad esta a la vista Es de lo mejor que lei en los ultimos tiempos  No lo recomiendo  los obligo a que lo lean  Resena escrita originalmente para Twitter  I loved this book  It really struck a chord with me because I can relate with it so easily  and so can hundreds of thousands of other people  It is one of the most well written books I have read simply because of it s style how unconventional whole thing is  This book is so universal that almost anyone can find something in this book that really speaks too them  It was such a fun read that even though I read a school copy when i read it the first time  I went and purchased my own copy and read it all over again  I highly recommend this novel for anyone and if it s on a required reading list for school  don t wait to read it in class  go out on your own and read it first   Holden Caulfield is one of those characters that I d just wish if they were real so I can meet him and listen to his nonsense and very entertaining stories and that was pretty much the book and I really liked it even though it was pointless somehow  because in the end Holden had just left the party and the stories were over and I was pretty bummed because I didn t want the book to end  I found the book a bit deep sometimes  there were these paragraphs that you would just and read and then stop to think about them for a while and sometimes it was relatable And Holden was actually a decent guy who d just though the whole world was phony  Which is true  and he didn t want to be a part of this big  Corny  show  I loved that about his character and I enjoyed each time he used the phrase  Goddamn it  that was another thing I liked about the book it didn t seem like the author was trying to make it sound like a story when it was just a fictional writing  but it actually did feel like it was real and that you were just listening to good old Holden talking The funny part is that when I came to think of Holden s character in a way that if it was a real one  I would ve probably thought that he was a phony liar haha  but it doesn t seem like this when you read the book  you get to know him for real   I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean  except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What Ihave to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye    Holden Caulfield Holden dazzles in this  Always thought so  He has such a strange and peculiar accuracy  if that makes any sense  He says things and then you re all   Oh yeah  weird way of putting it  but that s dead on   I loved his narration and oddball comments  Clearly he s not a reliable narrator  and I believe it makes the story even more clever   I would give this book 10 stars if I could  I certainly didn t want the story to end  Holden s sarcastic humor and his take on phoney  pretentious people was so very relatable  I think it s safe to say that I ve fallen in love with Holden Caulfield and his red hunting cap  So it s been about 15  years since I first read this one  and I still love it love it love it  I know that you re supposed to identify with HC when you re that angsty 17 year old adolescent  but sadly  I think I can empathize with him now more than ever  Oh  and I get it now  This book is so so so funny  The third time I read it  and it is still my favorite book of all time  This is the story of Holden Caufield  Holden has just been kicked out of school  again  But to avoid his parents noticing  he spends three days on the streets of New York City  This book is less about what Holden does and more about what Holden thinks and feels  He is a boy trapped between adulthood and childhood not wanting to grow up  The reason I love this book is that I was Holden  and in some ways I still am Holden  I want to have and do the things adults do and have  but like Holden I am afraid of the responsibilities and monotony of adulthood  I would argue that this is one of the best books ever written  This is definitely one of the all time classics  Just finished re reading it  again   When I started reading this book  I did not like it at all and found it painful to read  I soldiered on  reading a chapter a day  if I read it all  I do not know how many days it took  but I soon found myself transfixed  I must think now that this book is the work of genius  I was not pleased with how it ended  but I must admit if I am fair  that may only be beacause it had ended at all  I think the more time that passes the more I will come to marvel at this book  Holden s voice is quite extraordinary  Salinger captures something so true and right  I found myself trying to diagnose Holden  as something was clearly off about him  while at the same time feeling that I was Holden  that we all are Holden  An author who can create a character who seems so counter cultural and yet also captures some common piece of the human condition is a genuis indeed   Although published and set in the 1950s  the misadventures and alienation of 16 year old Holden Caulfield aren t hard to relate to  After being expelled from his boarding school in Pennsylvania  Holden runs home to New York three days early  to spend the rest of the semester in freedom before his parents realize he s been thrown out  Stretched out to a whole 214 pages  those three days are filled with countless encounters with sleazy bar owners   phonies   and a motley collection of old school friends  But during the course of running from all of his misfortunes  Holden realizes that what he is really running from is his adulthood  Holden s constant flashbacks  stream of consciousness  and distrust of the adult world can be confusing and difficult to follow  And because of the protagonist s use of  obscene  language  there has been much controversy over whether or not this book is appropriate for children  But  in my honest opinion  that would be a terrible waste of excellent literature  This book is one of few that really and truly convey the sentiment of adolescence  and that so many people can connect with  And as Holden would say  this book really  killed me   Holden Caulfield is the only teenager whom I d listen to complain about things  Him and his  vomity chairs  and  sexy  things  tee hee  This book will always have a place in my heart   Clasico imprescindible  tanto si eres adolescente como si dejaste de serlo  Hay que leerla  amigos  asi  sin excusas  Resena completa  http   www libros prohibidos com j d     An absolute classic  This book was one of the first experiences I had in reading where I thought that some people s brains actually were as  nutty  and busy as my own brain  My ever favorite book  I loooveeeee this book  I even researched the song catcher in the rye so I can fully understand this Planning to read it again     Holden Caulfield through passing the sensitive age of young adulthood  questions the very world of his and everybody sad exhausted tired and frustrated  while being a run away he is searching for an answer a cure and a path to his long time questions feeling alone and very lonely in his way he knows deep inside that something is not right I know this is insane for me to love this book so much but I truly did though at the beginning I was feeling exactly the opposite in the end I wanted to hold it in my arms like a teddy bear it spoke my heart and sometimes I even felt as if I m the narrator now if you think I m crazy or anything I don t blame you I swear I m a madwoman  Holden esta convencut que el seu pas cap al mon adult es de regressio i s aferra tant com pot a la seva infantesa  que esta lliure d hipocresia  responsabilitats i normes  Per aixo estima tant a Phoebe  perque es l unic fil que l uneix amb la seva infancia De l adolescencia  unicament en valora la llibertat que  durant aquests tres dies en fa un abus excessiu  El seu desig es constantment fer el que li doni la gana  fer coses incoherents molts cops  les quals explica al lector  com en una mena de confessio i se sent avergonyit en multiples ocasions dels seus errors i de les seves estupideses que explica per sentir se millor El vocabulari es molt limitat  i te un estil nervios i insegur en el que es repeteixen paraules constantment  El protagonista esta carregat de manies i es passa la major part del relat insultant  criticant i fent retrets  Fa us de paraules malsonants i fortes que utilitza com a escut protector  El fet que el llenguatge sigui tan limitat no es cap defecte  sino una manera d acostar se mes al lector  Tambe fa que el protagonista quedi perfectament caracteritzat amb el personatge del jove rebel El fragment de la novel la que mes m ha agradat  juntament amb l escena final  es quan Phoebe li pregunta   Que t agradaria ser    Saps aquella canco si un cos agafa un cos quan ve pel camp de segol     M agradaria      Es si un cos troba un cos quan ve pel camp de segol  Es un poema  D en Robert Burns    Em pensava que era si un cos agafa un cos    Es igual  m imagino tot ple de nanos petits  i no hi ha ningu  ningu gran  vull dir    nomes jo  I m estic just a la vora d un precipici altissim  El que haig de fer es agafar tothom que estigui a punt de caure pel precipici    vull dir que si algu corre i no mira cap a on va  haig de sortir d algun lloc i agafar lo  No faria res mes en tot el dia  Seria el vigilant en el camp de segol  Ja se que es una bogeria  pero es l unica cosa que m agradaria saber de debo  Ja se que es una bogeria   Es increible aquest fragment  Crec que Salinger vol simbolitzar la proteccio de la infantesa on la felicitat es absoluta i plena  i el precipici representa el mon de la hipocresia i la malicia en el que el protagonista viu Aquest llibre es un dels que mes m ha agradat  es molt especial  This book is often read due to some sort of an assignment from school  but unlike many other books that are assigned from school this was very enjoyable  It sparks up ideas about the true meaning of life and the people you meet  Holden Caulfield sees everyone he meets as  phony  and only possessing selfish intentions  He can only find something pure in Phoebe    his sister that he truly admires  It creates questions like are humans truly phony  People always change themself to impress others  Are humans truly selfish  If you think about it  humans can be selfish because many aren t satisfied with what is given to them  They only want more and more  This book raises questions  but doesn t answer them  It is up to the reader to fufill that task  This book is for one who is willing to answer the questions that Holden asks  It can apply to everyone  but normally to the older audience   Si bien el final me quedo a deber un poco  todo apuntaba a un violento  o al menos vesanico desenlace   The Catcher in the Rye es una de las mejores   bildungsroman   que he leido hasta el momento  Holden Caulfield es una suerte de arquetipo de la adolescencia estadounidense  Su hambre de sinceridad y el odio a los farsantes y pretenciosos que lo rodean   sin importar si son companeros de escuela  maestros  vecinos  etc    son los motores que lo impulsan a abandonar el colegio y a vivir dos dias delirantes y al borde de la demencia  con lo que se da cuenta de que debe tambien  sin exito  abandonar su vida acaudalada  El lenguaje de Salinger  no tan minucioso o erudito  es sin embargo el mas exacto para un adolescente de dieciseis anos  certero  filoso y con grandes momentos de ironia y humor negro  I wasn t going o start this review like this but I guess I should because I just read the other ones that gave the book stars rang from 1 to 3  1  I do indetify with Holden 2  No  it s not because I see myself as a noble worrier who defies society nor because I m sixteen  I m a 22 year old med student  in fact  3  I do see J  D Salinger as a genius  4  No  it s not because he  gets  it Now  let s start the review properly   oh and if it s not obvious  spoilers ahead  I started reading this book just because John Green talked about it once and since I m not American it was the first time I heard of it  I didn t know what I expected before reading  I just saw it was short and so started reading in the hopes I can finish it fast and watch John s video  but it completely blew me away  I can t even think of the book or Holden  for that matter  without sniffing my tears  It depresses me  it really does  As Holden would say  I finished the book today and read a lot of analysis for it  I wasn t surprised that it raised a lot of eyebrows back in the fifties for its language use  In fact  I have to say that I hated Holden at first  His repetitive use of  sort of    it kills me    it really does   and so many other of those catchphrases of his just stepped on my nerves  and I came close to stop reading because of them  Now  I can t think of them without wanting to cry  He just wanted to be listened to and to distan himself from pain  I didn t get it except by the end when he ffinally found someone to listen to him other than his little sister and found that the man was actually in fact a possible pervert before telling us that he  Holden  was repeatedly sexually abused in his childhood  Holden wasn t a normal teenager with natural adulthood fear  like some people who hate on the book sometimes suggest   He was broken  Too broken  in fact  that it affected him and his relationship with others and his fear of losing innocence for him and others came from the that  Not from being not listed to alone  I think Salinger made sure of that because of what he himself saw in the war and how that made him lose his innocence and see others innocence being taken away from them  He knew what life does to people like Holden  Life doesn t ruin them but kills them entirly  Now that I ve said that  I do have to admit that part of the reason the book affected me so much was the fact that I didn t realize how much my current self and past Hilden have in common  And I use my current self here because it s only recently that I ve started asking myself the questions Holden was so tortured by  or maybe still was by the end of the book  I felt with him and cried with him  I felt depressed with him because I know what s like to fear adulthood   Of course I m comparing myself here loosely to Holden as I  thankfully  weren t abused as he has been   especially now that I m only now  at 22  realizing that being an adult doesn t just mean getting to be responsible for myself  but having to ask difficult questions about who I am and where I m going  About not what I was welling to do to be a  successful  adult  but what MY definition of a  successful  adult was really  I have a rule of not re reading books I have read because    it really spoils the joy of them for me  I don t know  but for some reason I never find myself able to open a book and read it as if it was the first time and read it form start to finish  Maybe go through the it but not really read it all over again    Anyway  I think I m going to have to break this rule with Catcher In The Rye  Maybe it s the fact that I ve hated Holden so much for more than the first half of the book and only kept reading because one of my favorite authors recommend it  Or maybe because I only realized how much  in fact  I liked Holden for being unlikable  especially at first when he was so misunderstood by us  readers who just got to know him from stories he didn t seem to care a lot about telling or even about the people who were in them  if that makes sense   or the people he so desperatly seeked their attention to just listen to him  I liked Holden because  and I m quoting John green here   I regret to inform you that you are also unlikable  So am I  There s this weird but pervasive feeling in the world of contemporary coming of age fiction that characters ought to be either the person you wanna be or the person you wanna be with  and I m happy to acknowledge that Holden Canfield is not the guy you wanna be or wanna be with  He is not Edward Cullen  But he is the guy you secretly know yourself to be  which  I would argue  in the end much more interesting  And I agree  Holden is the person we all secretly are  Or at least the person I think I secretly am  I only found that recently and words express how this book helped me deal with it  D  J Salinger says that he wanted to be the catcher in the rye because he wanted to save the children who were playing in there and prevent them from being hurt or falling over  The truth is he has  For me  And propably for many others as well  I no longer fear adulthood  or maybe not it the way I did  Holden  by the end of the book  stands and watches Pheobe runs round and round and then he gets happy and doesn t know why  But I have to agree with John Green s analysis here when he said that Holden really changed in that moment realizing that time wasn t this straight line  but a circle going from and getting back to innocence he so desperatly wanted to protect  I think I m not there yet to fully understand that  I hope I do someday  but until then I can at least deal with the things that I fear in this phase I m in by reading and re reading this incredible book I realize there s many many more to the book than my memory serves me to write about  Like how it was kind of partially Holden s fault that he wasn t being listened to  He didn t know how to ask  But then a year later he manages to and finally gets us to care and empathize with him  He found his way into us and made us feel everything he felt  That s what s so magical about this book  and books in general in fact  for me and that s yet another reason I liked this book and Holden himself  The power of literature  The power of metaphors and the passive voice Holden liked so much to use   This book is a gem that I can t believe I just found   Quien ha hecho mas dano a Salinger no han sido sus enemigos sino sus fans acerrimos  No todos  pero si aquellos que solo han leido  El guardian entre el centeno  y han elevado a Holden Caufield a la altura de un heroe digno de imitar  Pero Holden es un pringado  un inmaduro que se cree muy especial  un amargado infeliz  Y creo que Salinger lo sabe perfectamente y que su intencion nunca fue que Holden se convirtiera un un modelo que varias generaciones idolatrarian  Dicho todo esto creo que  El guardian  tiene que leerse desde cierta distancia y tomandoselo con algo de la ironia que se gana con la experiencia  Creo que es entonces cuando mejor es  Aun asi  las dos primeras veces que lo lei  lo lei desde las entranas  Este libro llego en el momento adecuado y me ayudo y nunca se lo podre agradecer lo suficiente  Puede que sea en parte por esto que intento justificarlo tiniendolo de una nostalgica y melancolica ironia  Y es que no es un libro perfecto  pero es un libro maravilloso  Es un libro intenso como pocos  Al fin y al cabo es puro angst adolescente  Y esto no es su mayor defecto  sino su mayor virtud  Y todos alguna vez hemos sido Holden Caufield  Quien diga que no miente   The Catcher in The Rye starts out giving the impression that Holden Caufield is an angry individual  He seems to despise so many things about those around him  It seems that he is irritated by their personalities and feels that he is better than them in many ways  As I continued to read  it became more apparent that the characteristics that he found irritating about others  were to avoid the awareness of his internal self loathing  He is a troubled character  brilliant but unable to put his talents to good use  He is socially awkward and completely unsure of himself  although he would want the reader to think otherwise   It becomes clear that he is searching to find himself  people that accept and understand him and that he is holding on to the childlike innocence of the world that is no longer in existence now that he has entered adulthood  I found this book to be intriguing because the character had a strong internal conflict and developed throughout the novel  While many of the events did not tie together to form a clear plot  it was obvious that the story is more about the character and his internal journey more so than the actual events that take place  Each person that enters his life represents a part of his life that he becomes challenged to deal with on a mature level  He finds everyone around him to be  phony  and for this reason struggles to build relationships  The more I understood the character  the more I felt sorry for him  He feels uncomfortable in the world around him and does not know how to handle it  The chapters are short so it was easy to find a stopping point  The language is rich but not difficult  The only thing I didn t like about it  were that many story lines went unanswered  I wanted to know what happened with some of the girls and friends in his life  Because he did not resolve many of his conflicts  I was left to believe that he was continually conflicted  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys deep character development  it not afraid to read mild profanity or adult content  and who has ever felt like the world around them does not understand them  While reading  The Catcher in the Rye  i went through a strange part of my life  I could relate to the character very well because I was very annoyed by my classmates and my teachers  I think Mr Salinger illustrated the protagonists feelings in a fresh and relatable kind of way  His style of writing was different to other authors I ve read before and I have to admit his kind of writing is very close to mine  Therefore I loved what he did  how he descriped all the happenings and everything around the story  I also love the time where this story is set  All in all it was a lovely book and I think I can say it s now my favourite book  Thank you Salinger for your work  This is the craziest and strangest book i have ever read  It has no end and not even a beginning  This is beautiful  I can t put this into words but i truly loved this book  That kind of things cheer me up  when i find something exactly the way i want it to be  i wanted it to distract me to fill me up with something i don t even know  to know a story with all it s details and not being able to tell it i just know it  love it and memorize it by heart  Holden Caulfield is such a stange fella  He is confused and he hates everything and everyone from time to time and he doesn t like studying but he loves reading and he aces his English classes  which is to say the only class he passes since he s been kicked out of every school he s gone to  He doesn t abide by rules and he certainly doesn t like to do what he s told But what he really is  he s a sweetheart and very smart and a very simple person  if you ask me  He keeps calling everyone  phony  and yes they are  We sometimes all are  We keep doing things that doesn t have a meaning or a cause but they give pleasure to us because we  most surely  are vain and we like being flattered and we like people congratulating us when all we should really want is to be happy and help people What Holden wants is to help people  He says he just pictures little kids playing in a big field of rye and he is the only big and he is standing on the edge of some cliff and what he has to do is to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  He just wants to be the catcher in the rye  It s the only thing he d really like to do What I concluded from the ending is that Holden eventually gets cancer  like his big brother Allie  who died of leukemia  What I realized reading this book is that we shouldn t always think of the future  of our future  but that we should probably seize the day and live in the present  not in the future and certainly not in the past  I feel like I don t read enough because almost every book I m reading lately I rate 4 or 5 stars  But maybe I m jus  reading real good books   3 hmm  Maybe I ll never know  But really this is a good book guys  Yeah  I m not good at reviews  Oh hey but listen to this yo   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it SAME Anyway I could meet J D  Salinger but I think I d also like to meet Holden  It would be great  we d either fall in love or be best friends  Or I d tell him to call up Jane Gallagher even if he doesn t feel like it  I hope he wouldn t hate me  You know yo  I feel like I m not a phony but I could appear that way  I kept thinking about how maybe sometimes even Holden appears that way to people  Maybe the world is full of a lot more genuine people than we think but they just sometimes sell themselves short and act like what they think a normal or kind or cool person is  I definitely think I do that  Hey before I end this awkward review I want to say the language in this book was really fantastic  It sounded like Holden and I were just talking the whole book  I wanted to read this book because I saw it on a table when I was at a really awful camp over the summer  I knew it was someone else s but I didn t think they d care  I opened it up and read a few pages  It was weird and shocking and new and I was really excited to go home and read  The Catcher in the Rye   Ahh  Those few pages didn t have a lot of plot  this whole book doesn t   not in a bad way though  but I just felt like some was talking to me and it was special  Probably especially because I was at this camp where hardly anyone would talk to me  It really is good  I would suggest that you read it if you haven t     I actually truly enjoyed this book  The thing I liked most was J D  Salinger s writing style  It made the novel a much faster read  I also enjoyed the main character  Holden Caulfied  outlook on life  At times he was sort of depressed and unhappy  but he also realizes that the simple things in life may be the best things  Some people may think this book is a bit crude  but it is just so real and relatable that it is not only an American classic  but a great read  I would recommend this book to teens  because it relates to some of the feelings and struggles that teenagers go through  I would recommend it to people who have more of a dry sense of humor  People who enjoy classics or books in older time periods would like this book   In the beginning of the book  it appears to be at  In Media Res   starting with the protagonist Holden telling about his life so far without introducing himself to the readers  This is unique due to how our protagonist just moves on to his story and slowly gives more about himself throughout the novel  What I also enjoy is the fact of Salinger s word choice throughout the plot of the story and how he makes Holden make up lies to make the reader laugh  This novel was extremely fascinating because Holden brings up the fact of how the world is really today and how no one has ever noticed until now   Catcher in the Rye   truly teaches young readers how impure the world really his with the example of Holden not being able to erase the scratched profanity on the wall of a school his sister goes to  Holden also brings up that he wants to stop children to reach adulthood due to the claim of adults being impure and how they are the cause of it  He later finds out that he is unable to do this because he is the only one to do so  This message stands out to me because it is asking readers to be the change in the world and to make it pure again   Holden disagreeing with impurity is also ironic because he s the one using profanity and talking about adultery and how he also complains about being alone  Holden being alone is one of the reasons why he is unable to let go of his childish mindset and so he acts as if the world is so simple until he sees the scratched in word  Not only is  Catcher in the Rye  extremely hilarious but it is also is depressing  Holden mentions his brother Ali who died and so it leads the reader to understand why Holden acts the way he does  Ultimately this book teaches young adults who read this book that the world isn t as perfect as what it seems and that it is hard to get over tragedy   Don t judge a book because school has their curriculum set to read these books  This book is great  I ve finished it in a day and I absolutely enjoyed it   hwldn khlfyld  jwny z dyr syr dr dnyy bh Gyt shkhSy khwysh st  b hjmh y z ntqdt ryz w

around    tudo fazia sentido  Depois  reli aos dezoito  Pode se dizer que a minha adolescencia ainda tem apelo por toda a intensidade e blablabla  Mas ainda me identifico com Caufield  ainda acho sensacional a metafora do campo de centeio e a imagem das criancas vindo a minha direcao se coloca como uma das melhores sensacoes que nunca viverei  Os anos se passaram  eu mudei  mas as razoes que me ligaram a este livro estao longe de desaparecer Logo que terminei de reler o livro em 2006  escrevi  Ainda sou Caulfield no estar perdido no mundo e em completa desconexao  Ainda sou Caulfield no mau humor  no humor acido  na ironia e na raiva das pessoas  Ainda sou Caulfield no desejo de querer ir para bem longe  viver uma vida espartana  com ceu cheio de estrelas e uma casinha perdida  Ainda sou Caulfield no gosto pelo diferente  estranho  o chapeu de caca vermelho sinalizando que nao  nao me sinto igual a voces  Ainda sou Caulfield em amar a alegoria do apanhador no campo de centeio e querer fazer disso minha maior ocupacao e preocupacao Queria uma irma Phoebe e uma irma Allie  ja que irma D B esta em formacao  Queria Nova York  mesmo que fria e cinza  Queria ser ainda mais Caulfield   e tambem queria usar menos paralelismos   I ve taught this novel several times  It just so happens that I m teaching it right now in my 9th grade class  and we ll see if they care that Salinger died this week  I used to teach it to 11th graders in an American Lit class  In general  I think that might be a better age to take it on  That was at my previous school  and I don t know that I would teach it to 9th graders if my present school didn t require it  My students understand some of it  but there are still enough kids in the classes who don t seem to handle any acknowledgment by a teacher that sex exists or who don t yet feel any angst or who don t know how to deal with an unreliable narrator   Please don t judge my teaching based on the sentence structure in this review   One could argue that those are exactly the kids who should read this novel  and some do respond and change when reading it  but it goes by others  For those  I leave them with the idea that they should re read it in a few years  I also teach an AP English Language class  and the students in that class read only nonfiction  but  after the AP exam  we still have three weeks in the class before graduation  so I have them re read the novel  I mostly do it because all seniors are required to write a 10 page educational reflection as a final English essay  It s a good element of their reflection to have them re visit something they had to read freshman year  They re mostly game  and many comment on how they ve changed in relation to the sentiments of the novel  So  I ve re read this novel several times as an adult  and I gain great insight by re reading it with teenagers  The dynamic of the discussions change as some reticent students are drawn in and some teacher pleasers are puzzled by a seemingly amoral tale   I find it to be quite moralistic  but I can understand how younger readers miss it  Anyway  I m one of those people who loves this novel  I don t necessarily subscribe to the idea of a strict hierarchy for literature or of a short list for the Great American Novel  and I see the novel s flaws  I think  however  Salinger was a master of voice and dialogue  and the economy of language in his descriptions is breathtaking  The fact that all this is contained in a narrative that  at first blush  seems to wander all over the place aimlessly  from digression to digression  makes it even more remarkable  Every one of those digressions makes sense when I take a step back and trace how one ends and the next begins  I do not identify with Holden at all  nor did I ever  he s a whiner and a liar  among other things   Salinger neither defends nor dismisses him  though  and  through his attempts to accurately portray a particular mindset  he reveals a truth about human nature  Those who love or hate this novel because they think Holden is presented as heroic completely miss the beauty I see  the only thing I know on the last page is that Holden is the phony  lost in a cynicism    perhaps at one point earned    bordering on mental illness  In fact  that cynical nature that is present in any belief system can become an illness if taken to the extreme  At least to my way of thinking  Salinger isn t glorifying teen angst  he is examining it  though  and illuminating the tight relationship between naivete and jadedness  between optimism and pessimism  between those snap judgments we all make and what becomes of us if we allow our perceptions to harden  That tension is almost the end of Holden  and there s no neat little message at the end intimating that any of us will survive it  Like I said  I love this novel  I love it like I love  Invisible Man    The Great Gatsby    Catch 22    Hamlet    The Bean Trees    Romeo   Juliet    King Lear    The Awakening    Herzog    Blue Angel    A Death in the Family    Bee Season    Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man    Love Warps the Mind a Little    The Subterraneans    All My Friends Are Going To Be Strangers    Housekeeping   and  The Things They Carried   Are these stories similar in some way  Perhaps the thread that ties them together is tenuous  but I think it is  as Chekhov and Beckett and Prose wrote  that the particular reveals the universal  In my mind  that s what makes art great I hope I don t give my students the impression that they have to love  The Catcher in the Rye   They don t  I tell them on the first day of class that they can hate every book we read for class and still make an A  I do hope  though  that my passion for this book translates into a reason for them to be engaged with the text   I loved the way the author described each character  Something that they project to be that conflicts with what they truly are  Plus the highly fed thought of what one ought to be   that thought surrounds us all  not just during teenage years  but I experience it even when I am in my early 30s  I m not gonna go n discuss what   catcher in the rye   is all about instead   i ll just say what it felt like reading it n all  Though It s really hard when it comes to talk about a book you enjoyed so much   not only reading but getting involved to the extent of living it n believing it w all your heart   wishing you d run into a boy like that n getting curious of what he d say about you   think of you n act around you n all that kinda stuff    He drove me crazy that Holden guy n his hat    The reason i was so eager to read it was me watching   my one and only   the movie starring renee zellweger  anyways in the movie her son   George   a teenager w lotta complexes   Though you can t really blame him anyways   he was obsessed with this book  which was his favorite   n kept talking about it for two years   I didn t get the big deal about it then but i couldn t stop thinking about it   so i thought of giving it a shot n i m so glad i did cuz now i see why it was such a big deal for him   George i mean      All i m trying to say is Read it     you ll enjoy it as you kinda fall in love with that crazy Holden kid   Some books have the special ability to make deep impressions  You started them as just a book to read but it tends to stay with you after you finish it   The Catcher in the Rye  is that sort of book  One of the best Young Adult book I ever read   Must Read  for all who love this genre   I think most of us have experienced the illusion between beginning of puberty and adulthood  the so called adolescence  Most of us have a little Holden deep inside of us  which hates everybody and everything that he once somehow believed in  and wants to see the world in a different way  in a way that he s not used to  in a way that maybe he hates it too  The challenge of fighting this dilemma sort of shapes our adolescence  and maybe helps us to find our future  But what really killed me about this book was the way he used to describe everything around him  with his old lousy vocabulary and all  He notices the tiny little things in people that others may not even think of it  like Jane being muckle mouthed or Stradlater being a secret snob  or old Phoebe  that killed me  God I could imagine that little child as if I had known her for a long time  and I loved her  just as Holden did  I really touched the brother sister love between them  And I loved Holden too  The crazy bastard  I wish I had read this book a year ago   I felt many of the things that Holden felt  and this would have been a great reminder that it s OK to be confused and frustrated with the way things are This book transcends time and still reaches adolescents decades since its writing  Teenagers of every generation are confused   they re trying to figure out who they are in relation to the rest of the world  how they relate to their parents  how they deal with change and frustration that comes with being adolescents  This book lets them see that they re not alone  that even in the 1950s teenagers were feeling this way  It s also a good reminder that they are allowed to feel this way   that questioning authority and norms is acceptable and should even be expected of them Great good  easy read  read it in two days   Some readers might be touchy about the language  so I wouldn t necessarily require students to read it  I will keep it in my classroom  but I can t in good conscience require students to read it if they aren t prepared for the language or content  Aj napriek tomu  ze tato kniha ani nema nejaku zapletku a neusti do ziadnej pointy  ma velmi vela postav a mnoho veci nechava otvorenych  neskutocne sa mi pacila  Cita sa uplne sama  text je velmi jednoducho a zrozumitelne pisany  ma putavy dej a sledovat Holdena a jeho myslienky je ovela zaujimavejsie  ako by sa mohlo na prvy pohlad zdat  I hated Catcher in the Rye s protagonist  Holden Caulfield  Holden Caulfield  from my point of view  was a troubled youth who did not hesitate to call any living thing on Earth  with the exception of himself of course  a phony  He criticizes others  flaws while not bothering to make any adjustments to his own character  He constantly acts out on outlandish impulses and criticizes those who disagree with his actions  usually by calling them a pain in the ass or a phony  Holden Caulfield is a giant hypocrite  He makes all these little rules in his head which he uses to classify people as phonies  only to immediately break them himself in the following chapter  It wasn t Holden s charming personality that made this a great book  it was Salinger s ability to capture the essence of a bratty teenager who s fed up with the world  Salinger made an even greater impact on the audience by telling Holden s story of failure from the first person perspective  This way  the audience gets to see how Holden s actions contradict his own thoughts and visa versa  Catcher in the Rye  annoying as the main character is  is a good book  I enjoyed the book a lot more the second time I read it  probably due to the fact that I d become accustomed to Holden s poor attitude and could actually admire the story for what it was at heart  an epic about an annoying kid failing because of his own character flaws but instead of bothering to make a change  blames the world around him for his short comings 10 10 would consider reading a 3rd time  I can understand why so many people would dislike The Catcher in the Rye  it s fraught with unlikable characters  most notably the protagonist Holden Caulfield  who is a rebellious little rich kid with a negative outlook on life and who has been kicked out of close to  if not  four schools because he continues to fail And yet    aside from a few grammatical errors and writing style choices    I truly have nothing negative to say about this book  Although Holden was a very pitiful character who is often hard to like  I found myself feeling sorry for him  not just because of his circumstances but also because of his personality   I have trouble feeling sorry for some characters because I truly find there personalities horrendous  take Things Fall Apart s Okonkwo  for example   so when bad things happen to them  I just don t care  however  I didn t feel this way for Holden  which may sound weird  but after learning about  view spoiler  his being sexually abused as a child  hide spoiler    I can push aside my annoyances with him  Really real  Life spirals farther and farther from reality as idealism and disillusionment form their own perfect world  I hated reading it  Holden  the protagonist  swore far too much   but I love thinking about it  It s deep  deeper than you d ever think if you just passed on through the novel  You ve got to think  a lot  It took Salinger ten years to write this novel  and it was originally two times as long  Don t take anything as insignificant  It all matters  and I love thinking that way  It s a book everyone should read at some point  but only if you re dedicated to taking it seriously So even though reading it made me nauseous  this book is a masterpiece   This was my third time reading through  Catcher  and it honestly still holds up as my favorite book  The first time I read this book was when my English teacher in 11th grade gifted me a copy  The more I re read this story the more I enjoy comparing my previous thoughts and opinions I form from it  In 11th grade I mostly made connections with Holden in regards to continuing my education  The second reading I conducted in my Freshman year of college and the third I have now completed in my Senior year of undergrad  If you want to know the truth  Holden Caulfield is my favorite character in literature because he teaches us that you are not alone  The vast majority of the book deals with him complaining about his life  His grievances alone is why I can see how many friends and colleagues of mine see him as an irritating and ignorant character that does not appreciate how well he truly has it  However  if one is able to look past his constant frustrations  I believe you can learn something quite valuable  This lesson being that it is hard  awkward  and frustrating experience to come to terms with adulthood  but to remember that you are not alone in this journey  Family  friends  and mentors all around you are either currently having their own similar problems or have had past problems when it comes to growing up  Holden throughout the whole story is having a tough time coming to terms with adulthood  He admires children and their innocence several times and doesn t want to have to accept certain adult themes such as  sexuality  The title of the novel itself is because he misinterprets a poem written by Robert Burns in 1782 titled  Comin  Thro  the Rye   A crude interpretation of the poem is that the protagonist is questioning whether casual sex is okay  A question that each generation has to answer for themselves  For example  millennials have been branded the  hook up generation  due to an infinite array of dating apps and the ability to be constantly connected with people  but I digress  Although Mr  Vinson s class would have shouted  Digression   at me early on in this review  I love the endless avenues and conversations that continue to come from this novel  How people say this book is about  nothing  and  everything  all at once  It s not so happy ending is what continues to make this my favorite novel and is what draws me back to it through each transitional period of my life   Every time I read part of this I d end up feeling a little depressed But honestly I can t say I didn t enjoy it This is an amazing book and I kinda felt related to it somehow  I loved Holden  I loved how he describe things  his sarcasm  and the way he hates things around him This goes under my favorite books  Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger is one of my favorite book  Holden  the protagonist  is a teenager ready to be an adult  He wants to have the privilege of being an adult  but being a child at the same time  He wants to become a catcher  who catches children from the edge of the cliff  This means that Holden wants to stop the kids from growing up  to enter the world of phoniness  His idiosyncrasy mind shapes him as a teenager who thinks differently from the other teens  With thinking that the world is made up with phoniness  Holden does not realize his own hypocrisy  While one acts fake around others  the book has shown that Holden is doing the same thing as well  Holden is a hypocrite who is a very depressed yet curious boy  He looks at the world from a different view  His moral is to teach the readers to stay young and live one s life to its fullest  He is saying that there may be pleasure while being an adult  but the better part is the childhood  The book is trying to say that growing up is essential in life  but taking a breath would not harm anyone  Holden wants to stop everyone from being nonchalant  but to take a look back at their life  I recommend this book strongly to teens because it has a view from a totally different perspective of a young adult growing up  It made me turn pages after pages and I could not let go of this book  By reading this book over and over again  one can discover hidden meanings   This book was amazing  I think what really did it for me was the opening  best opening  ever    Holden was extremely likeable and even relatable to some extent  but what made the book even more interesting was the contrast between the characters of Holden and Phoebe  Definitely something I would recommend to anybody  really  The Catcher in the Rye has earned its place in the classics hall of fame  And  I m glad there s not a sequel or prequel  Those always suck   Fabulous The book is a magnificent  passionate and absorbing  rant  of a teenager  Holden Caulfield  who is genuinely opinionated  angry  lost  confused and headstrong as most teenagers are  It s a story spanning over approximately 3 4 days of Holden s life  The intensity of the writing is such that it draws us so close to Holden that we seem to undergo these series of emotions  From initially being fond of him  we begin to get amused by him and then get angry at him to finally empathizing with him The language is most noteworthy here for had the language been articulate  it would not have seemed like a ramble of a teenager  It thus is endearing to see the language be true to the character  Every character serves a purpose and makes for an interesting revelation taking forward Holden s story and us along with it However  if the reader has had an extremely smooth and  clear  teenage phase then there is every possibility of the book seeming cumbersome and pointless  I loved it     What s special about this book is that even though it was written in 1951  it still has a contemporary feel to it  I loved Holden Caulfield s voice  I loved that he was different from the other boys  that he was sort of an outsider in the world he lived   I think you have to be a teenager  or at least remember what it was like to be a teenager to truly appreciate this book  That feeling of being out of sorts  out of time  and out of place is what teenage angst is about  imo anyway   and once you ve left your teenage years it becomes harder and harder for most of us to remember what it was like  Then we have our own kids and experience what being a teenager is like all over again  only this time  from the outside looking in  That s why I enjoyed the book  not because I related to it today  Honestly if you relate to this book personally past     let s say early 20 s  that s probably troubling   but because I remember what it was like to be Caulfield s age and what it felt like to be that age  If you allow him to Salinger will let bring you back to your teenager years as well  but you have to let him   For no other reason but that I can  I feel I should say something about this book after the passing of JD Salinger and subsequent news about unpublished material Salinger was on the shortlist of people who define the misunderstood teenager and everything that went with being one  Catcher In the Rye was a rite of passage  I don t imagine this will change anytime soon I read Catcher in my later teen years  as one is supposed to do  I liked it alot  as you could probably guess  There would be other books that would have moved me more  Slaughterhouse Five  and it s not even the best alienated loner book ever  A Confederacy of Dunces   but it is worth the reputation it s built It doesn t hurt  honestly  that it was controversial  That it was the Mark David Chapman book only made the legend grow  Would reading the book make you go mad  Everything and all of it was part of the legend  up to and including the iconic red paperback cover with gold letters Catcher wasn t required reading where I went to school  There was no way it would be where I am from  but I think we read  A Perfect Day for Bananafish   In our literature courses  there weren t that many great American authors in the last century  Hemmingway  Faulkner  Fitzgerald and Steinbeck  all who had been dead for decades   and there certainly wasn t anyone still alive who was mentioned with the same breath as Dickens  Salinger was the only proof we had that you could still be a modern American writer and be respected on the level of classic literature That Salinger walked away from writing was as big of a part of his legend as anything  Though  that wasn t the intention  Salinger lived the Arthur Rimbaud legend of walking away after releasing his masterpiece to the world  and it made his icon grow that much more  Cobain  Jim Morrison  Axl Rose  Syd Barret  Terrence Malick  some talked about it  and some did it to a certain degree  but no one was a better example of the textbook recluse  Harper Lee  maybe a distant second  than Salinger  Salinger is the first person we think of when it comes to artistic recluses  His life was a ready made late night conversation  What did he do  Were there new novels to be undiscovered I have read Franny and Zoey  it s okay  and have Nine Stories on my shelf  but it is of course Catcher in the Rye that moved me the most  Even if we have JD to blame for Douglas Coupland  Jay McInerney  Donna Tartt  Bret Easton Ellis and countless others for trying to duplicate his feat  Evan Dorkin was particularly harsh  possibly joking  that Catcher in the Rye is over rated  Nothing happens  and you never do find out where the ducks went Thanks  Evan Dorkin for that last joke   Supongo que podria empezar a explicar que decidi leer este libro por las razones erroneas  el asesino de John Lennon  Me resultaba interesante ver que podia aportar este libro a un asesino  Y quizas por eso me decepciono un poco en un principio porque esperaba algo aun mas intrincado  mas psicotico quizas    Pero una vez mas me topo en un libro con lo mas basico  la madurez y ese duro trance  todo el mundo seguramente a pensado alguna vez en su vida  que todo lo que le rodeaba  todo lo que se le venia encima era una completa mierda  yo incluso hoy en dia lo sigo pensando con muchas cosas y es basicamente lo que cuenta Holden  su opinion sobre la vida que irremediablemente se le viene encima  desde su postura de  inocencia perdida  ve unicamente la pureza de la vida en sus recuerdos  vive de sus recuerdos y sus fantasias  apegandose a ello sin querer dejarlo atras  se aferro al recuerdo de su hermano  a lugares y cosas que hacia cuando era un crio e incluso a su hermana el mas claro ejemplo de inocencia para el pero que incluso ella ya muestra senas de estar perdiendola  y esa es para mi la base del conflicto interno del personaje  Que al final  bajo mi humilde opinion  se ve obligado a dejar su inocencia para ser el adulto  ya que estaba arrastrando a su hermana con su actitud  y es cuando para mi se da cuenta de que algo no va bien con el  cuando de alguna forma vez que tiene que afrontar todos sus problemas  empezando por volver a casa  No se si lo entendi del todo bien  al 100  todas las situaciones  pero la verdad es que me da igual el libro es genial  se mire por donde se mire Nota  10 10 I want to say thanks to J D  Salinger for this book  I found myself in a character from the book And he helped me to understand that you should love more then hate  Cause only love makes you really happy   This book was aobut a boy named Holden who gets expelled from a prep school and is told not to come home after the Holiday break  He later decides to leave early because the school has nothing more to offer him  After that he spends a few days in diffrent hotels  getting in touch with old friends and enjoyng himself  Holden later decides to see his younger sister  Phoebe  he spends a few hours talking with her and tells her that he wants to leave the city  Pheobe becomes worrided abut her brother when the next day he sends her a note at shcool saying that he s leaving and will say goddbye to her at lunch  The Cather and The Rye was a fiction novel  The theme was self discovery  This book was easy to follow  and you could always tell what was going on  I really liked this book because I could connect with Holden  i think anyone could enjoy this book because it was an easy read and easy to follow   i loved it badly  this book really has a soul Occasionally when I find myself at my parent s house  I look through the books I ve left behind  and I inevitably end up rereading Catcher in the Rye  I know a lot of people dislike it  and perversely I m happy that they do  I also know there are some people who actually claim to dislike the people who cite it as being their favorite books  That seems a bit strange to me  but I suppose it s unfortunate then  that no matter how many other books I read  this is the only one that really ever meant anything to me Catcher in the Rye is personal  I can t explain why I like it any more than I can describe how a banana tastes  In fact sometimes I wonder if I do actually like it    how can I love a book that makes me feel so incredibly bad  I ve read it countless times  and I really do fear that I ll never stop feeling the way Holden does    I ll never grow out of this stupid awkward phase  I suppose this is just really emo of me  That s actually a fair criticism  Only  sometimes I wonder if I love Catcher because I m a sensitive loser or if it s the other way around  Did my wiring get messed up somehow because I read this at too tender an age  Why is this one character so real to me  I can t say I recommend it or it s good or bad or anything really  because this book is a little beyond that  I know that s corny and probably grotesque in a way  but if you feel this way about it  then maybe you should re read it if it s been awhile  The first time I read this book  which was about 4 years ago  I rated it as 4 stars  Now it s definitely a 5 star  I finished this book in almost 24 hours and I enjoyed it so much  It made me laugh  it made me cry  This is such an important book and a must read for everybody growing up   I will use this book to explain tone vs mood  because in many works they are quite similar since the reader often agrees with the narrator  but here  Holden s sullen  cynical  and resentful tone evokes a mood of pity and concern in the reader  very different from Holden s attitude   Salinger utilizes the setting in his novel to display the truths about society  Holden  the protagonist  is growing up in the early 1950s   During this time Holden feels like the world around him is full of hypocrisy    It s full of phonies  and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day  and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses  and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day  and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques    Salinger 170   His views on society display his negative outlook on life  he feels alienated because he does not have the same goals as everyone else  Holding a bitter attitude on society and how fake it can be  Holden feels like an outcast in the world he lives in  Constantly complaining about how fake the world is  Holden hardly ever inspires change  Salinger displays Holden s resentment towards society  however  underneath what Holden says about the world just reveals his fear of growing up  Holden knows he is going to enter the adult world and his bitter attitude to it just reflects his insecurities  I love this book  one of my favorites   Satyrica  I do agree with  Satyrica because he she says is true  How it s true is because the author of Catcher in the Rye does or can talk to the readers at different points in the readers  life  The reader s can have something good or bad to happen in their life but once they read a book with their same situation then  they know that they aren t the only ones going through the same situation  So I believe that this is a good book to read no matter what  Yes some readers will dislike the book and or enjoy the book but as I read this book and got further into it  nothing changed how I live my lifestyle  The experience with this book was rather interesting and concerning but the author  J D  Salinger  really had gotten into it and started getting into detail about Holden  all his problems  and even his lifestyle I truly believe that reading a novel does not change any reader reading this book or even any book  I do believe this book because it s the reader s life to either change it or keep it the same  No novel will ever force the readers to to change their lifestyle and or do all the things that the characters do in the books  If the reader does have some type of problem then why should they continue to read the book  It s not like their hands are glued onto the book and they can t ever put the book down or put it back where they got it from  Catcher in the Rye does tech life lessons  Life lessons that are good and bad that show what you can do if a problem is to occur  The authors  in any book  do break down moments in each reader s life and how their life can relate to the characters in the book Catcher in the Rye is a perfect book for high school students because what Holden goes I through  and some high school students do go through what Holden goes through  So maybe high school students will find this book helpful or understanding  If they can t take reading it or anything then they can tell the teacher because The teacher is not going to force a student to it read it if they can t handle it  Although  teachers should teach this book because maybe this book can get to high school students and they can understand how life can truly be around the world   Though I feel that no review I could write could do justice to this book  I will attempt to portray my love for it  Many that I know who have read this book see Holden as an arrogant and selfish boy with nothing but a bad attitude  I wholeheartedly disagree  Holden is a young boy who desperately struggles to come to terms with reality and accept the  phony  people and things that surround him  I think a main aspect of the novel is that it s about a teenager that struggles to mature in an immature society  and though I have a slightly different reaction towards it  I do relate to that  Holden is mourning the loss of his brother and sees the world as a dark place  full of beauty but not entirely beautiful people  He s immersed in a serious depression  though it is not spoken of  especially considering the almost flippant manner that he mentions things  He simply needs help and there s nobody around to provide him with it  Like myself  I think he feels overly conscious of what goes on in the world and wishes it wasn t quite so  Hence why he wants to save those children from adulthood  because it just isn t what it is made out to be  and you begin to realize things you wish you didn t have to In a nutshell  Holden tells the truth  and at the time that this book was written  that was a scandalous thing to do  especially given how it was told  But it s the truth no less and I am eternally grateful to the genius that was J D Salinger  I have treasured this book for many years and I will never tire of it  I strongly recommend this book to everyone and hope that others will see the beauty in Holden s character that I do  Genial    Esun maravilloso libro sobre las vivencias de un adolescente adinerado en la Nueva York de principios del siglo XX  No reside su valor en su calidad literaria  si no en la continua reflexion que fomenta en el lector acerca de los valores personales  los objetivos vitales  la particular vision del mundo y de como encajamos en el que tiene cada uno  Relatado con desenfado y ligereza  como si hubiera sido escrito por el protagonista  resulta sencillo y rapido de leer  pero insisto  el meollo esta en la reflexion posterior   No se por que hay que dejar de querer a una persona solo porque se haya muerto  Sobre todo si era cien veces mejor que los que siguen viviendo Despues de leer este libro  siento que solo las personas que se sienten como Holden pueden entenderlo y no aburrirse de su actitud  Me lo recomendaron en el momento adecuado  tal vez no para hacerme sentir mejor respecto a lo que siento  sino para demostrarme que hay personas  asi sean personajes literarios que se han sentido igual o incluso peor con su vida y su alrededor  Le doy cinco estrellas porque me senti identificada con Holden  con su vacio  su indecision y su manera de pensar acerca de su hermano muerto  Se lo recomiendo a personas que esten pasando por un momento asi  para que lo entiendan de verdad  bbsT    ywns   ys dk wybhjk    n fkr fy lbT  yn ydhhb fy lsht   w khf  n  nZr l  lmra  l n hdh lwGd sykhrj ly mnh wyDHk DHk

young man  Holden Caulfield  who has flunked out of Pencey Prep and is  sore  about all of the  phonies  he has encountered while he was there  In the middle of the night Holden packs up his things and decides to leave after an altercation with his roommate  He hops a train to New York and decided to stay at a hotel until school lets out for the winter break to avoid drama with his folks who have yet to learn that he has been kicked out of school  The next few days are filled with teenage rebellion  the internal journey Holden is hesitant to take  and feeling as if he truly belongs  I read this book for the first time at the age of 21  and I don t know if I were to have felt as strongly as I do about it if I had read it when I was younger  When I first started reading this book  I just wanted to knock some sense into Holden  I couldn t understand why this was such a highly praised classic  and yet it enticed me  I couldn t put it down  Maybe it was my hope that things would work out  that Holden would get his act together  but I just became so attached to his character  I became frustrated with his behavior at times  and it just drove me crazy  And then he meets up with Mr  Antolini  his former English teacher  and that is when I realized what a powerful book this is and could be for young adults  The change after his visit with Mr  Antolini is subtle  yet evident  This is a fantastic book  I enjoyed the philosophical nature of this work and I understand why so many teachers teach this book to high school level students  There is so much to learn form Holden s experiences and interactions with those who are wise   Ironically enough  I read this book mostly on the minutes before waiting for my mental therapist  worth mentioning that the book helped much more than mental health lessons  I read it as an adult  just a couple of years ago  and I always compare it to what Herman Hesse s Demian did to me when I read it at age 14  Sometimes I wish I had read The Catcher in the Rye when I was younger  but gladly and for a fortunate accident  I read when I read  ah  the magic of good literature Okay  i just decided to write a short review for that one  I give for this book 5 stars  because i think  that they re deserved  Maybe The Catcher in the Rye isn t everyone s cup of tea  but it was mine  This book is an inspiring read  because it sends out the message  that we should all remain hopeful and true to ourselves  It s really exciting to read the book and it was pleasure to me to do that   Love it  Its funny deep  Sometimes u wish u could run away from the filthy world and hide in ur own shelter  U dont wanna get involved with the indifferent and stupid ppl around u  u d rather pretend u r deaf so that they ll leave u alone  But u can t do that cuz there r things that u love here  Actually u love most of the things in this world  u just can t realise it cuz u focus on the down side too much  It s not abt running away  it s abt staying and standing for the original things that u believe in  May u stay innocent always  mHshr bwd When I first read this book many years ago  I hated it  I was distracted by the foul language  and did not understand the point of Holden s journey  I realize now that I was simply too young to grasp the meaning behind the whole thing  The second time I read it  I was amazed to discover the story that I had missed years prior  For me this story spoke of the struggle to maintain one s innocence despite a world that is so determined to destroy it  The search for purpose  a sense of self worth  and a world worth inhabiting are the explorations I discovered in my second reading  which came at a time when I was exploring these same questions myself  My recommendation is to read this book  wait a few years  then read it again  It may surprise you how much the story will change  A rated this book a five because it was the best book I ve read  I liked this book so much because of the main character  Holden and his sarcastic personality  I related to this book because I believe I m at the same point of my life that he is which is trying to connect with people on an adult level but also a times still wanting to be a kid  That s a hard thing to balance so this book helped me find a common ground between the two  worlds   Lastly  I would recommend this book to ant teenager who s having a hard time trying to figure out how to be an adult but still a child at the same time   At first glance this novel may seem a funny story about a teenage boy trying to find himself  But if you start to analyze all the symbols  it gets deep as fuck and very meaningful The best part about it was that I could totally find myself within Holden s troubled soul  The main idea is that although he tries to seem grown up and mature by staying out late  wandering all alone through NYC  deep down he is still a little boy  who keeps looking for someone with whom to have a word  hoping for understanding and compassion This is frequently met in teenage years  the horrible period when you can t find your rest and everything  depresses you   as young Holden puts it I m not sure I got all the metaphors  but I did get what the author meant by the title and Holden s goal in life  to be the catcher in the rye   come to think of it I might want that job too  now that I understand it s quite useful and helpful for kids who simply don t want to grow up  I ve always recognized the title  mainly because it is a classic book  and I went into this not knowing anything at all on what it was going to be about  I admittedly say that although I do believe the main character  Holden Caulfield  is kind of a dick  I related with him a lot  No matter all the wrong he does in this story  you sort of always feel bad for him in a sense of realizing that his life was pretty sad  This story is wonderful and in a may  majestic  It moves me  and I believe it could move any reader  It showed me a way to look at life and how to recognize all the wrongness that is OK d in this world  The book doesn t necessarily have a plot  you just read whatever happens to Holden next in a well placed sequence of events  The book is beautifully written and has many moments and quotes that I will never forget  In all honesty  The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book of all time   many see this book as depressing and has been associated with invoking criminal behavior like Lennon or Kennedy assassination this book has been banned in schools  yet even after all those atrocities on this book it is in times magazine 100 books of all time and very well justified though writing a review of this book would require more pages than what Salinger did in less than 300  and that s exactly what a great book is  going beyond the mere pages and staying with you and like Holden  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it having said that this book may not be for everyone at first look you may not appreciate it now  but someday you will pick it up again and think what a bonehead you have been and YOU WILL LOVE IT  This truly is a book that EVERYONE should read  I am INSTANTLY pissed at all of my teachers for not introducing me to this book when I was in school  I have heard about this book for some time  but didn t think about reading it until I saw it on the 1001 Books everyone must read list  I became more interested when I found out the main character s name is Holden Caulfield  and saw there was a relation to a Green Day song   Yes  these are my priorities   I was so impressed by this book  It is the story of Holden  who  after the death of his brother Allie  stops caring about anything else  except his little sister Phoebe  He appears to be afflicted with bipolar disorder  ranging from manic episodes of high activity and excitement  to low lows of depression so deep he develops physical symptoms  Although I ve never lost a simbling  I can surely relate to some of his feelings  Perhaps that is the appeal But if you  like me  made it out of school without reading this book  do so now  2010 is the year to catch up on classic reading for me  either books I haven t read in a long time or books I should have read  In this case  I somehow missed this one  I had purchased a copy at a book sale a week or two before Mr  Salinger passed away  I had set it aside to read it eventually  but for some reason that gave me impetus to move it to the top of the to read pile  just as David Foster Wallace passing gave priority to Infinite Jest I was not disappointed  Holden Caulfield has it in for phony people  many of whom are adults  He relates more to children  seemingly  Salinger writes in the 1st person  the voice is consistent throughout  and the book is of the perfect length  Very enjoyable and hilarious in places  another of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE books ever  holden is so refreshing  but so tragic  his mental instability is sad but in a beautiful way  and the things he finds joy in  his sister on the carousel in the rain  are so wonderful and simple  it s easy to get caught up with him  the image of a catcher in the rye is haunting to me  solitary and abstract  but the fact the holden is so young and adverse to growing up but clinging to the idea of stopping children from experiencing this is so powerful  i think anyone who has had to grow up  all of us  can relate to this in some way  if you read close enough  i think holden has a pretty universal experience  A great classic that you just cannot put down until you have finished it     Written by J D Salinger   The Catcher in the Rye  never dissapointed me while reading the lovely novel  I read it almost a year ago  in my American Literature Honors class  Yet I still remember most of the lines from the book  The main character  Holden Caufield was a symbol for adolescence  The book was beautiful  It helped me realize things about my self I could have never dreamed about  Although he was the only character that stood out to me  that was all that it had to take to get me to fall in love with this staple of American Literature The Catcher in the Rye was just the beginning to many  coming of age  styled books  Without giving away to much of the book  Holden Caufield dealt with many issues in his life that were causing him to feel  sort of insane   just sad  Anyone who has felt depressed before  can relate to Holden Caufield  I honestly am not sure why many people dislike this book  I think it is just under The Great Gatsby in rank of the greatest books  I am definitely glad I was given this book to read last year  for it made me enjoy reading  I truthfully recommend this book to virtually anyone  but especially seniors in high school or college students  A reread I didn t get much out of this when I was 16 and Holden felt like a whiny brat   which in many ways he will always be  I really enjoyed the novel It s the kind of book that  hurts so good    not because it s poignant or sad  or romantic or wonderfully artistic Comforting  My Biology teacher  half talking about freezing oceans  said he felt relieved not to be alone when he read it It wasn t like that for me  but I understand him  The Catcher in the Rye   does it resonate with people who are like Holden or who were him  I think the latter is more truthy   if it makes any sense  At least it does to me Five stars not because I loved it  but because it made me hate myself  and yet be very  very nostalgic for that period of time  What can I say about this book that has not already been said  That I identified with the main character s plight  That I liked the profanity and authenticity of teenage angst  I m treading carefully in order to not be just another  phony  who shallowly takes everything at face value  In all seriousness  this book could not have come at a better time  When currently trying to sort myself out  academically and emotionally  it seems that whatever issues I m going through are just minor mishaps at best  compared to the storm of shit that rains down on the hapless but strong minded Holden Caulfield  I guess you could objectively say it s not very expressive  but with every angry  goddamn   I found so much pain and depth just oozing out of the pages of the book  It s difficult to put in words the  adolescent strife  and I know that it s extremely stereotypical to say that  you don t understand   but it really is a matter of being lost in translation  Generational leaps are becoming smaller and smaller  where one can say that the teenager of 2015 is undeniably different from a teenager in the year 2017  In any case  Holden s attempt at resilience and the maintenance of his withering dignity in a world full of inauthenticity is probably the best expression of the difficulties we face   we wish to be understood so much that we probably never will be understood at all  In the words of Fernando Pessoa   The cause of my profound sense of incompatibility with others is  that most people think with their feelings  whereas I feel with my thoughts   Anyone who has read the book will understand how perfectly Holden fits into this category of people   n m mdhhl  hdhh lmdhkrt bkl mfyh mn kab  wbw s wDjr fy lbdy  Znnt  nny s qr  shyy  ltDyy  lwqt fqT lkny ktshtft  ny  qr

book  I really do love this story  After trying to figure out how I actually felt about this book after finishing it  I gave up  I honestly feel so much towards this book that I decided that there s no other explanation other than I love it  But it s a funny though  My  relationship  with this book was like love  hate  okay  really   and then love again  I m not sure if you can follow me but these are the feelings of a reader after finishing a book that has touched his heart  And this book really did that  Holden is one of those pretty darn complicated characters and that was one of the reasons I loved him the most  Personally  I love  anti heroes   I mean it s easy to create a perfect main character with some flaws here and and there and making a great enjoyable story with a great action packed plot but this  what J  D  Salinger did in this book  is the most difficult and challenging thing  in my opinion  Because if I tried to tell you a plot of this story it d basically be  a depressed teenager walking around NY  and would you be impressed   I doubt that  But when you actually start reading this book  when you get into Holden s mind  when you start feeling with him  that is what makes this book worth it  This book is more about human feelings  more about the way we grow up than what happens  It s more about how what happens affects us  if you know what I mean  I d say this book is a perfect mess  Holden s thoughts are a mess and so is his life but I could find myself so much in him  How he went from happy to depressed in 0 1 sec  Another thing that touched me so much in this book was Holden s relationship with his sister  I just can t even begin to describe how perfect it all was  With it s own ups and downs it definitely was the most perfect relationship I ve read in a book  In that miserable life of Holden s the author placed his sister  An innocent child that softened Holden s soul  I could read about them forever and never get bored  I really can t point something I didn t like in this book  because even those  not so good  parts were intentionally written by the author  they were there to remind you that life isn t always all that perfect  and we are humans and we have mixed feelings and sometimes we hate the world  and we can be phonies and we can hurt but in this end  it s all because of this crazy ride called life I don t think everybody can fully get into this book  But if you read this story at the right time  it will be stuck with you forever  And I m glad I read this at the perfect time  I m going through the years Holden was in this book and reading about how other people felt the same strange things as you did  feels very unfamiliar at first  but then it is fulfilling  It s books like this one that remind me again why I am such a bookworm  It s stories like this that make you put the book down  take a deep breath to take it all in  and then continue reading that can keep me up reading until 5 A M even though I have an exam tomorrow  I have to told you though  what I just wrote aren t half of the things I feel and think about this book  But I ve figured words sometimes can take away the greatness of a book since I m not a writer and I ll never be  but I have to tell you one last thing  this is true literature  One that can lift your spirit and write your soul in paper  John Green s Crash Course pretty much sums up everything I have to say about this novel  so if you haven t viewed it on Youtube yet  do that now  It s a classic  true coming of age story  I ve found that people either love or hate this novel  Yes  Holden Caulfield can be a little annoying and whiny  but what teenager isn t   While the language is simple  this is a novel that needs to be taught  There is so much symbolism and depth beyond the simplistic kid who doesn t want to grow up and this can often be overlooked by the untrained eye  Holden s attempts to freeze time and keep his innocence are realistic and captured so well  While having prior knowledge about an author isn t always necessary before reading a novel  knowing that JD Salinger was a recluse and found movies to be phony as well does shed some light on his main character s thoughts and actions   This was a great book  So many people told me how good it was that i was expecting to be disappointed  But i was engrossed from the minute i picked it up  Holden is one of the most interesting characters i have ever read about  I recommend this to anyone who is literate  This is my all time favorite book  I ve read it more time than I can count and each time I find it more interesting than the last  Id recommend it to everyone  For some it s hard to identify with Holden throughout his journey  but I found it eye opening to see the way he views the world

this book I was confused as to whether I would understand this book but surprisingly  everything made sense  This book is my favourite book and I know that is an extremely strong statement to make but I do genuinely think this is my favourite book I ve never read any book that grips me that much  I ve also never come across any characters that speak to me as much as Holden does  My mum urged me to read this as it is also her favourite book and I have to thank her for introducing me to Holden  Holden will always have a place in my heart and I can t even begin to describe this book in depth as I can t explain how much this book means to me  Read it   a helluva book    though anyone may feel holden isnt worth a hero but this novel perfectly depicts the situation for a young adult boy  love the little sister  even though it feels as if story is never complete  yet thats the main point of all    This is the book you either love or hate  and personally I loved it  Like most people  I read it in high school when I was in kind of a similar place as Holden Caulfield  I just think this book really hits hard with the strangeness of adolescence  Holden is testing the waters as an adult  but still so desperately wants to keep a grip on his childhood  He is whiny and frustrating and shallow  just like a real teenager  The best book I have ever read  Holden Caulfield cracks me up  It is a celebration of my cynical side  I loved every underwhelming  dry  sarcastic  witty  brilliant minute of this book  I can t wait to re read it again    I think one of the things I like best about this book is that the character is straightforward  and describes objects for a reason instead of those people who just noticed everything for no reason  There is obviously lots of symbolization and profanity  but they actually enhanced the character instead of making him a try hard  Could be read in different levels  the catcher in the rye is a marvelous book about teenage rebellions  independency  and family   As someone who s pretty much always had a reputation for underachieving and being just on the wrong side of belligerent  I connected with Holden Caulfield  What struck me more than anything about Holden s story was the appeal it held for me  Reading of Holden s experiences  I couldn t help but want them for myself  He has a hard knock at life   my class wasn t told just how hard until we reached the end of the book  Imagine my surprise  one of favorite characters to date and he s trapped in a nuthouse   As if that could phase my admiration for him   To me  Holden is the kind of person I want to be  Perhaps not with as much trauma as he suffered  but with that same sentiment of insight and knowledge that I associate with him  More than anything  I wanted to have Holden in my life  Inspired as I was by his story  and by his intellectual and emotional triumph  Holden Caulfield made me want more from life than what had begun to be expected of me  He made me want to be different and strange  even if it ended up with me in the nuthouse   Either you loved this book or you hated it  There s no in between  Personally  I loved it  I connected with Holden Caulfield  I felt what he felt and yes  his whining did get annoying after a while but for me  it just made the book more enjoyable  It was a bit bland due to its lack of plot but the character development of Holden was incredible  Oh man  this book is so great  This is another book I ve come to read again  I first read it in high school and I could completely relate to Holden and his disillusionment with the hypocrisy of the world around him  especially that of adults  His fascination with the innocence of children and his drive to protect them did not resonate  however  with me at the time Now that I ve reread the book  I find I have a much different take on it  I no longer identify with Holden  and I see now how very insulated his character is  how black and white his thinking is  how limited his experience with life  how juvenile his reaction to and rejection of everything around him  I now see that his need to protect the innocence of youth is his own self preservation instinct and his hapless attempts not to grow up and embrace an adult viewpoint  I ve read this twice before   in high school  when I loved it and read everything else Salinger wrote  In my 30s  when I thought  this is pretty bad   Now my daughter is going to read it for school  and I ll give it another try    see which impression still sticks  or if I have another reaction altogether Really enjoyed re reading this book  I have a completely different perspective on it now  as a parent of teenagers myself  It was also an interesting take on the late 40s early 50s  when a 16 17 year old boy felt underdressed when going out without a tie   I somehow escaped high school without reading this book  Out of a kind of morbid curiosity  why does everyone hate it    I decided it was time to read it  and I m glad I did  I might have also hated this book as a HS student  but as an adult entering English Ed  I liked it a lot  That doesn t mean I d just assign it and expect others to like it  but as a reader I found it empathy rich  psychologically complex and interesting  It s funny  too Yeah  not a whole lot  happens  and Salinger is careful not to deliver anything too satisfying  but I think the fun  and pain  of the novel is just figuring out Holden  who talks around  never about  his issues in a way that tells us a lot about what he s gone through and how he s using all these classic defense mechanisms as a result It s a novel where everything is complicated but coherent  and I m always down for a good  amusing character study like that  If I were to teach it to HS students  I d try to let them read it as uninterrupted as possible  Too much stopping for analysis would kill it  Readers need to give the narrative a chance to snowball  It feels weirdly relevant  Holden would have hated Facebook  but probably would have been addicted to it  It also pairs well with new YA by Gary Schmidt and others  Woah  I got to know the famous bastard  Holden Caulfield  What can I say  that sonuvabitch killed me  He was so hilarious but I think he didn t know he was  But he really was  As I imagined him saying those lines  I couldn t help but laugh and didn t care at all  As I laughed my ass against that goddam book  dammit Holden  people thought I was a crazy person  like you  When old Stradlater beat you up because you didn t stop horsing around him  the way you d pretend Maurice s punch as if he s put a bullet in your guts  that killed me  You know that  Also  the way you hated all the phonies at your school  the way you d describe Ackley s pimply face  the way you said to Sally s face that she was a pain in the ass  the time you gave your hunting hat to your little sister  old Phoebe W  Caulfield  the way you d always want to give Jane Gallagher a buzz but you couldn t do it because you re not in your goddam mood  the way you d love to be just the catcher in the rye  You re the funniest person I ve ever encountered with  And you re in that goddamm mental hospital This may sound crazy and phony but J D Salinger  you re a hero Sorry for my words  I got carried away  X My favorite book of all time  It s the book that that every other book is measured against for me  I love Holden  He is sad  broken and a loving character  I ve always rooted for him and in my mind  he is real  We pass by people day by day  We don t pay in mind who we pass  nor we meet  Eventually people in your social circle walk away from it  Replaced by new people you get to know and learn  This story reminds me of that  pour life isn t revolved around people  but the people you have meet  After they leave you are left with a sensation of regrets  Yet we keep moving on  Even if we don t want to  They are their own protagonist of their stories  We are just a part of their picture as well  All we can do is move on and live our own story  Even if it hurts us to do so  Change the time this was written and it could be a contemporary story  Loved it   The book Catcher in the Rye by J  D  Salinger is a story of an adolescent boy who runs away from real life problems  He flees from school onto the streets of New York  he proposes to a girl he then starts to hate  he smokes in his sister s room when their parents aren t home    etc  And it all happens in  almost  just one day  Although the book only covers the events of one and a half days  it gives us a nice ride nonetheless  The author never fails to make us empathize with and feel sorry for Holden  By the end of the book we know all we need to know about Holden  It really was fun getting to know him through this book  I strongly recommend this book  that is  if you haven t read it already  Even if you ve read it  read it again  This book never ceases to entertain me  I bought a copy for Natascha today  the one with the excellent first edition cover  not the boring one above  which is the one I read   Must remember to look up what Salinger had against cover designs   Natascha wanted to borrow it when she found out I was reading it  saying she was interested because this was the book that inspired Whatsisname Chapman to kill Lennon  I don t remember if this is true  but if she s expecting something dark and diabolical  she ll be disappointed  She ll be surprised that it s desperately funny  and if Chapman read this as an invitation to murder he s even crazier than I thought  Being phony isn t a deadly sin  But I do think it stands for  sin  here  The wholesale judging of people as phonies is the author s way to create a human environment that is as strange and alienating to Holden Caulfield as the shades in Hell are to Dante  actor   Like the Divine Comedy  Catcher in the Rye is not just about salvation  it s about the cycle of sin and salvation  Salinger s Beatrice is split in two  his younger brother and sister  Dante lost and found Beatrice  Holden lost his brother and found his sister  Beatrice s red dress is Holden s red hat  I could go on  but judging from the sheer number of books about Catcher in the Rye I m sure the comparison has already been made in exhausting detail   By Harold Bloom  maybe  Anyway  rightfully classic  IMO  And anyone giving this three stars or less is just a phony trying to be  different   But they don t have to die for it or anything  A slap on the wrist will do   About ten times  Once as a teenager  once when my kids were reading it in high school  and eight or nine times because Holden Caulfield is the imaginary best friend of the protagonist in my new novel in progress  Catcher  Caught  See www readwhitelies com and my blog for an excerpt from the draft  It won t look the same when it s picked up by Random House and makes the best seller list  I have a dream  I m no critic and probably couldn t add anything to the discussion about why this is the best book ever  However  if you did not like this book please unfriend me immediately and cease all communication  If you haven t read it because you grew up in a closet and then joined a cult that didn t allow secular books  I m sorry for your hardship but please be advised you re on friendship probation  We ll reconvene in 2 days after you ve finished the book and agree that it is indeed  the best book ever   I am tempted to write this review a la Holdenspeak  but I will resist  I read this book many years ago when I was a young teen  I loved it as many young people did  and felt Holden was speaking for me  I was inspired to reread it after just finishing the latest biography of J D  Salinger  As a matter of fact  while I was finishing the bio  I retrieved my old paperback and started it  Well  reader  I am happy to say that my  much  older self was just as moved as my youngerr self  perhaps in different ways  This time  I identified Salinger s voice as Holden after having learned more about him  For instance  Holden has a fictional brother named D B  This older brother is a writer who has  sold out  in Holden s eyes by going to Hollywood to write for the movies  As all Holden fans know  this made him a  phoney   Knowing now how Salinger felt about Hollywood  this briefly mentioned character stood out a bit more  Also  after learning about Salinger s deep interest in Zen Buddhism and other Eastern religions  I noticed a thread of that in this novel  But  above all  there is the miracle of Holden Caufield  Whatever else J D  Salinger did or did not accomplish in his years as a recluse  he gave us Holden  I m glad I finished reading this at an age where I can almost relate to how Holden feels about the adult world and all its  phoniness   I loved the part where he described how he wanted to be the  catcher in the rye  more than anything in the world because honestly that s how I felt when I was 16 too and sometimes  I still do  I still want to cling on to childhood  to innocence  to that place where we could just go on playing around without a care in the world  It reminded me how afraid I was if I d turn out to be one of the  phony  adults I criticized while at that age  I guess I m saying there s just this part of me that isn t ready to move on to adulthood and all its complexities  But also how like Holden expresed a little in the end how he realized there s really no going back  just moving forward and accepting it  I ve learned I ll learn to accept it too   Haha  still a bit on the process here  I ve just turned 20  lol   10th grade English  Page 38   You d have liked him   Almost made me cry for no reason  Felt like he was really reaching out of the book  conversing with the reader  And he talks to the reader quite often which I think is perfect for his personality because he always accuses people of being fake  and it would be quite fake to write a book  and pretend people aren t there reading it  like how actors never look right into the camera  the book never talks to the reader  it pretends to not notice someone s reading it  I think Holden would find that quite annoying And Holden thinks everyone is a phoney who isn t like him  but if anyone was like him he would accuse that person of being a phoney   The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger portrays the thoughts and experiences of the main protagonist  Holden Caulfield  At first glance  Holden seems to be a spoiled rich kid who acts like a grumpy old man  Though  as you read the novel  you begin to connect with Holden and start to understand that he is just a troubled teenager who needs love and attention The book begins with Holden being kicked out of Pencey Prep in Pennsylvania around Christmas time  Holden  not wanting to meet his angered parents  sends several days at a hotel  wandering aimlessly around New York  We watch as he meets two nuns  gets in a fight with an elevator man  pays for prostitute  all the while trying to make sense of his life  As I read the book  I slowly came to understand Holden s motivations and thoughts are not as  phony  and depressing as they seem  but there are deeper reasons for his actions Salinger s use of syntax and diction make this novel more interesting and fun to read  Even though  sometimes Holden s repeated use of slang and curse words make parts of the book annoying and hard to read  overall  the novel was well written and realistically portrayed a teenager s stream of consciousness  The Catcher in the Rye  explores innocence and corruption  childhood and adulthood  and many other themes that really changed the way I thought about the world  I highly recommend everyone read this book as the unique characters are easily relatable and easy to love   I really do   I first read this book in high school in the 1960 s and remembering laughing out loud in study hall  I recently picked the book up again and re read it  The vocabulary is outdated  we no longer refer to things as  swell  or  crumby   Other words such as  necking    sore   at someone    dough   for money sound funny But Holden Caulfield s teenage angst is as real now as it was when the book was written  Holden is a big mass of feelings that he doesn t know what to do with  He mocks phonies but also pities them  He is very sad over the death of a sibling but never really acknowledges it or has it acknowledged by anyone else  He feels the wonder of beauty but has not way to name it As we follow Caulfield during a three day period after he has learned that he s been kicked out of his third prep school  we watch as he tries to cope with sadness  disappointment  realization  and a hundred other emotions  We see how he loves  how he yearns to be part of things but cannot because he sees the futility of it all  We watch him as he wrestles with his life and his emotions  This book was funny and sad when I was 16 and it s still funny and sad when I m 63  The most coherently written book about an incoherent state of mind I chose to do this book for a school project and to be honest i didn t think i would like it very much i read reviews and that clouded my judgement  When i actually read the book boy was i wrong it really shows how i people have different views  Maybe its because i feel like i can relate to Holden but i can guarantee if i lived back then i would ve been calling people phony too  Some people might not live this book though you might find the main character too whiny or a hypocrite which he is but i love that but everyone has flaws  Loved the book   I never read such a beautiful book until now  Sometimes you can t tell why you like something  you just like it  And  The Catcher in the Rye  is a great example of that  I don t know what I liked the most  the simplicity with which this book is written  the main protagonist Holden or the love between him and his sister Phoebe  This book is full of innocence in spite of the language used   with which I don t have any problem  to be honest  The innocence of childhood  the confusion about what you want in life and the sheer hate for phony people by Holden just made me love him  I mean the guy is so sweet  one minute he kind of hates Ackley and the other minute he asks him to go outside with him just because Ackley never goes anywhere  I think that s what I liked most about him  because that happens to most of us  We can hate a person and at the same time we can you know be concerned about him too I loved how he kept worrying about the ducks in Central Park  and how he just adored children  I mean the way he talked about Phoebe and Allie  it showed his love for his kid brother and sister  I don t know why this book is banned  For me this book is something I would cherish for a long time maybe a lifetime  Read it for the second time  Still related to the character and I m aware that he s a depressed individual  it s the way he thinks that makes so much sense to me in so many ways  This has got to be my favorite book of all time  It really connects to the struggles of teenage life and especially what teenage boys go through  Holden is a little troubled by all the sexist things he has seen and heard as a adolescent and he wants to be  the catcher in the rye  so that he can save children from falling off the cliff toward the path of the teen years and ultimately into growing up  hwldn dwstdshtny wqty yh nfr mrdh bshh dlyl nmyshh khh adm dygh dwssh ndshth bshh  mkhSwS mwq y khh wn shkhS hzr drjh bhtr z admyy bshh khh mydwnym zndhn  One of the best books I have ever read  Salinger tells a story that all teenagers can relate to  Holden Caulfield is a lonely kid who is critical of the world around him  Although street smart  he is kicked out of his 5th school  Holden keeps people at a distance and refers to people who he doesn t respect as  old   He often calls adults phony because they are jaded and not as pure  On the other hand  children  Holden feels  are pure and innocent  capable of doing no wrong  The most well known scene in the novel portrays appearance vs reality as Holden pictures himself on the edge of a cliff with children playing in a field of rye  Since the children cannot see over the tall rye  Holden hopes to  catch  them if they ever stray from the rye and fall over into adulthood  becoming the  catcher in the rye   He often over imagines situations  as the novel constantly contrasts Holden s idea of how things are to the reality  Another powerful example was the juxtaposition between the hooker and Jane  Holden imagines Jane to be this prefect girl while in reality  he is in a dangerous situation with a hooker and her pimp  Holden keeps his distances from others but craves a personal  intimate relationship  Sometime he rides a taxi just to ease his loneliness   What happens to the ducks in winter  Where do they go   Holden asks one day  He isn t talking about the ducks  he s talking about  himself   What happens to me in the dead of winter  Where will I go  One of the most important quotes in the novel was when Holden went to the museum remarking   the thing I liked most about the museum was that it never changed  Everything stayed just where it was   Salinger demonstrates Holden s longing for the same  the past  Like Gatsby  Holden desire to stay in the past consumes him and he almost suffers a breakdown  His younger sister  Phoebe saves him  Despite being younger than Holden  Phoebe posses a maturity that some adults don t even have  By undergoing a catharsis brought on by Phoebe  Holden slowly begins to recover  Unfortunately  the book ends too soon  which is a shame because I was ready to keep going   Catcher in the Rye  is one book that I will be keeping on my shelves for years to come  4 5Un clasico que tiene que leer cualquier adolescente  o adulto   Lectura imprescindible  O Apanhador no Campo de Centeio J  D  Salinger Este e mais um daqueles livros que li quando ainda era  praticamente  um bebe e ainda nao tinha nocao de nada Comecei a ler este romance pelas razoes mais idiotas que voces podem imaginar  Claro que nao irei menciona las  nao quero me envergonhar e muito menos envergonhar quem estara lendo Admito que apesar das razoes estapafurdias  creio que fiz a melhor opcao ao ler o livro  Pq ele me fez refletir sobre muitas coisas  Obviamente nao tinha a menor ideia do assunto que se tratava o romance  quando comecei a ler  Por isso  minha mente estava aberta  sem nenhuma ideia ou preconceito sobre o texto E nao demorou muita  nas primeiras paginas fui arrebatada pelo senso de humor e pela revolta obvia de um adolescente como Holden  Hoje compreendo os momentos liricos e toda a revolta de Holden RECOMENDADISSIMO   ADORO    Was leaning towards 4 stars but sat back and contemplated the genius of this book that was written so long ago  yet incredibly timeless   Except for the phone booths maybe  Salinger used the first person with such ease I too felt Holden s angst  emotions and sense of humor  Never read it while young though I remember hearing a famous murderer was a fan of the book back then  Yikes Recommended by my teenage daughter who enjoyed it as well  I read it in two days time  yn pwl l nty hmyshh akhrsh Hl admw mygyrh  hmh chy amdh s wsh sqwT khsy khh lHZh y tw  mrsh dnbl chyzy mygrdh khh mHyTsh nmytwnh bhsh bdh y fqT khyl mykhnh khh mHyTsh nmytwnh bhsh bdh wsh hmynm z jstjw ds mykhshh  mtwjh myshy  One of the best books ever  Everyone goes through a time  mostly in their teens  where they are full of angst and apathy  It could be a few weeks  it could be a few years  Catcher in the Rye really catches it  I personally think it s stupid this book has been banned before because nothing that offensive really happens  It s tame compared to most fiction out there since like 1970  And even at the time it was written  the book was tame compared to almost everything happening in real life  He says damn and hell a few times  that s about the worst it gets  Salinger has great writing  character development  and keeps you turning the page  Even if you couldn t relate to Holden Caulfield personally  you have got to know someone who could  My favorite scene  without giving any spoilers  is when he s in the hotel room looking out into other people s windows and sees really weird stuff  This is one of the first books I recommend to others if they haven t read it  The Catcher in the Rye was far beyond my expectations  It approaches a handful of subjects that are frequently doubts in the life of most teenagers  at least mine   It covers education  religiosity  relationships  sexual life  and also not knowing which path to follow in life  and even more  It all is experienced by a teenage boy from New York  quite wealthy  who struggles to find a place where he feels like he belongs to  Where people aren t  phony   Where he can find truthfulness I identified myself quite a lot with Holden  And the book is very well written  Lovely reading  I stayed awake until 4 in the morning to finish this book  It was worth it  Here s the thing  Caufield IS a phony  He is the exact person that he despises  because he is unable to find his true identity  He spends his life wandering    a spectator of the ever changing environment and people around him  He admires his classmates  family  and previous teachers  complimenting their poise and perspectives of life  yet shows his own insecurities with himself as he throws backhanded compliments after honoring his peers  characters  Caufield is the typical depressed human being  unaware of what it is HE truly wants out of his existance  because he is too preoccupied worrying about the existance of the others surrounding him  He spirals down deeper and deeper into depression  getting headaches each time solutions to his current detrimental lifestyle are presented by idoled teachers and his sister Phoebe  He almost seems as though he has had a traumatic experience with a sexual predator as a child as he becomes so interested in other s sex lives and feels any bit of anxiety when he feels physically violated  Holden Caufield is the definition of a man who has no sense of his own value or purpose in life  and without the support of his loved ones such as Pheobe  and guidance by past teachers  his depression will ultimately lead him to suicide  The book is about finding your own soul purpose on this earth and taking action  because every one has their own fate and agenda  and once one finds what makes them happy  they are able to excel without the worries of how everybody else is living their lives  I m so glad I finally read this  I felt so close to Holden cause he s literally like I am and I also think this is one of the best books ever  LOVE IT   For me  it all started here  This was the first book that made me defy my mother s order that I go to bed so that I could stay up reading it  It was the first book that made me identify so strongly with a character that I realized that fiction is not about the events on the page  but about the reader himself  Most importantly  it was the first book that really made me want to go out and read other books  I haven t revisited The Catcher in the Rye since that summer before tenth grade  It s likely that I d want Holden Caulfield to shut up and grow up  Still  this book will always serve as a powerful reminder of what it was like to be young  angry  and disillusioned with the world  I ll admit I didn t think I would like this book initially  Somehow I seemed to avoid it throughout my years of studying literature  but finally decided to pick it up on my own accord  Generally stream of consciousness novels don t interest me  but Catcher in the Rye truly piqued my interest After more thought  I m beginning to understand why it s taught in so many schools  except  of course  my 10th grade English class   The entire time Holden self consciously goes around worrying about growing up  being responsible  falling short  even though he does on so many occasions   being phony and acting childish  He s stuck in this middle ground of not knowing how to behave and constantly judging others for how they behave  He knows what he doesn t want to be  he just doesn t have a grasp on who he actually is or the kind of person he wants to be  That resonates so strongly with the entire high school and college questions of identity and self formation Salinger does a fantastic job of demonstrating all of this through imagery  dialogue  symbolism and of course  nearly 300 pages of stream of consciousness  I would read this story again in a heartbeat  My only regret is that it took me so long to finally pick it up  Just read it again for the    th time and still love this story  So interesting to read it through a different lens 30  years after my first time  Such a shame that so many of us won t be around in 2060 to read Salinger s   OCEAN FULL OF BOWLING BALLS  the prequel to CATCHER   It s really difficult to understand the whole meanings  But I still really like it for not only the originality ending used but also D   his lifestyle  Sometimes I saw me in this novel  so selfish and so cold  It s a book of my  the books must read before I die  list  and never regret it  Lo primero  no se que pensar de este libro  Me ha sorprendido que siendo un clasico del siglo XX  describa totalmente como son los adolescentes de hoy en dia  En la mayoria de los libros te encuentras con adolescentes de 16 anos hablando con palabras demasiado rebuscadas  y digamoslo  eso no es asi en la realidad  Por eso mismo me ha gustado tanto este libro  sabe analizar completamente a un adolescente al que estan expulsandole todos los dias del colegio y que no sabe realmente lo que quiere ser la vida  Repite mucho cosas como   y eso      y tal    justamente como muchos de los adolescentes de hoy en dia  me incluyo  hablan  Ha sido impresionante la forma de psicoanalizar todo  como suelta verdades como si nada  como te lee la mente  Supongo que esto ya es mas personal  pero este libro me define  sabe como soy  como pienso  Este libro soy yo  Y por eso me ha gustado tantisimo   4 5 Stars  I think I ll try to sum this book up in a couple sentences  This book is written from the cynical and rather depressing and slightly perverted point of view from seventeen year old Holden Caulfield  who hates everything except for english and his little sister Phoebe  and who s just been kicked out of his school  Pencey Prep  for flunking every subject except for english  Holden calls everyone a sonuvab tch  everything and everyone a phonie y  or says that everybody s  old   in the friend sense  before knowing them  T be honest  I ve never met anybody so cynical in both the real world  media world and literal world  and for that I applaud J D Salinger  The last sentence of the book leaves me thinking  HOLY COW  This book was damn good   Holden Caulfield I m not sure I would have appreciated this book as much if I had read it as a teenager   or maybe reading it would have made me a completely different person  We ll never know I guess  My favorite excerpt That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may  think  there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive  in fact  An internal monolog of teenage angst and depression J D  Salinger s landmark novel is a completely original beast  As the inner workings of Holden Caulfield s mind are slowly reveled and his struggles with identity and purpose are laid out over the course of a few days in New York  the book becomes something remarkable  Holden is a young man with no where to go and only failure in his wake  tossed out of another in a series of schools he finds himself slipping into a dark place of depression and self loathing  His life seems pointless in his own mind and he finds almost no joy in his surroundings and company  finding the littlest faults and annoyances in ever person he encounters  The path he walks is a tortured glimpse into the head of the quintessential depressed teenager  raging hormones  inner struggles  and thoughts of inferiority  I was sadden  and moved by this poignant interesting look into the mind of a boy on the verge of manhood  The ending was one of the most emotional powerful and thoughtful few pages in memory  a powerful window into the blackness of depression and the joy that can be found in the end  I remember reading this book in school and thinking that I ve been there  Not getting expelled  getting my money stolen by a hooker pimp  but feeling lost and wondering about what it all means at a very young age after the death of a sibling  I can see why kids are still forced to read it  and I can see why it makes some people uncomfortable  but I think it s a book that should be read in school  The Catcher in the Ryeby J D  Salinger  Holden Caulfield is a sixteen year old boy with grey hair  When Holden was around 12 years old  his little brother died  Holden goes through his whole life thinking it should of been himself that died  The death of his brother plays a huge role in how Holden thinks and his actions throughout the book  He has recently been kicked out of school  for the fourth time   due to failing classes  Holden decides to leave his school a little early and explore the notorious New York City before he goes home to face his ruthful parents  Throughout the novel  Salinger takes the reader through the marvelous city  and the reader gets to meet all of Holden s acquaintances  including graceful nuns and reckless prostitutes  From watching frivolous movies  to drinking illegally in nightclubs  to going to grand museums with his sister  Holden has quite the adventure  Holden is a curious boy who is concerned with why the world works like it does  Holden Caulfield does not want to grow up and he wants to save the innocence of the world  he wants to be the catcher in the rye  In the novel  he often says how he hates  phony  things and  phony  people  He is down to earth and an imaginative boy who is great at writing  The Catcher in the Rye is a great novel about a confused teenager wanting to live the best life he can   J D  Salinger did an amazing job of writing as if he were a sixteen year old boy  He used colloquials in the perfect spots  The writing was so descriptive  but not in a way that draws the reader away from the plot  Salinger often repeated a lot of things throughout this novel  just like a young boy would  I liked how it was written because you could understand that Caulfield had angst and was very confused  but Salinger did not out right say it  He left clues throughout the book like when Holden says   I swear to God I am a madman   174   Caulfield is a swanky  charming boy and I really fell in love with his thoughts and his character  which really made the book an overall amazing read   One part I did not like about the book  is that you never find out if Holden is mentally disabled  One can surmise that the death of his brother really affected him  He mentions that he is psychoanalyzed  but you never find out what the prognosis is  I think it is fun to have to guess what happened to main characters in books  and create an ending for yourself  But my one con  would be that I wanted to know if there was something wrong with Holden mentally   This novel was not an intended feminist novel  although it did have some feminist aspects  At one part of the story  Holden pays for a prostitute  But when she comes  Holden does not want to do anything with her as he says   I felt more depressed than sexy   She was depressing   125   Holden feels bad for this women and does not want to see her being used and objectified  Holden also mentions how he hates how men abuse relationships with women  He hates when they keep  necking  on a girl even when they tell them to stop  He says that he does not want to love a girl unless he really  truly loves her  He wants to hold a girl s hand  and know her personality and not just take advantage of her  Throughout the novel  Holden expresses that he does not understand women but that he wants to  This novel is not really a feminist book  because it focuses more on Holden s life as a teenage boy   This book reminds me a lot of The Great Gatsby  It even felt like Gatsby  as I held it and read the same font  Both Holden and Nick  from Gatsby  are confused about how life works  They both meet interesting people and sort of go through an epiphany  Holden even mentions The Great Gatsby at one point when he says   I was crazy about The Great Gatsby  Old Gatsby  Old sport  That killed me   183   Both stories had the same quick pace and the same alliteration  Gatsby and Holden had the same swanky style  Both novels are two of my favorites   I absolutely loved this novel  As a senior about to start a whole new life it made me think about innocence  It made me think about how I really am not ready to grow up either  I would recommend this novel to everyone but especially to teenagers  It is so relatable to that peer group  It was beautifully written and made me ponder about life  I think I am even going to read it again at the end of the year   I was probably fifteen or sixteen when I read this book  I had to read it for my High School Honors English class  I don t remember a whole lot about the story line or exactly what happened  All I remember is that I loved it  I loved the story  and I think a big influence on why I loved this story was because we discussed it in my class  Discussion happens a lot in a high school English class  however  I felt like ours was different  For a first  we all WANTED to be there  we all wanted to read and learn  Second  our teacher really got a lot out of us and had us thinking  as fifteen and sixteen year olds  about things normal kids our age would never think about  This most definitely influenced my understanding of this book  I will also say  that the majority of my class hated the book  I have read some reviews recently about this book and have decided that I probably related to the character at the time  as I believe he was about fifteen or sixteen  right  After thinking about this book  I have ultimately decided I need to re read it k  I remember reading this book a long time ago and liking it but not really knowing why  Maybe it was because I was a middle schooler and I knew this book was banned in many places  and thought it was cool to read a book that used a lot of swear words  But after reading it a second time I am impressed for an entirely different reason  I m impressed that I could actually like such an unlikable character  I m amused that I could be so enthralled in a book that basically has no plot  The author gave such a vivid slice of life and it left me wanting more  I look forward to reading this book again in another 15   20 years and seeing what my reaction to it is then  But mostly  I just look forward to reading it again  With an alienated narrator like Holden Caulfield  The Catcher in the Rye is one of the books that high school students try the most to relate to  Whether it can be considered a good thing or not  Holden is a cynical young adult trying to figure out the  phony  world around him  For some students  it can be refreshing to have a narrator who doesn t see life through a bright and shiny lens  Holden is also good at recapping events that happen to him in a way that can make a reader laugh out loud  He sheds his opinions on school  girls  love  family  and the world in an original and impacting story that growing students can learn a lot from   Reading Holden Caulfield and his sensibility  I just felt like i was reading my mind when i was 15  or even now i sometimes still can feel it  The feeling when you are walking across the street and suddenly feel like you gonna be far far apart from everyone   you try to stretch your arms but reach nothing  when you are being with your beloved young sister  when you feel yourself like a strayed wanderer  crawling for just a peace in your mind   something as peace as you were the catcher in the rye  Somehow  the loneliness in this story reminds me about Norwegian Wood and the endless loneliness in Murakami s other novels  This book is about a teenage boy  written for everybody   Holden n  Me A Book Review of The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  For generations Holden Caulfield  the  misfit hero  of J D  Salinger s highly renowned novel The Catcher in the Rye  has become the symbol of the alienated youth  For me this comic  irreverent  disturbed teenager gave me insight on growing up  the maturity it entails and taught me to seek my own identity in relation to an external world with which I found myself at variance Published to wide acclaim in 1951  the novel features a teenager talking about his innermost concerns     a somewhat eccentric literary device noted by critics during the time  Contemporary readers might easily fit the book in the Young Adult Fiction genre  a category that includes serious novels dealing with teenage characters written with a teenage audience in mind  Such books maybe common today  but in the 50s there s no such classification  Furthermore  the chief protagonist spoke in a manner that was easily recognizable as genuine  and he talked about matters that were serious enough to make even the most casual reader a bit uncomfortable  One of those matters was his inability to fit in the world of adults  Salinger attracted the attention of the reading audience because he was breaking new ground  As this is the first time I ve read the book  I tried to envision the impact the book had during its publication  I m surprised that the more I got to know of Holden and the world he inhabits the more I was reminded and got to know more of myself The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age story   with a twist  Holden is a sixteen year old prep student who has flunked out of school the week before Christmas  Several days before he s expected home for Christmas vacation  he leaves school  planning to spend some time on his own on New York City  where he lives  As events unfold we see him struggling  Part of this struggle is his resentment of the adult world  as he resists entry into it  yet reality dictates otherwise for he has little choice  In Holden s point of view he lives in an unstable and superficial or to use his term   phony  society  He rejects school because it is artificial  lacking depth and warmth  His loneliness and rebellion come from his passive rejection of the false conventions and materialistic values that surround him  He also struggles with family and class expectation Society and his own body are telling him that it is time to change  He is attracted to the trappings of adulthood  booze  cigarettes  the idea of sex  and a kind of independence  But he despises the compromises  the loss of innocence  absence of integrity  and loss of authenticity in the adult world  Holden can t see himself in that role Part of Holden s collapse is due to his inability to come to terms with death  This is demonstrated when he speaks to his younger brother Allie     who died three years before the events in the novel and whom he had idealized     in moments of stress  as if he is still alive  thoughts of Allie lying in his grave in the cemetery in the rain  surrounded by dead bodies and tombstone also haunt Holden  He wants to stop time itself  He want beautiful moments to last forever  using as his model the display glass at The Museum of Natural History  in which the same people are shown doing the same things year after year  He also seeks escape  but his solution  avoiding reality  is impossible  Life is change  Yeah  I know this a phony cliche adults usually say   His feelings are typical adolescent feelings shared by virtually everyone who is or ever been his age  One of the reasons readers like Holden is that he is so candid about what he feels In this respect Holden did remind me of my former self back in high school  I thought then that I would never age and that all the happy times in this world will last  Yes  I know I was too dumb back then  My interest in everything that preoccupies any adolescent my age stems from youthful search for experience and freedom  This undefined interest in things demonstrates my  at least  undeveloped sensibilities  At this age I thought I knew everything  but mistakes in life I guess served me better More importantly  what makes Holden one memorable literary creation is his peculiar way of speaking  In essence Salinger was trying to capture the speech patterns of the typical teenager in the 1950s  This manner in which Holden expresses himself is a subtle device used to reveal his character and also gives us many important insights into his personality  His loose  rambling speech reflects his own inner confusion  He often seems unwilling or afraid to say exactly what he feels  first  because he doesn t know what he feels  and  second  because he is afraid of revealing himself to a world that is either indifferent to him or out to ruin him  The way he speaks is also his means to dissociate himself from the so called phonies  who use language to hide from their feelings Holden s secret goal is to be the  catcher in the rye  when his younger sister Phoebe asked him what he wanted to do with his life  this response also contains the source of the book s title  In this metaphor he envisions a field of rye standing by a dangerous cliff  Children play in the field with joy and abandon  If they should come too close to the edge  however  Holden is there to catch them  Far fetched as it may sound  this fully expresses his urge to protect the vulnerable and their innocence personified by Phoebe and his childhood friend Jane Galagher  His image deals with children because no one is more susceptible than they are  But his urge to protect extends to everyone because he wants to prevent everyone from getting hurt  I ve also noticed that his name  Holden Caulfield  is a pun on this theme   hold  in  field  Holden does evolve toward the end of the novel  His acceptance of Phoebe s need to  grab for the gold ring  indicates that he sees her as a maturing individual who must be allowed to live her own life and take her own risks  At this point  he finally sees that children have to do this  and adults must let them  That s a step forward from believing that he must be their protector  For better or worse  Holden s own maturation has begun  He seems ready to surrender to the inevitability of growing up  He is exhausted  physically and emotionally  ready to go home and collapse Holden may or may not have progressed enough  learned enough  matured enough at the sanitarium to make it in the future  We cannot know how he will be in the future  Salinger does not serve the reader your typical  happy  ending  We can never say nor will never know what the prospect will be for Holden and as he says so in the final chapter   I mean how do you know what you re going to do till you do it   In that way  the novel is more realistic  more lifelike and authentic than some representatives of the genre Many have stated that reading The Catcher in the Rye has been a corner stone in their life  and it may have become an understatement to say that this book is life changing  For me I m forever grateful for this slim novel for reminding me of what I used to be  or the semblance of it  and relearning from it that growing up is the only way and it involves a lot of understanding and maturity on our part without compromising our integrity in a society that may or may not be similar to that of Holden s  This is a book that grows in you and along with you  Different interpretations always comes up when one crack opens the book and our appreciation of it deepens from multiple rereading  That s precisely what makes The Catcher in the Rye a force in literature especially for such a one that is complex and richly ambiguous in that it may mean many things to different people This Holden kid kills me  He s got a hold in me ___________________Published by Little  Brown Books  Mass Market Paperback 214 PagesStarted  May 24  2010Finished  May 28  2010My Rating   The Catcher in the Rye was interesting  I did not expect to be sucked into this book so quickly  Immediately from the first couple of lines I was so interested  From being written straight after WWII I was surprised at how accurately J D  Salinger captured teen s essence and speech  He talks about what every teenager goes through and what every teenager thinks at least once in their life  It was interesting to read this book because so many of my idols have read it and loved it  One of the bands I love is named  Pencey Prep   before I didn t really make the connection until I saw the mention of it in the book and by the lead singer  Then I realised and put together a few things  this book is about angst and growing up and basically not caring about what anyone thinks anymore  The band  Pencey Prep is about that as well  They re full of angst and don t care  I loved Catcher in the Rye  and I recommend to everyone   The Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books of all time  The book is about a boy named Holden Caulfield narrates the story  His story talks about a few days of his sixteen year old life right after he s been expelled from his prep school  Holden is a very stubborn  arrogant boy who doesn t know who he is  He has this rough exterior but throughout the story  you start to see that he does have a different side and that he s lonely  For a boy having a rough exterior  he finds simple joy in holding hands with the girl he likes  This book takes a lot to get into  I remember the first time I read it in high school  I didn t like it  I recommend this book to not everyone  but older students because the material discussed and Holden s way of telling his story can be hard to understand  Like I said before  I love this book  I even want to name my first son Holden  Holden s story will make you dislike him but then learn to love him  The Catcher in the Rye was written by J D  Salinger  This story is about a sixteen year old boy named Holden Caufield  It takes place in the 1950s in New York at the end of fall  Holden just finished a semester at his current school  Pencey prep school in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  This is his fourth school he s been to  because he s failed out of the last three he attended and has failed out of all of his classes at Pencey and got expelled  Holden is told to return to his home in Manhattan but can t go back for three days  Holden goes to say goodbye to his favorite history teacher and becomes upset while speaking with him and decides to go home early but not tell his parents he s back just yet Holden spends three days in the Edmont hotel in New York  He meets up with old friends and past girlfriends and as he spends these three days by himself he decides he wants to leave home for good  One night  Holden is out with a friend of his named Carl Luce  They went to a bar had a few drinks and Holden got drunk  While he was drunk  he wasn t thinking and decided to sneak into his own apartment and visit his little sister  His little sister s name is Pheobe  Holden went their to tell Pheobe that he hated school and that he got expelled  She got upset with him and told him to leave the apartment  The next day  Holden sent his little sister a note saying to meet him for lunch at the museum  In his note he added that he was leaving home for good and wasn t returning  When his little sister met him at the museum  she showed up with a bag packed and asked him to take her with him  He denied her request  In the end  Holden doesn t run away from  but he starts a new school in the fall and is very optimistic about his future I enjoyed this book very much  I felt like I could relate to some things with Holden because he s a sixteen year old boy  just like me  There were a few things that were much different though  Especially since this takes place in the 1950s  For example  in the book Holden goes out for a alcoholic drink with his friend and gets drunk  People my age aren t allowed to do that until they are 21  This book taught me that you should be grateful for what you have and you shouldn t take everything for granted  But  overall it s a great story and I highly recommend this book for teenagers   dang  done reading and full of swear  youth can t never resist that  by the way  it is just me or all the readers would think themselves as Holden  I ve read some previous reviews on this book  and honestly  you either love it or you hate it  Put simply  you either identify with the main character or you don t  I read this book when I was seventeen years old  and at that time  I was a senior in high school on my way to college and still trying to find myself  At that time  I identified strongly with the main character in a multitude of ways  I felt I was at just the right point in my life to make a connection with Holden  Had I read it any younger  I may not have understood some of the hardships he was going through  If I read it today  I would not relate with Holden  but I would remember a time of my life when I did  I am glad that I read it when I did  I actually read it for AP English and did a project on it  I fell in love with this book then  I was so tired of reading the classical books like Frankenstein  Although I enjoyed the deeper meaning of those books  it was nice to finally read something real that I could actually relate to  This book helped me see that good books usually always have a character that you can relate to  and I started paying closer attention to the characters in books I read after this book  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone going through a period of self discovery during their teenage years  even college years  I had never heard of Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye prior to my 12th grade English class where we had to read it for the novel study unit  From my understanding of how my teacher explained the book  it was black and white   you either liked it a lot or you despised it  After reading the book I was extremely amazed and astounded  The reason why I really enjoyed this book was because of its uniqueness  first person narrative which gave it much depth and authenticity  and its practicality  By  practicality  I mean how true to life the novel was since Holden  the 16 year old protagonist  is going through some hard times  He is flunking out of school due to his frivolous behaviour and bad grades  he thinks everyone is a  phony  because he believes they are fake  he has a hard time connecting with people and generally tends to isolate himself and spend time alone  and many other things  As you can see Holden is clearly having an identity crisis as customary of a teenager  I was able to identify with Holden because I felt that me and him were going through almost the exact same problems  and because of this I thoroughly enjoyed the book  Although some might say there is no plot to this book  I say that a book such as this does not need a plot  This book is about life  it vividly paints the picture of a teenager struggling with developing an identity for himself  Life does not have plot  it does not have a beginning  middle  and end  in fact  life is clustered and random and things happen here and there that do not correlate  Forget about the fantasy  romance  thriller  sci fi  and all other plot driven books time to pick up something that is real  unique and just so beautiful   subway progress    I first read this book in high school  and had decided to pick it up once again  It speaks volumes to the alienation of youth in a fast paced engaging prose  For those who read this growing up  it is worth another look from an adult perspective  You ll be amazed at how different your reaction will be from the first time you read it  This is one of those books where your interpretation changes as you yourself change  I guess that means that you have less sympathy for the character  an angst ridden adolescent  the older and more mature you get This book portrays Holden Caulfied as the paradoxical  all knowing totally confused  adolescent  The story takes place over a period of several days after Caulfield has been expelled from prep school  His cynical observations on his sorry state of affairs and his contempt for teachers  phonies and apparently all adults in general ring amazingly contemporary despite the book s being nearly 50 years old  It was a very insightful book  it made me think a lot  Since this a book clearly written way back then  the style and wording of this novel was confusing  but is a really nice break from all of the other books written now  I don t remember it much  but I remember that I enjoyed it very much when I read it  There is something about saving little falling children    The quinessental novel of my angst filled teen years  Holdan Caulfield being the first character out of a novel that seemed real  What can I say  I could really identify with Holden  even the feelings and emotions that I d rather not  He s bitingly and brutally honest  unapolagetic in a way that at times seems self depricating yet I could relate to him  Especially the fact that he feels emotionally attatched to the people around him even if he doesn t want to necessarily be interacting with anyone  I can definately relate to that  Holden Caulfield  Fuck you  Re reading The Catcher in the Rye was rediscovering the exhilarating experience of being swept along for the ride with a book  and living every minute  Compassionate  sensitive  funny as hell sometimes  and sad as life itself can be  layer upon layer of emotions evoked by the sheer  un phoniness  of its protagonist  It s the detail that gets you  the ability to see the little things that move you to bits and that are hard for most of us to put into words  unless we re J D  Salinger  Brilliant   The novel  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  involves a 16 year old boy  Holden Caulfield  who despises the type of people in the world who have their lives all figured out before the age of twenty five  He calls these people   phonies   Holden meets a lot of so called   phonies  over the course of three days on what he calls   madman  adventures in New York City just before Christmas  and after being expelled from a prestigious boarding school  Pensey Academy in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  Despite this novel s sexual content and illegal substance use  The Catcher in the Rye s overall plotline kept me interested and involved  as if Holden was speaking to me himself The content throughout the novel involved a high maturity level  thus is why the book is rated as  challenged   There are scenes in the book involving prostitutes  sexual references  inappropriate language and drug and alcohol use as a minor  In my opinion  the book s theme is defending the innocence of children of the world  which it reveals in the title  which comes from a poem called   Coming thro  the Rye   by Robert Burns  Holden overhears a little boy singing this song when he was out in New York City with his little sister  Phoebe  whom he adores  and makes him feel happier than he was  Holden s goal in life was to be the catcher in the rye  meaning  he wants to be the one to save the children  who are playing in a field of rye next to a cliff   I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye    and  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   173  To me there is symbolism in this  I believe that Holden is trying to save the children from growing up and entering adulthood  which is the trouble Holden is facing  and he does not want to see little kids turn out like him  thus is why he would want to save them  Some people who have also given a review on this book have said that the sexual content and Holden s negativity were not needed in the story  I completely disagree because I feel it gave Holden a realistic feature that most young men throughout the world deal with  the frustration with others  his opinions  and his sexual beliefs  All of these factors make Holden human and keep the story interesting The beginning of the story was slow but it was just an introduction into the main plot  which I didn t mind  I found that in the story there are three plots  The beginning where Holden introduces himself and what he is all about  then it goes onto Holden telling you about his expulsion and his adventures  and lastly it ends up with him reminiscing about the people he told you about and how he misses them  The writing style in this book was very casual  using vocal fry   like   forcing you to think like a teenager  and because I am a teenager  it felt very natural to read this book  Overall I rate the book as enjoyable and encourage anyone who has the maturity level to add The Catcher in the Rye to their reading list  I feel as though it could relate to the struggles teenage boys experience even today  To read this book  the maturity level is found to be high  and I do not recommend this book for anyone who is not willing to read about what goes on in a teenage boy s mind per say  Holden Caulfield s story  written in a judgmental  picky tone elicits a detailed analyzation of everyone around him from the reader  It is written entirely from this singular character s perspective  allowing one to predict and follow certain moods of the book  Though notoriously controversial  I felt that the novel was brilliantly written  The way it used Caulfield s emotions and thoughts to move the plot along really brought me further into it  The majority of the events that occurred during his travels weren t verbose  they appeared in a voice that wasn t impressive in it s vocabulary or description  but rather it s significance to the book  The final concept of the Catcher in the Rye that interested me the most was adolescence  I was fascinated by the different examples of youth throughout the book  from characters like Ackley and Stradlater to an older Carl Luce  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed reading every part of it  and it furthered my interest in writing   Must be one of the most enjoyable novel to read ever  I blizted through it in two days and after I closed it  the first thing I thought was that I should read it again  I kept having the impression that I missed the point Eventually I realized that he was the one who needed to be caught in the rye  Phoebe  Mr  Antolini and to some extent Sally played important roles in keeping his feet on the ground   in keeping him from falling off the cliff as he was playing around  I was clued in to this as I remembered the reference to  Out of Africa  which is the story of a woman who somehow gets stuck in Africa and thanks the people who helped her escape and made her life bearable while she was there once she returs home   or at least that is what I gathered from a friend who read this book   I would give this book more than five stars if I could  The Catcher in the Rye  an adult novel  is based on the life of Holden Caulfield  who experiences setbacks in his life since the beginning of his secondary school  Caulfield  the protagonist of the novel tells how he views the world of his own  one filled with complete detest for people around him  in a very lousy  casual and informal language  This novel is not extra ordinary because of the story in it  for one  I might think there s no point in the story of this novel  but how Caulfield converses with the reader in an extremely casual way  quite often swearing and using the vulgar language  such as uttering the words like  bastard    flitt  etc   in it  The novel is at most perfect in developing transitions between different episodes and events  A revolutionary kind of person or the one who has lost all hope in his life at a young age will definitely  feel  that this novel has expressed his sentiments about the general behaviour of different types of people in ways he could not  The Catcher in the Rye is certainly one of the best novels of the 20th Century that I have read to date  Hola  Hola  no se como sentirme acerca de este libro  Hola  Hola  acabo de terminarlo  Hola  no se que hacer  Hola  As I read Catcher In the Rye  I thought of other  even more contemporary retellings of the experience of having a mental breakdown  The books Girl Interrupted and Perks of Being a Wallflower came to mind  and  less so  Ken Kesey s One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest  What sets Catcher In the Rye apart is the confessional quality of the narrative  There s an immediacy and urgency to the story  told in first person  as we witness Holden Caulfield struggle to hold his thoughts together  I wish I had read Catcher In the Rye in high school because it almost feels as though Holden is addressing someone his own age  albeit through the lens of someone who has gone through hell  at least the hell in his own mind  the hell of having a breakdown  the hell of knowing he s once again let his parents down by failing and being kicked out of school  The decision to write in the first person point of view probably would have seemed even more daring when this was first published in 1945  and J D Salinger draws the reader in sentence by sentence  building on seemingly innocuous statements  making observations such as   These intellectual guys don t like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless they re running the whole thing   At first this makes Holden seem merely disaffected and disenfranchised  and his rambling makes sense to us as he critiques all the  phonies  he encounters  all the  phonies  in the world of privilege  Holden is part of that world and at the same time he keeps himself apart  critiquing everything that s wrong around him  He s failing his classes in part because he refuses to conform  but it s the quirkiness of the narrative voice that compels you to read further  to find out not only what will happen to Holden Caulfield  but also to find out whether he will be able to hold his increasingly fractured thought process together Late in the evening  Holden crosses paths with Mr  Antolini who warns him   This fall I think you re riding for  it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom   As much as Holden tries to pretend he doesn t care  we get the sense that deep down  he does  very much  and Salinger makes this clear to us when Holden sneaks home to see his little sister Phoebe  The title Catcher In the Rye mirrors Holden Caulfield s fears for himself  He wants to save children from falling over cliffs  and as he tells Phoebe   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in his big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean  except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  The reality is that Holden isn t looking where he is going  and he is heading for that cliff himself  Before I begin talking about the classic J D  Salinger novel  The Catcher in the Rye   I want to warn you that this is a school report  so it includes a brief summary of most of the book  I went into this book completely blind  with no knowledge of the plot  characters  or anything  really  and that is the way the book is best enjoyed  So  if you are considering reading  The Catcher in the Rye  for the first time  do yourself two favors  1  Read it  and 2  Don t look at the rest of this review  as this is a story best told to the unsuspecting mind  Anyway  for those of you who either have read it or are my teacher  here goes  The Catcher in the Rye  follows witty sixteen year old Holden Caulfield  a sarcastic  pessimistic young man whose negative view of people and the world often lead into trouble  Holden is a heavy smoker  and his unusually tall height and grey hair gets him into a few more bars than he s worth  The book begins with Holden flunking out of his school in Pennsylvania  Pencey Prep  He packs up his things after talking to a few  phonies  in his dorm so he can spend the next few days before he returns home on the opposite side of New York City as his family s apartment  He starts walking to the train station  of course after shouting  Sleep tight  ya  morons  down the hall  After a train ride full of shooting the crap to the lady sitting next to him  he gets a room in a cheap hotel and observes the strange things the people in the building next to him are doing through the window  Even though it is quite late  he isn t tired so he decides to head down to the  Lavender Room   the hotel s nightclub   The band in the club is putrid  and there aren t many people  but he finds an odd trio of girls to dance with for a while  He decides that the  Lavender Room  is too phony for him  so he catches a cab down to  Ernie s   the popular nightclub named after its star piano player  Once again  Holden decides that the place is packed with phonies  so he walks back to the hotel  He is greeted by the odd elevator man  Maurice  on the way to his floor  who offers him a prostitute for five dollars  It is against Holden s principles  but he s depressed from all the phonies and thinking he s been doing  so he agrees  In his room  he combs his hair and gets himself looking spiffy  but once she shows up he starts feeling even more depressed  He tries talking to her for a while  but winds up just giving her five dollars and turning her away  A little later  Maurice shows up at his room  claiming it was ten dollars  not five  and that Holden owes him another five dollars  When Holden continues to insist it was five  Maurice takes five bucks out of Holden s wallet  punches him in the stomach  and leaves  After a short sleep until morning  Holden calls up an old friend of his  Sally Hayes  and makes a date with her to go see a play later  He meets her at 2 00 outside of the theater  and they go in to see the show  Afterwards they go ice skating  and then go into the bar next door to chat  Holden begins to fantasize  and tell her about how they should run away to Vermont  and how they can live along a brook and get married  She is horrified with the idea  and they begin to argue  After Holden begins insulting her directly  she tells him to go away  So  he stands up and leaves  This is as far as I want to summarize  because after this the plot begins to resolve as Holden approaches the end of his time before returning home  Now  I want to emphasize how a summary does not do this book much good  It is not an action packed book by any means  What makes it so special is the way Salinger so cleverly gets you into Holden s head  You understand why he feels the way he feels  and why he does what he does  even if it isn t the right thing to do  You find yourself constantly agreeing with Holden  and by the end of the book you really feel as if you were a part of this character for a few days  Even if you think you have nothing in common with Holden  you always feel somehow connected to him  This is a book most people can enjoy and connect with  because Holden is such an understandable character   The Catcher in the Rye  is a book that is a true classic for a reason  A brilliant character  clever writing  and a simple  accessible plot make this novel one that can be enjoyed by many   I know that a bunch of people that have read this book believe that Holden needs to grow up and stop complaining and get his life togther and yada  yada  yada   but who the hell really wants to grow up  But  I think people don t see how truly grown up Holden actually is  He sees people for who they really are  not for the phony face they put on for everyone else to see  He has some crazy generalizations about people  but the crazy thing is  they are all true  I wasn t entirely captured from the start  The beginning was OK  but the last 50 pages or so  Damn  The very last pages killed me  how very Holden of me  Basically  I thought it was brilliant  And Zixuan  I guess I m pretty fucked up  I got the Audiobook version of this masterpiece  Somehow  I ve got the feeling I might not have enjoyed it as much had I read it in paper or e book  It was the talent of the narrator  whose name I can t seem to find  which made the story hilarious  I usually enjoy audiobooks while I walk to work  which is mainly the only 20 minutes I have a day to let my mind wander  as long as I don t run into a car  which hasn t happened yet    I remember bursting out laughing in more than one occasion  especially when he talks about religion  Jesus and his apostles  Absolutely brilliant   there s no plot  but there doesn t need to be  anyone will be able to relate to Holden  these are thoughts that every teenager has probably thought at some point  and everyone s been a teenager  I m not sure if this rating is a massive inflation simply because I m a teenager  all I know is that it was an absolute blast to read I also find it somewhat humorous that curses that are seen as so mild today sparked such wild controversy back in the  50s  Funny though  it took me almost 2 weeks to finished reading this one because it bores me a lot for the first 150 pages   I dunno I can t follow the story  Or maybe I got a little impatient  But then  when I came up on the part where he meets Mr  Antolini  boom  For the past few weeks  I been in a lot of deep thinking and searching for myself  so maybe that s why I paid not much of the attention on this  The part with Mr Antolini and the lesson or problem he imposed to Holden  that exactly describes my situation at this time  Oh   and now this book will never be forgotten for somehow it gave me lesson in life  I love the last line  meaningful and so real   I read this when I was 16 years old  I have a younger sister who was 8 at the time  I could feel it  you know  All the bullshit I went through in middle school  trying to fit in  trying to make people like me  and trying to cultivate some kind of meaning to it all  I was finding myself like EVERYBODY does  And only on reflection did I understand what had actually happened  I lost those bright eyes  the wonder  the readiness  Sure I did and instead I got scared of what was going to happen  why people were cursing  and why was it so fun to do so  It s terrifying that you have to actively pursue your ten year old self  and try to fit back into your old shoes  But they are just too small  That s how I felt  like Holden  I hated him as much as any of you all did  I still very much do  I saw it coming for my sister  you know  getting lost and ending somewhere else and realizing it s impossible to turn back  And that it just keeps getting farthur away  being a kid you know  I didn t want her to go through it  but she did  Now we talk  like old people  I m not saying I regret it all  growing up that is  I like the way I turned out and the same goes for her  I love her even more actually  This book just showed up in the perfect time  Right when I was hurtling into who know what  while she was still on the ground  My sister that is  I hated Holden as much as I hated myself  for going out and doing drugs  and drinking beer  stealing from the gas station  and buying cigarettes  I just didn t want to think of what I would have told myself  What the 7 or the 8 year old me would say  Most especially my sister  That s why I loved this book  And still do  This will always be my favourite book  The gasoline rainbows and Holden s hat will float around like clouds in my mind forever  No matter how many time you read it the magic just never wears of  This is what it feels like to be a teenager  Perfect example of adolescent literature that you might appreciate more as an adult  Easy read you ll finish in a day or two  Funny reminder of how I used to  and may still think  A story about a loss of innocence and growing into adulthood  this story is perfect for any teenager going through the same maturity that Holden is going through  I think the age that I read this book definitely helped my appreciation for this book  I could easily relate to Holden and his reactions to other characters  He was sarcastic and bitter at the world  while hiding all his own problems from everyone else  I think  for me  the best book is characters that I can relate to  and often with classics  at this age  I do not find characters that I relate to because of time period or other circumstances  I think that s one of the main reasons that this book is so special to me  other than that it is a great story too  J D  Salinger s most famous work is an illustration of Holden Caulfield  a late teen student who drops out of his school and bums around NYC for a spell  The metaphors in this story  the red hat  his little sister  are fantastic images of life s hurdles  The best scene  the one that crystallizes the whole book  is the final scene  In which Holden s little sister  Phoebe  finally teaches Holden something about himself While it s frustrating that people idolize Holden as some kind of intellectual  which he is absolutely NOT  it s encouraging because Holden is something of an every man  His plight is easily shared  The trouble of youth  when no one listens and no one could possibly understand because they re all a bunch of goddam phonies  I loved this book  ReviewFrom what Holden do  I see my own silhouette Sometimes I also want to escape from the reality and just to be a free child  but I also know that the reality is inescapable  I also wanted to do something stupid  to escape this false society  However  I still quite timid  so I have to take the realistic road  the ideal of Holden style can only stay in my heart  In fact  I sometimes feel that  a certain extent  everyone is Holden  And every person has their own Rye However  I don t think escape like Holden is not a good method  now we are young  the main task for us is to study at school Many of us are full dreams for our future  hoping to be scientists  doctors nurses  teachers and so no If now we work hard  in the future  our dreams may come true  It takes a while for you to know what the book is about  At times it can get pretty annoying  and you feel that the narrator is becoming too whiny  But in fact  the book is not that whiny  considering the subject matter  The character goes about narrating his depression in a very casual way  which makes the story even more appealing  This book is amazing  I swear to God it is  I did mean it  hahaI enjoyed every single part and I wish J D  Salinger is my friend so I can call him on the phone and talk to him about it  And Phoebe is a little sweetheart  3I absolutely give it 5 out of 5 stars   For Banned Books Week on WKAR s Current State I took on one of the most banned books in American Literature  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger You can listen to my new review here  http   wkar org post book review jd s    Book Review  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  SalingerThere are few books in American literature as controversial as The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  It has been linked to the assassination attempt on President Reagan and the killing of John Lennon  supposedly inspiring those troubled readers in their unspeakable tasks  The novel has become more than a novel  it s become its own literary device  Whenever you see a character in another story or even a movie reading it  you can t help but think that something bad is going to happen  Recently  I read the Judy Blume novel In the Unlikely Event  In that work  a character is given a copy of the book and along with it  a sense of eerie foreboding Time Magazine listed Salinger s most famous work as the number four most banned book in the United States  People who are critical of the book being taught in school point to the work s language and questionable morals  This year for Banned Books Week  the trick for me was forgetting that controversial history and just focusing on the story itself  At its heart  Catcher in the Rye is a tragic and personal story about a young man just trying to figure out the world around him and his place in it  It s feelings about humanity  its desire for meaning and purpose are all things we readers can relate to Holden Caulfield is a lonely teenager who has just been expelled from an elite  East Coast prep school  The book s timeline spans only three days  Holden spends that time wandering around New York City  just begging for someone to really listen to him  And since no one does  he sees everyone as phonies  people that are really not quite human  And that s it  There not much plot beyond that  Everyone disappoints Holden  from favorite teachers that never seem to say the right thing  the mentor who makes an advance on him  and friends who just don t get him  He never finds the love he is hoping for or finds any reason to believe in humanity What makes this book dangerous is not its history or hidden intentions  It s the fact that it taps into the part of our psyche that we all share from time to time  Those moments when we look around the world and think everything is ridiculous  phony and worth hating  Whether it comes from typical teenage angst or simply watching reality television  we all sometimes wonder   does anything really matter  The Catcher in the Rye struggles with the dark thought that maybe everything is fake and meaningless  Most authors would consider such a psychological premise like that for a short story  but Salinger stretches it out over 200 pages  diving deeper and deeper into Holden s spiritual downward spiral The difference between Holden and the people that find inspiration in its nihilistic philosophy is that Holden does find some kind of meaning in the world  Those three days are his exorcism  pushing his pessimistic view of humanity out  In the end  Holden breaks through his angst  finding inspiration in the innocence of his beloved sister stuck on a carousal during a rainstorm  It s sad that this moment of redemption gets far less attention than the morose tone of the rest of the book  In the end  Holden doesn t give up on the world  and maybe that is Salinger s true message  And that s not so controversial  is it  Wish they listed these books separately  Fabulous author  intense characters with good stories  Real people litter his stories with humanity and a touch of hope  To Esme with Love and Squalor may be my favourite short story ever  This might be one of my favourite books of all time  I read it for my AmLit class  and I was shocked to hear in our discussions how many people thought the book was mediocre at best  They viewed Holden as nothing more than the typical angsty adolescent  They were annoyed by him and thought that he was painfully whiny and pessimistic  However  I felt that Holden wasn t so typical and that the things he d experienced in his life greatly contributed to how he viewed the world  Throughout the entire time I was reading the novel  I never once felt annoyed by Holden  I accepted and understood his outlook and viewed him as being stuck in a depressed  confused  and complicated place  I think that the more you relate to Holden  the more you ll like him  and the story in general  I was able to relate to Holden more than some of the other people in my class  and maybe that s why I wasn t annoyed by him and loved this book   This is an all time classic for a good reason  The lack of a plot allows Salinger to show the inner workings of teen angst  a classical description of how we all felt  or feel  depending on your emotional maturity level  towards the world at large as we struggle to cope with the expanding principals necessary once realising that our id is not the only in the world  The book relies heavily on subtlety  and requires an acute audience  even if it doesn t require sympathetic feelings  The characters become parodies of themselves  but that doesn t stop the massive paradigm from showing a peculiar and evident analogy of the human condition   A beautiful thing    Obviously the best book ever written  That s why the author was recluse Holden is like the boy version of me  I m sick of society too  Holden  I m trying very hard to be happy but it s difficult   First read this in my teens  The bits I remembered were   a  he had a brother who had died of cancer  b  he had done something which showed this had had a profound effect on him  but didn t remember that it was smashing all the windows in the family garage  c  his encounter with the prostitute  d the conversation where he said he wanted to be a  catcher in the rye   What i didn t remember  and what was clearly important was  i  the scenes at the private school  ii  his encounter with his old teacher and his homophobic panic  iii  the strength of his relatinship with his sister  Phoebe    I suspected this novel was the genesis of the angst ridden teenager genre which includes Easton Ellis s  Less then Zero  and Lethem s  Fortress of Solitude   But you need the latter half of the 20th century to transform the sympathetic Holden Caulified into the monsters in Ellis s world  and the self obsessed hero of Lethem s novel  But what a story   and how perfectly told      I love this book more every time I read it  Salinger s writing not only perfectly captures how teenagers think  even if the slang s different   but it manages to encapsulate every struggle   worry so central to adolescence while only taking place over a few days  It s hard to describe how authentic this book feels  When I read this in high school I found Holden to just be an asshole  I didn t understand  Now I look back and recognize my adolescence in his  That smug superiority while failing to recognize that you re a hypocrite for doing what you hate  That desperation to connect  even if you don t particularly like the person  The general confusion that even Holden s wry intelligence can t overcome  This is definitely a book that should be read during and after adolescence  My actual rating  4 5 To be strictly honest  I found myself thinking  WHAT THE HECK      at the beginning of this book  The pages were littered with language  the premise okay But the farther I got  the deeper Holden s character became  the more I found myself awed by CitR  By the end  I was in absolute love with the book  The last two lines left me depressed for a long time  I haven t read such a good  just plain AWESOME  perfect  ending in ages  Seriously  CitR is now one of my favorite books because of those last two lines  But Holden s character was just so real and funny and quirky  I could see him clearer than so many protagonists So  read this book  And don t stop in the middle   Hilariously entertaining  This book is amazing  I say that about almost all books that i read but this one tops it all  Im not a fan of classic novels but After hearing many friends rave about it i decided to pick it up  It amazes me that even though it was written 50 years ago i can still relate to it in every way  I could not put this down and would recomend this to many  Holden Caulfield RULES    Oh  and for anyone who wants a montage like movie version of Salinger s entire oeuvre  check out  The Royal Tenenbaums   Every single character in every single one of Salinger s writings   a wee oeuvre though it may be   is included in this Anderson directed flick  Consider it the Cliff s Notes Salinger on video    I really liked this book when I first read it  but I feel like if I read it now  I would be less impressed  I think it s a book that really works for 18 year olds  because they can sympathize with Holden Caufield  but I d probably be annoyed by him now  Which is why I won t read the book again  because I d prefer to remember it the way it was when I first read it   I haven t read any other Salinger works besides Franny   Zooey  but because of said book i really want to  Franny   Zooey presents simple everyday lives in a way that seems so bleak and so hopeless  which may sound absolutely heinous  but it really gives Franny s story in the beginning a lot of fascinating tension   At the end  though  it really does create a perfect world in its own way  which may make little sense to anyone but me  but I hope not  Ha  The thing with this is that you either hate it or love it  The simplicity of Franny s desperation and proving herself to whoever is willing to listen will either leave you irked or ravenous for more  I am the latter  which is why this gets five stars  Ok  I LOVE this book  Now he does swear a LOT  but That s what makes Holden s character and personality  This book is a book that it s either you like it or you dont so I reccomend it  but you might  or might not like it  I loved this story   Me  I m just in it for the sarcasm  I can t believe that this classic book has such a low rating on this site  Really  Really people  You think Twilight is a better book than this  That breaks my heart   This is a  coming of age  tale  Purposely writing with a limited scope and a perfection within that narrow compass  J D  Salinger avoided some traditional rhetoric narratives authors like to use to depict the violent struggle within adolescents who are walking across the  line   The line is a mark  from immature to mature  One side holds the  cozy and happy memories of childhood  and on the other stands the seemingly  uncomfortable and scary world of adult   The time when you trespass the line  you become an adult Despite the book being written in  Holden s own words   when we are reading  we are in fact tracing the every thought of him   we can find Holden s surface response to a situation is hiding a much more deeply and emotionally response  I think that is just the representation of Salinger s brilliance  He is capable of infusing a nuance and essence to the sparse prose of Holden s narratives When I was reading the book  I was dedicating myself to looking for the real Holden Caulfield  Yes  he is lazy  stubborn  emotional and unfocused  But I know those are nothing but his masks  under which hiding an itching soul  Through his  pseudo rebellious  and  care nothing  exterior delicately manufactured by himself  I wanted to meet a real Holden Caulfield  a sad boy lost his way Holden is immaturely indulging in his own unrealistic world  dangerously shortsighted  But in my eyes this is also a common portion of boys in the age of 16  No doubt that Caulfield is compassionate and intelligent yet unable  or unwilling  to focus that energy on his education or other things that he sees as required to lead him away from his untruthful world and step into the adulthood  In the face of the  line  needed to trespass  Holden is afraid of taking all those serious commitments and responsibilities lying on the opposite side of the childhood I feel happy to see Caulfield back to his family again and I d like to believe that is a symbol of his transform from immature to mature  In fact  in his most dire straight  Holden is undergoing uncomfortable physical sufferings  such as nausea and anxiety  caused by his awful feeling and distrust of the world  What even worse is that he is expelled from every school  forced to embracing a bleak future  Just like what his teacher says to him  I can very clearly see you dying nobly  one way or another  for some highly unworthy cause       The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly  while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   This is true  During the most rebellious time of one s life  things are hard for teenagers  They are growing up  whether voluntarily or involuntarily  Admitted that growth is always accompanied with pains  While others cannot replace you to suffer such throes because the growth belongs to yourself and so does the pain  In short words  no one can replace or help or prevent you in the special experience of growing up  Like a pupa struggling to broke up its shell  growing into a moth  This process is hurt  Really  Likewise  in order to grow into adults  we need to brake up each and every protection  mental or physical  that the society and our parents exert on us  We must be mature  We must take responsibility  We must create our own futures  We must fit in the world  However  if you refuse to grow up  you will die  in the aspect of mind and soul  The world is  I admit  imperfect  But after being exposed to it  with the lights in the stage of childhood suddenly turn down  after disappointed with it  with the dream of a beautiful world collapses  we really need to fit in it  Or else a pupa might confine and stifle itself within its narrow shell  refusing to come out  indisputably the result is a tragedy  In the end  I want to talk about the book title  the Catcher in the Rye   In deed  I had no ideas about its meaning until I saw the words  If a body catches a body coming through the rye   It is the only ambition of Holden Caulfield  actually the only thing he wants to do in the world  How childlike yet how lofty the dream is  Here is a person so afraid of growing up and so averse to giving in to the pains and sorrows that he sees as a requirement to become an adult  He wants nothing but spending his whole life protecting others from losing their childhood  Yes  in his imagination  every time a child is going to fell off from the cliff  every time a child is forced to fell into the world of grownups   he will catch them and then bring them back to the kingdom of happy childhood  But I think Holden s dream to be a catcher is nothing short of brilliant  He is kind anyway  What a shame that such ideas and beliefs are too often destroyed under the barrage of  You must grow up  rather than having them transfixed and re focused into daring the improbable within the world of the possible  Anyway  the book really struck my nerve  Maybe it is time for us to leave a levee for our young generations to develop a consciousness of the adult world   I never get tired of reading this story  Holden Caulfield is quite nearly one of my favourite literary characters I have read so far  J D  Salinger outdid himself with this novel  Holden s stream of consciousness is hilarious  cynical  and in my opinion  quite heartbreaking  I love every bit of this book  and one must not die without having read this   Upon re reading this  2014   J D  Salinger encapsulates everything it means to be a teenager facing the horrible trials of growing up  This story is the most relatable novel to people of my age  I read this for the first time when I was thirteen  and the older I become  the more and more Holden relates to me and I hold him so near and dear to me  Salinger shines light on what it truly feels like to be a sixteen year old and what the world looks like in our eyes  though Holden is hilariously  and dramatically  cynical  The Catcher in the Rye is so timeless   This book is focused on a 16 year old boy named Holden Caulfield  He has just recently been kicked out of another school  This books focuses on alienation and how Holden tries to get somebody to listen to him and tell him adulthood will be okay  But he doesn t know how to ask the question directly  For example  he asks taxi drivers what happens to ducks in the pond when the water freezes over  He stays in New York for a couple days  because he doesn t want his parents knowing he got kicked out again  even though he wasn t supposed to be leaving the school for many more days  Holden is afraid of growing up because he   himself doesn t want to become a  phony   A term used many times in the book   The last few events that end this book felt feverish and dreamy and beautiful  I suppose it s some sort of rite of passage to read this book  Everyone seems to read it  Wow  I can t get past Holden in a way  In a way  it might be somewhat realistic with his immaturity  and all the craziness that goes on  It s possibly intentional and the author did well in conveying that  I must admit that I loved the portrayals of many of the characters in the book  I can t help thinking about that broken record in the book  It could even be symbolic of his state   Not to mention that Holden is very much like a broken record  He keeps on repeating the same thing over and over and over and skipping tracks and going all over the place   It was once whole with plenty of potential just like him  yet  from some accident  it falls and shatters into many pieces  Yet  when he presents it to Phoebe  she takes it and all the pieces and saves them  In a way she does the same for him  not quite that way  I did enjoy the part where she s asking him all the honest and hard questions  Yes  perhaps it was a great book  Pity I shan t like to read it again  I did not enjoy it  One  Bit  Similar to To Kill A Mocking Bird in that you re a git if you don t love it but more understandable because much more honest and confronting about life and the fucked up world of humans and adults  But still  you re a git if you don t like it just a less insecure one than had you not loved TKAMB rstsh r bkhwm bgm t rwzy khh nTwrdsht r z nmyshgh khtb khrydm  Hty smsh hm bh gwshm nkhwrdh bwd  wlyn chyzy khh nZrm rw jlb khrd sm khtb bwd  nTwr

where the setting was some form of historical fiction but in this book that feeling was pushed aside  I think it was the way the the main character   Holden Caulfield   shared his feelings and opinions on the world along with the thematic messages sent throughout the book such as loss of innocence and keeping your individuality  It really taught you a lesson about the period of time he was in and how a teenager felt and what they did about their opinions  Overall this an amzing book that I enjoyed and recommend to others  This book was very different than any other book I ve read  but I liked it  Holden was a very sad young man  but I enjoyed the way he told his story  I most liked his love for his sister and brother that passed away as a child  I think that part showed the humanity in him  a part that you could call him normal about  but he was a pretty messed up young man and its quite sad  Otherwise his views on people  entertainment and life in general were pretty messed up  almost to the point of being silly  but it was sad because you could tell this young man was really hurting all the time on the inside  A very different book to end the year on  but I loved it  A good

Salinger  Salinger  s ability to write is outstanding compared to many other authors  Most authors usually make it very hard to get the point across to the reader  Salinger  s style of writing is perfected to where anyone can pick up his novel and follow along very easily  He is truly a great author  Salinger does a great job writing this novel  He takes the reader into the life of a teenage boy who lives during the 1950 s  Salinger wrote the story so that the reader has a feeling that the main character is specifically telling the story to them  Well at least that s the way I felt about the novel  The story starts off with a teenage boy named Holden Caulfield  Holden is very different from other boys his age  When you read the novel you really get to know his character  You find out that he is really open minded  If he has something to say about someone he will let you know everything there is to know about that certain person  He acts very conceded and shows it off many times through out the novel and you really get to know how big of a rebel he is  Holden also gets depressed many times through out the novel and don t worry you will definitely know when he becomes depressed   Salinger starts off the novel with Holden attending a boarding school which is not the first boarding school he has been through  Holden fails out of both schools because of his carelessness in the classroom  You will find out that he absolutely hates school with a passion  He thinks everyone there is an idiot and a jerk  So after being kicked out of his last school he goes on his own little vacation  This point in the novel is when you really see what kind of a person he really is  He begins to tell you many different stories about his past  You will learn about his family and friends  And you will see a different side of Holden  A loving side to be exact  It is an amazing change to the novel  To tell you the truth I actually felt like I was growing closer to him  At first I didn t care to much for him because he acted like he was the biggest rebel of all  But when he tells his story of his brother and sister I really felt for him  I hope you feel the same way for him too   I really enjoyed this novel and the style it was written in  J D  Salinger really got the point of the story cross to me  The story was just awesome to me because the main character was a teenage boy just like me  There was a connection between Holden and myself  I almost felt like he was my rebellious friend that I have never had  Salinger s ability to write will bring you into the life of this boy and hopefully you will get the same feelings I did  I would love to go in more depth with the story but then you wouldn t enjoy reading the story  This novel will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time your reading it and I guarantee that you will love it  I would also like to advise that this book is not for you if you re a very boring person who has had no social life and has never had fun in there teenage years  And if your under the age of fifteen you shouldn t read this novel because you would probably think it was stupid mainly because you wouldn t understand it  I really hope that you enjoy this novel and that you will grow to love it  Oh yea by the way once you have read it and have enjoyed it got to everyone you know that hasn t read it to read it   I read it as a teenager during my freshman year in university and that s probably why I felt Salinger had sucessfully echoed and captured our most awkward years through Holden Caulfield  whose vulnerabilities were so raw and palpable  Salinger keeps the story realistic  as if you are actually reading someone s journal   maybe that s what makes the book so compelling to me   its sincerity  It is nice not to see any encomiums in or on the book  Words of praise will only cheapen the book s appearance  making it seem  phony   Furthermore  this novel has not been turned into a movie  thankfully  Holden is obsessed with his hatred of phoniness  even though he continually lies to people   A character from John Guare s play   Six Degrees of Separation   said the novel is about paralysis  among other things  I can see that  Caulfield never calls Jane Gallagher  never has sexual relations with the prostitute  never runs away from home like he says he will  etc  I love the writing style   direct and no nonsense  It is not pretentious at all  Loneliness  depression  defiance  rebelliousness  confusion  an overwhelming desire for realness  not having a direction  being an underdog  being an outsider   it is easy to relate to Holden  A favorite read of serial killers  Need I say more  Ok fine  after reading this book  Justin Beiber wrote a song on a napkin  It goes  baby baby baby baby baby baby baby  I m disaffected  This is an amassing book  It beautifully displays a sad teen that got kicked out of school and in my opinion he is quite a drunk  I think that this story is unique in that it doesn t really follow your classic beginning middle and end format and there is not really any climax  It is just the story of a kid trying to figure out what to do with his life from the time he gets kicked out of school to finding where he fits in in society   First review  2007   Great writing  But it appealed to me little and got old before the book ended Reread February 2012 I m switching it from 3 to 5 stars  It s not  amazing  as 5 stars is supposed to represent but it s great and I can t think of anything wrong with it  so 5 A review in short  Beautiful Bitching The difference between my two readings is that my first time  in HS  I tended to judge works by their content against what I thought should be the case  how people should act  think  talk  So Holden s negative outlook  his criticism of everything  his lack of stability  his swearing  etc   I saw this as not good  and things to be avoided  not desired or sympathized with  and I held it against the book   I had similar problems with Catch 22 my first reading  e g  prostitution  Now  the content of my initial approach was not wholly bad  The content of works DO effect the readership and must be considered  A blatant  accepted  example of this is our criticism of objectification of women in media  This portrayal encourages the like  However the ambiguity in theme or tone is what leads to  literature  and a strict concern of what a work seems to encourage leads to censorship There is much that goes into a good work and into judging one  One is insight into the human condition  This book approaches that in portraying one type of human experience  And it does it exceedingly well Also I really like Holden s writing voice  I found it amusing  Note  Second reading done via audio book  Voice  Ray Hagen  It was excellent   The one thing that drew my attention to this book was the anime series Ghost in the Shell  SAC 1st Gig  where a quote from this book is used as a signature by one of the characters  I finally was able to get my hands on this book and I really  really liked it  Raw  plain  no BS views of a sixteen year old teenager of what he really thinks about people and things that surround him  I could personally understand and relate myself to some of those views too  All in all  a great read  Oh  just a note  if you re gonna recommend this book to someone young  seeing that it s won the Teen Read award and what not   be forewarned that the lead character swears curses almost every couple of lines  but that just put the reader in a more realistic perspective of the teenage character  P Enjoy   D Holden loses the fencing equipment for his school and gets expelled  so he wanders around aimlessly  philosophizing  whining  longing  and looking for connection  He hangs out with some girls and finds them vapid  and reflects on his lack of sexual connection with women  knowing he s had chances with some girls but never took advantage of anyone  and when he decides to get it over with with a prostitute  he finds he just wants to connect with the girl  human to human  which gets him into trouble  and gets him punched by the girl s pimp   Holden reconnects with other people he s known  buys a record for his sister  fails with another girl by making grandiose suggestions  and drinks himself out of coherence  Holden s visit home to see his sister helps put some things in perspective for him  but he remains fixated on the purpose of life  HIS life  and wants to put himself in the line of fire to protect others for a higher cause  Reflections on immaturity  sexuality  and authenticity follow Holden as he wanders Holden can be angsty and obnoxious  but it s such fun watching him flounder and grasp  I didn t find him exactly likable sometimes  but I did find him relatable  and this character driven novel about purpose  childhood  and adulthood really did a great job capturing a certain ineffable feeling about that particular stage of life  The turns of phrase and worries Holden displays are really entertaining and sometimes touching  I liked spending time in his head  possibly my favorite book of all time  the story of a boy who decides to run away from home and has to do a lot of growing up in the process  The Catcher in the Rye is a 214 page classic by J D  Salinger  It tells the story of seventeen year old Holden Caulfield  the protagonist  and the events that led to his breakdown the previous year  The novel starts with him getting kicked out of his boarding school and then going to New York alone for a few days  The story mainly deals with themes of anger  rebellion  and just being a teenager I really liked the story  I thought Salinger did a really good job writing it  The descriptions were so vivid that I could imagine being there  I also grew to really like Holden because I could understand what he was feeling and why he did the things he did  One thing I didn t like too much was the language used in the book  I know it was written in the fifties so that kind of language is only expected  but sometimes I found the vernacular really hard to understand  Some of the phrases used are really outdated  Other than that  the book was pretty good and I m glad I had a chance to read it    There are no spoilers  just feelings I got of reading the book  and it s kind of useless to read this without knowing what the book is about    I d read the Slovak version of this book a year ago   I ll rather not talk about the awful translation of words I thought Holden did use there  because he really didn t use any of them in English  which annoys me how I thought he did talk  but he didn t  but I rather not say anything more to this subject  bc I d get too angry anyway  A year ago I loved this book  I felt so understood by Holden   the way saw this world  the way he thought of it  those things he did and all   it was so mine  I still love this book and still feel the same about it  but this time it was a little different  Most of the time I read so familiar to me I felt like crying  I didn t remember Salinger writing so blue  but maybe that s the thing I loved about him  I felt so sorry to Holden that he was lonesome and depressed about everything that I wanted so much to be able to help him with anything I could  I wished I could into the book and be in the story with him and just hug him and maybe cry even he d hate me  Idk  I really felt like doing it tho  I d marry that boy with no hesitation   I m not kidding  I am that crazy like he is  I know   so everything would be okay or at least kind of better if he wasn t that alone  Idk  I m getting so sad reading how lonesome he is and that I can t help  It often makes me sad that I can t help Thank God that little Pheobe was there  Un libro muy interesante  con un personaje adolescente que poco a poco nos lleva por un recorrido de las diferentes inquietudes de la mente juvenil  Disfrute mucho el libro  It s one of my favorites with the most number of highlighted lines than any other books I ve read  The atmosphere of teenage angst and anger is overwhelmingly contemporary and universal  I think Salinger was able to narrate the sentiments of an adolescent soul in the midst of an internal battle with society s philosophies  Salinger has portrayed the teenage generation well through the character of Holden Caulfield  Although there had been a long list of characters  or the mention of them   one can still grasp the themes and the plot well  The language  personally  was the most dynamic and the flag bearer of the book  Despite it being one of the Banned Books  I still consider it as one of the best ever published in young adult literary history  It s worth every bad and good review  Just because someone s dead  you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake  especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all    Holden Caulfield     educated and scholarly men  if they re creative and brilliant to begin with  tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative  And nine times out of ten  they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker    Mr  Antolini Thank you JD Salinger for  The Catcher In The Rye  Holden Caufield is like any other teenager  overly dramatic  moody and sarcastic  Holden undergoes inner turmoil as he struggles to find his identity in a world full of  phonies   experiencing a summer as a an archetypal wanderer  lost and drifting about in search of something more  I think the reason why I fell in love with this book is because I can relate so much to Holden  and because it captures so specifically the point in our life when we begin to question everyone and everything  and look to find ourselves as young adults  Holden s satirical commentary and simple story is what drew me to him  Salinger s style is so alluring and clean  loud and clear yet with so much more behind it  that this book makes it into my top 5 without question   Growing up  I knew that The Catcher in the Rye was considered a 20th century classic  I knew the same thing of works by Jack London and John Steinbeck  and somehow I guess I lumped them all together in my mind  It didn t help that the title of Salinger s novel makes reference to grain  I never would have guessed that The Catcher in the Rye is such an urban and contemporary novel  For me  that was a pleasant surprise  one I hope to revisit in the near future The Catcher in the Rye unfolds by way of the first person narrative of Holden Caulfield  a young man recounting his latest expulsion from boarding school and his subsequent journey home  I m tempted to say the book takes place primarily in New York City  but that would be misleading  Holden s own mind is the real locale  not because the events described are figments of Holden s imagination  although  who knows  for Holden falls just shy of deeming himself a pathological liar  but because those events are of secondary importance to Holden s interpretation thereof  The Catcher in the Rye reads like Holden s personal journal  which it basically is  As such  the book has no explicit plot  Holden talks about school  about girls  about his family  about people in general  Everything you d expect a 16 year old to talk about in a journal  Even though Holden s reflections are confined to those inspired by his voyage home and therefore maintain a strong sense of continuity and cohesion  the storyline from which they stem provides no more than a backdrop to understanding Holden s psychology  The Catcher in the Rye s brilliance is thus wholly dependent on the authenticity of its protagonist  Fortunately  this is precisely where the book excels  I love Holden Caulfield  This doesn t mean I view him as worthy of emulation  or as an ideal dinner guest  The love I feel for Holden is an utterly paternal one  but that speaks volumes about the efficacy of Salinger s writing  Holden is cynical  diagnosing almost everyone he meets as pretentious  stupid  or phony  usually all of the above  Often  he is wise beyond his years  More often  he merely thinks he is  Holden doesn t understand why people get so annoyed with him  though the reason stares readers in the face  Never does Holden seem quite as young as when he s conversing with others  Just like a kid  Holden doesn t get that he s being somewhat of a pest at times  Yet despite it all  there is much we wish to preserve about Holden s nature  He is not without conscience  and the fact that Holden seems perpetually crestfallen seems to have more than a little to do with his wish that the world were a more innocent and beautiful place  The young man who cusses in just about every sentence he utters is the same one who mourns at the thought that a little kid will read profane graffiti and forever lose her innocence  Holden is a pessimist  no doubt  but more than that  he is sad  If Holden doesn t stir your compassion  you re missing something The Catcher in the Rye could not be so emotionally profound if Salinger did not create a voice as genuine as any in literature  And sadness isn t the only emotion Salinger stirs  The Catcher in the Rye is one of the funniest books I ve ever read  Especially during the first several chapters of the book  I found myself laughing out loud almost once per page  When Holden bemoans the inanity of his fellow classmates  finding himself so downright perturbed at every little thing they do  I was thoroughly amused  Granted  Holden s emotional reactions can be a bit absurd  but they aren t without warrant  Likewise  Holden s incessant use of profanity is assuredly ridiculous  but he sounds exactly like a teenager who s so accustomed to swearing that he now includes foul language as a matter of syntax  In short  everything about Holden Caulfield rings true  over the top swearing included  As the book progresses  we come to appreciate Holden s softer side  and by the end of the novel  we see Holden as an intelligent but naive kid worthy of affection and in need of nurturing  I would think anyone who has  at one time or another  been all too well acquainted with melancholy will find something in Holden to love and to empathize with  Even as a 30 something adult  I recognize some of Holden s emotional frailties as my own  Funny enough  I think only a cynic could fail to appreciate the lovable cynic that is Holden Caulfield  I had  read  this in high school  meaning I flipped through some pages while we discussed it in class  and tossed it somewhere when I got home  Reading it now about six years later  all I can say is wow  this really is a classic  This is not outdated at all  and there s a little Holden in all of us  if you want to know the truth  one of my all time favourites  I guess i read this at the right time and in the right mind set  not that it greatly affected my mind set  at least conciously   the book of boy who goes through a crisis  we all do in as we go along our merry way and we all are holden caufield  not much on the author as he really never wrote to this calibre  in my own way i can see why yet i reserve the write to alter my opinion as new information comes to my attention  not the fun loving gu the author and that sort of comes out in his work  yet this could be that he was just a dedicated artist of humans  either way  this holden guy really does sing it to you  its a moving tale told in a timid hard yet darkly jovial sense  another book that has that present tense vibe about it  pretty cool too my tastes just give it a read   I read this this book quite a while ago and truthly  I didn t enjoy it as much as I thought I would  I found it slow and the style of writing annoyed quite a lot  I found Holden quite an irritating character because of his views  but that may just be because he s a teenage boy  and thought he was immature  once again not a big fan of teenage boys  However  i turned 15 a couple of days ago and started reading this book for a second time and I am enjoying more than I remember in the past  It seems as though with age I have understood and excepted Holden s immaturity and appreciate the corruption of innocence within him and others around him  I wish I would have waited to read it when I was a bit older as it would have been great to have loved it the first time round  oh well I love it now and I guess that s all that matters  The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age kind of story  set around the 1950s in New York  The story is narrated from the perspective of our main character Holden Caulfield  who is telling us the story from a psychiatric facility a few months after the events of the novel  The first thing I noticed when I started reading The Catcher in the Rye was the cynicism and bitterness of Holden s voice  At first it kind of got on my nerves because Holden is just too pessimistic about life and people around him  But then I started to understand that The Catcher in the Rye was nothing more than a chronicle of Holden Caulfield s emotional breakdown and I started to sympathize with him Now we have this whole  Phoniness  situation  which is probably the most famous phrase in the novel  It is one of Holden s favorite concepts  He uses it many times through out the novel in order to describe the hypocrisy  superficiality and pretension that he encounters in the world around him  Holden explains that all the adults are by definition phonies  and the worst part is that they can t even see their phoniness  Phoniness  for Holden stands as an emblem of everything that s wrong in the world  which provides him with an excuse to withdraw into his cynical isolation Holden s loneliness is a more concrete manifestation of his alienation issues  a big part of the novel describes his almost manic quest for companionship as he flies from one meaningless encounter to the other  As a reader we understand pretty soon in the novel that Holden uses his alienation as form of self preservation  and we also easily link his unusual behavior to the death of his younger brother Allie  Even though Holden never explicitly admit it  this event has obviously affected him a great deal The  Catcher in the Rye  as a source of the title of the book deserves a close inspection  When Phoebe asks her brother what he wants to do in the future he answers her with this image from the song  catcher in the rye  Holden wants to protect the kids playing in the rye field from falling over the cliff by  catching  them  in other words Holden wants to protect kids from falling out of innocence into the adult world including the knowledge of sex  The thing is that Holden is mistaken in the lyrics of the song which are  if a body meet a body coming in the rye  the song asks if it s wrong for two people to have a romantic encounter out in the field  which is the exact opposite of what Holden wants the song to mean Over all I really enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye and I will definitely be rereading it in the future  I already miss Holden and his famous red hat of individuality   God  this book  I am Holden Caufield  He is I  We are one and the same  Not to be dramatic but I ve read this book a trillion times  not literally  obviously  and every time I read it I want to be alone in my head and think and distinguish all the bullshit  And there s so much of it  Like  shit  Anyway  please read and then question  Not me but life  your life  ABZ This book was very good  A lot of my classmates thought it was bad and very boring  The first half of the book was but towards the end it got good  It takes us through Holden s life growing up with  phonies  all around him  Phonies are fake people  Holden realizes that life isn t what everyone thinks it is  Escribir sobre este libro es una de esas cosas que se me hacen bastante complejas  Me ha parecido un libro tan bueno  que no quiero caer en una critica abstracta e ineficaz Poniendonos en situacion  el libro publicado en 1951 cuenta la historia en primera persona de un Adolescente problematico que tiene que enfrentarse a la madurez  pero esta no le interesa en absoluto Narrado de una forma muy especial  en primera persona  y con un vocabulario bastante limitado  como lo seria el de un adolescente de 17 anos  narra la historia personal de Holden atravesando un momento peliagudo de su vida  Es expulsado del colegio y se ve envuelto en una espiral de problemas causados por no querer volver a casa de sus padres y querer evitar la bronca  La historia con un principio y un final definidos  se nos explica desde la narracion del adolescente y esto hace que el hilo argumental se mueva de una forma abstracta con unas asociaciones de ideas particulares no hacen mas que conseguir meternos aun mas en la mente del protagonista y entretenernos enormemente de forma que no queramos dejar el libro En su momento 1951 este libro resulto drastico por ser un libro adulto  narrado desde el punto de vista adolescente  con problemas adultos que le ocurren a un adolescente  Con el tiempo  se ha considerado que este es un libro que se deberia leer en ese momento en el que el protagonista y el lector encajan en el mismo molde  es decir  en la Adolescencia Pero  como todos los libros buenos tiene una segunda y una tercera lectura que habria que tener en cuenta  En una primera lectura adolescente nos quedaremos con el personaje y la historia  En la segunda lectura en la edad adulta le sacamos el verdadero jugo al libro A grandes rasgos el libro relata el enfrentamiento del protagonista con la realidad adolescente  teniendo que convivir de forma drastica la ninez con la madurez  Ya que en el libro Holden tiene un recuerdo de la ninez exquisito  pero todo lo adulto le resulta desagradable  malicioso y falso  este no quiere madurar ni hacerse adulto El libro tambien se puede leer desde el punto de vista psiquiatrico relatando los problemas y enfrentamientos que surgen en los adolescentes al no querer enfrentarse a ciertas decisiones que en ocasiones se ponen a edades en las que el adolescente todavia no esta preparado para hacer frente  Y tambien relata la lucha interna de la juventud al enfrentarse a un mundo sin futuro definido en el que todo se basa en el excelente recuerdo infantil y la imposibilidad de ver como bueno la edad adulta que acarrea demasiadas responsabilidades El libro ademas es bastante conocido por sus peculiaridades  entre ellas esta que la  sinopsis  habitual es inexistente por expreso deseo del autor  y las editoriales no pueden anadir absolutamente nada mas que el titulo y el autor a la portada y contraportada  no dando avances de lo que te vas a encontrar Mark David Chapman  el asesino de John Lennon  se confeso obsesionado con el libro y llevaba este libro encima en el momento de su detencion  Ademas anadio en su confesion que los motivos por los que habia asesinado a Lennon  estaban en el libro John Hinckley Jr  detenido por intento de asesinato a Ronald Reagan  y Robert John Bardo  el asesino y acosador de Rebecca Schaeffer tambien tenian este libro y se confesaban tambien obsesionados con el libro En la pelicula  Conspiracion  protagonizada por Mel Gibson  se explica la leyenda urbana que hay ligada a este libro  El protagonista  Mel Gibson  se siente obligado a comprar el libro cada vez que lo ve en alguna libreria  Y segun la pelicula esto es una tecnica de programacion mental que usa la CIA para encontrar a los asesinos en serie que ellos mismos programan para matar a quien les interesa Tras todas estas curiosidades  no tengan miedo  hay millones de personas mentalmente sanas que han leido el libro  pero esto no hace mas que agrandar su misterio y las ganas de la gente por leerlo Por ultimo y como conclusion Creo que este libro es una Obra maestra que esta entre los mas grandes de la literatura  Recomendado para todo el mundo de cualquier edad  Creo que deberia leerse en la adolescencia sin problemas  Y tambien considero que los que lo leyeron en la juventud  deberian volver a leerlo en la edad adulta para ver el potente sentido que esconde bajo sus lineas que solo encontraran con una lectura en una edad mas adulta Realmente  este libro merece un 10  I started reading this book around a year ago  and I stopped when I was around halfway through  I can t remember exactly why I stopped  I remember that I really didn t like Holden because he was just such an idiot  Being in the head of such an immature and naive person was  at first  nauseating  I spent all my time focusing on Holden and his thoughts and didn t take much notice of the people and environment around him  As the book progresses  you find that the environment and people around Holden play a bigger and bigger role in the story  showing you how Holden has drawn the conclusion of the world that he has and  sadly  forcing you to agree at times  In life  you meet many people who seem so awesome at first  but the longer you know them the less you like them  It was the opposite with Holden  I couldn t stand him in the beginning  but the longer I stuck around  the more I liked him  The reason I enjoyed this book so much was because Holden is probably the single saddest person I ve ever come across in a story  I really don t know what to say about him  except that his story took me across the darkest places in the life of a teenage boy  and the darker places in his mind   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you miss everybody   A final sendoff that I can t get out of my head  I just love this book  I can relate to it and no matter how many times I read it  I never get tired of it  When I have a lot of school work to do I like to read the first sentence of Cathcer and I always feel better  This book has a special place on my bookshelf and it is never covered in dust   This book focuses around the story of a boy in collage who lives in New York  He tells about his life and gives philosophy as he leaves his college and goes to live on the town  When he first starts out  he is failing his English class  and decides he doesn t want to have anything to do with college after the holiday break  He leaves the college  after a fight with his roommate  and sets off onto the town  In the town he goes dancing  starts dating a girl he hasn t seen in forever  and many other things  His philosophy on life unravels as he tells this story  as he says things like actors are just  phonies  and he wishes people wouldn t be so crummy  This book drew me in from the start  J D  Salinger uses the language of a New Yorker very well  and makes Holden Caulfield sound like a real person  His philosophy is very relatable  and the book provides an interesting insight in how people in big cities live  I loved this book  It was very easy to read because Holden has a very vibrant and strong character  It was as if he were talking directly to me in person  The book was even comical at some points  Holden isn t much younger than I am  so I m still able to sympathize and understand how he felt at certain points  I didn t understand why Holden wanted  for a job  to save children from walking over cliffs in the rye  he wanted to be a catcher in the rye  I m not sure if that meant that he wanted to  preserve  the innocence of the young or if it was something metaphorical like that  It was also very sad hearing about how he would talk to Allie despite being dead for a while  it was very sentimental and nice  I loved the book  People who give this book a low rating don t understand it  This is a magnificent work of literature and should be read by everyone at least once in their lifetime   must not have pressed the right button as i thought i had added my two cents worth i ve read this one a number of times  the first back around  82 or so  another time in an american lit course  bout  86  86 or so  more than a few times that i forgot to remark the date between then  in  82 and now i like how the metaphor of the pond can be interpreted in a number of ways  where do the ducks go when the pond is frozen  strange  how a few characters got bent out of shape when holden asked the question  like the taxi driver taken as a metaphor for the home  the family  the ducks are sent off to a boarding school and there s every indication that that trend will continue after holden leaves the place where he is narrating the story taken as a metaphor for the world of fiction  the world of literature  after a certain point  the writer stops sending stuff out the door and we all hope  i do  anyway  that maybe there s some manuscripts stuck in drawers in a bank vault somewhere  i ve often wondered what salinger thought of john and jill public s take on the telling taken as a metaphor  again  for the world of literature  the ducks  in this case  the reader   well  they find a way  don t they in a sense  i agree w holden s assessment of things phony  the school  w the kind of flyer that has been arriving daily in my mail box  the one attached to my house  usually some kind of warning to do w someone running for office  though the flyer about the school  some guy on horseback jumping hurdles  though holden can t see the metaphor in that  he takes it at face value and calls it phony  there are no horses at the school should be interesting  my next read  to look more closely at how the movies are used in the story  say like does that tie into his brother  d b  out there in hollywood  prostituting himself   and how does that relate to the metaphor of the pond  or like the three he dances w at the club bar   the way the one keeps looking over his shoulder  looking for a star  and he tells her he just saw so and so   makes her day  Catcher in the rye is an amazing composition written by the American writer J D Salinger  The book is about an American teenager  Holden Caulfield who goes to a boarding school  Pencey Prep  in Pennsylvania  Holden is a rebel teenager that sees the world in a different way  he sees it as it is  with a very honest opinion  Holden is expelled from Pencey Prep  and then he decides to escape to New York before the letter of expulsion gets to his parents  That is just one of the many rebel things that Holden does throughout the course of this incredible story  The book is a comedic and very interesting piece  very recommendable for teenagers who are willing to find a book to which they can connect to  The way he sees things and thinks about them are very relatable to any teenager  Since the book was first Published  Holden has become an icon for teenage rebellion and that is why this book is such a very funny  relatable book that any teenager will enjoy I really liked this book  It evoked so many emotions in me  I m not much of an avid reader  because I find it hard to engage and be drawn into the story lines of many of the books I ve read  But the Catcher in the Rye was different from any book I ve ever read  Holden had me hooked from the very beginning  It s so easy to identify with his character s persona  It made me reminisce about being a teenager and hating everything and being annoyed by everybody  It was like an outer body experience  It s one of those books that you ll either really love or really hate  purely because of the protagonist  There isn t much of a traditional story line  And that is one of the things I loved  You just go on this journey with Holden  he doesn t know where he ll end up next  and neither do you  and that s one of the fun things  Definitely one of my favourites  Will be re reading it soon   and that coming from someone who isn t crazy about reading    speaks volumes about the book  I personaly am not a reader but this book will always stick with me It was my first ever novel i read and i came across it from an interesting youtube ad about the documentary called  Salinger  The book is just flat out amazing and its easier to read for younger readers because of the passive voice its writen in All in all the book will always stick as my first and favorite novel  The first time I read The Catcher in the Rye  I didn t even realize the kid  Holden Caulfield  was a nut  He just seemed like the basic kid everybody was  except much less underserved  I was younger than he was at the time  The current reading is maybe my fifth time through with J  D  Salinger s lingering adolescent  and I have become older than his father was when Holden s events were narrated  I see now that the kid is in and out of a nervous breakdown  fragile and excitable  bitter beyond his years  critical beyond reason and far out in the weeds  well out beyond the limits of that rye where he imagines himself doing all that catching  So  despite all those advances in perception I ve made  or perhaps thanks to them  I still feel that Holden Caulfield is speaking for me  personally  That s either a pretty bad sign about me or a solid indication of The Catcher in the Rye s enduring greatness  maybe both  My most favourite book of all time You should read everything by J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Rye is about a boy who has trouble relating to people  and spends a couple of meaningful days in the city  I  like many  love this book because of Holden s sassy attitude and sarcastic comments  He is a teenager who s relatable and has trouble with his family just like every other teenager   As I see many adults didin t enjoy this book  maybe I won t like it either when I grow up  but as a 17 year old teenager I absolutely love this book  even though I have a different personality than that of Holden s  but I understand him  I also despise pretentious people  I don t know what I want and don t know what I want to be in the future and so on  I m pretty sure many teenagers are in this phase and that s why it s so popular among them  so my advise is to read this as a teen  when you re developing your own religious  political and philosophical views  when you re getting ready to step into the adult world   hmh sh mjsm my khnm chn t bchh

captivating and now there are a lot of words like phony swell etc that is now going to be a part of my frequently used words  Even though I could understand the thoughts going over Holden s mind but in my opinion he overdid it He called so many people phony for such trivial reasons that at some point he seemed phony too  The first time I read this book was the 10th grade  While my friends couldn t find one positive thing to say  I found I just couldn t say enough  Years later it was selected to be read by my book club  I was over the moon  While I was able to read it with a much more mature mindset  I found that the things I loved when I read it in high school were the same things I loved today  Holden  the protagonist  wanders through life  reaching out to every person he can think of without actually being able to say what it is that he needs  He views the world through a thick blanket of skepticism  mistrust  and cynicism  He loves deeply  thinks thoroughly  and yet acts completely irrationally  Each page brought a new layer of depth into his personality and each chapter brought the reader closer and closer to this protagonist  While there s no real  plot   this book presents an unmatched character study and introduces the reader to a new level of emotional connection with the protagonist  If you haven t read this book  it s a must  If you have read it  pick it up again and again   In my opinion the central theme of the book  The Catcher in the Rye  would be the turmoil involved in the transition from teenage years to adulthood  I read an article about celebrities who were assassinated and became aware that the Beatles star  John Lennon was one among them  So I quickly browsed on Wikipedia  and found out that his shooter was reading The Catcher in the Rye in the crime scene waiting for the police to show up  Reading tidbits of information like this on the book does a great deal to instill an interest and curiosity to read it The protagonistWhere do I even begin to describe the unconventional protagonist  the seventeen year old Holden Caulfield  He is characterized as being warped  a misanthrope  clinically depressed  and abnormal  Many at times in the book  Holden acts out as though he has a severe gunshot wound  But at the same time erudite in his opinions and a mind loaded with invigorating thoughts  The book is small  about two hundred pages  more or less  Caulfield has a peculiar loathing for hypocrites and people who pretend  He regards them as phony  Phony is his catch word throughout the book The bookComin Thro  The Rye is a poem by Robert Burns  The line goes   If a body meets a body coming through the rye  which Holden misinterpreted it as  if a body catch a body   Holden Caulfield wants to stand at the edge of the cliff and be a catcher in the rye  He wants to catch hold of the kids running in the rye fields and prevent them from falling off the cliff  If the kids fall off the cliff then they will turn into a phony adult  Caulfield likes the company and innocence of kids  the same reason why he is very fond of his kid sister in the book  Probably the only person he is able to be around with and not experience a sense of aversion or phony behavior  And it is his sister who saves him in the end  While talking to phoebe  he thinks to himself   if somebody at least listens  it s not too bad  Lessons from Holden CaulfieldJ D Salinger makes the reader understand the chaos that goes inside the mind of a teenager  For example  in one of the lines of the book  Holden says   I m always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though   And the other time Holden is also maddened at how little parents know about the true character of their teenage children  Holden says   You take somebody s mother  all they want to hear about is what a hot   shot their son is   This is in reference to a boy in his school who is not a nice person  or in Holden s description   he  the boy  was always going down the corridor  after he d had a shower  snapping his soggy old wet towel at people s asses  Holden also highlights how most people are so superficial and pretending to be somebody they re not  always trying to ape a custom or practice that wasn t even meant for them in the first place  He says   Take most people  they re crazy about cars  They worry if they get a little scratch on them  and they re always talking about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars  and if they get a brand new car already they start thinking about trading it in for one that s even newer   He also talks about how most girls end up marrying  dopey guys  guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf  or some stupid game like ping  pong  Guys that are very mean  Guys that never read books  He also hates the kind of phonies who have to give themselves room when they answer somebody s question  So  Holden talks about facets of everyday life and the people we encounter  making his outlook in life very relatable to the reader  The attention to detail and mannerisms of people goes a long way in understanding just the kind of people there are Holden s view on school life is applicable today  In his words   all you do is study so that you can learn enough  to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac someday  and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses  and all you do is talk about girls  liquor and sex all day  and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques  The story actually ends on a positive note  because I was assured that it might have a violent ending and either the protagonist or the other people in the book might die  The book assures that Holden Caulfield indeed got some therapy and help  The book does have rebellious and intoxicating views  It also served as an inspiration to the assassins of John Lennon and Ronald Reagan  You become what you read   that s a scary thought  It explains why the book remained banned  It s all about how you want to comprehend it  for better or for worse http   divya blr tumblr com  Holden Caulfield    I can t even begin to talk about this guy   Do you guys know that feeling you get when a book brings you on a journey and the words on its pages are no longer a hassle to read  the sentences flow and you find yourself in another place when you re really just sitting at your desk flipping through a really interesting book This was how I felt reading The Catcher in the Rye  I picked up this book without knowing a single thing about its content  except for the fact that it s a classic and has been named many readers  favorite book or the book that inspired them most  Well  also that despite all the great reviews the book has received over the past 60 61 years  many people still wonder what it is that s so great about the book   mostly because they didn t find the protagonist  Holden Caulfield  very appealing  the main plot was just    plain or there wasn t even a plot at all Let s get this straight  personally  I like Holden Caulfield  At some parts in the book  I saw myself in Holden  some parts of my personality or thoughts or tendencies  I liked how he was honest and frank about nearly everything and how deep inside that young man was a kid  a kid that was afraid of what the world out there has to offer The part about the non existent plot  as I like to call it  I found that the most interesting part of the book  You wouldn t want to read a book knowing what it has to offer  The most important thing about an interesting book is its ability to bring you on an adventure  and also the fact that it shouldn t be predictable and bore you  really To those of you who are thinking of reading this book  read it  Even if you don t like it now  you may find yourself starting to agree with the little things in the book in the future Totally worth the time     Amazing read  What the fuck is life  anyway   Nothing much happens  however the journey Holden Caulfield goes through in this book is staggering  His narrative voice is one of the most distinct that I have ever read and he comes off the page more than most lead characters ever do  His experiences are at times funny and at times heartbreaking and I found myself putting off finishing the book as I didn t want it to end  Loved every moment   this is one of the best books I ve read so far  not that I m an avid reader but in my humble opinion  your life has been wasted if you never read this book mind you that  it is such a depressing book but in a good way  I mean  I ve been struggling these days to overcome the  self  conflict I ve been dealing with  so this book  just to let it pass it s good to know there are other ppl facing their lives in the same shoes like yours  the same goes to me from this book  I m glad to know  I m not alone struggling with depression  or whatsoever you called it    even if Holden Caufield is not so real it took me days to finish reading but I actually enjoyed it  and almost burst into tears till the last pages  well actually  I already did   I don t even know what to say  I won t lie  I cried while reading this and laughed while reading it and did both at the same time while reading this  I fucking loved this book  and I will never understand why someone won t love it  it s so real in the moments we all feel but can rarely put into words  it put into words the feelings and moments that make us all feel insane and out of place and maybe completely alone  it killed me  and it gave me all sorts of life  fuck  one of my all time favourites now for sure without a single fucking doubt  The protagonist comes off very annoying  I suggest reading the Cliff notes after each chapter to understand the real meaning of the book  Also read the Cliff note summary  themes  and symbolism BEFORE reading the book  this is not the kind a book you want to walk into blind  While reading it I hated it but after finishing it I grew to love it  Just get threw the book and then make your decision  The one thing I have to say is I hate how this book is portrayed really the book is about the mental break down of a boy  who hates what he believes the grown up world is like  He wants to stay a child but knows he can t and refuses to take part in society  He has some kind of mental illness but the book never says what   Holden associates death with the mutability of time  He wishes that everything could just stay the way it is  that time could stand still  especially when something beautiful happens  At core  I believe the books point kind gives us something to think about when using the word innocence  As a child innocence is seen as a good thing but as one grows up innocence is very similar to ignorance  If you do not accept the change in the word  where does that leave you  Can you accept society or are the just phonies Major ThemesInnocenceDeathAuthentic versus Artificial   It s hopeless anyway  If you had a million years to do it in  you couldn t rub out even half the  fuck you  signs in the world  It s impossible   Holden Caulfield is the kind of bastard that can t enjoy art if he thinks the artist thinks too highly of himself  He s the kind of bastard that easily identifies the pettiness and scabs of others and then gets lonely when deprived of the people he so perceptively criticizes  He s the kind of bastard that lies to make conversation easier  skips his last few cents across a lake in hopes that that ll ease his depression and flunks school for high minded reasons he can t articulate  Holden Caulfield is among the most harmless and most entertaining of all the bastards  he is a silly bastard Many people don t like Holden and much of the in depth analysis of this novel focuses on Holden s childishness  his selfishness and his  typical teenager  iness  But I find Holden a model of mixed up compassion  He sees people s warts because he cares enough to look and he misses them when they re gone  He s depressed and aimless because part of him realizes that he s as mixed up and phony as everyone else  Holden s dilemma is a timeless one  adult society is full of fakers and bullies but it s inescapable  I see now why this is considered a classic  It s truly fantastic  Yes  it is jam packed with vulgarity  and yes  Holden Caulfield himself is a complete immature moron at times  that s what he seems to refer to everyone else as   and yes  he does hire a prostitute  but those things only lead to the whole theme of the book It can be read and interpreted different ways  but I like to think of it as a book of sadness and loneliness  Holden Caulfield flat out says he is depressed  He s suicidal and can t form a connection with anyone  He tries to  but in futile ways  He won t let himself view adults as anything but a bunch of phonies  That s why he likes his kid sister so much  She listens and cares and gets genuinely excited about stuff  So when readers get annoyed that Holden is being too immature and just needs to  grow up   then they re barely missing the point  He does need to  and in a way he knows that  but he is in denial  He doesn t want to become an adult because he s only known them to disappoint The Catcher in the Rye is excellent literature  We just read in in my AP English class and I really enjoyed it  It s extremely depressing  and I think anyone can identify with Holden with feeling lonely sometimes  but it is also hilarious  Holden has some of the greatest and funniest quotes I ve ever heard  I recommend reading this if you have ever hated some aspect of society or ungenuine people  If you are the slightest bit cynical  read this  Holden is the king of that  It s definitely an entertaining read  You just have to take some things lightly and some things not  This book is great for all ages  but I liked it especially because I m at the brink of adulthood myself so I definitely relate to Holden s denial of growing up  I loved it  and recommend it to anyone that wants to read a great book full of laughter and hidden meaning  I loved this book and it was a joy to read  This book was often funny and also sad in equal amounts This book is considered a   classic   and I couldn t agree more with that I enjoyed the book mainly for the fact that it is written in the first person making the main characters thoughts more relevant   like he is talking to you and only you He is also   in my opinion very easy to relate to and empathise and sympathise with He shares opinions of people in a very honest and comical way making the book very funny but when he shares his own thoughts and feelings they can be very though provoking and at times upsetting Through the thoughts he shares with you   you seem to build a profile of him and his world around him   Holden Caulfield  in his own right  is the real definition of an ordinary teenager with a not so ordinary mind  His story is a journey through his emotional ups and downs through only a brief yet remarkable period in his life  After all  not every teenager begins their journey by finding themselves expelled for a fourth time for low academic scores  with everywhere to go but home  Love him  hate him  no one can deny  Holden has a troubled mind  The feeling of loneliness weighs down on you through every line and every page of the book  Holden portrays himself as a  tough guy   but as he finds himself faced with the most daunting task for any teenager  moving on and growing up  the ghost of Allie s death pulls him down  and he sees himself as alone and hopeless with no one to look to for support  Is tragedy one of the main cause of loneliness  People never believe you   Being expelled from school  out in the city on your own  no friends or family for support  you d hardly imagine a random taxi driver not believing your age was Holden s biggest problem  But it s the little moments that are the keys to unlocking a character who seems so straightforward and normal as Holden does  He is a normal teenager  who speaks to the reader in a normal way  but it s easy to tell that loneliness inside is Holden s biggest demon  He has grown cold and closed himself off from having any friends  but just keeps convincing himself that he is only misunderstood  and not lonely  because he is afraid of realising why he is so cold and used to closing people off  because it makes him reflect back to his past and remember the days that made him feel so sad and alone   A great novel  in my opinion  is the one that leaves me a lot of questions by the time I finish reading it  Too many  whys  in my head that I can hardly bear them all till for days  I keep thinking on why the author ends the novel in such a way  in an unexpected ending  Perhaps  for some readers  they will regard the ending as the best one and bring them to enjoy a bit of forceful happy ending  But for me  I prefer to see the major character to be who he wants to be and defends his own belief  And a good piece of art will find me too precious to tell to my friends what the hell the novel is all about  Well  I can say to them the beginning  a little bit of major stories and the end of it  But the book is too amazing thereby it will be hard for me to put into words on its details and all I can say is  you should read it by yourself  I am referring to  The Catcher in The Rye   His name is Holden Caulfield and he is just 16 years old  But all the way down  I felt like I was reading the personalities of a thirty something year old man  He experienced too many extraordinary things in his life  He was kicked out four times from school as he did not pass some subjects  Not because he was stupid  But rather  he hated its people  Holden called them as  phonies   Holden loved only English and he passed for that subject only  So instead of living with the phonies  he chose to let the schools to kick him out  Basically  the book tells its readers on what he did within three days after he left Pencey  a prestigiuos school which became the fourth place that expelled him  He should have spent few more days at Pencey before he went back home  But he couldn t stand of his arrogant roomates so he preferred to spend a lot of doughs to stay in a hotel  pay for a teenage prostitute  get drunk  wander and involve in a number of fightings This youngman is insane yet honest  Througout the pages  all I can feel is how he hated a lot of people  He was even disliked his father and mother  He showed only his respects for his late brother and affectionate sister  Damn  How he loved his siblings And as I told earlier  I cannot tell much on its details  The novel is too lonesome and miserable so as you should really read it by yourself  I myself took only few days to finish reading it since I was impatient to know the ending and what Holden would do by the time he was at home and how he could tell his parents about being expelled from the school  And I was like throwing the book by the time I knew all the answer  It lied only in the two last pages of the novel and I read them over and over again to ensure I got the ending very well  Trully  I was desperate  How could J  D  Salinger ended his story in that way   Reading through pages  I strongly believed Holden would commit suicide or at least create his own world and away from people he hated most  Why wouldn t the author let Holden be an idealist   Why should he surrender all his idealism   Did he love his sister old Phoebe so much so that he wanted to be a catcher in the rye   And so he was  He was a goddam catcher in the rye O   J D  Salinger  you really breaks my heart  You should answer many curiosities lingering in my head now  Are you too afraid to let Holden be who the hell he really is   Is he still alive anyway     A tale of an individual s alienation within a heartless world     This classic novel by J D  Salinger describes a character named Holden Caulfield who finds himself at a young age between a place he cannot go back to and place he doesn t want to go  The character  the story  and the experience describes every teenager who has ever felt  fed up   When I realized I hadn t reviewed Catcher in the Rye I was hugely disappointed  Not because I hadn t gotten to it yet  more because I realized that I had skewed my star system to positively  I may now have to go back and re review all of these books  moving the stars back one  so that I will have a fifth star saved for the few books ever written that moved me as deeply as Catcher did What did I learn from Catcher  First that there is no style template for a great novel  That a great novel is about telling a great story  Beyond that  life lessons  I am not huge on super analyzing novels  I didn t study literature and I don t want to talk about symbolism in great detail  What I know is how books have made me feel  Catcher is personal  It s almost in a league of its own I once had a teacher say if he ever wrote something like catcher in the rye he would just put down his pen and retire  I agree  Looking across the other reviews of this book  you come across a massive disparity of opinions There are plenty of readers who relate to Holden Caulfield  they feel as if he is a hero  a savior of innocence  or a shining light of realism and displeasure in a hyper patriotic modern wasteland  Others  however  see him as a whiny and irresponsible teenager  They begrudge Holden s constant hypocrisy  his repetitive nature  his negative personality and his judgmental attitude  I think that both interpretations are correct  Holden is certainly a good person with a troubled past and is also a nagging and brash teenager  Holden is his own worst enemy and has trouble making good decisions  but his flaws do not necessarily detract from the worth of his character  The Catcher In The Rye is an excellent novel  and the emotional charge and biography behind the story only serve to increase its relativity through the years       lns

khrfy  I never really understood John Green s argument that you don t need to like the characters in a book to like the book itself  That was  until I read this book I mean  for the first few chapters of the book  I hated Holden  It seemed like he wasn t even trying  He was prejudiced and misogynist  I didn t want to listen to him whine about his problems for roughly 200 pages  But  as the novel went on  I began to empathise with Holden  I saw how lonely and lost he truly was  I saw how this boy   my polar opposite   was in fact the me I didn t like to think about  Deep down I was like Holden in many  many ways  I began to like the fact Holden wasn t typically  likeable   but still relatable  It made the book so much more interesting  I began to notice the little quirks in the story  For instance  how his red hat was the same colour as Allie s hair  and how he used it to protect himself  When he asked about where the ducks would go  when the lake froze over  I realised he was actually asking where he would go  now everything seems to have frozen over  and where would he go when he was older  Throughout the novel  Holden searches for one thing in particular  Someone to listen to him  And  nobody does  Nobody can understand how he really feels  Nobody ever really understands how anybody else feels  But for some reason  this novel so often described as  depressing   made me feel kind of  content in a way  That is when I finished it  I mean  I think it s because I felt hopeful for Holden  Here he was  writing down what had happened  And this time  he had finally found the words to get someone to fully empathise with him  I mean  knowing Holden things could go very wrong  but I got the impression that  new Holden  is strong When reading the reviews of this novel  I noticed some people deeming Holden as their idol and others  stating how much they disposed him  Holden is not my idol  but I can t help but admire him  Before I read this I wasn t really into reading a book  now  I can t imagine a day without reading one  Even though Holden may be a little whinny  the main message communicates to anyone who has ever been felt like they were alienated  As I followed Holden s life  it was like I was literally looking through his eyes and experiencing what he went through  The thing is though  throughout all your teenage years  you have people tell you  I was sixteen once    I was seventeen    I was your age before   Well if you re like me  you would have then said to them or to yourself   okay  but you grew up in a different town  with different people  in a different school  with different friends  with more girlfriends  with better grades  etc   so  how can you possibly know what I ve been through when you ve lived a different life anyways   But  you see  when I read catcher in the rye  I not only could picture a persons story  I could put myself in Holden s shoes  That made me realize that even though someone goes through a different path than you do  they can still feel the same way   The whole way through this book I was thinking  THIS IS SO UNFAIR  Wanna know why  Here s why  When I was studying for my English Literature A Level  we didn t study ANY books like this  We had Scobie and The Heart of Darkness  and Tess of the D Ubervilles and a bunch of Shakespearean miscreants  How is Tess of the D Ubervilles supposed to help me move forward in modern living  How can I even relate So  while I m going through my teenage angst  bunking off school to go to Bad Religion gigs and feeling like a crazy outsider   nobody told me there are books like this out there I wonder if it s because it was a girl s school and they already had problems with us drinking in the hockey field with our equivalents from the local boys school  Who knows  I don t question Mr Burrows now  He was a good man Someone should put this book into the hand of every teenager and tell them  it s gonna be OK  Yea  people have these crazy thoughts and nights sometimes run away into the corridors of insanity  but the ducks are gonna be ok  Even when the ice freezes over Thank god for Mr Salinger  and if you re a parent   get a copy of this for your family bookshelf  Now  The title of the book  The Catcher in the Rye  attracted me first  This book has been one of the most challenged books of the 20th century  I was well aware of the book s place in the literary world  Simply  it was a very famous book and other than that  I didn t know anything about the book  I didn t even know the name of the main character  The Catcher in the Rye was first published as serial form in 1945 6 and first published in book form in 1951  This masterpiece by J D Salinger was not an avoidable one for me  I always wanted to read this book but I wasn t sure when  Finally in 2013  November 21 I decided to read The Catcher in the Rye and by 23rd I finished it gracefully  The number of total pages 192  A simple and small book  An easy read but did I take time  I m usually a slow reader  But when it came to The Catcher in the Rye  I loved myself for my slow reading  I didn t want Holden Caulfield s  the protagonist s rants to end  Caulfield is everything and nothing a teenager supposed to be  Holden is an unhappy rebellious teenager who wants to break free and fly out of the world  He desperatley wants an escape  He is prejudiced  quick to jump to judgement  inconsistent and lonesome  I was captured by his idealistic  unrealistic perspective  He was failed or reluctant to float away with the world  Caulfield represents a mass which firmly stand on their grounds with an inability to resonate with the realities of the present  Holden s personality captured me  I m not a 17 year old teen like Holden but a 21 year old woman who is amazed by Holden Caulfield s perspective of life and the way he constantly dropping out of everything in the world which he is supposed to be a part of  Do we have teens like Holden Caulfield in this 21 century  Of course we have but things have changed and our teens have their own way of expressing their rebellion against the world  The so called teen angst is no longer suppressed  But Holden is not an ordinary teen  He is the opposite of ordinary  He is intelligent and despite being lazy and unfocused Holden displays a great taste in books  He writes a composition for his roommate despite being upset with him  He is lonely and longs for a genuine relationship  He is not despising the world altogether but he is unhappy and irritated with the falseness and the phonies in it  Holden misinterprets a line from Robert Burns  poem  Comin Thro  the Rye  and he changes the line  If a body meets a body  to  If a body catches a body   He imagines himself as a catcher in the field of rye near the edge of a cliff and keeps picturing children playing in that field of rye and him catching them when they start to fall of the cliff  He is afraid of loosing the innocence and the realness to the pseudo world  Its a coming of age book  You can of course count this book as one of the greatest books of all time  Its a thought provoking and wonderful book written in a great and moving prose  This is my first Salinger book  I decided to read all other books and short stories written by this great personality  His writing style is like poetry  beautifully moving and wonderfully woven  I recommend this to all those who doesn t want to change themselves according to the way of the world but want to create a space of their own where they can flourish and enjoy the wildness of the world without being affected by the unreality of it  Holden is a 16 year old  he s lonely and terribly scared of the impending future that dawns upon him  He s constantly running away from his life  He has no one to relate to and thinks everyone he meets is fake  having ulterior motives in what they do in their choices only to suit their needs Holden is very empathetic even in his crude nature and is searching for anybody  anybody that will listen and empathize with him  This book is so very subtle in it s context  instead it s filled with symbolism and metaphors  There s never any big reveal and the narrator is always so passive in both contexts  As he tells the story  and as it happens to him   I loved getting to walk around New York with Holden  and get to know him through the strange characters he interacted with  I felt really connected with Holden and understood all that he was thinking about  I loved getting his inner thoughts as well as seeing his action  I felt that it really let the audience get immersed in Holden s story and allowed us to being to truly understand him in such a short book  I love Salinger s writing style as well  I think he has a unique voice and I like reading what he has to say  Every page had me caring even deeper for Holden  and made me more excited to continue on his journey with him  I loved every page of this book    On the subway today  a man came up to me to start a conversation  He made small talk  a lonely man talking about the weather and other things  I tried to be pleasant and accommodating  but my head hurt from his banality  I almost didn t notice it had happened  but I suddenly threw up all over him   The quote belongs to John Doe in Se7en but could easily  save the last line  have been Holden Caulfield on an average day  The thing is  it could easily have been myself on a bad day When you feel like that I can t think of better company than The Catcher in the Rye  Sometimes other people are idiots  Nobody describes the feeling better than J D  Salinger  Other ramblers like Karl Pilkington and Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm must love it too   Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger is a very catching book  It is a narration about Holden Caulfield s sixteen year old days  He is expelled  but doesn t tell his parents  and only has a little bit of money to spend  He talks about what he did with the money  and goes into detail on his opinions of certain things and people  The book is written as a narration so it is all in first person and based on his view of things  While there are a very large amount of swear words that are used  it adds some humor into the story  but also shows the pain that he is in  I think that the author successfully portrayed the emotions that Holden Caulfield felt throughout the course of a few days while he is sixteen and that the story itself was very well written   Smazvashcha i opustoshitelna kniga  BUKVALNO  Mrazia ia i ia obozhavam ednovremenno   Originally written for adults  it was an immediate hit with teenagers instead  and continues to be read by both groups more than 60 years after its first publication  Readers of any age will likely respond strongly to it  either loving it or loathing it  The protagonist and unreliable narrator is a boy of 16 with a limited vocabulary  and the prose is far  far more profanity laced than you d expect in a book from 1951  The subject matter likewise must have been jolting then  and will surprise even today s readers  There s underage drinking and sex  prostitution  homosexuality  and suicide  and I m probably forgetting other stuff  I don t believe in banning books  of course  yet I can understand why a school library might give this one a pass   Which only makes it more desirable as forbidden fruit  I m sure   A cynical  angry  depressed  lonely  frustrated kid flunks out of an exclusive private school  He s in no hurry to tell him parents  and instead of going straight home wanders aimlessly around Manhattan for a few days first  That s the plot  as little as it is  The book s not about the plot  but about the main character  and the reader s ability  and willingness  to identify with him  He also as a sweet side  by the way  as seen in his love for his kid sister  While teen angst is what the book is about first  it s also about the isolation and sadness that people of all ages sometimes struggle with  Read it and weep  I think this book is excellent for those who are troublemakers  since the narrator is a troublemaker  but he has a big heart  This books message is that everything is best with family  not with friends or with whores  who are supposed to give you pleasure  I think the narrator  Holden Caulfield  is mentally challenged since he keeps getting depressed over simple things like social hierarchy or when he s frustrated he says profanity to the girl he is dating  In the end of the book when he bought a ticket for his younger sibling  Phoebe  to ride the merry go round and she rides a beaten up horse  its also the picture in front of the book  while she is riding it she tries to grab a gold ring  but nearly falls  This is a symbol of taking risks  This book impacted me more than any other book  more than any war book  I couldn t believe that a 12 year old was about to have sexual intercourse with a prostitute and he comes from a privileged family  What a normal underprivileged kid doesn t do a privileged kid does   fuck a phony that dont understand this goddam book After being exposed to the unending hate that Holden receives from dozens of people  I decided to give The Catcher in the Rye a reread  I ve never really understood the vehement support of a book requiring a relatable or likeable protagonist in order to be good  In this case there seems to be a lack of empathy towards Holden and a stark refusal to understanding his position Even in high school  when I first read the book  I didn t dislike Holden  In this 2nd reading I feel even more compassion towards him  he s reeling so hard from his brother s death that he incessantly criticizes everything  He is just as guilty of the phoniness and hypocrisy he likes to point out  Rather than get frustrated with him pointing out how everything sucks  it really killed me  The fact that all his snap judgments and strange explanations of his own behavior are so ludicrous is why I find them hilarious What I got from Holden is that he just wanted someone to talk to without endless posturing and superficial bullshit  In the age of the internet and social media people love to point out how its destroying authentic social interaction  But even in Holden s world  you can see how its not the sole fault of technology  A lot of interactions are superficial and based on some sort of deception  It s not until near the end of the book where he has substantial conversations with both Phoebe and his teacher that he gets what he wants  He enjoys talking with his sister  Anyway  I like it now   I said   I mean right now  Sitting here with you and just chewing the fat and horsing    That isn t anything really   It is so something really  Certainly it is  Why the hell isn t it  People never think anything is anything really  I m getting goddam sick of it  After spending time at his teacher s place  it really kick starts his internal thought processes and he starts to understand the error on his judgmental attitude I like characters that I can jump into and try to understand how they work and I believe that Salinger really nailed it with Holden So I guess I kind of shot myself in the foot with my argument because I do think Holden is both relatable and likeable though I think it would be hard if not impossible to write a human character that isn t relatable on some sort of level Stay Holden phony boy  i first read this book in seventh grade  i had a progressive english teacher and he let us read pretty much whatever we wanted  i think that age twelve is a bit too young for catcher in the rye although not because there are curse words and hints of sex  but then again  it s also a perfect age because you feel as though you re reading something the older kids are reading  something you re not quire supposed to read  and that makes it even more exciting the last time i read this book was right after i graduated from college  eight years ago  i was about to leave all of my friends and my then boyfriend and move to san francisco  where  eventually  i d be joined by other friends but where i didn t  at the time  know anyone  i think i cried at almost every page  khyly

a classic and people say it s obnoxious  and we have to read it in my Junior English class in a year and a half  But I m just going to say that this is currently my favorite book of all time  I got nearly all of the metaphors  such as the red hunter s hat sort of being a symbol for Holden s security  when his little sister Phoebe gives it back to him  she s giving him with little innocence he has left intact  and I don t know  I found it relatable and much less angsty then what we hear about in English Lit  I heard on someone s YouTube book review that she had no attachment to the characters  but I certainly felt lonely when Holden did  and I had hope for the Holden who is telling the story in present tense  Ultimately  I adored this book and hope that I can convince some of my friends that it is a must read  I loathed this book while reading it  I thought that Salinger s narrator Holden Caufield was a whinny little malcontent and I just wanted him to  get to the point   Holden is alienated from society  He feels that no one understands him and that everyone is a  phony   He thinks that no one is honest  and everybody wants to be something else  He feels that the only person who understands him is Phoebe   his ten year old sister  He does not have relationships with girls  or anyone because he feels that he is the only genuine person in the world   When Holden hears the  Catcher in the Rye  song being sung by a little boy  he decides that he wants to be the person that keeps children from falling off a cliff  That cliff being the transition from childhood to adulthood  and he wants to keep them as innocent children  not phony adults I finished the book and thought  thank goodness that s over   Then as the hours went on I realised just how deep and profound the book actually was and am just as effected by it today  A must read  How many pages long is this book  Let s do the math The physical book is 288 pages  However  this is an inaccurate measurement  First of all  Holden never has a thought worth saying that isn t worth saying twice  So it s really half that length  or 144 pages  But the book isn t really 144 pages either  The book has 26 chapters  and each of them plays out exactly the same  Holden meets someone he considers a phony  acts superior psychopathic  and is surprised when his insufferable attitude doesn t win him any friends So in fact  144   26   5  This book is really five pages long  J D  Salinger has quite the scheme going on here  write five pages  get paid for 288   J ai toujours entendu parle de L Attrape coeurs et je n ai jamais vraiment eu l occasion ou l envie particuliere de le lire  Pourtant  jeudi dernier je me baladais a la fnac   en attendant la prochaine seance du film que je voulais voir   comme je le fais toujours un peu comme si c etait ma propre bibliotheque et j ai atterri dans le rayon Romans Anglophones  J y traine pas des masses  dans ce rayon  parce qu ils mettent toujours en avant ces livres romantiques que je n apprecie pas trop  Enfin bref  je me baladais pour passer le temps et pendant que je marchais a travers ce rayon  j ai pense au livre que j etais actuellement entrain de lire Dash   Lily s book dares  C est l histoire d une fille qui laisse son journal dans une librairie au rayon de l auteur J D  Salinger et un garcon le trouve parce qu il adore Salinger et puis voila ils font des paris et tout ca  Donc  je pensais a ce livre la et a Salinger alors j ai cherche l etagere ou se trouvait les oeuvres de ce fameux J D  Salinger  Il n y avait que deux oeuvres en fait   au moins une centaine d exemplaires de L Attrape Coeurs et puis Nouvelles  J ai pris le premier livre de L Attrape Coeurs que je pouvais attraper sous la main et j ai commence a le lire  Ce qui m a plu c est la familiarite et l air desabuse du personnage principal  Le premier chapitre passe  je me suis assise sur un sorte de tabouret et j ai lu jusqu a ce que la voix off previenne que le magasin allait fermer  Le livre ne coutant que 5EUR j etais trop contente   je l ai pris et en plus il n y avait personne a la caisse    C est la premiere fois de ma vie que je voyais la fnac de Chatelet sans des files d attente monstres  Trop contente Au debut j ai trouve Holden Caulfield amusant  J aimais la maniere dont il n aimait rien et changeait d humeur toutes les quatre secondes  je me disais  Ha ha   C est trop moi     Puis  hier soir j ai commence a me sentir profondement triste  Holden ne me faisait plus rire  il me refilait sa deprime  J ai fini par comprendre qu il ne faisait qu errer dans cette histoire  Qu il se demandait ou allait les canards du lac quand il etait gele parce qu il voulait lui aussi partir  Cet Holden n est pas un sarcastique boute en train qui s amuse a faire chier les gens en s inventant des noms et des situations loquaces  Cet Holden est deprime  il ne sait pas quoi faire de sa vie  Il est nostalgique  il n a pas envie d avancer  Rien ne lui convient  Et cet Holden  c est moi  C est exactement moi  l ete dernier quand je ne voulais ni retourner a la fac  ni quoique ce soit  que je voulais juste m en aller sans savoir ou ni comment  Je ne pense pas que ce livre soit uniquement destine aux adolescents a la recherche d un avenir  Je pense qu il est destine a toutes les personnes en perdition  J aurais voulu connaitre ce livre plus tot finalement  Je ne pense pas qu il m aurait aide ou je ne sais quoi mais j aurais voulu connaitre Holden Caulfield plus tot  Generalement  soit on adore completement ce livre  soit on le deteste completement  Moi je l ai adore  Apres  je dirais que le petit bemol est la traduction qui m a un peu    enfin elle ne me parait pas tres geniale  Quand je le pourrais je me procurerais la version originale pour encore mieux connaitre Salinger  Je l aime bien ce type  Il me plait bien Edit   J ai donc lu la version originale  J ai mis plus de temps a lire l histoire et je me suis arretee plus d un mois entre temps   pour lire CoHF   _   et obtenir une nouvelle copie   donc  ma lecture a un peu ete ruinee mais j aime toujours autant ce livre  Davantage en anglais  Ca m inquiete d autant apprecier un livre porte sur la depression mais je n y peu rien  I LOVED this book and personally  I feel as if I am going to read it again  The story and irony incorporated within the novel was absolutely amazing  A book that I would recommend reading following this one is the novel Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer  I recommend this because in my opinion  Christopher McCandless mirrors the main character in The Catcher in the Rye  Holden Caulfield  from a more modern perspective when examining their views on adulthood and society  Into the Wild is definitely recommended  Furthermore  The Catcher in the Rye is an amazing book  The novel hits you emotionally with no warning  however  this is what adds to the Caulfield because while reading  readers often get attached to to him in an emotional sense  Boy  I would recommend this book to anyone  however  I am telling you now to be prepared to feel sad and a slight bit mad at society when finished   I m not going to discuss here the plot of this very entertaining novel since at the time I am writing this over 22 000 others have already posted reviews on goodreads  many of whom go into great length about the story line  What I will say though is I very much enjoyed the book and found 17 year old Holden Caulfield a very quirky  humorous character who had me smiling and laughing countless times during his telling of his extraordinary 2 day adventure  beginning with his expulsion from the very exclusive Pencey Prep and concluding with his wild adventures in Manhattan  A classic example of the humor I m referencing is Holden s obsessive concern about what happens to the ducks in the lagoon in Central Park during the wintertime  He has conversations with a couple of taxi drivers figuring they might know  He asks one of the taxi drivers  I mean does somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away  or do they fly away by themselves   go south or something   Both taxi drivers respond in a very blunt New York manner  letting Holden know that that they have no idea and making it very clear they think he must be out of his mind  Later in the novel he wanders into the Park rip roaring drunk at an obscenely late hour to check out the ducks  I read these incidents and many others with a big smile on my face  There were many other humorous and entertaining incidents like this but this was a definite favorite I ve read that as recently as the early 80 s this was the most censored book in US public schools  ostensibly because of its vulgar language  In fact in 2009 it was one of the most challenged books according to the American Library Association  Vulgar language   Give me a break    My God  network prime time TV programs  not to mention PG 13 movies and contemporary music have stronger language  Only shows I guess just how uptight and narrow minded a large number of people are  This is a very enjoyable and quick read and a book I would highly recommend  It is in fact I think a must read novel and I clearly see why it has become a modern day classic  Be sure to read or possibly re read it  Uno de mis favoritos absolutos  El  Guardian en el centeno  trata de un par de dias en la vida de Holden Caulfield  un adolescente de familia acomodada al que acaban de expulsar  una vez mas  de un internado  El dia que lo expulsan decide volver a Nueva York  la ciudad en que vive  pero en vez de volver a la casa de sus padres  a los que no queria enfrentar antes de que reciban la carta oficial del colegio  decide hospedarse en un hotel   El Guardian en el centeno  es la historia de esos dos dias  de las aventuras de Holden y de sus esfuerzos por encontrarse a si mismo en una edad dificil Puede parecer cliche  pero creo que  El guardian     es uno de los libros mas importantes sobre busqueda de la propia identidad que se han escrito  A alguna gente le desagradan las constantes criticas de Holden Caulfield a una serie de cosas en el mundo a las que  a veces sin ninguna base  ataca como  falsas   el cine  los estudiantes de la Ivy League con sus chalecos al hombro pavoneandose ante sus chichas  los marinos que te apretan la mano demasiado fuerte al saludar  Pero a cierta edad tambien es importante definir lo que uno NO es para poder encontrarse  En la primera escena del libro Holden Caufield mira desde lejos el partido de futbol mas importante del ano entre el equipo de su colegio y su rival  sintiendose totalmente ajeno Hay una enorme sensacion de pertenencia al leer este libro e identificarse con todo aquel que se ha sentido extrano alguna vez  por preferir leer libros a hacer otra cosa  por creer que son importantes cosas en que nadie mas parece fijarse  Holden Caufield puede tener muchos defectos  pero tiene la cualidad redentora doble del humor y la bondad  los carinosos recuerdos de su hermano muerto y de su hermana Phoebe  la admiracion que varias veces a lo largo del libro expresa por distintas personas  un tipo que sabe silbar muy bien  un par de monjas amables en una cafeteria  J D  Salinger es un maestro narrador  y el  Guardian     se lee increiblemente rapido  Los dialogos son precisos y correctos  una leccion de economia  Este es un libro iniciatico  conmovedor y polemico en su tiempo  Recomendado para todos  I couldn t decide whether I liked this book until after finishing it and processing it  I figured out why I was somewhat confused  This book was described to me as someone who hates everything and makes you hate everything  When I read it I didn t find anything super strange about it  Yeah the main character makes a few strange decisions and has some strange thoughts BUT it overall came off to me as any other regular teen  Which needless to say is probably bad  I think the main character makes so many good points and says a lot of the things people think  Great book  This is the book that converted me from an occasional  reluctant reader into a bit of an obsessive and it remains the greatest book I have ever read  I don t want to sound like a cliche  and I know a lot of people like to ridicule the fact that this book is held in such high regard  especially among the  teenage  audience  but I really think this to be a true work of genius  It s hilarious and very touching and  despite not having a plot  Holden s narrative won me over from the first page  His cynicism and sensitivity make him a real great guy  he really is    and his outlook on life is intriguing  Maybe one day  I too will fondly reminisce on my younger years when I felt this way but for now  I am eternally grateful to Salinger having written this masterpiece  and writing this review makes me want to read it again  I loved this book  It was easy to read and I didn t feel like I was reading a book  It was as if my friend was telling me apart of his life   I know it s no Raise High the Roof Beam  but I kinda feel the need to re read Catcher in the Rye after reading King Dork  And those of you who have strong feelings about Salinger either way and can admit to occasionally enjoying teen fiction and or have ever pretended to hipsterdom must absolutely read King Dork  which I can only describe as Catcher turned  up to eleven   Is there such a thing as a mockunovel  I think this book is one of the best books on Earth  The Catcher in the Rye is a strange phenomenon owing mostly to the entirely inaccurate reputation it has garnered  and the misleading representation of its protagonist by contemporary readers  Let me first start off by saying that this  banned book  is far from the nest of filth and depravity that many tout it as being  The Catcher in the Rye is the story of a kid who  like everyone  wants to find the place where he belongs  After being kicked out of another prepatory school  Holden Caulfield decides to spend a few days kicking around New York before he goes back home to tell his parents  During his time in New York he meets new people  finds old friends  gets drunk  gets in trouble  and longs for that which he used to have  Holden Caulfield is not a genius  and he s not an antihero  Holden Caulfield is a kid confused about his place in the world who is just trying to find some form of identity  So  before you start reading this coming of age story  forget all the nonsense that you ve heard and think of Holden Caulfield as a less than brilliant  out of place adolescent and not as a seething symbol of social rebellion  The Catcher in the Rye is one of my top three favorite books   Everyone always talks about the books being about loss of innocence  It is  but what I find far more interesting is how well J D  Salinger evokes the crushing feeling that nobody cares  Put simply   Nobody ever notices anything   As a person who has gone through mental breakdowns  I found a sense of connection to the story  which will remain a classic for generations as a coming of age tale   Quem me dera ter lido este livro no secundario em vez d Os Maias   livro que so soube apreciar anos mais tarde   qualquer adolescente identificar se a muito mais com um personagem como Holden Caulfield do que com Carlos da Maia  por exemplo  Am I the only one who thought parts of this were laugh out loud funny    I would cry from laughter from Holden s descriptions of things  Maybe I relate too much  My full video review is here https   www youtube com watch v 7y6jl    this unusual book may shock you will make you laugh and may break your heart   BUT YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT   I decided to read The Catcher in the Rye after my Mum read it and didn t like it which somehow intrigued me to read it even more  This may be because I wanted to see exactly what she meant or to have a riveting debate about it afterward if I thought otherwise This fills the category of a classic book published before 1950  Although it was  officially  published in 1951  but it s serial form was published in 1945 and i figured that was close enough  Despite my Mum telling me it wasn t a good book  I really enjoyed it  This may be because it is based on a teens life not a grown adult My favourite character from the novel was Holden  who was the main character  I favoured him because he is witty  self efficient and independent  Although he isn t displaying the best of choices and decisions  the way he goes about his life is interesting as some of his choices are ones I could never think of making myself My favourite quote is  People never notice anything   I like this as after I read it  I had to think about exactly what he meant  I discovered that the more I think I notice  the less I actually do as I do not bother being observant anymore than I have to  I think a lot of people are the same  Most people are narrow minded and often oblivious to  the bigger picture  which I believe human beings should work on What I learnt from this novel was that the decisions you make early on effect the choices you can make later as it limits your opportunities if you make a wrong decision  Although some opportunities can be developed  others are created by how hard you work or pursue one   Por el momento solo dire que amo a Holden  Y que necesito saber que paso con el       What can I say  I just finished reading the book yesterday as it was recommended by one of my friends and since I finished reading its being in my head whole day  After finishing the book I felt very lonely as Holden Caulfield became so alive and as I was with him during the his entire journey from Pencey till home I think If Holden was real we would have become best friends      Review  I must admit I didn t find it interesting in the beginning and felt it like a hard read type book  Especially I wasn t able to grasp the meaning of some of his expressions such as Phony  corny   Flitty   and when he says  It killed me  does it mean it pleased him or displeased him   But eventually the more the I went through the pages I became really engrossed and got extremely intrigued  I got glued to the book and was reading it whenever I can  and finished in 3 days time  While reading the book I felt like I was going through the journey of my own life and somebody was speaking to me and narrating me my own story  Holden was just an expression of the majority of teenagers in the world  I strongly recommend this book to everyone and its not hard read at all so even those people who are not much of a reader will also enjoy this book  I believe   By the way when I went to buy this book  my local bookstore didn t have it available so I had to make a special order with some extra bucks and it was worth it      I read this book many  many years ago while I was still in my  angry young man  phase and didn t quite understand the big hub bub about this book then  After all  Holden Caulfield was just saying what we were all thinking  everyone is a jerk or a phonie and there is very little beauty in the world  Now that I am midway through my forties  I see Holden in a different light  He is an angry young man  just as I was but maybe  just maybe  he will come out of it and become a happy young man  Living with that much anger on your shoulders can be very devistating  or it can be a great asset  If one is artistic he can use that rage to produce some very provocative work  just as J D  Salinger did in creating this classic novel  Or  one can allow that anger to get to them and climb into a bell tower with a loaded sniper rifle  Anger  like fear  brings out both the best and the worst in people but it ultimately depends on how much the person allows these emotions to control them  I think that Holden will have turned out okay  He loves his little sister and  to a lesser extent  his older brother D B   who he thinks is a phony because he is a screenwriter for Hollywood  but the memory of his younger brother who died some time ago will keep him centered  He might be full of rage  but Holden is a nice kid that just wants someone to understand him  That is just what everbody wants  This is sometimes required reading in high school English classes and I think it should be  I think every teenager  especially the boys  really needs to read this book  but I think every parent of teenagers should read or re read it as well  It might remind them of what it felt like to be a sixteen year old  for many people the most painful time of their lives   It s been a long time since I first read this book  It s just crazy  off the scale  good  Its stream of consciousness style and main character s oscillating behavior in a bygone era may not suit all readers  yet the discomfiture of youth is vividly portrayed  La adolescencia convertida en libro  En este nos veremos reflejados muchas veces y otras veremos a companeros que hemos tenido  Es el libro que mas rapido me he leido nunca  This has to be the best book I have read this year so far  I wanted to take a break from my normal reading of fantasy dystopian  and I knew this book was the perfect choice  Holden is a very cynical person  but not irrational  He has his own opinions  and keeps them open to everyone  and that s what I enjoy most about him A lot of characters I read about are bland  and have little to know personality  But Holden is exceptionally different  I particularly likes it when he calls himself a  madman  quite often   it shows how he views himself  and makes him feel like a real person that I would want to get to know  I went into this book knowing absolutely nothing of what to expect  and came out happy and wanting a sequel  wanting a longer story of Holden Caulfield

have some fun  I really enjoyed this book because it was just interesting  Wasn t boring at any point  And everything was in Holden s perspective  Which was very cool just to see how he thought of things and what was going on around him  Not only was it in his perspective but it like he was talking to the reader  He was a  mostly  relatable teenager  Just with how he viewed the world was the most relatable  At some points he was this rebellious young guy who seemed to just care about where he was going to get his next drink but then he would go and worry about his sister or an old friend   The Catch in the Rye is one of my all time favorite books  J D  Salinger has a great Style of writing that tends pull the reader in  You cannot put the book down  you just have to keep reading to find out what will happen next  This novel is just oozing with rebelliousness   Holden Caulfield  the main character  was a troubled teen  who just could not seem to stay in one private school for very long  The book began with him preparing to leave Pencey Prep  We soon discover that he had attended Whooton School and Elkton hills before Pencey  We quickly figure out that Holden was an outcast  This was made evident when he left all of the fencing equipment on the subway in New York City  The team got angry with him because they were forced to forfeit  While in New York  he purchased a red hunting hat  which becomes an important image in the book  Even though Holden himself was an outcast  he still managed to criticize others who were also considered  outcasts   Robert Ackley  Holden s suite mate  is a perfect example  Robert Ackley  as Holden described  was a rather unclean person  who never brushed his teeth  Holden acts as if he does not like Ackley  but deep down I think that he felt a connection with him  There was only one class at Pencey that Holden did not fail and that was English  He only liked one teacher  whose name was Mr  Spencer  Mr  Spencer taught history  which Holden failed because he wrote a horrible essay on the Egyptians  Holden visited Mr  Spencer the day before he left and began to pity the old  sick man  Holden liked Mr  Spencer  but he did not like his whole  life is a game  lecture  Holden felt his lecture was extremely phony  The night Holden decided to leave Pencey Prep three days early  he got into a fight with his roommate  Ward Stradlater  Stradlater was a popular jockey  Holden did not like any of the jocks because he had come to believe that all jocks were phony and he hated phonies  Anyway  Holden got into a fight with him because he talked inappropriately about what he did with Jane Gallagher on their date  Jane was a girl who Holden had spent one summer with a few years earlier  She played a crucial role in the book because of how important she was to Holden  After this fight  Holden decided it is time for him to leave Pencey  He knew that he could not go home because his parents had not received the letter stating that he had been kicked out of school  He did not want to be the one to tell them  but he could not stay at Pencey any longer  He had to get out because he felt that everyone at Pencey was a phony  He decided that he would take all the money that his grandmother had given him for his birthday and travel to New Work by train  When he got to New York  he wanted to call his little sister Phoebe  but it was too late and he did not want to wake his parents  He decided to call Sally Hayes instead  The next day he went on a date with her to a play and later they went ice skating  Sally helped Holden to decide what to do or rather what not to do with his future  While in New York  Holden furthered his fascination with ducks  He always wanted to know where the ducks in Central City Park went during the winter  He talked with a few taxi cab drivers about the ducks and asked them where they went  Most of them just thought he was crazy  A cab driver by the name of Hurwitz was the only one who attempted to answer his question  They had a nice conversation on the subject  The ducks are a reoccurring theme throughout this book In Holden s three day adventure in New York  he goes through many trails and tribulations while he tries to discover what he is going to do with the rest of his life  He meets many people while in New York  who tried to help him get on the right track  While others tried to throw him off course  To find out what Holden decides to do with the rest of his life and how he decides to do it  you must read The Catch in the Rye by J D  Salinger     WARNING NOVEL MAY CONTAIN CRUDE LANGUAGE AND OTHER MATERIAL    This is one of the strangest books I have read and also the fastest to be finished  It had me in its grip till the end  Is it the story  character  language or the fame surrounding this book that pulls you to it  I cant be sure of  The very first few lines will help you notice that he is a reclusive rebel who would not stop at the strictures and norms laid by the society  It is colloquial at its best  It has a strange pull and depresses you at certain places  Took me a while to understand the significance of the title  One of the most unique books I have read  I can only see the impact this book had on this genre of books and the new wave that was caught on by many newcomers of this era  Hail Salinger  I wouldn t try to change anyone s mind about a book that they generally don t like  but it seems that so many people who dislike The Catcher in the Rye do so because they can t stand Holden  Fair enough  I work with teenagers every day and God knows their insanity is beyond comprehension or excuse  I get the feeling that some of the other reviews could be right in saying that you either identify with Holden at some point in your life or you don t  but to me Holden and the book s success is more about his maturity  most of which we come to assume because of the where the book leaves us  This is the part of Holden that is not universal  Of course if you ve spent the book getting upset with him  then maybe the payoff isn t enough  For me  it was just right and I love the book    Catcher in the Rye   by JD Salinger  is about a seventeen year old boy who attended and failed four different schools  his last being Pencey Prep  The novel is narrated in first person by the protagonist Holden  who embeds a distinct stream of conscientiousness  raw and straightforward  Holden s true identity is revealed through his voice in the novel  which is undeceiving and sarcastic  Throughout the course of the novel  within a span of a few days  Holden encounters taxi drivers  nuns  a prostitute  a pimp  a couple of women  and two teachers on his journey to escape the  corrupted  society  I personally like the book  although it contained an abundant amount of profane language  it was how I  as a reader  was able to understand who Holden really was  Even though the book is structured very simply  its contents are essential in portraying it s message  When I first began to read the book  I didn t think much of the meaning behind the events  but through class discussions  I was able to visualize how all the events weaved in together perfectly to present Salinger s view of the society  In addition  after understanding the figurative meaning of the text  I was able to understand why Holden acted the way he did  and as a reader I was able to develop the ability to be a good observer in order to see the identity that society hides under its facade  The classic bildungsroman Holden Caulfield uncovers all the phonies in his life while searching for the question to where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter  Holden is one of the most realistic young narrators of all time  He hates everything but wants to like something someone and wants to be liked but at the same time can t stand anyone  He is messed up in the beginning of the narrative and is still messed up at the end   it doesn t get any realer that that  This is one of my favorites  it s on the list of books that I re read every 1 3 years  Themes  Growing up  family  love  identity  sex I simply love this book due to the fact that it does remind me of my past self   I was once Holden lol but might not be at the same level as he was  Before you start reading this review know that this belongs to my top 10 most loved books  Addicting  brilliant  bone shakingly good  extreme  divine  surpassing    Help me find words to discribe the Catcher In The Rhy  Luckily my mother told me that once I opend that book  I wouldn t be able to close it until I drained every word  every thought from it  So I made shure I was not to be disturbed the next hours  And started reading  as if in a trance  a frenzy  Do you know this feeling  when you get to a book completely  When every thought makes you think  when you feel every emotion describend  This is what the Catcher in the Rye is to me The book describes a few days in the life of an growing up teenager  After he gets thrown out of school he decides to spent a few days  well  just the way he likes to  His ironic wit and observations make one laugh  his way of approaching things makes you think about how you approach things  The way J D  Salinger describes the reality in such an dry and thoughtfull way made my cry  A lot  I suppouse I can t excactly say why this is so special  Perhaps because this book shows that in a few extreme days your life and you self can change completly  That growing up  getting to further episodes of your life  that changing can come from the smallest encounters and that humans react to small gestures very deeply Read this book and learn from it    Hellovabook   No doubt i am going to read this one multiple times  Classic  Most of my friends including myself could relate to the main character   Holden Caufield  He did not like the phonies  Preach  I read this a long long time ago but I remember the book vividly because it made a big impression on my life and how I want to live it  I knew I should have eventually have to read this  There s such magic around it s title  reputation  and everything else  As you know  I started this book a few years ago  April 28  2012  to be precise  but couldn t get past 30 pages  This year  I decided to give it another chance  And boy  this was SUCH a great read to start the new year with  What makes this book special  HOLDEN  HOLDEN  HOLDEN  HOLDEN  HOLDEN  HOLDEN CAULFIELD And Salinger s writing Holden is me  Holden is you  Holden is every teenager  Trust me I felt like I was reading my own thoughts while I was reading this book  Holden s perspective of life  his vulnerability just makes up the whole book  There is no plot going on here  It s just beautiful writing  scattered thoughts  and lots of life lessons  not in a preachy way  I am out of words  This is the second book that I ve read that I can relate to very much  And the words  the authenticity of Holden s voice just hit me in the right places  It creeped right under my skin and chilled my bones I don t have anything else to say  You will either love this book because of Holden or you will hate it  again  because of Holden I am speechless and I m sure Holden will stay with me for quite a long time Recommended to read if you re 16 or above  You might not appreciate it at an earlier age I tried reading this book last year  or two years ago  but I couldn t even get past the first 30 pages  Should I give it another try  Does it get better UPDATE I m gonna try reading this again since I want to read classics  I really hope I can get into it this time  Fantastic book I get excited whenever I see someone else reading it  The first copy I read was borrowed from my English teacher s class shelf  but I liked it so much  I never returned it  I would have bought another copy  but I always feel a connection to the actual book itself that made the influence  gave me the feeling  Recently  I saw one of my classmates reading it  and I thought   That s a great choice  Finally someone gets it   Then  it disheartening to find out that it was assigned reading for one of her classes  Then I thought  how can THIS book be forced reading  It s a gift  Ironically  whenever I hear that this is someone s favorite book I think   How original   I was maybe 15 years old when I read Catcher the first time  I checked it out of the high school library because I d heard it had been banned in other places  so I wanted to read this illicit material  The whole time I read it  back then  I wondered when I d get to the shocking parts  I finished reading the book wondering what the fuss was about Now  decades later  I know what the fuss was about  but  fuss  from the artistic viewpoint  It s pure genius  this book  I didn t really  get  it the first time  This time  I realized how funny it was  and how poignant  and toward the end I did wipe that little bit of tear from the corner of my eye  Highly recommended  This is a popular book  so I won t waste my time writing about what this book is all about  people probably already knew that  Just note that this book is a classic because the main character is an icon for  teenage rebellion   angst  and stands among the important characters in American Lit If you have read this book  you might think this is funny  but I love the main character  Holden Caulfield so much  Yes  despite his immature attitude and teenage angst  he s 16 btw  it s normal   I still love him  Why 1  He is an intelligent kid   He question things that an average teenager wouldn t even think about it  Being kicked out from school  doesn t mean he is stupid  Just that  it s not for him and he doesn t know the importance of an education yet 2  He is nurturing as hell   This doesn t need an explanation  you can see it from the way he treated his little sister  Phoebe  And the way he treated kids that he bumped into during his  depression phase   Also about his dream  to be the  catcher in the rye   who save kids from falling down  3  He is a romantic man   He respects and appreciate women  because he told us in the story  that he can only  being sexy  with a woman that has characters he really really like   being in love with 4  He is kind and generous   He generously lend his things to his friends throughout the story  And when his roomate asked him to write an english composition  he did it even when his roomate being a pain in the ass and all Looking at his character  I think Holden Caulfield is a special boy who is still finding a reason to live in this world  I m giving this book 5 stars and mark it as one of my favorite  Oh how I loved this book  surprisingly enough I ve found that everyone whom was questioning their sexuality in high school as was I all came to the same conclusion that Holden was gay or at least  curious   I do think that after a certain age life experience this book might lose some of its luster  I d have to re read it to make sure  This was one of the few  I mean very few  books that my stuffy  old Shakespearean type book loving  Oh did i mention the highlight of her year was when she was in the renaissance fair  gave me that I liked  Im pretty sure she only did that because the school board made her This book is a Most definitely a must read for everyone of all ages  everyone and anyone with a soul that has ever question the certainty of their existence  their life  or has ever dared to question instead of just excepting what you have been told as true will love this book While all authors strive to write books in a unique  voice   only a handful stand out as shining examples  JD Salinger s THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is one of them  I have just finished reading TCITR for the third time  specifically so that I could hear the  voice  of Holden Caulfield  and recall Salinger s archetype as a foundation for my own  Work In Progress   Funny thing was  I almost stopped reading after twenty or so pages because the voice felt like TOO MUCH  Focusing on how many times Holden says the word  phony  or how often he uses superlatives  sarcasm  and contradictions became nearly overwhelming  This is NOT a criticism of Salinger s choices  I believe the novel is close to perfect  Reading TCITR once versus multiple times is like going for a dip in the ocean versus donning scuba gear for a deep sea dive  The experience becomes infinitely more intense During the first and even second readings of this book  I focused mainly on Holden Caulfield s sad story  Holden is a nineteen year old rich kid struggling against everything that has been handed to him on the silver platter of his father s success  Unfortunately for Holden  that silver platter has not protected the family from tragedy  Allie  Holden s younger brother  died of leukemia several years before this story  and the entire family has suffered and coped with his death in their own way  Holden is extremely observant and sensitive  and through his struggle to make sense of his own luck and good fortune  money  good looks  intelligence  social graces  he is repelled by  phonies   snobs  conceited people  inconsiderate people     essentially anyone who wields power over anyone else  He has profound compassion for the innocent and less fortunate Holden s story is heartbreaking  I imagine many people know of a  rich kid  who drinks too much or fails to apply himself  so it s wonderful that Salinger could provide a glimpse into the heart and mind of one of those kids  The same could apply to anyone with a handicap  or to a minority  TCITR should teach every reader compassion for others I believe THE CATCHER IN THE RYE will always be in print  much like JANE EYRE  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE  TALE OF TWO CITIES  WAR AND PEACE  et  al  It is that good  and that indicative of an era in time  Bravo  JDS Undoubtedly  Five Stars  again  Salinger  J  D  The Catcher in the Rye  New York  Back Bay Books  2001  Print The Catcher in the RyeThe Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger is an excellent book  written to portray the adolescence of a sixteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield growing up in New York in the 1950 s  Within two weeks after its release  it was listed number one on The New York Times best seller list  and it stayed there for thirty weeks  The book was intended for adults but has become more popular with teens and young adults  Anyone between the ages of thirteen and twenty two should give The Cather in the Rye a chance because it is a classic novel with many controversies that make you think about things you normally wouldn t think about Holden Caulfield is annoyed by almost everyone he meets  except his older brother and little sister  Holden complains almost the entire novel about people being ignorant or less inelegant as he is  Here  Holden is talking to a friend   Have just one more drink   I told him   Please  I m lonesome as h     No kidding   He said he couldn t do it  though  He said he was late now  and then he left  Old Luce  He was strictly a pain in the a      Salinger 193   Holden begs his friend to stay and spend time with him but when he says no and leaves  Holden acts like he never wanted to hang out with him in the first place  Holden tries to blame everything on people he is frustrated with  which is mostly everyone  to make them look like worse people than they actually are  One of the most controversial aspects is Holden s constant drinking and swearing throughout the novel  At sixteen years old  Holden is still five years away from the legal drinking age  but still manages to smooth talk his way to obtaining alcohol at restaurants  Okay  okay   I said  I figured the h    with it   Bring me a coke   He started to go away  but I called him back   Can tcha sticks a little rum in it or something   I asked him  I asked him very nicely and all   I can t sit in a corny place like this cold sober  Can tcha stick a little rum in it or something    91  That is Holden as he is ordering a drink in the lounge at his hotel in New York  Most parents and school boards do not want to expose their children to the constant drinking and swearing in the novel  but the intended demographic justifies the drinking and swearing  Teens and young adults who read this novel are right around the same age as Holden Caulfield  who is also experiencing adolescence  and are going to start swearing and experimenting with alcohol anyway  J D  Salinger wrote this book to describe what it is like for a teenage boy having a problem making the transformation from adolescence to adulthood  Salinger does an exceptional job creating opportunities for Holden that occur in everyday life for a teenager  He hits underage drinking  smoking  and even a few little things like trying to pickup girls at restaurants and bars    Where you girls from  Don t answer if you don t feel like it  I don t want you to strain yourself    94  is an example of Holden as he tries to pick up girls in the lavender room at the hotel where he is staying  He becomes frustrated by the little intelligence that these women posses  J D  Salinger accomplished his goal to write a novel about a teenager experiencing problems with school  parents  and society by telling the story of a sixteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield as he experiences his adolescence  Anyone from the age of thirteen to anyone in their mid twenties should read this book  It is one of the best books of all time and will definitely be around forever  The Catcher In the Rye  by J D  Salinger  is a book that catches readers from going over the edge of happiness and sanity  A book which re routes readers from the cliff  and sends them to run right back through the rye of which they came from

Vi  trung  hop qua  Tu dau den cuoi  Co can thiet phai nhu vay khong     Scrivero un milione di righe di recensione  Se vi va di leggerle  leggetele  Se no  affari vostri  Il giovane Holden e la storia di un giovane di nome Holden  e questo lo capivate anche da voi  Di questo giovane Holden non ci interessa un fico secco di come fosse prima di conoscerlo noi  e del resto lui ce lo dice chiaro e tondo   Se davvero avete voglia di sentire questa storia  magari vorrete sapere prima di tutto dove sono nato e com e stata la mia infanzia schifa e che cosa facevano i miei genitori e compagnia bella prima che arrivassi io  e tutte quelle baggianate alla David Copperfield  ma a me non mi va proprio di parlarne   Cacciato per l ennesima volta da scuola  Holden fa la valigie e prende un treno per New York  dove vaga per tre giorni di nascosto dai suoi genitori  In questo suo vagabondaggio fisico e mentale lo vediamo interagire con diversi personaggi  reali e immaginari  persone vere e persone dei suoi ricordi  Ma lo seguiamo soprattutto nella sua discesa dentro se stesso  sul fondo della coscienza laddove se ne sta solo ed abbattuto  Holden e un tizio di cui non si puo dire che bene  perche mette dentro una tenerezza da lasciare senza fiato  Holden e un tizio con delle idee precise sulla gente  che vogliamo riassumere cosi  La gente pensa sempre che le cose siano del tutto vere  Io me ne infischio  pero certe volte mi secco quando la gente mi dice di comportarmi da ragazzo della mia eta  Certe volte mi comporto come se fossi molto piu vecchio di quanto sono   sul serio   ma la gente non c e caso che se ne accorga  La gente non si accorge mai di niente   Ecco una cosa che mi fa perdere le staffe  Quando la gente dice le cose due volte  dopo che uno gli ha dato ragione la prima volta   La gente non ti crede mai    Non faccio che dire  piacere d averla conosciuta  a gente che non ho affatto piacere d aver conosciuta  Ma se volete sopravvivere  bisogna che diciate queste cose    La gente e fatta apposta per rovinarti tutto   Holden e un tizio che odia tante cose  e soprattutto le cose fasulle  tra cui   la gente che ti grida  buona fortuna     gli attori   i film   la parola  eccezionale    i fiori per i morti   i presuntuosi  gli spacconi  quelli che danno sfoggio di essere bravi   quelli che  stantuffano  le ragazze in macchina senza interessarsi di come giocano a dama  Holden e un tizio che ama poche cose   A te non ti piace niente di quello che succede   gli dice la sorellina Phoebe  Ma invece qualche cosa gli piace   ballare   la vecchia Phoebe   i libri che non sono fasulli   Allie  suo fratello   Jane  la ragazza che tiene le dame tutte nell ultima fila   James Castle  il ragazzo che s e buttato da una finestra pur di non ritrattare un insulto  Oltre alle cose che odia e alle cose che ama ci sono le cose che lo deprimono  Ma siccome lo deprime la maggior parte delle cose  forse e meglio non farne una lista  I personaggi migliori di questo libro   oltre al vecchio Holden e alla vecchia adorabile Phoebe  s intende   sono quelli che non vi compaiono  Sono Allie  il fratello minore morto di leucemia  che aveva ricoperto di poesie il suo guantone da baseball  Sono Jane  la ragazza delle dame  la ragazza con cui  non stavi nemmeno a pensare se avevi la mano sudata o no  Sapevi soltanto che eri felice  E lo eri davvero   Sono James Castle  che s e buttato da quella finestra e c erano sangue e denti dappertutto e che Holden conosceva solo perche gli aveva prestato il suo maglione col collo alto  E mi deprime da matti pensare che qualcuno definisce questo libro  non letterario   Cristo  questo libro ha un ritmo bestiale e il ritmo a un libro non glielo conferiscono le belle parole  Un ritmo a un libro glielo conferisce una bella penna  una penna col senso della musica  e la musica si puo fare anche picchiando con le forchette sui bicchieri  Quindi viva tutto questo vocabolario di  schifi    vattelapesca    eccetera eccetera    compagnia bella   senza il quale questo romanzo non avrebbe ragione di esistere  E poi cavolo  se non vi sta simpatico uno come Holden che si deprime per tutto e il vostro vocabolario comprende solo parole come  effluvio    masnada    aulico    tremulo   fate voi  Se non lo leggete  nessuno si offende  Anzi ci fate pure un piacere   This was my very favorite book for the longest time  I have read it so much that I know where different parts of the storie are and can pick up the book and just turn to the page of the part I want to read  In this book you really feel that you are getting to know a real person  I love Holden and feel that he is almost a real person that I once knew and was friends with  In the book  Holden says that he judges a great book by the fact that he would like to be friends with the author  I would love to be friends and sit down and talk to J D  Salinger and his characters  It is a book that has a good pace and you can sit down and read it all in one day if you have the time  It follows the story of Holden spending two or three days alone in New York but it has lots of Holden telling you about things in his past and just whats on his mind and what he thinks about stuff  Ill say it again this is a great great book  If you read it you will not be disapointed   Hava onceki gun kadar soguk degildi  ama gunes hala ortalikta yoktu ve bu sogukta yurumek pek hos degildi  Ama guzel olan bir sey vardi  Herhalde kliseden yeni cikmis olan bir aile hemen onumden yuruyorlardi  baba  anne ve alti yaslarinda kucuk bir cocuk  Biraz yoksul gibiydiler  Babanin basinda  yoksul heriflerin havali gorunmek icin giydikleri o inci grisi sapkalardan vardi  O ve karisi  cocuga hic dikkat etmeden filan  oyle yuruyorlardi  Cocuk muthisti  Kaldirimda yurumuyordu  inmis sokakta yuruyordu  ama kaldirimin hemen dibinden  Dumduz bir cizgide yuruyormus gibi yapiyordu  cogu cocuklar gibi  ve durmadan   Yakalarsa birini biri  cavdarlar arasinda   sarkisini soyluyordu  Guzel bir sesi vardi  Ustelik  sarkiyi felaket iyi soyluyordu  anliyordunuz  Arabalar yanindan vizir vizir geciyor  frenler cayir cayir otuyor ve o kaldirimin dibinden yuruyor   Yakalarsa birini biri  cavdarlar arasinda   sarkisini soyluyordu  Oyle hosuma gitti ki  Artik pek fazla moral bozuklugu hissetmiyordum    I Really liked it  At first I had a hard time understanding but as I kept reading I understood it more and more  And although the ending could have been more thought out  it overall was a good read  I love the insights from this book  It s critique of society  The idea that Holden wants to keep kids from growing up because the world is harsh and adults can be wrong  He wants to keep kids from growing up into adults like Maurice  Holden himself is not always a likeable character and he may make choices that drive you crazy  at least for me   but he will make you feel a profound sense of pathos   one way or another   After being sucked into Holden s stream of consciousness for the last two days and just now making it out the other side  I suppose there are two or three things I d like to mention The goddam ducks  obviously  The cab driver had it all wrong  and all Holden wanted was a straightforward answer  The mallards that fleck the North American landscape are sensitive to changes in the food supply and model their migratory patterns accordingly  not unlike Homo sapiens prior to the advent of agriculture  For most of their history  humans have hunted and gathered where there was food to hunt and gather  schlepping off to new haunts as the seasons and weather dictated  It s not that ducks don t have the ability to withstand the wintry conditions  Indeed  their thick feather coats serve as nature s perfect insulators  Rather  they follow the food  During the northeast winter  insects  fish and aquatic plants like duckweed become scarce as cold temperatures transform the local ecology Annual changes in duck concentrations can also provide clues as to the cold conditions from which they flew  A harsher winter will bring more birds south to the Mississippi River Valley  for example  to feed on plants and grass not covered by snow and in open waters not glazed over with ice  Due to the weakening of the polar jet stream brought about by changes in the global climate  we ve been seeing more ducks nestled along the southern locales of North America the last two years That was all probably more than you wanted to know  but if someone had explained this to Holden in grade school it would have been one less thing bouncing around his busily eccentric mind Troubled YouthWhich brings us to Holden Caulfield himself and the man who created him  What strikes me about this novel is the nagging question of whether we are glimpsing inside the mind of Salinger or whether Holden is a cold cloth fabrication  I suppose anything a person writes is a glimpse into their mind in a way  but we are always left to wonder how closely a book s characters resemble their creator  Is Holden s brooding disaffectedness a reflection of a lifelong angst and alienation suffered by Salinger Salinger was of course the quintessential enigmatic recluse  but that hasn t stopped commentators from speculating  We know he was born and raised in New York City  that he performed poorly in school  so much so that his father sent him to military academy in Pennsylvania as a last resort  and that he later joined the Army during World War II  Like so many others  the war seems to have had a profound and lasting influence on Salinger  who was hospitalized for nearly a year in Nuremberg  The unauthorized biographer Ian Hamilton suggests Salinger suffered a nervous breakdown in July 1945  which may explain Salinger s letter to friend Ernest Hemingway in which he mentioned almost being discharged from the Army on psychiatric grounds Regardless of how autobiographical Holden Caulfield may or may not be  the character is among those rarefied few that have compelled readers for generations  Even those who don t necessarily connect with Holden tend to find the narrative irresistible  I don t find much of myself in his chronic repining over things big and small  but I found him deeply absorbing  like a car crash from which you can t look away  I sincerely wanted him to get help and not let his discontentedness get the better of him  Maybe he would have been better off with a healthy dose of SSRIs and professional counseling  or perhaps  given the subversionary role reversal in which he and his sister Phoebe are engaged in the closing section  he just needed to see himself from the outside looking in  The Streisand EffectI dug around a bit trying to find out why I didn t read this book in high school like everyone else  As it turns out  The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most censored books in U S  history  which would certainly explain why it wasn t on the reading list at the private ultraconservative Christian school I attended  Apparently Holden s rebellious nature was  and still is  thought to be too infectious  his vocabulary too potty mouthed and the sexual references too saucy  Atheism also pops up sparingly  with Holden self identifying as an atheist and attributing the label to his brothers as well  Whether this was among the reasons many a school board fought for its proscription I do not know Of course  the Streisand effect all but guarantees that banning a work of art will only catapult its status far higher than it ever could on its own  It may have taken me longer than most to read this literary classic  but it was well worth the wait Note  This review is republished from my official website  The Catcher In The Rye was a surprising book  I picked it up because of all the accolades by writers and the author s disapearance from the public eye and rejection of fame  People seem to either love this book or really hate it  depends who you are I guess  I read this book at the ripe old age of 35 for the first time  Actually the first time I tried to read it I couldn t get into it  But I kept wondering  Why is it called The Catcher in the Rye   I now wish I would have read it sooner  I don t know if people realize that Holden is in a mental institution when he is sharing his little adventure about his slow but inevitable descent into madness or at least a nervous break down  Perhaps that is why it has been associated with certain mentally unstable assassins of celebrities  like the guy that killed John Lennon  Holden s brother dies in the war so I guess it becomes too much for him to handle  The end finally explains or reveals where the story began  a place people go to when they need to deal with mental issues  Reading it through Christian eyes I found his idea of becoming  A Catcher in the Rye  to be a very beautiful way of looking at someone wanting to be a good Christian  as Jesus commanded us to be  I know that Holden the character or Salinger its writer probably didn t see it that way and it probably had something to do with wanting to save people like his brother from death  but to me I saw the love holden had for his brother  As Christians we are to love people as ourselves so knowing where the edge of the cliff is and wanting to stop people who are not aware of how dangerously close they are playing next to it seemed to make sense  I highly recomend this book  although I only read it once  I may have to pull it out and read it again soon   Excerpt    The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move  You could go there a hundred thousand times  and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish  the birds would still be on their way south  the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole  with their pretty antlers and they re pretty  skinny legs  and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket  Nobody s be different  The only thing that would be different would be you  Not that you d be so much older or anything  It wouldn t be that  exactly  You d just be different  that s all  You d have an overcoat this time  Or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and you d have a new partner  Or you d have a substitute taking the class  instead of Miss Aigletinger  Or you d heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom  Or you d just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them  I mean you d be different in some way  I can t explain what I mean  And even if I could  I m not sure I d feel like it    For me  what is so incredible about this book is the way J D  Salinger has such total command of the language for his characters  Each word spoken helps to shape the people who are talking  It s as if nobody else could speak these words  I go back to this book when the world around me seems to be so harsh and cold   which usually is in the middle of March when winter refuses to exit I can t remember characters ever speaking in such a way that they appear to be real  They do exist  Forever  Every time I go to Central Park  I think of his stories with the ducks  Each time I see a fancy hotel  I have been inside because of him  What an incredible gift he gave to the world   leaving such a book behind If being human means I get to read Catcher in the Rye whenever I like  then I ll take everything that comes with it  CH Normally  I wouldn t want to review a classic book    But I really do have to say something about The Catcher in the Rye because it s one of those rare books that really resonates with me  It will always have a special place in my heart  What really won me over was probably that I could relate to Holden much more than I had expected  I ve never felt so connected to a character before  Reading Holden s thoughts  it was as if I were reading my own  It was like meeting the male version of me  You do not know how badly I wanted to reach into the book and just pull him out  I found comfort in this book  Especially with this quote from the book  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior   That was relief right there  It was then that I realized I had misunderstood this quote by William Nicholson   We read to know we re not alone  Although it didn t have much of a plot  I felt that all the scenes in the book were necessary and just perfect  J D Salinger seems to be able to SHOW us how Holden feels  through actions  without actually TELLING us J D Salinger is an amazing author  even with all of this  he still managed to sneak in some symbolism that really blew my mind  With this book  he has truly encouraged me to read more classics and consoled me at the same time Although I really enjoyed this book  it was very much character driven  For this reason  it is probably not for everyone  PBS aired a documentary on Jerome  JD  Salinger a few months ago that made me want to reread Catcher  I m so glad I did as I think I missed a lot of the impact when I was younger  Literary agents always say VOICE is a major differentiator between successful and unsuccessful books and Holden s voice has lost none of its impact with age  He is an arresting narrator  depressed and cynical  yet always moving  active and interesting  Two things surprised me  the level of humor in the novel   I was often smiling  smirking  and just enjoying Holden s observations  The second was the presence of death  There are two deaths in the book  and I kept thinking of how Salinger wrote much of the novel while at war  If I recall the documentary correctly  he served an unnaturally long time under combat conditions  and liberated one of the concentration camps   harrowing life experiences that inform his writing and give it such depth  as even this aimless prep school rebel  wrestles with issues as vital as  life and death   Salinger s work always seems to be searching for big answers  and acknowledges beauty and tenderness amidst the ugliness of 1950s New York  This is a very special novel that deserves its high status in the American canon  As you probably know  this is the story of Holden Caulfield  a teenager who does not really feel part of society  He thinks of people as phoney because they do things that they don t really want to do  often they are just pretending An example is his father  a lawyer  who according to Holden  should be out there defending innocent people  but instead goes off playing golf with his colleagues most of the time Holden is being expelled from boarding school and his parents are expecting him back home at the end of the term  It s a few days before the end of term  and Holden sees no reason to stay at school any longer  He runs off and stays in a hotel for a while This book is about a boy that is at odds with the world and with himself  He does not know what he wants  although he unrealistically considers moving westwards to live in a log cabin   On the other hand  he does not want to do things that he doesn t feel like  such as school   as that would make him  phoney  too Of course  once he s in the hotel and bored  he calls some of his  girl friends to try and meet up with them  At the same time he s telling the reader how much he loathes these people  So in fact  he s as phoney as anyone else for pretending to enjoy meeting up I thought the writing style was really good  It was clearly a teenager talking  He exaggerates when something gets too much for him  The play covered 500 000 years of the life of an old couple  The man was at least a hundred years old  and when he finds something boring  he breaks off the narration I very much enjoyed reading Holden s story  And you would think I had had enough teenage angst recently  There was Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld a few weeks ago and Black Swan Green by David Mitchell just last week  Ok guys you can t find a better book showing us the way teens see the world Accept that Holden Caulfield A drop out who has some free time and money The best thing can happen to a teen Go and do whatever you want to do The book is about that And it is hilarious Trust me The best thing about the book is that when you finish it you ll realize that you loved Holden much more than you expected You ll love his way of thinking the way he sees the world the things happened to him You ll realize that this book is a masterpiece And it is Salinger is an amazing writer and this book prooves it If you consider yourself as a reader you MUST read this book It is one of the best books I ve ever read  This goddam book is awesome    Really love it  I got tired of seeing sentences starting with  Am I only one who doesn t     and would like to help you with a quote from the book  It s funny  All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they ll do practically anything you want them to     Actually after all these people will not get what some writers  Salinger  Kafka  Camus etc   want to say and they will continue to ask the same questions since they want to read  fancy  things not the ideas Anyway  what I like most about this book is the honesty of the main character Holden Caulfield   Yes  He is mocking and criticizing everyone who comes along his way  I guess he has much more self criticism than to others  this is one of them  I m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life  It s awful  If I m on my way to the store to buy a magazine  even  and somebody asks me where I m going  I m liable to say I m going to the opera  It s terrible  As a result  I can say it s one of the best books I ve ever read  This book was a risk for me  I went into Chapters before my vacation and bought this novel for a fairly pathetic reason  I liked the cover  It intrigued me  Unfortunately  I often do judge books by their covers  Seeing as this was a classic  and I just finished 1984 by Orwell  I decided  Why not   and bought it  and boy am I glad I did  This book was absolutely grand  Farthest thing from phony I ever read in my whole goddamn life  It took a while to get with the lingo and all  but once I did  boy  I wished we still spoke that way today  I do  This book kept me reading at the beginning just because of intrigue  The language  the storytelling  and the mystery were enough to get me to tentatively continue my journey of reading this novel for the first time  I ll admit  I didn t like it at first  I thought there were far too many  and alls  and  goddamns   The story was going nowhere  I didn t see a real plot line or connect to the character  Holden  very much at all  As I continued  I saw some of myself in Holden  I began to understand him a little more  I learned how dearly he loves his sister  how he s worried about his mother  and how he desperately tries to hold on to his youth  That portion about the cases in the museum always being the same really got to me  I ve had those exact thoughts myself  J D  Salinger captured the depressing nature of getting older and growing up  I m fifteen  so I could really relate to those parts of the novel  Holden often rants about hating people  and then liking them  and then hating them even more  which got tiresome for me  However  it was explained later to his old English teacher quite eloquently  Holden has bursts of  dislike   He likes people  then he doesn t  I think that expresses a crucial flaw in a lot of us  When we get to forming a connection with someone  we often focus on their negative qualities to distance and protect ourselves  That s what Holden did  but when he distanced himself  he got to missing those people he thought he hated  It s difficult to decide who you like and dislike at this age because everyone is changing  some for the better and some for the worse  The recurring theme of the ducks leaving  killed me   It was hilarious that a guy who can be so intelligent  rebellious  and brave  still had such an innocence to him  I think that portrayed his transition to adulthood  Even when you re getting older  you can still ask questions like  where do the ducks go    You can always  stay gold   I definitely recommend this book to anyone up for something different  It s opened my eyes to the similar nature of teenagers now and then  It s shown me how innocence should be cherished and given me a reality check about the importance of pursuing something for good reasons  instead of money or fame   When the power of love overcomes the love of power  the world will know peace    Jimi Hendrix   Probably my third favourite book  The Catcher in the Rye was Salinger s most famous work and was eventually the cause of what one could say was his demise  He garnered so much attention from this book that he became a deeply reclusive person and was barely seen until his death in 2010 Salinger will be remembered forever because of this seminal text which has been studied and has lived on school reading lists  library shelves and bookstore shelves since its original publication in 1951 The book follows Holden Caulfield who is somewhat of a juvenile delinquent who is continuously kicked out of expensive prep school and who seems to already have intimacy issues despite being so young  It is easy for teenagers to identify with Holden because of his pessimistic view on the world  I shared his views when I read this book and essentially still do  This book is not your typical feel good story  it has sex  drugs  alcohol  music and profanity  everything parents in 1951 were trying to keep their kids away from  I loved this book so much because of Holden  he acts the way every teenager is feeling on the inside  and I truly believe this book has the power to inspire teenagers into the distant future despite being steeped in 1950s era confining activities  language and society   I am in love with this book  I ve been putting off reading it for years because all I ever heard about it is how much everyone hates it and how horrible Holden Caulfield is as a character  Wrong and wrong  This book is slow and sad and a little bitter  but perfect too  I can t say I empathize with Holden  but I certainly feel for him  I want to defend him  to convince everyone that he is just misunderstood  He seems to be aware that he is a self obsessed cynic  and he wishes he wasn t  He is world weary and utterly alone at 16 and it breaks my heart  He puts on a facade of apathy  boredom  even disgust  but there are moments when you really see him  When he buys the record for his sister  When he helps the little girl with her skates  His indulgent friendships with boys who don t fit in at school  And who cares that there isn t much of a plot  I don t really need one anyway  The more I read  the more I realize that good books don t focus on plot  Instead they develop rich characters  amusing dialogue  genuine interactions  For example  The Road  Remains of the Day  Never Let Me Go  or Mrs  Dalloway  You can t even do a proper plot summary of these books  but they are all brilliant  moving novels  And so is Catcher in the Rye  It s kind of weird to say  but I found this book to be much more relatable than the contemporary stuff I ve been reading lately  I didn t fully agree with everything Holden said  but for the most part I found them to be quite true  and absolutely funny  I was just a bit bothered by the writing because it felt a little too repetitive at times  but I liked that it was consistent all throughout and it was sort of catchy  like an LSS but for a book or something I kind of wished I read this sooner  like when I was in high school  It would have made a much bigger impact on me  Yet at the same time  and for the same reason  I m kind of glad that I didn t read this when I was younger  In the first few chapters I could not stop hating Holden for his irritating always complaining calling everybody around a  phony  and a  moron   attitude  Well then somehow  I realized that this book got me hooked up until the end  This book talks about a teenage boy who is afraid of growing up  insecure and is still in search of who he is and what he wants  He experiences a conflict between the childhood and the adulthood world  This book reminds me that having a feeling about being alienated and isolated in your teenage years is just a phase that would soon just past  And hey  it s normal  As much as I hated Holden at first  I just could not help being sorry for this guy  and at some point I realized that I ve been this guy  This book touched me deeply  I found the relationship between Holden and his sister  Phoebe very touching  Sometimes a younger person or another person may know you better than you think you know yourself  In the end  he realized that his thought about wanting to live better off isolated is a mistake  He cannot live alone as well as others around him cannot live without him  Another character in this book who I found important is his teacher who Holden came to seek comfort in the end  I forgot that teacher s name   This teacher tells him to focus back to his studies so that he could actually find what he is interested in the most  School is not about getting straight A s  it is a world where you could discover who you really are and what you really want to do in your life  Genius  Holden shows that he is interested in English  the only subject he didn t fail  even though he didn t realize it yet  Holden is not as bad as he thinks he is  he is just a guy trying to figure out his place in his world  Aren t we all    This was my first time reading this book  I really liked it  I liked the style and how Holden kept repeating his overall instantaneous state in life  whether is was depression  love  hate  sexiness or boredom  Stick with me  I want to copy this page down  It think it is the crux of the novel and I found a lot of understanding and solace in Salinger s advice  Chapter 24  An old  flit  professor of Holden s is telling him what s up   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever been confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something for you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry  I m not trying to tell you that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world  It s not so  But I do say that educated and scholarly men  if they re brilliant and creative to begin with  which  unfortunately is rarely the case  tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind then men do who are merely brilliant or creative  They tend to express themselves more clearly  and they usually have passion for following their thoughts through to the end  And  most important  nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker  Do you follow me at all    Something else academic education will do you for  If you go along with it any considerable distance  it ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have  What it ll fit and  maybe  what it won t  After a while  you ll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing  For one thing  it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that don t suit you  aren t becoming to you  You ll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly  Basically what the professor is telling Holden is that is notextraordinary because he does question human nature and how society works but he could be if he uses his ideas and thoughts to better and change the world that he becomes so  depressed  about  He is super emotional and his emotions shift like the wind  The professor is also telling him not to give up  He is telling him to be the anti Into the Wild  stay where you are  get an education  and shape the world through your creative and expressive works  I can dig it  Hrs Hql lshwfn  hwldn  mrhq mtmrd  lq mbyn mrHl  lTfwl  wbrth w bwb lw y wlnDj l Tfy mrHl  lltwzn wtjrb  fqdn l

made an imprint on me  As an adult  I still find Holden s observations about the world  that it is filled with fakers  to be oddly reassuring  Letto  riletto e bistrattato  ogni riga  ogni spazio bianco e persino la costola di questo libro sono ormai ricoperti da anni di commenti e annotazioni  Un capolavoro  unico nel suo genere  Bez dumi  Yes  a masterpiece  Also  a pernicious influence on every novelist after him  I could argue that  after  Catcher   just about every writer s first novel was a reaction to or imitation of this book  Consider Sylvia Plath s The Bell Jar  a female Holden Caulfield  Roth  Doctorow  they all did their own version of  Catcher   Salinger nailed it here  There s nothing worthwhile to be added   Catcher in The Rye is a great novel by J D Salinger  It is the story of certain series events that occured in 17 year old Holden Caulfield s life  The book explores the themes of A  phony world  that exists or existed withen the world of adults in the 1950 s  It is a novel highlighting the not well known teen anxiety of the certain teenagers such as Holden Caulfield in the 1950 s  Another theme the novel explore is alienation as a form of self protection  Holden Caulfied makes various excuses for not following the other teens and rules of his school and society  He excludes himself from society in order to not follow what depresses him the most which are the actions of people in general  This is one of my favorite novels by my favorite artist because it is somthing that I can really relate too  It is very  real  in the sense that Salinger knows what hes writing about when writing in the perspective of a teen and it is a novel that has inspired my thoughts of the world depsite the vast difference of 1950 s New York to 21 st century Norcal  I highly reccommend this novel to anyone who wants to read somthing  out there  and somthing different than most highly awarded pieces of literature that tend to be very wordy and unrelevant to daily life   Sakin kimseye bir sey anlatmayin  Herkesi ozlemeye basliyorsunuz sonra  Anlatici bir cocuksa o kitap okunmaya degerdir  Very descriptive and interesting  It makes you think   I read the book Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  a book in which we get to follow the experiences that Holden has in New York City  Holden is the main character and since the book is read in first person perspective he is also the narrator  This story begins with Holden getting expelled from Pencey Prep which is a boarding school according to the book located in Pennsylvania  At Pencey Prep he talks about the people who surrounded him and the fact that they were all phony people  His number one hate was phony people and stated that he did not mind leaving  He leaves in the middle of the night and goes to a hotel where he hires a prostitute but does not sleep with her  This is one of the many interesting encounters he comes across with including his old friend and teacher like Mr  Antolini  I would say this book has to be my favorite book because one can definitely relate to it  Holden is a character who is just trying to find himself  trying to see where he belongs  That is something that everyone must go through at some point in their lives  they have to figure the best place for themselves  The view that Holden takes on the world is very unique which leaves the reader with the chance to construe the book in their own way  A very important theme that this book lets the readers explore is that of innocence and how important it is  There is not just one reason which is what I definitely think is the best part because the expectation is not limited   Everyone can definitely enjoy this book especially teens and older people  Younger kids can read it but there is more to explore in that book than what is on the surface  Going in depth with it makes the readers more interesting and makes them grasp a concept that will stay with them years after reading it  Holden is living these experiences in New York and if readers actually visit those location that are mentioned then they can feel like they are in his shoes  One thing that I took away with me was a sentence that he states in the end  It talks about how it is best to not remember some people even when one does not like them because eventually we will end up missing them  I recommend this book to everyone out there who has ever felt lost and needs some hope or just anyone who wants to read an amazing book   The Catcher In The Rye is about a kid called Holden who gets kiked out of a boarding school called Pencey  He leaves the school a few days early and has an adventure in New York city  He does this because his parents are not expecting him to be home until wednesday  He meets with a few teachers who tell him that he is in a downfall  In the end he figures out the meaning of his life  I recommend this book because there is some comedy in the story   Firs of all  I m going to start saying that everyone is different  Everyone has their own point of view  I can be writing a whole essay and still not change a persons point of view  Or to think like me and that s  ok   That s how it s suppose to be Books are meant to give lessons of life  give messages  or transport you to different worlds They can be negative or positive  I don t think there s a book I don t like  I think that a book is not meant to be judge at all  The Catcher In The Rye  is a book that teaches teens or grownups not to be like Holden Or to consider what teens are thinking right now  Holden passes through a lot of frustrations and depressions  He though he was alone  he starts asking asking help from the wrong people He was afraid o be judge or not to feel that s support that he needed  Teens need to understand that life is just that  That what the book is trying to portray to the reader  I have heard or read a lot comments about the book  about not reading it  because talks about depression  sex  and has bed language  And yeah it has all those things but how people want teens to learn about life  Some teens can t even communicate with their family or other people This book is not that bad I have read worst  I m interested to see what I ll think of this book in 20 years  At age 17  I absolutely love this book  I ve never laughed so much while reading a story than I did with this one  Holden has some very awful past experiences causing him to despise the phoniness of the world  A lot of people don t understand this and think that he s a punk kid who needs to get a grip  I don t think these people recognize that Holden is a teenage boy going through a crisis that many intellectual teens go through  We want things to matter  We want to do things that matter  We don t know what the hell to do with ourselves and our experiences  We just know that we want to be the one to catch the kids running through the rye because no one caught us  Also  Holden s views and desire to escape the unoriginal mold of society are seen in the views of Chris McCandless from Into the Wild  There s a very interesting connection between them and I wonder if Chris ever read Catcher in the Rye and if he had  how it changed him  At first  I thought this was a comedy  It made me laugh out loud for a long time because Holden is so sarcastic  For awhile I totally identified with Holden because I tend to be sarcastic and a little cynical  Reading on  though  Holden was eventually revealed to be addicted to alcohol and smoking and his negativity becomes much too extreme  Holden doesn t seem to like anything or anybody  Clearly  it s because he s having issues with growing up and he still hasn t gotten over the death of his brother  But I kinda stopped identifying with him about half way through the book In a way  this is a really sad story  And yet something about Holden s sarcasm kept me laughing almost right to the very end  The characters in this book are portrayed very well  I LOVE Holden s sister Phoebe  Considering the time in which the book was written  she s a very entertaining  multi dimensional  strong female character  And her love for Holden is so cute I hope that Holden eventually turns out okay  He could grow up to be a really interesting  great person if he can only get past this rough patch  The ending was a little ambiguous  to say the least  so I don t really know what happens  Being a nerd  I looked up some background on JD Salinger right after I finished the book  He said that this book was based on his own childhood  Tom Hanks apparently identified with the book too  and I read in the newspaper that The Catcher in the Rye is something you really have to read as an adolescent in order to appreciate it  So I said to myself   Oh no  I won t be young forever   and I promptly read the book so that I could get a first impression of it at  the right age   At least that s one thing off the bucket list  Now I just need to travel to every continent  learn two foreign languages  and publish a book  and then I m set   Oh wait   and try some Turkish Delight  I don t know what it is  but C S  Lewis seems rather obsessed with it   I relate a lot to the character Holden Caulfield I understand his loneliness his behavior  the way he thinks and behaves in the book is the same way I behave Holden is a character that everybody that is going through a phase can relate and I recommend everybody that is going through troubles with their lives to read this book because it will make you laugh and you will probably end up having a connection to the character  The Catcher in the Rye is an American classic  It is known to be among the greatest literary works of all time  There are some people who believe that it is not worth all the hype that it has received over the years  I think that this book is brimming with lessons that have pervaded throughout time One of the reasons this novel has stuck around is because of its risky content such as language  violence  sexual content  alcoholism  and suicide mention  The use of profane language and violence was made apparent from the start of the book  People may think that certain instances of language and violence were superfluities  unnecessary to the plot line  However  every swear and act of violence from or directed towards Holden Caulfield showed how Holden felt about the world  Holden could throw a punch at the world  but he would always find that the world could hit harder  i e  Holden punching Stradlater  I think this is why he felt so depressed all the time  he could be as mad at the world as he wanted  but he could never actually beat it  Yes  this violence  profanity  and other controversial content are important to the book s value  but these topics are still unsuitable for children under the age of 13  I would recommend the ideal audience of this book to be 13 and older because of this content A major argument against this book is that it has no plot or purpose  The plot may not seem obvious at first  it appears that Holden is just running around New York City  avoiding his parents and calling up old friends The actual development of the plot doesn t lie in Holden s physical actions but more in his psychological and mental state  Most of the people Holden comes into contact with throughout the book are phonies who only make him lose faith in the world  A repeated line throughout the book is  it was depressing   which was said about nearly everything  In the end  his little sister Phoebe was the one who made him truly happy  At the end of the book  Holden says  I felt so damn happy all of a sudden  the way old Phoebe kept going around and around  I was damn near bawling  I felt so damn happy  if you want to know the truth  I don t know why   Holden goes through his entire journey finding things that only make him feel more depressed  but it only took one thing to make him happy  I like this moral because it shows how everything in the world can seem as though it s fighting against you  but if you find the right person  you can still find a way to be happy This book is one of the best books I ve ever read  The Catcher in the Rye caught my attention from the very first page  I was immediately intrigued by the writing style and the characterization of Holden Caulfield  An angsty and depressed teenage boy with an intolerance for phonies is a relatable character  even 70 years after the book was written  I was constantly thinking about the different memories that Holden would recall and how why they affected him  During the book  I wondered how the story would find a way to end  and I was not disappointed  Everything detail in the book had a purpose  and I can gladly say that I won t ever forget The Catcher in the Rye   Read this review and other reviews by AE at Geeks UnleashedA lot of writers have been born from books like Harry Potter and even Twilight  But  long before those books fell into our hands and hearts  there were many other amazing books that taught us something about what we call the human condition In today s society  I find that like me  many are looking for a place to run away to  to escape into  The hardships of growing up never really stop  When you are fifteen  you think you can t wait till you get older  And inevitably  when you get older you wonder why you ever wanted to have to deal with all these  adult  problems  All the challenges in our lives are like the fire that tempers the metal  only making us stronger with each and every challenge  Books are like magnifying glasses on these challenges So in looking back on books that have made such an impact  I ll introduce you to one of my absolute favorites  The Catcher in the Rye  A lot of people read it in high school or maybe even college  but a greater number have still never read it I recommend this book because of the  coming of age  style of it  You start reading it and you re simply not sure what you ve gotten yourself into  The vernacular is that of a 17 year old Holden Caulfield  This is one of the few books where I would tolerate over using of words  as it is part of the protagonists inner dialogue But  this book gives an in depth look at the struggle that YA face in growing older  It shows the vulnerability of youth who think they are ready to face the  real world   and when they come face to face with it  realize they would rather dial back the years before they knew what they know now  Life is dirty and tough and we are seldom prepared for what is laid before us The title of this book is one I ve used a lot in my own life  The  Catcher in the Rye  is a not so hidden metaphor for how Holden doesn t want kids to grow up  He says he s like the catcher in a rye field  trying to stop the kids from going over a cliff that they cannot see because the rye is too tall and hides the inevitable fall For those who haven t read it  this book really grasps the truth of what growing up really means  In Harry Potter  we see the strength within all of us  when we have no real choice but to either rise to the occasion or lie down in pre dug graves  In Catcher in the Rye  we are shown a different enemy  time  We are brought back to those moments where we think we are ready to move forward  or like Holden who has no choice but to grow up  And as we cannot escape time  we can either rise to meet it  rush ahead of ourselves  or just let life pass us by  mn  jml lrwyt lty qr th fy Hyty  rwy  l tHml hmW  w qDy   w  Hdth mHdd  ttb h  lkn lbTl hwldn hw lrwy   rwy  l tdhkr l thlth   ym

tHb qrth f lan  I first read it half a lifetime ago  When I was about Holden s age  It didn t hit me that first time like it should have  Perhaps that s because it was written by a man in his forties  There s wisdom in here that you only get later in life  And yet it does remind me of what it felt like to be 16 17  to see the world in black and white  to be harsh and tender  aggressive and vulnerable all at once  I still feel that way  and I m in my mid thirties  Maybe that s not such a good thing As far as style  it s so much harder to write like this than it might appear  So many people have tried to mimic Salinger and their failures only make Salinger s achievement more impressive  It might be a perfect book  Then again  there s so much mystique and baggage with this book that it s impossible to know if what I m seeing in it is really there or not  I ll check back in my fifties   Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  I read for the first time my sophomore year in high school  like most other adolescents  It s the classic story of sixteen year old Holden Caulfield who has been kicked out of his prep school and finds himself wandering around  He s very disappointed with the world at the time and in my opinion  I feel like he would not be able to survive in our world today  He s very opinionated and tells it like it is  I think this novel has such a strong impact on the young people in society because it s about a young person in society  Many different people can identify themselves with Holden at sixteen  he s young  he s trying to find his way  and he doesn t really know where his life will take him  For me  this is how I felt at that age  as do many people  Salinger was brilliant when writing Holden Caulfield s character because he made him unique in his own way  but made just about every high school kid who read this book relate to him in some way  After reading this iconic novel  I now understand why it is considered a timeless classic  The main character is Holden Caulfield  he is a troubled teen who spends a period of three days in New York after getting expelled from yet another boarding school  In this time  he finds himself after reliving memories and meeting up with old acquaintances  I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and after having gone through adolescence myself I could relate many feelings Holden felt through the novel   A truly wonderful piece of literature  One of the best novels I have ever read  I found myself  as  I assume  many readers would  identifying strongly with the teenage hero of the story  Holden Caulfield  an intelligent  angst ridden  frustrated  confused  lonely  despondent  cynical young man at odds with the phoney  mediocre  bland and seemingly pointless world in which he exists  After Holden is expelled  because of poor grades  from yet another prep school  Pencey s   which everyone thinks is a good school  but which Holden knows to be just another     hole   he journeys through the streets of New York to meet new  phoney  friends  and enemies  and reconnect with old  sorta  friends in a desperate attempt to find some meaning and purpose to his life  He was a great character and reminded me of myself  I found Salinger s characters to be some of the best and most memorable I have ever read about  Holden s little sister Phoebe  she s so cute and clever she breaks your heart   in a way she s Holden s salvation   Holden s little brother Allie  who died when he was very young and whom Holden speaks to quietly when he s depressed   Holden s older brother D B   the successful older brother who became  in Holden s eyes  a  sell out  when he moved to Hollywood to become a hack writer   Ackly Boy   Holden s ugly  friendless  gloomy  pimple ridden  royal pain in the  you know what  of a next door neighbour at Pencey s   Stradlater  Holden s handsome  callous  self absorbed   indirectly lazy   no good roommate   Sally  Holden s good looking sorta girlfriend who is too wrapped up in her own  phoniness  to say or do anything meaningful   Jane  Holden s first flame   and Luce  Holden s sorta friend from another school   an intelligent guy who claims to know all about sex  although he could  Holden thinks  be a closet flit   but too wrapped up in his own rhetorical bull     to be really interesting   I could talk about this book for hours but suffice it to say it was a very enjoyable read  People complain about the controversy of this book  the language  Salinger just loves to use  goddam  and Holden s always saying that this or that just  kills him    I like that   old school slang   and sexual references  I think it s magic  how s that for old school   though  it s a book that gives you the brutal  confusing  darkly comic truth to the whole being a teenager and trying to figure out the whole point of being alive  I m still trying to figure out the answers  and Holden is sixteen and I m twenty eight  It s so applicable  the story feels like it was written yesterday  Like the stuff too about Mr  Antolini s  one of Holden s ex teachers and a total flit  advice to Holden about finding what he wants to do in life  Any book  no matter how drab or boring  teaches you something  But there are a few books that really mean something to you  that really make you feel  that make you feel connected to the characters  that make you laugh and cry and despair and wonder  that make you feel human  This is one of those books  Mr Salinger  I salute you   I hate to describe it this way  because I feel like too many books are described this way  but I think the catcher in the Rye is a book where you either love it or you hate it  Nothing much happens in the book  So  you either identify with Holden or you don t  For me  Holden Caulfield was in my mind the whole time I read the book  I can relate with him  I related to all of his hate  loneliness and insecurity  in a way    I mean I m not quite Holden Caulfield but I definitely have felt the way he feels at times   And so the book was profoundly interesting to me  almost scary as I could see myself becoming like him  I found the book profoundly moving and honest  With that being said  I can see why same people hate it  I can see how a person could  if they were not absorbed into the book like I was  see the novel from another angle  as a whiny emo rich kid who doesn t do anything for the entire novel  I was told before I read it that I would hate it for this reason  and  while I see the validity of this criticism couldn t help but love it   This is one of those books people rate differently depending how old they are  I ll leave the rating from the first time I had read it and  obviously  loved it  The Catcher in the Rye is a story about a teenage boy  Holden Caulfield  and his encounters with different people after being expelled from his school and running errands in New York  avoiding to return to his family  Yes  Holden is a jerk  He is a teenage boy  dealing with angst  confusion  alienation and identity issues  then becoming an icon for teenage rebellion  He is so unlikable that you end up liking him a little bit  At least that s how I felt reading it  I am well aware that a lot of people dislike this book and even more the hero  or more like the antihero   but I think that s how teenage years feel like  Not for everyone  of course  thank god     but a lot of teenagers feel like Holden at least once in their life  I personally like the story  and despite the unlikable hero  this book is a classic of modern American Literature  It is not for everyone  but if you want to read classics and especially american classics  you should read Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye   I personally enjoyed this book  I remember in Mr  Proctor s senior English class back in high school we had to read this  I d read it a couple years before  but I remember one student   Nikki I think   really didn t like it It was a big back and forth affair and generally did a good job of killing time in class that day  I can t remember if we had to write anything So in other words  shouldn t you have read this in high school by now   Un libro que realmente deja sin palabras Me he sentido grandemente identificado con los acontecimientos que el autor relata en la historia de nuestro protagonista Holden Vivencias propias he podido compartir con la historia y mas de una vez me he quedado sentado en mi cama pensando y tratando de digerir los que sus palabras me transmitian Simplemente tres palabras UN GRAN LIBRO  I am really ashamed to say that this is the first time I ve read this book  It has really blown me away and moved high up in my list of favourites after just the initial read  I really believe that it s one that everyone should read at least once in their lifetime  and again I m really embarrassed that I haven t done so until now Holden Caulfield is a wonderful character  He is troubled in many ways  and he s certainly an unreliable narrator due to the way he narrates his exact thought process  which is disjointed yet wonderful  His use of irony and sarcasm in his descriptions of simple things is hilarious  and very endearing Holden has everything that a teenager  or  in fact  an adult  can identify with  such as seeing everything as being a bit pointless  and seeing others as being fake  or as he d say    phonies    He has no wishes to be a popular  or even sociable  person  and it becomes clear very quickly that he is a teller of what is real  He doesn t sugarcoat a thing  picking up very quickly people s exact selfish reasons for behaving in certain ways  He is so wonderful  and real  that he s become one of my favourite literary characters in the space of a heartbeat The book raises a lot of questions  but doesn t go on to answer them  I think this is reflective to growing up  and moving on  Holden s life is never romanticised  you see what he is seeing and hope he can learn to see some beauty in things before too long  Salinger describes the pain of growing up extremely well  making Holden almost resist the maturity process  He wants everything to constantly stay the same  and to be as simple as possible  He adopts this idea that the adult word consists entirely of  phonies   i e  the superficial  the hypocrites  the pretentious  and the shallow  in order to make himself feel better about resisting entry into it The symbolism in The Catcher in the Rye was also something that I enjoyed immensely  Holden s hunting hat  in particular  was a favourite  I think because the hat was so odd  so outlandish  it became a symbol of Holden s individuality  and showed him trying his best to be different  But he is also incredibly self conscious about the hat  and won t wear it if he thinks he ll see someone he knows  I think this is a gorgeous portrayal of how we feel growing up   wanting to be unique  but still fearing that someone will laugh I love this book so much  I d recommend this to absolutely anyone  it could really change the way you see things  even just a little bit  It really is a beautiful masterpiece  it s made me happy  and it s made me so sad  If you get a chance  please read it  it honestly is wonderful   I tried to read this a couple of years ago  and didn t even get half way  which surprises me  really  because I loved it so much this time around This novel lives up to its reputation  and  though I m not sure how I feel about it  and novels in general  being studied so commonly  I m really glad it has been maintained in such a strong position in 20th Century American literature The first person narrative in The Catcher In The Rye is easily the most consistent of any similar books I have read  Not once does Salinger veer into sentimental or poetic prose  instead he keeps completely true to the character of Holden Caulfield  allowing it to be simple and real and  at times  profoundly funny Though there were brief stages that were a little slow and not terribly interesting  I still loved this novel and its final few pages will remain vibrant in my memory for years to come  I am 15 and reading this book has been a good experience for me  I can totally relate to Holden  I feel like every one is a phony so yeah  I know what I have to order to get to everything I am going through right now  Not entirely but yes  I have a small idea  I m glad I read this book  Spoilers I love the style of endlessly changing thoughts the main character had  even if he was a bit too cynical of everything  It reminds me not to hate on the world too much   Although I will allow it of him due to his struggle to find purpose in life  and his looming nervous breakdown     I am one of those people who was in love with J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye from the first page  Shortly after reading it  however  I noticed that the novel and its protagonist are synonymous with ungrateful teenagers and their angst  Maybe I only liked it because I was in high school  I was mad at the world and every crummy thing in it  In many ways  though  I admire and pity Holden Caulfield to this day Caulfield s thankless attitude is the major bone of contention with most of his haters  to the adult mind  he s a hypocritical brat  After being expelled from Pencey Prep  he never questions the financial blow to his family  or acknowledges the waste of an above average educational opportunity  He berates the rich as  phonies  without conceding that he is among the bourgeoisie  Is he blind to his privilege  or so self aware that it disgusts him Salinger s protagonist is wildly hypocritical  He obliviously displays every flaw he finds with others  In high school  I overlooked this particular aspect of Caulfield s personality  As an adult  however  I learned that all people   including myself   are at least a little hypocritical in certain areas of their lives  None of us wants to scrutinize his or her own shortcomings in the mirror  so we all pile scorn on those who openly exhibit the qualities we privately hate about ourselves  This is why adults vilify Catcher as a whiny novel  and Caulfield as a brat  it is easier to hate him than to admit how much he resembles you Everyone has  or has had  an inner Holden Caulfield  In five years  it will not matter that a careless parker dinged your car door  that your spouse bought the wrong brand of ketchup  or that some jerk stood you up  None of these insignificant things will have any lasting impact on your life unless you let them  but they will all probably make you feel crummy in the moment  You might even let these incidents marinate until they fester into a deep seated   but temporary   resentment for your fellow human beings  Eventually you come to realize that there is no reason to be angry anymore  you learn and you grow  In Catcher  Salinger is simply showing us a young man s learning period  I say stop hating and let him grow  I loved this book  I really did I think I just about laughed the whole way through  Holden Caulfield has to be one of my favourite book characters ever  seriously  He is absolutely hilarious  This is one of those books that you can t really recount the storyline  It s one of those novels where not much really HAPPENS but the story is so fantastic  And its such a little page turner  Loved it  obich  obich  obich goliama greshka da ia preprochitam tochno sega    no o b i ch  pochuvstvakh se niakak pak sebe si  This book is like Marmite  either you love it to pieces or you hate it like poison It all depends on whether or not you identify with the anti hero  For people just looking for a novel to  pass the time   then I wouldn t recommend it  But if you re reading it with the intent to see the world as Holden did  then  it will literally blow your socks off It takes a certain kind of understanding to appreciate the nuggets of wisdom secreted away in this book    it reads like an autobiography  sort of  of Mr J D Salinger  Some people find Holden a  whingey  selfish  boy   but in his sarcastic and cynical way  he brought forth the hard  life  issues that haunted him  the death of his brother  suicide of a former schoolmate who borrowed his sweater  how he find his peers and teachers  phony   and his yearning to look for isolation acceptance where he can just  be himself   Isn t that what most teenagers going through puberty   hormonal imbalances   I had a big giggle at that  Holden amuses me a lot   uncertainty about sexuality and experience or his lack thereof   and confusion about how to deal with people in general  in a way that sounds  true  to him  The metaphorical  catching of children as they fall off the cliff  is beautiful  and he struggles to hold on to the idea that his younger sister will  fall off  one day  unaware that he himself is falling  I would have loved to be able to shake Salinger s hand for this beautiful piece of work  Deserves another reading  Pertama membaca  langsung jatuh cinta dengan gaya dan pemikiran Caulfield Tidak ada yang salah dari pemikirannya dan saya bilang semua yang ia pikirkan wajar  Membenci kepalsuan orang orang munafik  membenci mereka yang mengaku pintar padahal otaknya bisa jadi umpan ular  Tetapi di sisi lain  ia tidak membenci pada mereka yang benar benar mempertahankan prinsip  manusia manusia berhati tulus dan anak anak  Mengenai buku ini menjadi pengaruh Chapman untuk membunuh John Lennon  saya rasa pemahamannya akan cerita ini baru setengah  atau cuma karena tidak sengaja  I d first heard the name Holden Caulfield when I heard the song  Who Wrote Holden Caulfield  by Green Day on the internet radio  I thought to myself then    Holden Caulfield must be a book or song or something   How wrong I was  The story in this book is one which many of us have come across ourselves at some point or the other  It s a typical adolescent issue  and many of us may not want to give up our childish innocence  I remember when I was an adolescent  I used to constantly be at war with my parents  They d tell me to study and I d be a rebel  I d do something else  like play a game on the computer or text my friends or read a book  The narrator had done an excellent job in depicting scenes astute in adolescent life  Smoking  underage drinking  Salinger has done an excellent job in bringing about the life of a character that will remain dear to us years after we ve grown up and look back to our teenage years  There was an excellent review above mine that depicted exactly this  As teenagers  we find this novel to be entirely too accurate to be true  Salinger has done an excellent job in striking a relationship with the character in the novel such that they become true  There are times in this novel that you ll think the book has been written by Holden Caulfield and not Salinger  Certainly  Salinger was a very gifted author  It s a pity he chose not to publish any more books The moment that you pick up the book  you ll get the feeling that you re going to love this  no matter what  I m not such a great fan on classics  but this one sure is going to be favourite of mine  no matter what  The simple and casual language used in this novel helps us settle back more comfortably into our recliners and read with a more casual approach  knowing that thinking would not be required much for this novel At the end of the day though  when all is said and done  and you re out there wondering if you should run away or do something equally stupid  think again  Caulfield chose the right thing in the end  Many of us that perceive the world to be black and white isn t sadly so  It doesn t revolve around you  and you shouldn t let that get to your head  So what if someone ignores you for a time  Certainly they have bigger and better things than worry about your silliness 24 7  Read this a few years later  maybe when you are 50  when you are more mature  You will understand why Caulfield didn t runaway then  Salinger has thrust maturity upon Caulfield s years in the end  That s his way of getting across the message  And maybe it should be yours to read this  You ll need to get a move on and start reading the book if you haven t already  I found this book simply amazing and the sole reason for that is the connection I felt with the main character  I felt as though I could understand exactly how he feels and could actually recall myself feeling the same way sometime in the past  I absolutely loved this book  Duh  It s fucking Catcher in the Rye  After forty or so years  I searched my library for the well thumbed  cheap paperback I had in college    I knew I had saved it somewhere because Salinger tickled my fancy  I had to read it again  to experience that awakening that Holden Caulfield had induced in me when I was a pimply Freshman and finally away from home I was not disappointed  it was there again  that feeling that Holden was a part of the inner me  the juvenile  self confident  self loathing  socially fearful me  After forty years  the book spoke to me as it had those many years ago  But now I had the experience of Ferris Bueller  a successful and happy Holden whose GPA and social interactions are not in jeopardy  the successful Holden The plot  the dialogue  the message    it was all there  The grammar  well  it makes you wonder how an editor could have gritted his teeth  unless they  too  were false  while reading the manuscript  J  D  confuses his case usage to the point where he wouldn t have been given a diploma at my college  but hollow trees can still make an impressive forest Five stars    no less  The book The Catcher in the Rye is about a boy named Holden Caulfield who is recalling the recent events up to incidents that place him in a mental hospital that he s telling the story from  He begins tracing the events back to when he begins to do bad in school  to meeting people from his past and secretly going to see his sister  A reason I liked this book is because the whole time you know where Holden ends up and it helps you see how they affected his life  When you say the effect of something first  then the cause it keeps the reader intrigued because you re constantly going  Ooh so that s how it happened   or  Oh wow that makes sense now  Another reason why I am a fan of this book is because it is told from first person This is really important in this story because you know he goes crazy  but you re in his head and you see how his actions were rationalized by Holden himself  Personally  this is one of my favorite books  Despite what others say  this book is still relevant to today s youth  even with all our fancy gadgets and social media   Holden Caulfield  a teenager  finds that he is expelled from Pencey  a prep school  before the Christmas Holiday  and makes the executive decision to leave campus and spend time in New York City alone  Through his misadventures  Holden finds out more about both the city he grew up in  and about himself  J  D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye intrigued me with its tale of a nearly despondent teenager and his journey through the concrete jungle of New York City One unusual characteristic of this book lies in the writing style  To my dismay  a pessimistic  nearly despondent  and angry tone pervades itself through the entire book  Normally  such a horrible tone makes me want to scream   Burn it   within the first three pages  However  despite the dreadful style  this book kept me glued to the page and not wanting to put the book down Yet another facet of this classic that engrossed me was the wide cast of characters present  Salinger knows how to make people out of characters for sure  By the time I had finished half of the book  I felt as though I knew Holden well enough to predict his next abysmal phrase  Even minor characters such as Stradlater and the nuns are described in so much detail  they seem to have more of a personality than some real humans  Stradlater s hurried actions and snobbish request  as well as Holden s commentaries about him  suggest that his personality can be summed up as snobbish and arrogant  The nuns  kind actions and courteous behavior toward Holden portray them as stereotypical nuns Other examples of the uniqueness of this book lie in the setting  Typically  I can relate to the setting of a book somehow  but this takes place in the Big Apple  New York City  On the contrary  Salinger describes the streets to a degree in which I could find my way through the megalopolis All rambling aside  I thoroughly enjoyed J  D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye  The unique style and word play captured me and held me hostage until the last page  I highly recommend this book  and can guarantee that it will be like nothing you have read before  277 Pages J D  Salinger s  The Catcher in the Rye  is an incredible  one of a kind classic that is definitely worth a read  I m a high school senior and to be honest  I ve never much enjoyed  classic novels   never in the slightest really  I m an avid reader  and am always willing to try out new books but this book is the absolute first classic that I ve ever enjoyed  So for me to finish reading it and realize that a novel that is constantly revered as a classic wound up as probably my favorite book yet  was quite the surprise  Holden is a lot more complex than he seems  he s distraught and mentally ill not just some whiny angsty teen like most people initially think of him  Make no mistake  this isn t some sorry  sob story Holden is immensely relatable  sarcastic  and just downright hilarious  This book may not be everyone s cup of tea  but I sure am glad that I gave it a try   Wow       I mean wow would likely be your first impression the moment you finish reading this novel  Not only astonishment  but The Catcher in The Rye is exactly the kind of novels in which you find yourself still opening the last page  even though you just finished it 10 min ago    looking thoughtfully at it with probably a half open mouth and a hundred ideas dancing madly in your head   Salinger s the Catcher in the Rye is one of the really profound novels although it may seem not  It s mainly about a teenager called Holden Caulfield  the protagonist and the central intelligence of the novel  who has a miserable attitude towards the world  and throughout the novel you see how this sixteen year old boy acts  talks and deals with people accordingly  Nonetheless  he has this wonderfully kind and honest side of him  The thing is that Holden  who happens to be a distinguishably thoughtful boy  develops a terrible reaction as he sees the ugly truth of the world  I think this is exactly why the author chose him to be a teenager  It s precisely the passage between two major phases  childhood  the world of innocence  and adulthood  the world of experience   So what happened is that Holden could figure out the ugliness of the later world but unlike others he couldn t be an active part of it  And I think this is why you always find him love children  especially his little sister whom he adores the most  and wants to be with them all the time   Generally  the novel has the simplest plot ever to the extent that you may think it doesn t have one  However  as you keep reading  you will be able to generate a good idea about what the author is trying to say here  The novel is FULL of hypocrisy images  No wonder the author emphasizes on the word phony all the time  Furthermore  this novel was written in the 20th century where the weakening of religious faith has strongly taken place  and you can see this idea amazingly and brilliantly depicted in the novel  especially in the part where Holden unintentionally blows smoke on the face of a nun  Anyway  it will take me hours and hours to tell all about the wonderful images and symbols woven in this brilliant novel  Oh  Forgot  one of the most superbly amazing symbol in this novel is the title itself  if you could know what it means and see how it relates to the whole novel  you will just uncover clearly the brilliance of J D  Salinger and his spectacular novel Defiantly one of the books I ve enjoyed the most   I read this book during my junior year of high school  Honestly  it felt boring and stupid back then However  I just re read the novel  for my own fun  and I just marvel at it s technical brilliance  Every chapter  every sentence  every word has a specific point  JD Salinger was a true literary genius  and  Catcher  only justifies that statement Of course  not much happens in the story  It can feel boring  understandably  It s a tough pill to swallow But that s where social sites like Goodreads come into play  The great thing about  Catcher  is that it expands beyond the physical pages  People love talking about Holden Caulfield and dissecting his un adventure  It s fun to start a conversation about this particular book Ultimately  I think that is what Salinger wanted to inspire  He desired to spark a social dialogue about teenage depression  It s tough for modern kids to grow up inside such a confused world  Salinger understood that  and  Catcher  only serves as an entryway to a deeper discussion  Re read this novel to teach in my American Literature course I know there is some disagreement on the issue  but I love Holden Caulfield  Some people dislike him for complaining all the time or getting off topic  but it s such a clear perspective into the mind of a character and into the mind of a typical teenager  I personally love Holden because he s the guy who will erase the F word off of a wall so little kids won t see it and get corrupted  He is a champion of innocence and protection  even if he is a bit unstable  The way he talks about Allie  the baseball mitt or the garage windows just goes to show how passionate he can be  And worrying about where the ducks go in winter is a sure sign of him looking out for others  even if it is also a symbol of eternal change and questioning what happens when you re gone I like this book  even if not everyone does  I don t know how J D  Salinger did it  Make this book still relevant and relatable over so many years  I expected really old and heavy words but it felt like I was reading something written just a year ago or so Felt like I gained a new friend after reading this  I wish there were more books written like this  I ve always enjoyed listening to people s stories  but at the same time I wish there was a real Holden who I can talk back to and share my stories with  because I don t know  maybe he s the type who d listen to someone like me  especially knowing how much I d actually keep up listening to him   He started  for me  as a phony but eventually I d say I fell in love with him  don t judge   No one cares much for Holden  He s self absorbed  sure  but he s also used and overlooked throughout  It seems cheesy to say  but the most important things to most people are having a sense of belonging  When Holden says he wants to be a deaf mute  it s at least partly in order to have a sense of place  He s tired of having conversations that alienate him from everything else and he longs for a nostalgized time in which Things Were Different  His fear is a simple fear  expressed through simple conversations  And as he runs into dead ends each time he reaches out  the sense of place rides out of view  It s important to me because of the honesty with which it accepts the meaningless emptiness of most of Holden s interactions AND the dire need behind them  The value is in seeing again and again the extent to which nostalgia can be both a comfort and a crutch   by Karon Luddy  June 20  2004 The Secret to the Catcher in the Rye Holy Moly  After intensive study  I finally figured out the particular magic J  D  Salinger used when he wrote this masterpiece  He created a brilliant and humorous frame around the having a first person present tense narrator address the universal you in both the first and last chapters  and makes the reader his familiar by using the phrase   If you want to know the truth    which of course  we all do   This deceptively simple technique creates intimacy with the reader  Salinger sustains this intimacy in every chapter of the book by allowing Holden  the present tense narrator to interrupt the past tense narrative of Holden  the protagonist  These interruptions are often right in the middle of a past tense paragraph and are so masterfully done  that the reader never realizes it  unless she happens to be studying the book for brilliant author s techniques   In the first paragraph  Holden sets you up by telling you that he is going to tell you exactly what he wants to tell you  which is specifically  this madman stuff  that happened to him last Christmas  Talk about authority  he does it in the first paragraph   If you really want to hear bout it  the first thing YOu ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  In the first place  that stuff bores me  and in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them    Salinger s interruptions are usually charming global statements like the following    What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it     I don t even think the bastard had a handkerchief  if you want to know the truth    Almost every time somebody gives me a present  it ends up making me sad    I m probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw    Sex is something I just don t understand  I swear to God I don t    She s very emotional for a child    referring of course  to Phoebe    That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall half in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are    People are always ruining things for you    Grand  If there s one word I hate  it s grand    Goddam money  It always ends up making you blue as hell    I m crazy  I swear to God I am    he says this many times    I m sort of glad they ve got the atomic bomb invented  If there s ever another war  I m going to sit right the hell on top of it  I ll volunteer for it  I swear to God I will    Rereading Catcher in the Rye this particular time is a watershed event in my writing life  I am no longer intimidated by this great American storyteller because I figured out why Holden is so unforgettable  Salinger allows him to speak directly to every  you  who reads the book  The net effect of Salinger s technique is that it creates both a uniquely poignant voice as well as a profound sense of authority  Me ha encantado  Asi  simplemente  Es tan facil de leer y de alguna manera acaba enganchandote tanto  No me sorprende en absoluto la fama que tiene  ademas  aunque desde el principio te insinue como acaba  a medida que van pasando los capitulos tienes ese miedo o esa tension de que pase algo grave  algo fuerte  que estalle la cosa  I really really loved this book  The amount of things Holden and I agreed upon was just borderline ridiculous  It was an experience to say the least  I don t understand how people don t like this book  really people what s wrong with you   Something s lost  but something s gained on the road to manhood  A very emotional approach to the journey undertaken by a boy who travels across the States to discover himself and the meaning of life  If given a chance to be Holden for a day I m game Teen angst at best I don t understand why it was challenged by so many people   guys have you never been pissed off   This book is my bible  I quote out of it to just get the kick of it  Some people smirk          Boy JD is just awesome Bro Can you forget the lil Phoebe  Balu this is coz of you Such a joyful and

of age  It addresses themes of discontent  realization  protest against the nature of the world  misanthropy  and finding one s way  I think it is something every teenager should read  I felt like I could really relate to Holden and his hate of the phonies  of the not really intelligents  of the ways of the world  Holden Caulfield is really a masterful creation very multifaceted  very complex  and of depth  I enjoyed his quirks and mannerisms and his original  well developed speaking style  Kudus to Salinger There was something almost nostalgic about the book and the way it documented life  It was sentimental  honest  and very reflective  The pacing and style was great  I was drawn into Caulfield s world and way of thinking right from the first page I feel like Holden Caulfield was who I was at 14  and I wish I d have read this then it would ve helped a LOT back then  I feel like Holden is more mature in his awareness of people and the world than most people his age  and he thinks more deeply  which makes it harder for him to get along with other teenagers  Yet  while he is an adult in this sense  he is not an adult in the way in which he hasn t yet developed the capacity to deal with his emotions and thoughts  This is very similar to how I was  This logical but emotion ruled nature that we both had makes it very hard to just  deal with it  with things like school  etc Now I m 17  and while I would still passionately agree with many of Holden s views  I m over the youthful angst and melancholy and have now morphed into a cynical but accepting teenager who s relatively happy  and has accepted school and does well  I would love to meet post crisis Holden  though  He and I would make great friends  Maybe he d be 18 or 19 by then  Boy  would I love to meet Holden  I think we d have some really great conversation  Witty and intellectual  Holden  and we can  horse around  some too  The first time I read this book I was fourteen years old and not up to speed AT ALL  I laughed at the fart jokes and was slightly amused puzzled at the way this guy apparently views religion   Maybe being half Jewish  half Catholic is just too much for anyone   I felt like was tripping through a world I didn t get    so I sat it down for a few years and came back to it  When I came back to the strange world of Holden Caulfield I realized I wasn t imagining it or misunderstanding  This guy s entire world view is off center    and IT S FUN  Like taking drugs without any of the bad side effects    except possibly the urge to commit assassinations       Along the likeness spectrum of The Catcher in the Rye  there are only two marked points  Those who extremely love it and those who hate it soulfully  There s no in between  Now how many of you dreaded and offended by  bad words  as follows  crap  goddam  damn  hell  etc  If you are  then better skip this book  NEVER take a peek at it  Because this book might as well be called THE HANDBOOK OF PROFANITY  I remember ordering a copy from a book vendor  and he cringed saying   Are you sure  I once worked with the publisher who translated this book to Indonesian  Horrendous censorship all over the pages  Just FYI this book is banned in some places   Did that discourage me from reading it  Absolutely no  If anything  I was getting even more curious  When I finally had it  it was amazing  The Catcher in The Rye is simply about an angsty  I hate everything and everyone kind of teenage boy named Holden Caulfield telling his bizarre moments at a certain point of his adolescence  when he felt things were overwhelming  He was approaching transitions in some aspects  and perhaps that got him scared  During that phase he went through a series of moronically stupid decisions   which he told very frankly throughout this book  There s no obvious  systematic plots whatsoever  It s just a chain of random events  And the vulgarity of language may leave you wondering how on earth this could have been published  But that s the charm of this book  It doesn t hold back  Yes  A book that doesn t hold back  How terrific is that  The effect of the peculiar language is even almost therapeutic  Somewhat liberating  This book is flawed in every way  and that s one reason for adoring it  It doesn t try to be something it s not  You ll love it for being perfectly flawed  For the dark humor of it and everything else   Just like Holden  reading The Catcher in the Rye gives you an experience of leaping beyond your comfort zone  It gives you a wide room for interpretation  If you actually look at it  there s innocence behind the egocentrism of Holden Caulfield  There s honesty behind the bluntness  There s hope behind his desperation  And most of all  Holden wasn t afraid of showing his darker side  Maybe I overthought this book  Maybe it s just a story about a horrible teenager and nothing else  Who knows and who cares  This book leaves a unique impression and that totally counts for something  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody    Holden Caulfield  J D  Salinger I believe that either you identify with Holden and absolutely love the book or you hate both  I m obviously the first option  I think each one of us has a little bit of Holden inside  everyone feels depressed once in a while  The thing is that he s desperate to know if stuff will fit back into place  aren t we all  he keeps asking people where the heck the ducks go when the lake freezes  are they coming back  will spring come again  That s what the book was all about for me  He feels the world is bullshit and he s getting lost  he can t stand it anymore  That s almost the entire book  no hope  Until  at the end  the scene with Phoebe at the carousel  he gets all happy and all For me that was the answer  the ducks just fly away for a while  but they do come back I think I liked the book so much because I totally identify with Holden  He feels so alone  nobody listens  no empathy  fake people  I ve felt that so many times and wondered where the damned ducks are  This is my first book review here so don t be too critical Also there are some mild spoilers but its mostly about stuff that s not too important  For school this book is required reading  Before I even started to read it my good friend talked about how much he hated it  He hated the main character who was scatterbrained  cynical  and pointlessly malicious  So for the first couple pages I agreed  the seldomly mentioned main character  Holden  is odd and talks about minor details  but despite this I sympathize for HoldenSPOILER    Holden is a character who is afflicted with a death in the family that has obvious left a mark on him so that he has a lot of anger  Additionally the pressure of growing up leads to a lot of self hate  Holden calls himself crazy many times  Despite his trappings  I sympathize for Holden because he is trying to be a good person  Holden does things like offering Taxi Drivers drinks and showing kids  who are skipping school  how to get to the museum exhibit because he is humble  Almost all of the other characters use other people  like Stradlater  or cheat him out of money  Maurice the elevator pimp  or are just fake  Sally Hayes  NOT SPOILERS  Now many times Holden lie s  he professes to be an expert in it so his non  phoniness  is hypocritical  But I overlook that because Holden lies in response to the world which to him is so horrid and he is amused  He also lies because he feels that people deserve itHolden does not act like a hero and never really wins anything  his victorys are all broken   But this book is important because you see his perspective  The perspective that maybe people who might be different are so because they have to deal with problems of there own  However it does not incriminate  normality   Maybe this book didn t have your usual brave and nice protagonist  but he trys  J D  Salinger s 1951 hit Catcher in the Rye is one of the first books I have truly enjoyed reading  It is full of humor and witty talk all basically within the mind of Holden Caulfield  The constant reference to phonies and conformists  the strange attitude that Holden has towards the world and people  and his weird obsession with ducks all make this book fantastic  I am 16 years old and I obviously haven t read  true  literature  but this is definitely the closest I have had to a perfect book This book is a lot more than just a kid that screws up in his schools and gets  sick   It is full of underlying tones of isolation  depression  and loneliness in general  I truly liked Holden s perspective on the world  He isolates himself by being  different  than everyone else  He wears a red hunting hat to stand out  but is scared to wear it around people he knows  To me  it seems like Holden needs isolation over companionship  Throughout the book Holden refers to people as  phonies   or self deceptive people who won t accept their own weaknesses  I love this because I tend to think this about a lot of people  Holden thinks that he is above most people  and shows it  When he meets with old friends  he makes the meetings terrible due to bad behavior  He thinks he is above them and that they are all just  phonies   It s almost as if his self created loneliness is a security blanket to keep him safe from losing his individuality   To me  this book also shows how painful growing up can truly be  He struggles with school  with making friends  and with fitting in  Growing up obviously isn t easy  I struggled with switching to a new school just a few months ago  It s hard yes  but it builds people  And I think that Holden realizes this  because he seems to enjoy being alone  Yet again  he loves his loneliness   Catcher in the Rye is definitely one of my favorite books  and I recommend it to everyone who likes a more serious book with some humor and lots of underlying tones of sadness and loneliness  To me  the saddest books can be the best books  I don t consider Catcher in the Rye a sad book  but it definitely isn t the happiest story I have read  I think that everyone who reads this book can find their own special meaning in it  and thats one reason why I liked it so much  Go start it today  I adore this book passionately and it is easily one of my most favorite books of all time I related to this book so much that it actually hurt for me to read through it  Because I was too late  Everything had been ruined and nothing could turn back time  My life could never take that little twist to become Holden s story  and that s why I was so sad when everything ends A lot of people say that this book is whiny  pretentious and loosely put together  They see Holden as a spoiled  selfish and condescending brat  an angry teenager no more  But I read this book and I see Holden with all his big dreams and expectation  but life turns out pretty shitty sometimes  and he saw everything collapsed in front of him  And it hurts so bad to feel helpless  to struggle to do the right thing but nothing can be satisfying anymore  It s really difficult to be Holden Caulfield  And people may look at him and see how he should be happy and content with himself and stop making a fuss about everything  But life doesn t work like that and you can never compare happiness or sadness  It just sort of happens I can never tell you clearly and eloquently how or why I love this book so much  I just feel like I get it and for a moment when I was reading it  I felt less lonely  En  El Guardian entre el centeno   Holden es muy sensible a los actos falsos  a las hipocresias que ve en la gente adulta  o incluso gente de su edad que ya se inserta en esa vida   Y detectar las intenciones ocultas  los verdaderos pensamientos que no se condicen con lo expresado  lo deprimen  lo hacen alejarse  escapar  Por eso es que fracasa en las escuelas a donde lo mandan cada ano  Porque no soporta tanta mentira  tanta adulacion a las autoridades  tanta idolatria a lo inutil Holden entonces solo quiere estar con su hermana  una nina de aproximadamente 10 anos  que le parece la cosita mas tierna y sincera de este mundo  y no es porque sean familia  ya que aborrece a su hermano mayor por prostituir su talento haciendo guiones de cine  en vez de hacer lo que realmente ama  como es escribir cuentos y novelas Entonces  Holden comprende  aunque sabiendo que es imposible  que quiere ser como un guardian entre el centeno  quien cuida a los ninos de no caer en el precipicio  tal vez como una metafora de cuidar que no se muera esa sinceridad y espontaneidad que tanta falta le hace al mundo Seguro que si leia esta novela en quinto ano de secundaria  me hubiera sentido mas identificado aun de lo que ahora me siento al recordar pasajes de mi vida Me hace falta una continuacion  en la que Holden encuentra su lugar sin importarle el dinero o la fama   Description of book from Amazon com  ReviewNovel by J D  Salinger  published in 1951  The influential and widely acclaimed story details the two days in the life of 16 year old Holden Caulfield after he has been expelled from prep school  Confused and disillusioned  he searches for truth and rails against the  phoniness  of the adult world  He ends up exhausted and emotionally ill  in a psychiatrist s office  After he recovers from his breakdown  Holden relates his experiences to the reader    My comments  I enjoyed this book  I found myself relating with Holden more than I thought I would  especially remembering my teenage years of never really feeling I belonged  of always feeling everyone else and everything around me was  phony  and   just not enough  I think I d describe this book as a teenage version of  American Beauty   Good book  L ho letto la prima volta a 14 anni e mi ha fatto impazzire  Ho seguito Holden per tutto il libro  immedesimandomici pieno di ammirazione  sentendomi piu grande e libero  e godendo del suo sbraitare contro il mondo E stato il mio libro preferito da allora A vent anni l ho riletto  stavolta in lingua  comprato proprio a New York  che visitavo per la prima  e ultima  volta  e mi ha fatto impazzire  Di nuovo Mi sono ri immedesimato in Holden  stavolta sentendomi piu giovane e sciocco  ma godendo ancora come un matto del suo sbraitare contro il mondo Essere cresciuti ha cambiato radicalmente il mio punto di vista  ma il libro continua a piacermi e a rimanere  tra  i miei favoriti  Essere cresciuti ha anche allargato un po  i miei orizzonti  sulla cima della montagna ora c e spazio per qualche libro in piu  ma non troppi Credo di aver letto questo libro all eta perfetta  e averlo riletto in un momento della mia vita ancor piu perfetto  ma c e qualcosa di magico tra queste pagine che non si spiegarmi  ma che mi strega ogni volta A 26 mi sa che lo rileggo Cosi  di sei in sei  vediamo cosa succede stavolta   i enjoyed franny and zooey and nine stories more but there was something so touching  so heart breaking about holden  especially when he talked about his brother  allie  and his conversations with his sister  phoebe  i wanted holden to break through all the hurt he was holding onto    i was really rooting for him by the end  The catcher in the rye is a novel by J D  Salinger  In this book  the narrator Holden Caulfield is a 16 year old boy who believes that he is much older than he is  Holden is an outcast  he does not fit in any where he even got kicked out of his school  Penney Prep  because he was falling all of his class expect one  During Holden s last days in at Penney prep where hard on him  Holden had written a paper on his brother old baseball mitt for one of his friends while his friend is on the date Holden wrights it for him  When his friend comes back from the date Holden knows he was going out with a girl he know  Holden wants to know how the date whet for him but Holden fights his friend because he dint tell him about the date  Holden lost the fight so he cleans himself up and leaves the school early  When Holden leaves the school he has nowhere to go and no one to talk to  So Holden tries to find friends and a new home  I liked the book because it teaches us to not take anything for granted by telling Holden Caulfield s story  I had to read this in 9th grade  I don t remember what I thought of it  but knowing my nerdy ass  I probably found some poetic symbolism in catching the golden ring and had a crush on Holden Caufield  I just reread it  It took a few hours  I loved it  He s depressed and anti social  but man  is he funny in a flippant kind of way  And he s right   people are phoneys  We all have to play the game or be Holden Caufield   I finished this book a few months ago  but I still remember the impact it had on me  I will never forget it  Holden Caulfield is me  or rather  I am Holden Caulfield  He s the kind of universal voice of a certain kind of youth  and I am of that kind  My mind was as inquisitive and full of fright as his is in the book  and just reading some fictional characters thoughts that sound like mine made me feel like I wasn t the only one in the world who feels and thinks like I do  When I told my professor that I had never read  The Catcher in the Rye   he was shocked but also sullen   There s no hope for you   He told me  When I asked why  he said that I was  too old to read it   I challenged his notion by reading the thing  and after three months or so  I finished the book and told him that I was just on the threshold of appreciating it the way a teenager would  I believe everyone should read this book  but the time at which they read it DOES matter  You ll either read it through the point of view of Holden  understanding everything he speaks of at a very personal level  Or  you ll read the book with an adult like detachment from Holden and will judge and criticize his thoughts the way a parent criticizes a crying child s complaints  Fortunately  I read this book fully understanding Holden s concerns about life and society  I was in a really dark place myself when I read it  and I think that really helped me get into the shoes of my sixteen year old self again  I was twenty two when I read this book  and I m sure if I hadn t been feeling as bad a I was  I would t have enjoyed this tale as much as I did   This classic novel of teen age angst  rites of passage  coming of age      or however one describes Holden Caulfield s struggle  is simply the best novel of its kind  What is astounding about this book  and all the masterful writing of J D  Salinger  is how strongly the reader identifies with his protagonists  When I read this book as an adolescent  at an age when I was just aspiring to question authority  I looked up to Holden Caulfield  wanting to emulate his wit and kookiness  Then  I read it in my mid teens when I didn t so much look up to Holden with naive hero worship any more  but instated strongly identified with his rebellious sarcastic confounded teen persona  Next  I read it in college  and for the first time appreciated the context of Holden s adventures and struggle  putting myself in his place as a sibling  a child  a student  a friend  and an observer of the absurdities and painful realities that was foisting upon him  Fast forward a few decades  and I had the opportunity to teach this novel to my 8th grade language arts students  It was such a joy  Personally  on this reading  I felt very motherly towards the young protagonist  I found it heartbreaking to think of a kid who had lost his brother  who was his idol  and whose parents  in their grief for one son who had just died  sent their younger one off to boarding school before he had any chance to work out his grief in the comfort and familiarity of his family s home  That poignant scene when he sneaks in to his family s house and has a lat night chat with his sister Phoebe  really talking aloud for what may have been the first time about their dead brother  was more poignant than ever  at least to me  as I was reading it with the heart of a parent of three teens  What can you say about J D  Salinger  What can you say about  The Catcher in the Rye   He was brilliant and he somehow touches his readers  minds and hearts and souls in a way unlike any other writer I ve ever read  Is this my all time favorite novel  Yes  It s certainly the one I ve read the most and enjoyed in a different way  but equally satisfying  ever time  The author did a good job of making me hate the mane character  It s one of those books that stays by my bedside because I just pick up and read a random page  I simply adore this book      This is by far my second favorite book  There were parts that were very boring at first and some parts it s hard to get by but once you ve read it  it s worth it  I re read this book at least 3 times and every time it got better and made more sense  i would suggest this book to others who are looking for a good laugh and maybe even a cry  I love holden and all his shinanigans  The catcher in the rye is about this kid named Holden who is very very smart but gets kicked out of almost every school he goes to because he is so incredibly lazy  In this book Holden is getting kicked out of this school and has to leave by a certain date but he decides to leave earlier and be on his own for awhile and this book basically describes his adventures after leaving and heading home  My favorite parts would be when he s talking to his old english teacher who s half naked and being really weird  also when he hires a prostitute and all he wants to do is talk with her  This book is incredibly funny and weird and can occasionally be awkward  but it s very good  I m about to disclose an array of my personal secrets  and it s might seem pretty grumpy and all  I am quite certain I m not a gay  For one thing  I ve never had an erect penis for a guy  which I get for girls all the time  Yet sometimes I get confused  I have this thing for cocky masculine characters  Whenever I encounter them in books movies or in real life most rare arena   I kind of fall in love with them  I fell in love with the cocky anarchist Tayler Darden from  Fight club   I m crazy about Robert Greene  the author of the book  The 48 laws of power   I still go on youtube and watch his interviews and lectures and all  he is like the holy prophet of masculinity  his face almost seems to radiate it  I even like the cocky Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman  I m not queer  In fact  gay guys repulses me to hell  they almost always have effeminate nature  Don t get me wrong  I m not anti rainbow or anything  In fact  I quite campaigned for gay rights and all on social networks while the topic was hot   Girls most certainly do not arouse me in the same way like these characters do  except they arouse me physically  I wish I d rather be a straight gay  rather than being this strange type of gay Now  let s talk about the kid in this book  Some people might say he is a disturbed child 16 years old  and would try to kind of disregard him as immature  mainly the extra wise critics and them all   I tell you what  the kid is wise and honest  unlike the phony critics who mainly want to show off their skill by dissecting and reducing everything   What we do lack most in our world is certainly not wise criticism and all  but honesty  I m not honest  my best friend is not honest  almost nobody is honest in this sore and lousy world  because we need to assume roles in the society  and honesty would really knock us out of the game  This kid is honest as hell  about every goddamn thing  So he is a reflective mirror for us in which we can see how things really are  which we almost forgot because almost nobody tells us how thing really are beneath our shiny phony appearance  He is not wise enough to put on a pseudo veil of wisdom like the  learned  persons  may be it s just because he isn t old enough yet  He possesses the innate wisdom of a child  which we do not usually get in our much adulterated books  movies  songs  comics  dramas and you name it So he stands back and defies everything phony  which is almost everything  It takes guts and honesty  That s why I m in love with him  He is cocky as hell  I probably didn t make much sense  But I know what I exactly wanted to say  Let me rephrase this again  I m in love with this kid  Because his eyes are fresh and he can pierce through the veil of the apparent appearance  About people  God  society and almost everything  He is not yet wise enough to fake everything  old people often do that  That s why he s cool I had an old friend recommending me this book  I thank her for that  if she s reading this  This book helped me to rediscover myself  an older version of myself which got deeply buried under the acquired wisdom from society  Raw and unadulterated   Catcher in the Rye being a clearly character driven novel  I think we can put it this way  you either empathize with the main character or you don t  and depending on this you will love the book or not like it at all  Indeed  the opinions about this novel are highly polarized  If you read it expecting to be haunted by the story  you won t like it  You have to be willing to give it some thought and analysis  otherwise you ll be easily put off by the plain and annoying language and the apparent lack of a plot  So  even if I like the book  I wouldn t recommend it to anyone asking me for a good  entertaining story I read Catcher for the first time when I was around 19  my then boyfriend had read it and liked it  He gave me a copy for my feast day and I read it  It s not that I didn t like the story but I found it rather boring and it left me cold  with the unsatisfying impression that nothing happened in the story and that it was a light reading and that s all I didn t  don t  think it was the best book for a teenager to read and understand  because it requires some perspective  but I didn t quite understand why it had been banned  either  I now remember the South Park kids disappointed at the book  as Holden would say  that killed me   http   www southparkstudios com clips   This year I ve decided to read more classics in English and the first book I came across in my bookshelves was this one  So I decided to give it another try  I didn t quite remember what the story was about  only that the main character had been expelled from school and that he had a kid sister  So I started reading it again expecting to find it boring again and to read it in one or two sittings and move on to the next book  But  somewhere along the reading  something clicked on me and I started caring for the boy  I don t know where it happened exactly  perhaps when he starts wondering about the ducks  fate or when he explains how he likes museums because nothing changes there except for you   I started finding his thoughts insightful and Holden a sensitive boy and not only a whiny one  well  he is whiny too  after all  he s a teenager    His brother Allie died and everyone s moving on   It rained all over the place  All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars  That s what nearly drove me crazy  All the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinner   everybody except Allie     war is over and everyone s moving on and going to the movies  And no one cares where the ducks go in winter  But Holden does  He cares about the ducks  about the nuns collecting money  about the kids in the seesaw  about old Phoebe  That s the kind of grey hair he has  And that s why I find Holden and his story endearing and I know they re going to stay with me this time  This is the most complete  perfectly composed book I have read  Just to mention some of it s brilliance  I would like to point out that the reader and his identification with the character have probably never been so taken into account as did Salinger while writting  Catcher   Boy  I really am sounding phony here  as Holden Caulfield would say and thats just another of the great things of  Catcher   The way it tears down to pieces the pretenciousnes  the insecurities  the fake world of adults that is so over rated  This book is way more than a masterpiece  it is a work of art that accomplishes itself by spitting on art itself  it is a reflection on paper of the unsaid thoughts in our head when we talk to people we don t really care about  It is about growing up  about dissilusion  about pain  And the most incredible thing about it is that no matter what you say about it  you feel that somehow you are never saying ENOUGH  If you haven t read it yet get out of here and grab a copy  because taking the risk of sounding like an intellectual phony I will take the risk of stating that  The Catcher in the Rye  is not A book  It is THE BOOK  and one that might will you forever  Classic   Simple words leading to big emotion  Deep observation of the essence of ideals in an adolescent mind This book I listened and read at the same time  The southern accent of the reader was very helpful for someone who does not speak English as a first language  helped immensely to understand  the underlying flow of emotions behind the words  I thoroughly enjoyed the book  Refreshing and soulful    This story is set in the 1950 s in New York and is narrated by a 17 year old boy named Holden Caulfield  He was recently expelled from the prep school he attended  after failing out of three others At Pencey  he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled  but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday  He visits his elderly history teacher  Spencer  to say goodbye  but when Spencer tries to gripe at him for his poor academic performance  Holden becomes annoyed  Gathering from the text  Holden doesn t care about anything  Why wouldn t he just rebel  The guy depressed me immensely  I was in a good mood when I started reading this book  but as i read  it bored me and depressed me  I didnt like how Holden always had flashbacks  I thought this story was very realistic  expecially in the minds of hateful teenagers who dislike everything  I m not saying that is me  but those types of people would relate well to this story  I will always be proud of myself just as Holden seemed to be  Teenage slang is used throughout  The Catcher in the Rye  and catches the attention of the reader  During high school many of us are trying to find out where and how we fit in  Holden never tried to enjoy life  if he even wanted to  The book does show how harsh society can be  especially to a teenager  This may be why Holden doesnt enjoy his life  J D  Salinger shows many emotions that come into action in teenage life and also the hardships some may face  You can either love or hate this book  i didnt really like it  Too much cussing  The author kind of makes the story very bland  I didnt really like Holden that much  he was kind of dumb  The tone never really changes through the book  Which made it really boring  Holden needs to make up his mind  He says he doesn t like phonies  but he constantly lies himself  So he s a phony himself  Holden tries to keep away from the adult world  he doesnt want to grow up  He thinks the adult world is cruel  He pays to much attention to things  like when he went to see his old teacher  He said things like   Their bumpy old chests are always showing  And their legs  Old guys legs at beaches and places  always look so white and un hairy   Not one person i know pays that much attention to things  Weak  that is how i would describe Holden  he has no personality   Some people might like this book  especially if you like to read  It takes a real reader to get into this book  In the end  anybody who likes to read  would like to read this book i think  Although  if excessive use of cursing offends you  then definatly dont read this book  It is pretty easy to follow  so if you want to read it  go for it  I realise I read this in high school  and on top of that my grasp on English was still uncertain then  But I still remember it very well  which is unusual  and I don t really understand why so many people hate it  The usual complaint I hear from basically everyone who hated it is that Holden is a whiner who doesn t know what he wants  Perhaps I was unduly influenced by my school philosophy teacher who gave the book as an example of a distillation of love in text  but I don t see that at all   The other example he gave was a female character from Crime and Punishment   Holden carries too much of his childish sincerity and hope with him and he can t seem to find a place in the adult world for it  I don t find that annoying  I think it s a simple but exhaustive judgement on the state of the world  And it rings very sincere  so I buy it all the way  That  in my opinion  is the crux of the book s importance   I ve read this book twice  This is just about my favorite book ever  J D  really captures what it is to be young  what it really is  It was written almost half a centaury ago and it is still so applicable to real life  It made me look at the world in a different way and it helped me realize what is real   The Catcher in the Rye by J  D  Salinger is a classic book about a boy in high school  Holden Caulfield  who is trying to discover who he is  This book was very relatable to me  because it wasn t written with huge words that are hard to understand  It is written the way a teenager would talk around their friends  or the words that would pop up in their heads  The book started slower than most books that I read and has less action than most books  It is almost like a memoir of a day in someone s life except for that it spans longer than a day  One thing that Holden kept mentioning was his brother as well as his sister  Phoebe  I have a really strong bond with my sister  so this is one way that I feel makes me really connect with the book  The other major element that makes me really connect with the book is the moment that the title is mentioned  For me  this makes the book come full circle and always makes me feel a certain way that is indescribable  The moment of realizing the importance of the title connects the whole novel  It leads in with Holden sneaking into his home to see his sister  Phoebe  This shows how much he loves and cares for his siblings as well as the compassion that he has  This one section tells everything about Holden      If they re  little kids  running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all   Through this  the reader discovers who Holden really is  and this is what he has been trying to find throughout the whole novel  and is still looking for at the end  I would recommend this book to everyone  I feel that it has very important messages in finding yourself  Even if someone might not like it  they will still get something out of it  I understand how people may not like the fact that it curses quite frequently  but that makes it so much more real  Another problem seen is that the main character smokes and makes fun of people  Reading it doesn t make it ok to do these things  but most people realize that  Also  this is how real life is in most circumstances and reading about it will make you ready for it when the time comes   I couldn t get ahold of what this book was when I started it  it seemed that Holden  digressed   lol  a lot  Then afterwards I was kind of annoyed by this character  I read in several reviews that his hatefulness was what charmed everybody who read it and I thought that I wasn t like them because I was hateful myself  But afterwards I started understanding the whole point Cauffield was making by being this way and the lesson at the end  in ended up falling in love with this book and would totally recommend it to anyone   It s funny that people either love this book or hate it  Count me in the first group  Since grade 11 I ve loved it  Now  every time I read it  I find new things in it  as it should always be with great works   Having finally taught it last year I discovered that Holden still resonates with some students  and I ve discovered that there are many Holdens among my students  More importantly  he resonates with me as well and that s why I give this book a five five  One of my all time favorites     yh chyz mHshr rj  bh yn khtbh ynh khh qlkhm ghy adm rw my

against the structure and strictures of the traditional coming of age novel  with the very first sentence the narrator informs us that he s not going to go into  all that David Copperfield kind of crap    this book instead gives us an unfiltered  uncensored and un  adult  erated flash into the life and brain of teenager Holden Caulfield as he wanders around New York City for a couple of days and nights after being kicked out of yet another prep school  not ready to go home and face his parents  There is no epic adventure or crisis  we are simply pulled in by Holden s hilarious  confessional narration  which from page to page is obnoxious  insightful  vulgar  sensitive  spazzy  intelligent  depressed  distracted and empathetic   Read my full review here  http   froztfreez com 2009 08 the cat    So this book was part of my last minute comparative History English essay assignment  but I did get to choose this book to read  because I have wanted to read it for the longest time  and the only regret I have is that I feel like despite reading it  because I was on such a time crunch  I didn t really give myself a chance to soak it all in  By the way  I m still on a time crunch  the same time crunch  but I need a break damnit  Anyway  I really really enjoyed this book  It made me laugh OUT LOUD several times  The language was so fantastic and relateable  And there was so much GOLD that spewed from Holden s thoughts  Half the time I was like  HOLDEN WTF ARE YOU DOING YOU ARE ACTUALLY INSANE  but I enjoyed every minute of it  I think I would have related much more to this book when I was a teenager  I mean I m still young  but I m 20  I graduated high school  I m halfway through my second year of college and while I may still be afraid of being an adult  I m not afraid in the way I used to be  I don t need to figure out who I am anymore because I ve lived and gotten past that struggle  But 16 year old Phoebe would have related on a personal level to Holden s hatred for the adult world and growing up and to the  phoniness  of everyone around her  Then again as much as I ve always loved reading  16 year old me would ve had a hard time picking up a classic for fun  Despite being and adult and what not  reading this book gave me a sense of nostalgia  That sense of petrifying fear of what s to come  wanting to postpone the inevitable  The fear of becoming what you hated most  Maybe it s more of a angry  self entitled  bitter nostalgia  but nostalgia all the same  I can see why so many teenagers throughout time relate to this book  Hell  I could still feel myself relating  despite not being at that point in my life anymore  Fantastic novel  The more I think about it  the more I want to change this to a 5 star rating  like I said  I really didn t give myself enough time to soak this book in   We ll see how I feel in a couple of days  Like I said  FANTASTIC novel  It killed me  REVIEW UPDATE  It has been a couple of days   Going into junior english I wasn t looking foward to reading a lot of books  I wasn t expecting to actually enjoy them  The way the book was written was different from anything I had ever read before  The many symbols throughout the story made great conversations throughout class and always kept you thinking  Holden s story over the course of a couple days was very interesting and entertaining  It showed the different lifestyles of people of in this time period  This book is not for everyone  Salinger tells the story very differently and this style of writing may not appeal to everyone  He often goes off on tangents that are completly un necessary  but I liked this aspect of his writing  Others may find it boring  Overall it was a great book  The Catcher in the Rye is misunderstood Firstly  the reader is not meant to identify with Holden Caulfield  Intimacy clouds judgement  and it s clear to any relatively mature reader that Caulfield is something of a jerk  His misanthropy is forgivable  many otherwise wonderful people have hated human nature  but his actions towards others betrays his lack of self awareness  Caulfield lambastes others for being  phonies   but he willfully joins the arena of dishonesty    joyfully  even  as when he strings along the middle aged woman on the train  A reader who identifies with a corrupt character is probably not going to have the courage to criticize him  doing so would mean painful self examination Secondly  the reader is not meant to hate Holden Caulfield  Hatred obfuscates reason  and a reasonable person can see that Caulfield  strictly limited to the character portrayed in the time span of the novel  is a product of his context  His brother Allie died not long ago  he is doing miserably in school  he feels inferior to his siblings and perhaps even his parents  He is a confused  wayward  lost individual  trudging through adolescence with a new awareness of the world  This is a character who s had the idealism of childhood shattered  everywhere he recognizes the masks people are wearing  He has begun to realize that life is a game  a stage  a world of superficiality that requires false fronts He hates this reality    and who doesn t  Worse  he seems to know deep down that he is no different from anybody else  He skewers others for their manifest flaws  while privately admitting to the reader that he has the same problems  Sexual perversion  duplicity  and socially antagonistic behaviour are a few sins he identifies in others and also harbours within himself  One can t hate a complex character like Caulfield  and one shouldn t identify with him  given his degradation  All that is required of the reader is to empathize with him    relate without committing  criticize without condemning  He s a character to be understood  He is not an anti social deviant  he s staging a rebellion against change  Consider his fixation on mummification  which represents the preservation of the present  and how he laments that modern science cannot discover the solution  Recall his wistful wondering at the carousel Phoebe rides around and around  He wishes his days of ignorant bliss could ve lasted forever  He wishes he could ve ridden a horse alongside his sister  unaware of the world s lies  and gone in circles for eternity He wishes he could be a kid again  As much as I make fun of this book  I admit I read it in three days when I was 14  having never heard of it before  Why do teenagers love it so  Or used to love it   I don t know  Do they still   I think I heard the answer in a movie  Because Holden Caulfield hates everyone  or thinks he does  And he observes things that seemingly no one else is capable of seeing  The language is basic  The plot  fairly brisk  J D  Salinger need never have wasted his time with any other book  Ya dije unas cuantas reviews atras que me parecia un poco cansino que todas las novelas con protagonista adolescente y traumatizado con la vida se compararan con la obra de Salinger  Pues bien  como la habia leido hace un par de anos y la recordaba con sensaciones buenas  me decidi a releerla para ver si seguia pensando lo mismo y  efectivamente  lo sigo pensando  Me parece buena e interesante  pero muy sobrevalorada Por un lado me lo parece porque la manera en la que esta escrita aunque buena  rapida y facil de leer  a veces ciertas cosas me parecen demasiado repetitivas  No se cuantas veces se repetia  En serio  a lo largo de toda la novela  por poner un ejemplo  y en si la historia en general tampoco me parece gran cosa  Pero bueno  tambien sigo pensando que todo el mundo deberia leerla  sobre todo a ciertas edades A destacar  Que te haga sentir como un adolescente ya la leas con veinte o con treinta anos  I was torn betweeen 4 and 5 stars   I really did like and respect this book   I related to Holden  My Mom loved this book and suggested I read it and we don t usually relate well with books  She liked Holden s critique of the phony in our world  I think the main question Salinger is asking is who should be blamed for all the phony  Society or the individual  Children are genuine and lose that part of themselves as they grow older  Holden couldn t stand to lose that part of himself and looks to his child sister to save him  He can t catch the children falling out of the rye   he couldn t save his younger brother   but then Phoebe in her genuine innocence ends up saving him Pat and I are in a debate about whether Holden himself isn t a phony   I felt the need to defend Holden and I am not sure why  I guess I really liked Holden   and had a lot of sympathy for him  I wanted to know what happens to Holden in Book 2 and there isn t a book 2 as far as I know  Holden mentions the Great Gatsby  so now I want to re read that one  I think that is a classic that I will actually rate with 5 whole stars   but now I can t remember why I didn t give this book 5 stars     The best thing though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move  You could go there a hundred thousand times  and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish  the birds would still be on their way south  the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole  with their pretty antlers and their pretty  skinny legs  and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket  Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you  A story of loneliness and the painful transition from adolescence to adult  Holden Caulfield is simply a brilliant and timeless

Hrfm z nZr khyly bykhwd bshh m Hss Sdqnh m bh khtb bwd  dyslynjr dwstt my drym  dy This book came to me during a too perfect moment  its almost embarrassing to remember it  I happened to borrow this book during the exact moment I was scolded for committing some small error within my household  In my emotional state  I starting reading this book while playing the experimental rock album The Velvet Underground and Nico on my Ipod  That is pretty much the perfect moment to pick up this book  and also to listen to The Velvet Underground and Nico   when your mind is in a constant state of emotional tumult Lets start by commenting on the structure of the book  the first person narrative style  Salinger pretty much excels in this  I believe that when one has experienced enough media  so much so that the joy of watching or reading has dissipated and what one hungers for his greater and better books  one develops a kind of little imp that sits in the back of your mind and shouts out expletives at every little nitpicky point in whatever media you re immersed in  Salinger s prose is made in such a way that you have to subvocalize every single word in your head to experience that flow of thought  something I also mentioned in my review of Franny and Zooey when discussing the dialogue   Of course  with my mind disoriented with anger and twisted psychedelic tunes playing in my ear  it was hard for my inner critic to manifest itself  Your mind becomes accustomed to the swearing and the psychological tics Holden has and integrates it into your own thought   On a side note  I believe one of the great failures of Literature classes is to force students to read books  The two ways the imp is most likely to manifest itself is when reading a book that has been hyped considerably or when one is forced to read a book  Forcing great literature on people is a surefire way to make them ungodly cynical about it  regardless of whether they would have liked it or not  I have seen the criticisms and praises coming from both sides  You can either relate to Holden or you think he s a whiny bitch  I think this book should be read at a certain point in someone s life  no matter how many people say its the worst book in the world  It must not be forced upon that person  he must not be hyped up by friends to read it  he must find it by himself and sit down in isolation  for the amount of time that he leafs through the pages it must be his Bible  Whether or not that person likes it in the end or not  he must have experienced it ONCE  preferably in that time of cynical and misguided adolescence  Hopefully it will be his guide through those angsty teen years  and hopefully he doesn t shoot someone  That s all I can say about The Catcher in the Rye  there is exactly one single point in your life when this book becomes your Bible  If you miss that point it means you ve grown up  either weary of life s fruitless toil or relishing in life s endless comforts  Either way keep it in your house  let your child discover this book when the time is right  it may show him exactly how wonderful Literature can be  Often in our lives  there comes a point when we must ignore a few scratches to see the bigger picture  Catcher in the Rye just happens to be a read that forces us to reach that point The material is dated  of that  I do not deny  However  even its dated references are easy to follow because of Salinger s brilliant writing technique  The problem with a lot of readers today is that stepping back and understanding the material under the date is a difficulty  I have been guilty of this numerous times  Jane Austen is just a woman I ll never understand  Another problem with this particular read is that Holden can come across as very whiny  Oh  life is so hard  Damn those phonies  But  let s be honest with ourselves  folks   who wasn t a whiny little brat when they were Holden s age  Holden wasn t an emo  despite what today s critics of this book might say  He was looking for his place in the world  and  at the same time  he was rebelling from being forced to have a place in the world  He was just a scared kid In conclusion  I must say that  no  this book might not be for everyone  but it is certainly worth being given a chance  Don t worry if you don t get it  just try to enjoy it as much as you can  This is a book that I carried around with me for most of my later High School and early college years  Holden Caufield was an alter ego for me  The ways in which he was confused were the ways in which I was confused  and the way he was misunderstood by his contemporaries was the way in which I was misunderstood I think many  many generations of teen men have felt the same way  I wish Salinger was more of a public person   cause I d really like to know how he developed this character  I also wish he d tell us more about Holden as Holden grows into middle age  Is there a family  Children  What does Holden end up doing with his life There is so much that can be done with this story  A truly astonishing book  A prose so modern  yet so heartfelt  I could understand right away why Holden Caufield has captivated millions of adolescents through the years since this book first appeared  The first person narrator has a unique voice  very distinct  and the techniques the author uses to convey his opinions and judgements have now become common  but I guess they weren t so back in the day   It s hard to review this book  but I want to because I hate seeing people write mean things about it  When I first read it I was in the eighth grade  and so naturally it was easier for me to connect with such a self focused character  I m glad that I read it when I was young  though  this is a book for the young  Not everybody is attracted to Holden once they are old enough to see how flawed his logic can sometimes be  He s hypocritical  judgmental  immature and over sensitive  But he also has a heart of gold  and the soul of a poet  He wants so badly to be sincere  and to feel that other people are sincere with him as well  That isn t how the world works  though  and he just can t reconcile himself with it yet  He s young  He s learning  That s part of what this book is about  Salinger has a magic touch that manages to fuse sadness and confusion with a dark humor that makes a long list of bitching and moaning funny enough to read  Holden has really felt these things  he is really admitting some of his most private pains  but he s a teenage boy  and so he has to confess them in an off hand  flippant way  I think it s genius  I loved this book more than I have ever loved any book  and still love it so much that I almost feel personally insulted when people call it a pile of self absorbed trash  It isn t  It has so much to offer  there are so many layers  If you find you can t connect with this book  you re either too old or too happy to be reading it now  Maybe you can t remember how it felt to be a confused  lonely kid with a bad mouth and good intentions  Or maybe you never were one  Either way  it isn t trash   Moreover  Holden s bourgeois background does not deny him the right to emotional discontent  I hate that argument  Perhaps instead it points to how little those comforts can absolve the pain of perceived intellectual misanthropy  He feels rejected  and he in turn rejects  Forever a classic   This book is amazing in many ways  Amazing this chap  Holden Caulfield  and his definition of not wanting to do anything in particular with his life exept saving some innocent kids maybe while they play in the rye  It is great to think this way  you know  fresh    Living in a world were one has to decide early to become an attorney or a physician leaves little space for sincerity  kindness  soul  I think Holden was a rebel  with a cause  but without actually knowing it  against the coldness of world set in stone  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger offers something for every reader  The number of readers who have been able to identify with Holden and make him their hero is truly staggering  You may relate to Holden Caulfield s angst and alienation  you may be drawn to his rye humor or cynicism  or you could even be offended by his pursuits of relationships and sexuality  This novel sets us inside the mind of a depressed cynical teenager  and allows us to experience the world through his eyes Holden Caulfield is a troubled and unreliable narrator  He fails out of four schools and manifests complete apathy toward his future  One point that is made extremely clear is that Holden is extremely judgmental  He criticizes other peoples philosophies and ideas up to the point where it becomes comical  I feel that Salinger is trying to express teenage insecurity of themselves and the world around them  through satirical mockery of the  phonies  Salinger s world view is especially evident throughout the many social interactions Holden experienced  Ernie the piano player was especially considered  phony   Holden believed this because Ernie was the  Finest Piano Player in the world   but despite his extraordinary talent  his motives for playing were false  Also  Holden feels strongly that sex should happen between people who care deeply about and respect one another  and he is upset by the realization that sex can be casual  This is a move to examine more than just social issues  but moral issues also  Perhaps Salinger s values and background can be seen through this  Parts of this book made me re evaluate myself  The uncomfortable social situations Holden encountered caused me to wonder if I myself were a phony  It has lead to me questioning my motives for everyday things  and to really think about my reasoning s  Salinger s take on a struggling teen can be seen in this Novel  I personally recommend this to anyone who is looking for an impressionable novel  Whether or not you enjoy it  you won t walk away empty handed   Five stars  A near perfect book  I don t have any problems with the book  but I do have a problems with how many people  maybe even most people  insist on judging it an adult novel when it is probably one of the first and best examples of YA fiction  I don t care what Salinger intended  this is a YA novel  It is for young people who are finished with Judy Blume and S E  Hinton and want to go further down the road I also have a problem with how many people who have read this in their youth  and think it was so great that it somehow excuses them from reading fiction in their adulthood  Like fiction is not a subject for real adults to engage in Everyone should read this book when they are saying goodbye to their adolescence  They should think of old Holden with affection  but bid him farewell and get on with it   Even as an English major with a undergrad and grad degrees in English Education  I had never read Catcher in the Rye  Crazy  right  Well  this year was the first year I ve ever taught 11th grade  which in my county is American Lit  So  I started reading this around the same time my students started reading it  I d heard for years about how controversial it was and I m still amazed that this was pubbed in 1954 because it was so fresh that I felt it could totally be happening now  In truth  I was totally surprised by how much I liked this novel  As some one who has written a boy narrated book  I totally dug the fact that this was a male narrated MC  I flatter myself that sometimes I could see correlations between Holden and my MC Noah  Both are coming to grips with the loss of someone they loved   however  Holden is narrating his story from a mental institution after a breakdown while Noah doesn t go through anything quite so extreme  At times  it was painful to watch Holden s downward spiral  Even though it s a flashback and we know where he s at in the opening  it s still painful to see how he got where he is We first get glimpses at how much his brother Allie s  death affected him when he writes Stradlater s composition on Allie s glove  As the novel progresses  Holden begins to even talk to Allie and ask him for guidance  We see the contrast of losing innocence with his trip to NY  He comes out of his sheltered world to stay in seedy hotels where he s offered a prostitute by a pimp in the elevator  However  Holden in his brutal honesty isn t able to seal the deal  and in a scene that reminded me of Pretty Woman  he just wants to talk to Sunny  However  Sunny isn t used to this and she summons her pimp after Holden doesn t pay what he s promised  leading to him being beaten up  The relationship between Holden and Phoebe is very sweet  he s the typical big brother who both loves and is aggravated by his younger sister  He wants the world to be a better place for her and not so full of phonies In the end  the reader can only hope or try to be optismic that Holden will come out of the hospital  settle down  finish school  and try to learn and grow from his experiences   I love how inside his head you get  You start to like him  even though he s twisted  I wish they would ve spent more times with the actually interesting characters  or that there was a sequel  I don t think it is the smartest book ever written or anything but it is definitely intriguing and will make you turn the pages  I think that you either love this book or you hate it and I think it depends on how you see Holden  I know that he seems like an absolute dick  but then so do I sometimes  I just don t say shit out loud like he does  I have also always seen Holden as being mentally ill so what some people see as him being an awful person I just see him as being brutally honest and kind of fucked up  I m not sure if this book was supposed to be funny  but I was reading it in public once and I was trying so hard not to laugh that I ended up crying  I understand the mixed reviews that this book gets  but if you are anything like me then I would definitely recommend it  Then again  I can relate to Holden so there is a good chance that you are nothing like me  Easy reading    and simply amazing Holden s story could be a story of every adolescent  This novel is not to be narrated or to be put on the screen  but is to be read  Maybe this is the main reason why Salinger refused to sell the rights for a  Catcher in the Rye  movie   Holden has one of the most interesting voices i ve ever read  I loved how negative he saw everything  I felt bad for him about his views but he really sold the idea that something was really wrong with him  And for the whole book you try to figure out what the hell happened to Holden to screw him up this much  Personally I think Allie got the ball rolling when he died  Holden s view s on childhood really got hit by Allies death  After that Holden kinda got screwed up more and more  He hated anyone that was growing up and ended up calling them  phony  Which for most of the time story i was trying to figure out what made people  phony  to Holden  So the only people he actually liked were kids  He liked them so much he didn t want them to grow up and feel the pains that he had  So he got this really weird idea that he would catch them before they fell off the cliff  The ending was cool too  i didn t care for the way it made an open ended ending  But i like how the conflict was resolved  Holden stopped trying to be the  catcher  and that was a really great moment for him  I really hope that Holden changed for the good after this book   This was a great re read from school days  I finished it on an airplane  I turned the last page and closed the book  and a passing airline attendant  stopped within seconds of me finishing and said  oh I want to read that book  how was it   Without thinking I said it was very interesting  didn t make much sense  but then again some of it made some sense and I was figuring the rest out still  She replied well  that s life  and said she couldn t wait to read it       HeartbreakingBreath takingAmazingTouchingMy favorite book Unforgettable A masterpiece   It is a great book for people who see themselves in the main character and an OK book for people who want to understand people like the main character  if you think its a horrible book its because your one of those people who cause people like the main character to feel this way if you don t understand the book  don t try to  you wont and probably never will  This is my first classic book that I ve ever read  It really struck me because of its language and the main character s actions  Holden s rebellious actions are very risky but I can tell from the start that he has a very interesting character  And it is a huge risk to take for the author because during these times  bad language and bad actions are taken very seriously  It is also possible that this book become the most famous because it was banned by several schools or even by some ethnic groups because it go against the beliefs  However  the book show the disgusting reality of the world and how a young adult feel about all these  Holden  main character  showed me that it is absolutely okay to follow what you want to do and it is okay to be different  He does not give a damn about anything and he is willing to believe in what he wants to believe in  This is a BEAUTIFULY written book and it is definitely one of my favorites   Simple english and easy to understand   I mean  now i know why this book became a modern classic  I could identify with Holden in almost all of his situation  In my heart  shall this book remain forever               Everything around Holden Caulfield is phony  That s it Aren t we all old Holden  Aren t we all sick of the society around us and the expectations everyone has towards us The firs encounter with the story is when you realize that Holden is talking to you by the first person narration  in a means of escape or breaking the routine down  Telling you about how messy his life is Holden is surrounded by morons and show offs  even his some sort of  friends  are either disgusting  or lacking the intellectuality he seeks in others  Everybody around him are joining the herd of a boring life where you have to finish school  go to college  then get the girl of your dreams and that s it  And this is something Holden wouldn t do Being a young rebel  he rebels even in very small activities  like cussing or using swear words  You wouldn t find one page without old Holden s swear words  He hates the life he s leading  The death of his young brother Allie  apparently breaks his will on life  His little sister Pheobe is his inspiration and he is such a sweatheart when it comes to treating her  Through the events  you know that he s a sweatheart deep within him What I like the most about him that this little devil is TOO DAMN FUNNY I rarely laugh or even smile when I read a book  even it was kind of funny  but this cynical boy is got a real sense of humor  Holden is always depressed  Everything around him makes him depressed  His family has no positive effect on him  although it is implied that they are from a wealthy class  That s why at the end you ll see where he ends up in a crossroads of his own mind  whether to climb up the hole  or to reach the rock bottom of his life The language of the book is just perfect  being uttered from a 16 year old narrator  Salinger knew what he was doing 5 stars for everything  I m not sure how I avoided the fate of being assigned to read this book in high school  but despite being late to the party  I m glad I finally picked it up  I loved the way that Salinger s narrative was so immediately arresting and immersive  It was also fascinating to watch how all the sides of Holden s personality  not just the angst  shone through the exterior bravado  So obvious why this is a classic   I m twenty five and just read this book for the first time  My only regret is not reading it when I was younger   it would ve been helpful  Or perhaps that s just my twenty five year old self trying to sound pedagogical  Looking back  the teenager I was makes me cringe  Like most teenagers  I suppose  I recall being in a similar mind state as Holden   angry and rebellious  But mostly just lost  And that s where I found the parallels between Holden and my teenage self  Holden can be despicable at times  yet with a little empathy  you can see through him  Essentially  he s just alienated and misunderstood  Everyone around him seems to be busy growing up  but he doesn t want to  this inevitability seems to make him even more contemptuous  By the end of the book  some say Holden doesn t maturate  I think he does  He proves it by showing concern for Phoebe and her future  and by deciding not to leave  Sure  it s not reaching adulthood  but it s something Anyway  The Catcher in the Rye is a book you won t stop thinking about when you put it down  In my case  it made me think how I changed since a teenager  It s not that I understand everything now  far from it  Still  being aware of the changes in your thought process is what makes the difference  Knowing that you re not alone and accepting the fact that everyone is constantly changing   growing  up   Some may think that they still haven t fallen off the proverbial cliff  but that just might make them end up in a mental hospital  OK  I m exaggerating and digressing     Chances are  if I happen to stumble upon this review in a couple of years  I won t agree with anything I just wrote  It might even sound ridiculous when I read it tomorrow  Fine  I guess that means I ll be more mature then     I hope some goddamn phony never makes a goddamn movie of this ace book  Chrissake  that d goddamn kill me All kidding aside  I absolutely loved this novel  Possibly one of the most perfectly wrought picaresque novels I ve ever read  it is a landmark for me  I m sorry I didn t read it sooner  The unreliable narrator  the sly wry humor  the modernist self references  the bipolar social criticism appreciation and the purposefully  aimless  structure all left me thinking about this book for a long time after I finished  Genius  Realmente me encanto este libro  Holden  el personaje que narra el libro  es de ese tipo tan escaso de personaje que lo amas o lo odias  te cae bien o te cae mal  A mi me cae bien  su manera de ver el mundo y las cosas quizas sea un poco odiosa o deprimente pero entiendo lo que quiere decir o de lo que se queja  y hay un punto en que se nos olvida la edad de el porque estamos enfrascados en sus pensamientos u opiniones  El final fue como Holden inconcluso e impredecible  Lo recomiendo mucho aunque sino son de humor acido o sarcasticos de una vez les digo que odiaran a Holden  Welcome to the messed up life of Holden  Full of angst and judgmental thoughts  Hands down  one of the best classic novels of history  The way Catcher in the Rye is delivered is not through plot  not through a high climax  but through language  And that s what makes the book so amazing  For a book to make you feel like that when on the surface  nothing is really going on  but just Holden walking around in New York  The subtle nature of Holden s writing and the way he doesn t explicitly state things   Yes  I admit  I didn t glean much deeper things until I watched Crashcourse with John Green   The pure language  the way his thoughts are so unfiltered  The society isn t always empathetic  but there will always be someone to listen to you  And adult world is scary  I agree  Holden  I agree  This is one of those books that you are forced to read for school  but you actually can end up loving  As we all know there are few and far between of those therefore I was really amazed by the fact that I enjoyed it so much  I found myself constantly finding symbols and metaphors  I also found it a really hard hitting and personal novel since there were certain relatable parts to it  I can t say you will enjoy it or find it nearly as meaningful as I did  but I think it is worth the read  It s so anti Holden to say this  but reading this book really did change my life  I finally realized the power of literature when I read The Catcher in the Rye  I just finished reading this book and i was amazed by Holden Caulfield character   this book was amazing even though it contains a lot of swearing which made the book even more realistic   i mean a lot of teenagers spend most of their time getting annoyed and angry   swearing at the tiniest things  including me    so the book is set around the 1950s it is mostly about Holden a young teenager that got the ax at Pencey because he was failing in everything except English and he goes wandering in New York   booking a room at a hotel      afraid of getting home before Christmas vacation   THE CATCHER IN THE RYE will definitely makes you ask a lot of question it was so easy for me to relate to Caulfield   If you are looking for a quick read go and pick this up    This book seems to be highly polarizing   even based on the reviews  there isn t much middle ground for loving or hating it  I can t pinpoint why I love this book so much  but it s one that sticks with me and that I continue to love no matter how much time goes by  I find Holden to be hysterical   his blatant sarcasm keeps me laughing from the beginning as he refers to classmates and anyone who upsets him as being a  prince   I feel that a lot of people   and so many teenagers   can identify with Holden s insecurity and loneliness that so many people will experience right along with him  I connected in with Caufield  and he s on of those characters that I wish was real so that we could go out for a few drinks  or ten   shoot the shit  and just reflect on all the things running around in our minds that we couldn t talk about with anyone else  To me  and to a lot of people I know  there was something so powerful in the ability to relate to the struggles of someone who should have it all together  but is self destructing and doing anything to keep their head above water   Despite a lot of negativity from my classmates  I really really liked this book  Good old Holden Caulfield  I feel like this book will always be a part of my life  and as many others  I can relate to Holden J D  Salinger is a terrific author  and I must say this isn t his best work  the Catcher in the Rye is that one book that either you love or hate  Holden is not a simple character  not at all  but besides that  I think he is hilarious and more intelligent than he is pretending to be in the book  He doesn t want to grow up  and he doesnt want to be a part of the shitty society he lives in  He is hypocritical and he knows it  and thats the point  The point is it s relatable  when we were kids we wanted to grow up  and when we finally grow up  we realize it sucks  it sucks being an adult  it sucks that you have to start labeling everything  that people expect you to be things you don t want to be  Holden is confused  hurt and he gives up  don t read this book if you can get easily irritated and if you like action  I cannot deny that this is one of my favourite books of all time   I read this book for my eleventh grade English ISU and absolutely loved it  I have since read it a total of three times   The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  is the story of a teenage boy named Holden Caulfield trying to find himself by running away and wandering aimlessly through New York City for a period of only a few days   During his travels in New York City he spends much time in states of reflection upon different periods in his life  The reader gets an in depth look into the mind of a confused teenage brain that is struggling to find a purpose  This is part of the reason why the story may seem to be going in no general direction  It is up to the reader to decipher what it is that Holden is trying to convey in his actions  thoughts  words  and so on  The book demonstrates the great search for identity from the mind of someone who is losing their innocence to experience  The experience is not a graceful one  From the mistakes he makes in school and relationships  it is enough to make you want to pull out your hair  It seems like the answers could be so simple to get yet they are the biggest challenges in the book  What I got out of the book  personally the book made me feel sane  Strangely I could relate to Holden and his endeavors  Although my experiences have been far less shocking as his was  I felt less alone while reading it  It made me feel like I was not the only one who was going through an inner battle against myself and surrounding forces  The book showed me the true trials and errors of youth transitioning into adulthood and how they can effect your mental and physical health  From this perspective it is easy to see how somebody like Holden can get lost so quickly  I would recommend this book to people ages 15 and up  If you have read the book I recommend you to read it a second time with a different perspective  Truly a fantastic journey to be read   When I read it I absolutely loved it and I still loving it  but if you don t relate to Holden  have teen angst or something you are probably going to hate it and found it boring  Membaca PenggerutuMungkin di halaman awal kita bakal digerus perasaan tak sabar mengapa novel klasik The Catcher in The Rye besutan J D Salinger sejatinya hanya mengutarakan gerutuan tokoh utama  Holden Caufield  remaja enambelas tahunan yang gelisah dan resah menjalani hidup  Tapi  itulah Salinger  Tiada yang menyangka novel yang semula diterbitkan tahun 1951 ini malah menjadi  virus  aneh lantaran kejahatan yang disebabkan oleh the lone killer atawa pembunuh kesepian konon dipengaruhi karya J D  Salinger ini Di sini memang tak ada metode pembunuhan sehingga sia sia saja kita mencari bagian mana yang mungkin menginsipirasi Mark David Chapman  penembak John Lennon yang sebelum menembak idolanya meminta tanda tangan Lennon di atas buku novel ini  Pertanyaan mengusik  apakah pribadi gelisah yang ditokohkan Caulfield ini seolah mewakili jiwa pemberontak yang tersendat  jiwa yang mungkin menggayuti Chapman dan Hinckley  penembak Presiden AS Ronald Reagan hanya untuk mendapatkan perhatian aktris Hollywood  Jodie Foster  Impresi demikian bisa benar adanya lantaran karakter Caulfield selain pemberontak sejatinya juga seorang pengecut karena ia tak berani dan sulit mengutarakan perasaan sebenarnya dengan orang orang di sekitarnya  Ia marah kepada segala hal sehingga tatkala berdialog dengan gurunya  Pak Tua Spencer di sekolah Pencey ia selalu berbohong  Hatinya tak pernah klop dengan mulutnya sehingga ia hanya mengatakan sesuatu yang disenangi gurunya Terlepas dari peristiwa besar yang terjadi di luar novel ini  kelincahan bercerita dan detailitas Salinger memang tiada duanya  Jangankan pribadi yang heroik  sungguh tak ada tokoh besar dan kecil  tokoh yang berhak dibela di sini   Tragedi  di sini malah terbentuk dari peristiwa peristiwa kecil sehingga menyiratkan bahwa Salinger sendiri memang segan mengolah novelnya menjadi narasi besar yang kaya dengan pergulatan konflik yang berkembang menjadi makin rumit atau panas  Memang  pergulatan jiwa demikian carut marut yang dialami Caulfield adalah sebagian kecil pula yang mengilhami remaja Amerika macam Chapman  Tapi  di sini Salinger toh bukan berarti hendak  membela  karakter utama hingga pembaca memakluminya seperti misalnya kita membaca cerita yang berpihak pada kaum marjinal  orang orang yang dikalahkan karena peristiwa politik atau sosial  Ia hanya bercerita uner unegnya kepada kita  itu saja  Caulfield sendiri toh bukan remaja miskin  Keluarganya terbilang cukup sehingga tak heran ia sering pindah pindah sekolah  Pandai tidak  bodoh juga tidak sedangkan selera bacaan Caulfield cukup baik  Pada halaman 30 Caulfield mengaku menyukai novel Out of Africa karya Isak Dinesen yang tak sengaja terbawa olehnya dari perpustakaan sekolah  Selain itu  walau menyukai Dinesen di novel ia juga menganggap baik karya sastra Somerset Maugham  Of Human Bondage  Bahkan ia punya metode sendiri untuk menamai bacaan yang baik  Menurutnya  bacaan baik itu adalah  kita lantas berandai andai bahwa si penulis cerita itu adalah teman baik kita sehingga kita bisa saja langsung telepon kapan pun kita mau    h 31   Mungkin metode ini agak subversif  terutama bagi tipe pembaca yang umumnya baru membaca setelah menyimak pujian kritikus di media massa  Justru  keunikan inilah yang termaktub sehingga sebuah keseharian dapat menjadi luar biasa di tangan novelis kelahiran New York tahun 1919 ini  Di ranah komik  tokoh Caulfield mengingatkan kita pada Harvey Pekar  penulis yang juga  penggerutu kelas berat   penghasil komik otobiografis yang belum ini difilmkan  American Splendor  Komik yang gambarnya diolah komikus beken R Crumb ini juga hanya mengisahkah keseharian Pekar  pegawai brankas di rumah sakit untuk veteran yang sumpek dengan hidupnya yang selain gagal juga monoton  Pesona inilah yang mungkin jarang terjadi  begitu pula dalam novel Catcher  Walau ceritanya beda  tag line film American Splendor yaitu  ordinary life is pretty complex stuff  seperti berlaku pula dalam novel setebal 300 halaman ini  Kelancaran bercerita Salinger yang mampu diterjemahkan dengan baik oleh penerjemahnya juga berhasil ditafsirkan demikian lugas sehingga novel ini tak harus mencuat dengan metafora atau permainan konflik yang berputar  satu hal yang umumnya terjadi pada karya  yang maunya dianggap  sastra atau novel  Kelancaran naratif novel ini bahkan bisa dinikmati selancar membaca cerita remaja ala Enid Blyton sekalipun  Nampak kejujuran sebugil adanya yang menguatkan novel Salinger ini setelah sebelumnya dicaci kemudian diakui di kalangan sastra  selain diterima juga oleh pembaca umum tanpa bermaksud menjadi wacana besar  Gerutuan Salinger setebal 300 halaman ini justru bukan berakhir pada kesimpulan yang ia hadapi atau menjadi semacam tafsir  Caulfield hanya marah menghadapi dunia yang menurutnya munafik sehingga menyulitkan orang bahkan untuk menjadi diri sendiri  Percikan kehidupannya begitu dekat bak kita mendengarkan  curhat  seorang kawan  Singkatnya  walau tak berpretensi menjadi wacana besar  novel ini berhasil membawa gejolak emosi sesungguhnya begitu hidup sehingga pembaca yang bukan orang Amerika sekalipun mampu merasainya Biarpun nadanya marah  unsur komedi cukup kuat  seolah Salinger paham sebaiknya pemaparan di tulisan harus bisa dimengerti dengan baik oleh pembaca  Misalnya penggambaran setting rumah guru Caulfield yang disebutnya sebagai  Pak Tua Spencer   Ia menggambarkan begitu detil seperti ruangannya berbau aroma obat gosok Vicks yang tajam  atau rasa jijiknya melihat Pak Spencer kalau bicara sedang mengupil   Tak heran  kelincahan naratif novel ini diidolakan banyak pengarang ternama diantaranya sastrawan Umar Kayam sampai pengarang Haruki Murakami yang memasukkan kesukaannya pada Cathcer melalui diskusi tokoh tokohnya dalam novel Norwegian Wood yang belum lama ini diterjemahkan di Indonesia Walau novel ini konon tak sampai membuahkan berbagai penghargaan prestisius macam Booker Prize  Whitebread  bahkan penghargaan tertinggi seperti Nobel sekalipun  ia hanya masuk peringkat  100 Novel Pilihan Sepanjang Masa    Salinger berhasil memberikan pengaruh kuat dalam kebudayaan di berbagai lini  mulai dari film  musik  sampai buku  Tengoklah salah satu lagu grup punk Amerika  Greenday  Who Wrote Holden Caulfield  yang termaktub dalam album Kerplunk  film Taxi Driver yang diperankan Robert De Niro  film remaja dengan setting Amerika akhir 1950 an  The Last Time I Committed Suicide yang diperankan Thomas Jane  sekarang mencuat lewat film The Punisher  dan Keanu Reeves  sampai buku Norwegian Wood  Maklum  Salinger sendiri ternyata juga seorang penyendiri eksentrik sehingga meski sadar ia telah tenar ternyata sampai sekarang ia tak mengijinkan Catcher maupun karya lainnya yang juga memiliki bobot emosi serupa  Franny and Zoey diadaptasi menjadi film  Bagi publik pencintanya harus puas dengan karya lain yang dipengaruhinya  Langkah penerbitan novel ini sebenarnya terbilang telat lima dekade  Tapi bagi pembaca Indonesia lebih baik terlambat daripada tidak sama sekali merasakan kegelisahan seorang remaja yang mampu memberi pengaruh kebudayaan sepanjang masa    It was very interesting to see the way ones train of thought can change directions so rapidly  and how Holden interpreted certain things differently than I would in that situation   I read this novel when I was fifteen and found it a little confusing  However I then read it again seven years ago as I wanted to teach it for GCSE  It totally blew me away  The protagonist  Holden Caulfield is at times detestable  at times funny  at times very vulnerable  and totally lonely  It is interesting that at fifteen I did not identify with anything that this character was going through  However as and adult an having experienced so many harsh realities of life I found myself empathising with his feelings of isolation and  not fitting in with this shitty world  It will make you laugh and cry  It is such an excellent thought provoking novel  The last line is a classic piece of literature    I won t quote it as it is a bit of a spoiler  but as a teacher of kids with depression and anxiety I use it as a guide as not what to do or you could end up like Holden Caulfield  This book is gonna make you ponder and think a lot After reading this  I realized that people can really be  phonies  or hypocrites most of the time  This book is told on the POV of Holden Caulfield  the main character  and he mainly talks about his experiences with people and places    I don t really know how to continue this review  so I m gonna end it by saying that my favorite character is James Castle  Read the book to know why  The Catcher in The Rye  me lo sono gustato in lingua originale e devo ammettere di non riconoscermi nei pareri negativi che ho riscontrato da parte di alcuni lettori italiani  Molte delle critiche nelle quali mi sono imbattuto sono rivolte allo stile  evidentemente si tratta di una scrittura non cosi facile da rendere nella traduzione italiana  La prima considerazione dopo aver letto le pagine iniziali e stata   Questo libro deve aver avuto negli anni 50 lo stesso impatto che da noi ha avuto  Jack Frusciante E  Uscito Dal Gruppo  negli anni 90   per poi scoprire che Brizzi aveva definito l uscita di John Frusciante dai RHCP come qualcosa che faceva molto Salinger  prova che il giovane scrittore italiano ne era certamente stato influenzato  Indago ancora e ad ulteriore conferma leggo che la critica spganola definisce Brizzi il  Salinger italiano   Mi ha poi fatto pensare a Mark Twain  precisamente ad un Mark Twain del mondo adolescenziale  per via dell umorismo che contraddistingue entrambi gli autori alle prese con le due diverse eta che trattano  Ebbene  smanetto ancora sul web e scopro che l Holden e stato spesso associato all Huck Finn da fior fior di critici  cosa che mi ha fatto sentire molto  orgoglione  perche  pur non essendo un lettore accanitissimo  ho gia un discreto bagaglio letterario per scovare i libri che si sono  parlati   come direbbe il grande Umberto Eco  Per concludere  libro originalissimo e bellissimo  Da leggere  i almost didn t add this book because it seems like everyone ever has read it and or has something to say about it  what s one more review  but then i picked it up off my shelf  flipped through some pages and read what i had scribbled on post it notes  one yellow note just had  brilliant  scrawled across it  it s true  it s perfectly layered  i read it when i was in highschool and i hated everyone  including myself  i read it fast and i believed in it  and holden  like it was a kind of bible  in the years since then  i ve read it often and every time there is something new and my opinion changes  i ve loosened my grip on holden and  almost a decade since i read it  i think  phony  is starting to fade from my vocabulary  You go through this entire book wanting to give the main character a wedgie  Then you get to the end and you realize that the main character symbolizes you  and you realize just how horrible of a person you are  Afterwards you want to give yourself a wedgie  and isn t that something you want to experience  Have fun with the existential crisis this book makes you have Although  I think the reason I get along so well with this book is because I spent the latter of my freshman year and the former of my sophomore year of high school  crushing on  obsessing over an individual who I would say is the physical representation of Holden Caulfield  So I had a good outlet ranting about him with people while still sounding mildly intelligent   yay for literature  To say I enjoyed this book would be a complete understatement  The way Salinger conveyed the simultaneous simplicity and complexity of Holden s thought pattern contributed to a highly stimulating reading experience  leaving me feeling incredibly tearful by the end Discussing with others after finishing the novel made me feel incredibly puzzled  as I struggled to see how one could not sympathise with such a character  Just me who found it shockingly and tragically obvious that Holden suffers from an amalgamation of issues  likely caused by the sexual abuse he alludes to  However it is interpreted  I cannot help but feel incredibly emotional when thinking back on this novel and its writing style is one that really appealed to me  Really recommend  I teach this novel to my 11th graders  and  as a result  I love it I did not always love it In high school  I think I just thought it was weird In college  I think I thought it was mildly inappropriate   What s with the Lord s name in vain every other word  Holden  But now that I understand all of the symbolism in the book  I think it is fascinating and engaging My students really like it because the narrator is a  rebel without a cause   and they relate to his fears about growing up and his distaste for the hypocrisy of adults  If you decide to read it  stop every couple of chapters and call me  so we can have discussions about the symbols as you go  It really does make the novel MUCH more enjoyable  Is this the most popular book on goodreads I enjoyed reading this book This is a story about a sixteen year old boy  with a very foul mouth  I must add  who trying to deal with the challenges in his environment   i think people are so hyped up with the idea of reading this book  that they miss any real value it could have for them so if you can get past that  mandatory high school reading  stigma  and if you can read it without the mind cloud of bullshit that hollywood has made this book out to be  then you ll find a really special  intimate story about the innocence and struggles of young adulthood on a personal note  there s been this storm of people dying lately     it s been so fucking overwhelming and it seemed as though everywhere i ve turned  and every time i ve gotten a phone call  it was just to say some other joker was dead  or killed himself  or drowned  or just plain died  and no matter how i had tried to deal with it on my own or to whom i had reached out for consolation   nothing no one could get into my locked down head to force me past it all  but that s exactly what this kid holden is dealing with  albeit to a greater degree than i  but regardless   just reading his thoughts  relating to his loneliness  and understanding that familiar  rotting emptiness that death causes    and without any psychobabble self help crap to read around  just holden s random thought processes    which aren t really all that random    was the most therapeutic help i think i could have will receive so if you re just looking for a way to pad your reading history with some well known  classic   then by all means  this is your book but if you want something beyond that  rather  if you NEED something beyond that  even if it s just to get away from your own mind s world and see life through someone else s eyes  then this story not so story has the potential to give you some place of solace that you might not find anywhere else and on a separate note  that previous person s review    Waist of time  One of the most lousiest books i have ever read  It is very boring to read and the style how the persons speak at the book is irritating     if that  critique  annoyed you whatsoever  then you ll also probably like this book quite a bit  and get a kick out the entertaining story with its witty  dry humor  whether or not you re in some falling domino chain of dying family and friends   The Catcher In The Rye is a book that requires more thinking and problem solving than the average book  Holden Caulfield has attended prestigious high schools like Pencey  Elkton Hills  and Whooton  Nevertheless  he s flunked out of all of them  Within the book  Holden Caulfield struggles to find his way in life  His peers  teachers  parents  and siblings have given him every opportunity to be successful in his education but he may not want to follow in those kind of footsteps  Overall  excellent book despite the small amount of profanity and unfocus  Don t forget to take into account the comical relief and interesting plotting of the story itself  De un clasico se suelen decir dos cosas  esta sobrevalorado o se merece todos los elogios  En mi caso este libro entra en el segundo rubro  Una vez empece la historia  tuve que terminarlo lo mas pronto posible porque te atrapa y no te suelta  aunque solo se cuenten unos dias en la vida de un adolescente neoyorquino  Holden Caulfield es la voz de una generacion narcisista  malcriada  insegura  inconforme  pero con ganas de mas  Una historia atemporal  que puede extrapolarse a las andanzas de cualquier joven de este milenio  al fin y al cabo son los mismos sentimientos que ser viven en la adolescencia  Uno de los principales problemas de los libros escritos en primera persona es que te puede parecer insoportable o puedes empatizar con el personaje principal  Afortunadamente Holden me parecio sincero  simpatico  mas debil de lo que aparenta e incluso tierno en su relacion con sus hermanos  todo esto mientras nos lleva por su universo retorcido  desolador y sin esperanza  Y esto es un logro fascinante por parte del autor  Mi libro favorito del mundo mundial  so far   Holden Caulfield es un personaje complejo  que lidia con una multitud de problemas tanto personales como psicologicos  y como el mismo diria  sabes que es un gran libro cuando al finalizar de leerlo te dan ganas de llamar por telefono al autor y platicar con el como si fuera un amigo de hace anos Es una historia de la cual no esperas el final para saber que pasara  sino que disfrutas del camino a el paso a paso  Salinger creo una obra que desafia el tiempo y nos conecta con el adolescente que todos llevamos dentro  y no es necesario que hayamos sido adolescentes problema  o ricos  o increiblemente inteligentes  simplemente es necesario tomar algo de Holden y aferrarnos a eso con lo que nos sentimos identificados  para poder comprenderlo y saber que siente Holden ese fin de semana  i love this cynical book   i first read it in high school  while flying home for spring break  and drove my fellow passengers nuts with my spontaneous outbursts of hysterical laughter    this is a classic  and i have read and re read this book a million times  it inspired me to write a story about my teenaged observations on life  but i never managed to finish it     one thing i DO notice is that whenever i finish reading this book  i find myself swearing more than normal   synopsis from amazon   If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  In the first place  that stuff bores me  and in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them  His constant wry observations about what he encounters  from teachers to phonies  the two of course are not mutually exclusive  capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation  Without doubt the most intriguing and infectious character voice I ve ever read  Maybe it s because I m really a seventeen year old inside a forty four year old man s body but I was hooked within the first couple of chapters and waited a while to read on trying to savour it   but once I picked it up again I was a goner  I ll spare you the analysis of character  plot  setting or timeline because it makes no difference  Salinger could write this character landing on Mars and I would still want to read it  What surprised me about this book  given all the notoriety  was how much I laughed and I rarely laugh out loud at books but parts of this cracked me up  And I hate to say it because it s the cliche thing about this book but it s exactly the way I would see it and probably what I would say to someone if I was trying to describe the things Holden does  At least  maybe just via some J D  Salinger magic  that s the way it made me feel  My eyes ran over the words as if driving a large convertible down a freeway with no one else on it  It was easy reading but that s also partly what made it so enjoyable  The words just went straight in  Holden Caufield does infect your mind and you ll see things the way he sees it either because you resonate with him or by Salinger s incredible  sleight of hand   And once he s in you  you ll always remember what it was to be him  either in your own life or from reading this book   THIS IS BOOK CHANGED ME  The catcher in the rye is hands down one of the best books I ve ever read  though some people might say that Holden was hard to relate to  to me Holden  J D Salinger is like my hero  he said and did things that i would never have the courage to do or say and it s in a freaking book for generations to enjoy and learn from  Although the vocabulary is quite repetitive and sometimes Holden gets a bit whiny  it s a pretty freaking good book  One thing I would say that I wasn t a huge fan about was the way he talked about girls  like how he would describe them and how he would talk about  ugly  and  pretty  girls  that was a turn off for me but I think he means well  This book is sort of an eye opener in some ways like it shows you how reality really is and it sucks  And if you think about it the actual definition of being successful has changed over the years and before I m guessing it wasn t just about money  fancy clothes and accessories it was also being happy  So  if you actually didn t have a lot of money  but you were happy you would be considered successful but nowdays its different  It s all about money  fancy clothes and look how much MORE hateful society has become  Honestly though  this book does teach you and show you how reality comes crashing down on you  but it also shows how you aren t the first person going through a reality check and that there is also a way around it      I am grateful to Compton MacKenzie for writing  Sinister Street   Volume One of which returned me to  Catcher in the Rye  with a new level of appreciation for the tiny masterpiece it is  That last scene  with Phoebe riding the carousel and  going for the gold  really wrenched my heart  I had first read this book in my teenage years  now I am 68 years old and a parent  Meandering in the mind of Holden Caulfield was much more poignant for me this time around  He so beautifully captures the anguish of entrusting all things  especially the wee  wet ones  to God    or going mad  Catcher in the Rye is one of those books where you get the feeling that you are the main character  Readers  especially teenagers  can absolutely relate to Holden Caulfield because they are more than likely going through what he s going through one way or another  I m not saying that teenagers always get kicked out of schools and run away and then try and fail to sleep with a prostitute    I m saying that the teenagers can relate to what Caulfield is experiencing and are really what I think are the main themes of the book  fear of the future  fear of choices  of what others expect of you  fear of growing up and having to face responsibilities You grow up thinking that you have to meet the needs of your society  about what age you should marry and what age your supposed to have kids  This book got me  personally  to think about what choices I want to make and what others are expected of me  My parents and I have the same goal for myself  to be a doctor  It s something that I ve always wanted to do and something that my mind has always been set for  But while reading this book  I considered the possibility that maybe I only like to be a doctor because it s what my parents have always instilled on me  Although I m not very worried about it because I m still young  and I still have lots of time to make a decision that I know I won t regret  Hopefully Catcher in the Rye is definitely one of my favorite books and I always find myself comparing it to the Paper Towns by John Green  I think it s because there are certain similarities about Holden Caulfield and one of the main characters of Paper Towns  Margo Roth Spiegelman  I think anyone who has read both books will see what I m talking about here   Both characters run away  both characters are alone in a sense and both characters are looking for something that they can t find  and they don t even know what it is  I admire both characters because I think it takes a lot of courage to run away from people s expectations and to do your own thing  And even if you have successfully ran away it also takes a lot of courage to stay away and not come back  to completely give up the needs of your society and to not be swept away again One of the things that has stuck with me until after I read the last page of the book is this quote by Mr  Antolini  This fall I think you re riding for  it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement is designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  So they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even got started   He then goes on and talks about education and the importance of it  Their whole conversation  I thought  was just so    good  Mr  Antolini really hit on the head what the whole point of learning is  and I really learned a lot from that conversation  I m not saying it became all crystal clear just like that  but it has certainly helped Another thing I really liked about this book is the way it s written  It s so easy to follow  even if it s set around the fifties  I really  really liked it So yeah  I love this book so much  I ve read it 3 times  This is a big deal because I can t really re read books  So that must mean that J D  Salinger has made a huge impact on me for me to read again and again  I would definitely  definitely recommend to other people  especially people around my age  My only concern is that it doesn t have a solid plot  so it might not satisfy other people  Other than that  this books is just amazing  Creo que es mi novela favorita  Aunque ni siquiera pueda leerla en mi idioma    No  No hay traduccion posible  Nada  Vale la pena arrastrarse hasta manejar el ingles minimo que permita acceder a esta novela per fec ta Y Holden es mas real que muchas personas que nos cruzamos por la calle  Esta noche duermo en Central Park   re read In the time after I first finished reading this book  it became a significant contributor to all I ve been learning about empathy and the power books and stories have to help us better empathize with one another  Rereading it was like bringing all the thoughts I ve had since summer 2012 full circle  I didn t really like Holden when I first met him  but the thoughts he had and the things he said made me grow to care about him  And then I realized how very full the world is of people like Holden  who  from a distance  I would avoid or ignore because of who they seem to be on the outside  Yet  underneath the outward appearances  these are people with their own set of struggles and dreams and disappointments and hopes  often quite like my own  Learning that I cared about Holden  despite who he presents himself to be  has challenged me to care more deeply about all people  particularly the ones who I don t think I would like  So yeah  This book has greatly helped me grow as a person  so for that  it warrants a 5 star rating from me   1st time There isn t much of a plot to this book  but I don t think there s anything wrong with that  The books I like best are the ones that are more about the characters than anything else  and if this book was about anything it was about Holden Caulfield Reading this book was like getting inside someone s head for three days  following them around wherever they went and hearing all of their thoughts whenever they went somewhere  It s not about what happens to the character  but what has happened and made them who they are  I loved Holden s introspective thoughts the best  and when he thought about memories of his family  I felt like I really got to know Holden over the three days the book takes place in  better than I would have ever gotten to know a kid like him He gets into a lot of crap  he smokes  he drinks  he doesn t give a darn about school  He s got the typical hormonal mind of a 16 year old boy  There s a lot of swearing in this book  but I don t really see how there couldn t be with a kid like him  with the book written in 1st person and relying so much on what he thinks  People who swear out loud swear twice as much in their head  It made sense I think Holden s the kind of kid I d like to know from afar  Not the kind of person I d typically associate with  but an interesting one  He is an interesting person  and I like interesting people  He s curious about the world  he has lots of untapped potential  but he s just got so much going through his head  I ended up giving this book 3 5 stars because it s a book about a person  so I ended up rating based on how much I liked the person it was about  I liked parts of Holden  but parts of him frustrate me  I was rooting for him to succeed  but he doesn t seem to want to try  He just wants to live life as it comes  which isn t the perspective I have  We have to live life intentionally  to live with purpose  I wanted Holden to have purpose in his life  I sympathized with him  because he s been through a lot  but I also wanted to smack him upside the head and say  What are you doing with your life    I gave this book 3 5 stars because I liked Holden  I did  I really liked parts of him  the deep  insightful  mature thinking parts of him  and I didn t care for other parts of him  the immature  capricious  selfish parts of him  It s still a book I want to reread  and probably something I d appreciate and maybe even enjoy more the second time through  but for now I ll stick with 3 stars  I think everybody knows a Holden Caulfield  He seems confident  He has plenty of charms  He likes to pull your leg all the time  The more you get to know him the more you realize he doesn t have his stuff together and probably never will  Holden Caulfield in J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye is only 16  but you can imagine in a few years he ll be jumping from job to job because he just couldn t grow up  This novel is required reading in most high school curricula  and I think the reason for that is to serve as a warning to teenagers preparing to move into the next phase of their life  know the difference between healthy and unhealthy values At the start of the story  we learn that Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of Pencey Prep because he failed most of his classes  Holden makes all kinds of excuses  The one that seems to stick is that the whole place is full of phonies  In Holden Caulfield s world there are phonies everywhere  And the mere existence of these so called phonies is enough to drive Holden to indifference  He grows annoyed when his history teacher  who seems to care about Holden  begins lecturing him about making an effort in life  Holden makes an excuse and gets out of there  In fact  to avoid further humiliation he leaves Pencey that very night  though he still has four days left before the end of the term The novel seems made up of random occurrences  what with a run in with a prostitute and her pimp  visits to bars and clubs  meetings with various friends  but these things happen at the whim of Holden Caulfield  He makes a decision  often unwisely  and then these things happen  Holden does things without purpose  Even the decision to invite the prostitute to his hotel room was not well thought out since he had no intention of sleeping with her  Much of the novel finds him wandering around aimlessly  as though he can t decide what to do  where to go His paralysis in making a healthy decision for himself seems to lie in a hypersensitive sense of injustice  Even the tiniest injustice is enough to paralyze him with indecision and inaction  The fact that the world is full of phonies is enough to convince him not to pursue any meaningful activity  He has an ideal of himself as a savior of sorts  but the way he envisions this is as a fantasy rather than a realistic goal  He describes his ideal future as a person who catches lost children as they wander towards the edge of a cliff  Humanity needs him  he seems to believe  to protect them from the error of their ways  But this vision only serves to highlight his inability to make a concrete decision about the direction he wants to take his life  Holden doesn t even realize he s one of those children veering towards the edge of the cliff  If the ending is any indication  he never will   Marvelous Novel  I haven t read such a great book in a very very long time  In fact  This s the book I read after a very long time  I was scared to get a  lousy  story  But this one master piece is great  The story of a two night mind journey of Holden Caulfield and how Salinger sees the world from the eyes of a teenager boy  An oldman wise boy whose manifest goes against the bullshit routine that has covered us and our environment  The golden part of the story is how it ends  The everyday struggle of any typical man trying to swim against the current but winds up attached and dragged to the routine all around  Wonderful story  Left me speechless with a couple of great underlined parts  All I can say is brilliant  In some point of my life  I realize how accurate Holden s point of views are  I m really amazed how he see things and how he became sick of it  Hands down  JD Salinger for a wonderful job  Most amazing thing everrrr  Holden s character has so much to say and the writing is brilliant the author s style of making you realize that you are the ones judging holden is truly amazing   Loved it  The book is one of the most popular ones for a reason  I believe that the whole sad and rather ugly approach to a subject like this is what makes the book special  The  axis mundi  revolves around an ordinary star in this book  The fact that it concentrates all its attention on such a mediocre case  the ordinary and at the same time  the sheer oddness of the happenings are just a few more things that keep you hooked to the pages I enjoyed it for the moral conflicts and inner struggles  very well written by Salinger  The typical drama of the careless teenager that gets kicked out of school turns into something more worth reading when we re revealed more tragic details of the past  more honest opinions about the people around  The style of using continuously flowing flashbacks that mix with the foggy present tense is of such great effect that it is anything but boring to read pages and pages of an event that the narrator himself mentions being unimportant  I have to say it s an impressive book  really worth reading  Actually  it s one of those books without a definite genre or style  Its uniqueness is what makes me think this book is for anybody  no matter the age or their preferences  If you haven t read this book  read it  I was positive that I would despise this book  Everything I knew about it just screamed into my ears that it would be  teen rebellion  junk  The first time I heard about it was that it was the book that  inspired  Mark David Chapman in his Travis Bickle like alienation  Not a fantastic introduction by any means  I thought it must have been a book about assassination or something  Then I learn that it s a high school classic  That Holden Caulfield is a  icon for teenage rebellion  according to the Wikipedia article  Everybody I knew hated it  So I have the double whammy of 1  Nobody I know liking it and 2  Finding the sound of the subject matter immensely distasteful  So why did I even read it  Because I m trying to catch up on my great book reading right now  I ve put everything else on hold to read all those books I always wanted to get around to but never did  The Catcher in the Rye is at the top of all of the Goodreads lists  Everyone knows about it  It s iconic  So I decided I would bite the bullet and get the pain over with  I read the first paragraph for kicks while I was in the middle of something else  Huh  I thought  This isn t bad  I laughed  Maybe this won t be so horrible after all  I read Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and decided the next day I would read half of Catcher  So I started the next day  and wow  I loved it so much I read the whole thing cover to cover that day  I can t think of any words to describe how wrong I knew I was  I still can t believe how good it is  The narrator is completely unique  the story is fascinating  yet nothing is really happening  It s kind of like Seinfeld  The characters are so great you don t care if there s a story or not  It was so real  It was stunning how true Holden s words were As much as a guy might hate to admit it  I think we re all a lot like Holden Caulfield  Some of us may be more finely tuned at not showing it  Deep down I think his thoughts are close to ours  Ok  maybe I should rephrase that so I don t sound like I m Holden Caulfield  I m not  but to a certain extent I think he s similar to me  I think the reader might believe this easily because he connects with Holden so much closer than anyone else in fiction  Because you not only see what he sees through his eyes  but he s completely honest as well  This is what kills me  It really does  He s not only honest to us  but to himself as well  Which strikes me as funny because he describes himself in chapter three I believe as  the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life   It s extremely bizarre to me this concept of Holden being an icon of rebellion  When did he ever rebel  Who is he rebelling against  There s no indication of rebellion at all  In fact  I would go as far as to say he s anti rebellion  Would a rebel get mad about someone writing  F    you  on an elementary school wall  Holden wants people to hold onto innocence  This is not a rebellious characteristic  Holden is a contradiction in that he is extremely mature in many ways  almost too mature  At the same time he is completely immature  He really is one of literature s greatest characters  not greatest rebels  I m tellin  yah  By the way  I laughed harder at The Catcher in the Rye than probably any other book I ve ever read  I never see it mentioned as a humor book  because it isn t really  but it certainly doesn t lack some laughs by any means  The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that when you finish you know you just experienced something that is truly great  It s just an incredible book  A tour de force in American literature  There really isn t much a man can say when he s awestruck by greatness  I wish it wasn t so misunderstood  but I guess Holden would expect that   Holden Caulfield is a successful representation of how most of adolescents see the world and how by any means they react to it  What amuses me is how this was written eons ago  I like that someone devoted his time to write a book about adolescent cynicism even before it became a mainstream issue  He could have written about anything but he chose to to write about Holden Caulfield  Do you know what I m saying Naturally  readers would frown multiple times over the amount of profanity and the unbecoming nature of the narrator but I encourage everyone to read it for its blatant honesty and revelation  This books seems to be written in a rushed manner and with Salinger never minding to proofread it at once which give it its raw quality and of the assumed apathetic mood of sixteen year old Caulfield  If I would ve known it would only take me 5 days to finish this book  I definitely would ve started years earlier  At the same time I m glad I waited to read this book  I always wondered why I never read it throughout high school  I heard about it everywhere  now I figure it was banned at my high school due to the language  LAME  The Catcher in the Rye is a book about innocence  isolation  growing up and so much more  Holden Caulfield is not your usual protagonist  I personally have never read anything with a voice like him  Although it was very clear to me he had issues  always angry at everything   everyone  hates even the smallest things   I still somehow felt connected to him  On some level I knew there was a time in my life where I was like Holden  a young teenager questioning everything  learning that my childhood would not last forever  What I found most interesting about Holden was his fear of moving into adulthood  He was absolutely terrified of growing up  and it took some time to realize that  The more you read the book it is clear how scared he really is  It was also very easy to connect with him through the way he wrote the story  it was different in a good way  Always sounded like a thought that just came into his head  it was never forced or too thought out     Do not read further if you have not read the book   The metaphor of the catcher in the rye is something I can t stop thinking about  Once I connected his dream of being out in a rye field  with thousands of children  catching them before they fell over the cliff to the fact that he was trying to save them from  falling into adulthood  helped it all make sense  He wanted to be the person who saves them before they fall and can never come back from it  Keep their innocence  hide the violence of this world from them so they can stay young and happy forever  It was so moving to me and I truly can t stop thinking about it  I had no idea what the title meant when I first started this book  but it all came together in the end  There is so much I could say  but I don t think I can find the right words to explain how much I enjoyed reading it  And I didn t even have to get it assigned as homework     Wow this book was purely amazing  I know there s not really a point in the whole story but a lot of things Holden went through are relatable  I can see myself in him    76This is something unbelievable  I came to know about this book through John Lennon s incident  Started reading this and found the starting pages were just good  But not great  I didn t see anything which is related to murder or anything  Not even the words which provocative one to murder  While I was turning the pages  somewhere in the middle I was hooked by the book  I was into it  I could listen that melancholy music behind those words  I started feeling Holden  I started understanding him more and somewhere we have so much in common  I mean common thinking Not that I laugh at the inappropriate places and timings   The book is finding yourself  Maybe not exactly finding yourself  Maybe understanding yourself  Maybe not even that  It s abstract  It discusses with you with one topic and it jumps to another which is nowhere related to the previous topic  This is something weird and beautiful  I am sure this book doesn t give you everything at once but it grows on you as the time passes  And one day it takes you into it Read the borrowed book  I hope I keep my own book in the shelf  Uau  kolko e trudno da pisha za liubima kniga  Prochetokh  Spasitelia  za p

With the death of J D  Salinger I was tempted to reread the book that made him famous  I probably read it originally in the early sixties when I wasn t much older the Holden Caulfield  the hero of the story  I think I enjoyed it more reading it as an old man  I think I understand what makes it a great book now better than I did all those years ago   The allure to a younger reader is Holden s bravado and his contempt for everyone and everything he comes in contact with  Who among us hasn t felt the same at sixteen  But his smoking and drinking and sexual misadventures only serve to mask the real Holden  who on every page shows a sincere decency  Holden is really a very good boy with a wonderful heart for all his bravado  He stands up for every underdog and every good person in the book  And what he hates most are self centered  phonies   And after all  how can you fault a boy who wants to spend his life being a catcher in the rye   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though      J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Rye I ve read this book over a year and a half ago  and I don t know why I never wrote a review  At first  I had to get used to the language and tone a little bit  but it turned out fine  The writing style was very likable  It s simple and straightforward  Holden is very realistic and describes everything as he sees it and I liked reading that  It s honest  I like that something like this was written around friggin  1950 and everyone went nuts  I ve noticed this is a love it or hate it kind of book  I honestly don t get why people wouldn t like this book  It s probably because they don t like the main character  Holden  but why would that make it a bad read  To be honest  I DID expect some sort of epic adventure to happen when Holden went away from school  but when it didn t  that was OK  It was better even  It felt good to be reading something real I could really identify with Holden  and maybe that s not a good thing but it was a good thing for my reading experience    Identity crisis is a big subject in this book and you can feel it as the story goes  Who is Holden  Is he the annoying spoiled big mouthed teenage boy he appears to be  Or is there more to him People would think this book is negative  but it s very realistic  Holden seems to be in a constant struggle of wanting to be an adult  but he seems to fail each time he tries  At the same time he does not want to grow up at all  For example  he is trying to save innocence  He wants to be the catcher in the rye  He wants to save children from adulthood  I think that s beautiful  This seems to be his identity crisis  In the book he is looking for a place to stay  but he can t go anywhere  That is like a metaphor for his life  He doesn t belong anywhere in particular  He hides behind the cynical and sarcastic boy he appears to be  He criticizes everything  According to psychologists  this is a stage everyone goes through in life around that age  Not knowing where you stand  not able to commit to one certain identity  So I would think that anyone could identify in SOME way  It doesn t mean that he is the little brat that he seems to be throughout most of the book  And I mean  why lie  I know I went through what Holden went through  and if you did  you can t hate this book  I need to re read this very soon   Just love the part where Mr  Antolini gives Holden the words of wisdom   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one    you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry    I m not trying to tell you  that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world  It s not so  But I do say that educated and scholarly men  if they re brilliant and creative to begin with  which  unfortunately  is rarely the case  tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative  They tend to express themselves more clearly  and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end  And  most important  nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker    Something else an academic education will do for you  If you go along with it any considerable distance  it ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have  What it ll fit and  maybe  what it won t  After a while  you ll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing  For one thing  it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that don t suit you  aren t becoming to you  You ll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly   I also want to be a poet   The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderful book about the feelings of a teenager towards society  The main character  Holden Caulfield  is incredibly sarcastic and skeptical about almost everything  and is convinced he is living in a world of phonies  This book is incredibly powerful on the character development aspect  though I felt like most of the information was being revealed over time  His point of view is powerful enough to change anyone s mind about society  I loved this book because of the detail  it made me feel like I was on the streets of New York with Holden  It is one of my personal favorites   The first novel to have ever knocked me off my feat and show me how it s really done  Holden wasn t just some character on a page  he was a true being  a real teenager  I could hear his voice whenever I opened a page and read a sentence  as if he were in the room  Fantastic work and one that everyone has to read at least once  even if they hate it   It s somewhat funny that the only times i ve read this book is because of the book being part of a class s necessary curriculum  Once in High School  my junior year to be exact  I remember it pretty clearly  opening to that first page and being completely drawn into it  There was already this kind of dangerous notoriety towards the title  I couldn t name it off the top of my head  but the title itself sounded dangerous and I knew there was something attached to it that made it even more controversial  like  Helter Skelter  is for The Beatles  Up until then the only kind of books i found that really shook me were Stephen King books  to be honest  Literature was fine but it always seems so DATED to me  I had yet to discover so many greats that would come later  so Salinger would be my first introduction to what i call  Kickass Literature   Hemingway  Wilde  Kerouac  Faulkner  Joyce   all of them  came much later for me  But hey  i think that s still a worthy introduction  Now it s 2013  eleven years later  Now it s for a literature class  and i have to admit  the book still holds up  I am a far better of a reader now than I was back then  and also older and more of a whole person  Holden doesn t sound like some kind of rebel hero  but i still love the writing  I see layers to the story that were never there the first time i saw it  and i find it far more tragic  dark and depressing  Which of course is a subject that i tend to have a predilection for  Which is odd  because I am not a very unhappy person  at all  I think i m getting off topic  I understand a bit better why people hate this book  the ones that do anyway  I honestly believe that Salinger expected this book to pass under the radar  he did not write this in any way to explode the way it did and continues to do  i think another reason why i love it is because i love art that tends to polarize people  There s something so complex about it  as if its mixing something of distaste with something of favor and saying  have at it  i will not conform to your expectations   It feels like a rebellious act to me  or at least a dangerous one  and I respect that  To sum up  no i don t idolize Holden in any way  I pity him  actually  and anyone else who has had to endure the experiences he has had to come through and pressured to make his way through the modern world  a thing that is difficult in its own right   I still find the book interesting and well written  and worth checking out  no matter the end result  Just be sure to read a little deeper and not stay at the surface  otherwise you ll miss the real point of the whole madness of Holden s situation    I thought it was  If a body catch a body    I said   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around    nobody big  I mean    except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff    I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy  If I was reading this book now for the first time  I probably wouldn t have enjoyed it that much  But I read this book when I was a teenager  and no book ever  before or after that  affected me so much  I have very fond memories of  Catcher in the Rye   It was always my favorite book  easily  no book touched me  or spoke to me so well  I was full of angst as a teenager  lonely  confused  depressed  felt like no one really understood me  Suddenly  here was a book that was written as if especially just for me  Boy  when you re dead  they really fix you up  I hope to hell when I do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something  Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery  People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday  and all that crap  Who wants flowers when you re dead  Nobody  I remember when I reached the end of the book  the part where Holden was watching his young sister riding the carousel  and I cried  I had never cried reading a book before  and it was such a simple scene  just Holden watching his little sister being happy  and him being happy just watching her  and in that  I found something  It felt like in all the unfamiliar  unhappy thoughts in my head  here was something that was uncomplicated and simple  and it felt enough  It was a scene of pure ecstasy for the most basic reasons  and to me  it was full of hope for myself  I went down by a different staircase  and I saw another  Fuck you  on the wall  I tried to rub it off with my hand again  but this one was scratched on  with a knife or something  It wouldn t come off  It s hopeless  anyway  If you had a million years to do it in  you couldn t rub out even half the  Fuck you  signs in the world  It s impossible  After my first read   Catcher in the Rye  remained a book that I kept rereading  sometimes from start to finish  but most often  just at random  I d pick it up from the bookshelf  read a few pages  and put it down again  For the next several years  it became some sort of comfort to me  Whenever I felt lost  I d just grab it  and it felt soothing  That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall half in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are  Girls  Jesus Christ  They can drive you crazy  They really can  I owe a lot to this book  And now reading it again a decade later  I might not enjoy it like I did then  but it felt familiar and good  like I was revisiting the past  and I felt such an appreciation for it  for helping me back then when no living person could  When I started reading it a few days ago  I finished it in less than 24 hours  The thing is  it s really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs    if yours are really good ones and theirs aren t  Thank you  J  D  Salinger  for giving me something that I can never forget  I have a feeling that you re riding for some kind of a terrible  terrible fall  But I don t honestly know what kind     It may be the kind where  at the age of thirty  you sit in some bar hating everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college  Then again  you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say   It s a secret between he and I   Or you may end up in some business office  throwing paper clips at the nearest stenographer  I just don t know    This fall I think you re riding for   it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement s designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  So they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even got started   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry      Those war movies always do that to me  I don t think I could stand it if I had to go to war  I really couldn t  It wouldn t be too bad if they d just take you out and shoot you or something  but you have to stay in the Army so goddam long  That s the whole trouble      I mean  he was very intelligent and all  but you could tell he didn t have too much brains      Here s what he said   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   I have so many feelings and I don t even know where they came from a      hwldn     Extremely funny and delightful   What makes this book beyond great is that you either hate everything about it or you fall completely in love with it   You can see Holden as an arrogant and self centered guy who sees himself as superior to everyone around him  According to him  everyone and everything is phony and stupid  Everything  depresses the shit out of him   I kept picturing Grouchy Smurf all the time while reading the book  For me this was just a shield he used to hide how he really feels  He is just a lonely kid  Someone who is in desperate need for human contact and love  but his protective wall of bitterness prevents him from looking for such interaction  He is criticizing everyone and everything and yet he still wants to be around them  he still needs their approval and love  Like why he kept looking for someone to call and meet if he already thinks they are all bunch of morons and show offs  The language of the book is just perfect  How he simplifies those views about life and human beings using the language of a 16 years old kid  He is pretty funny as well  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though   This is exactly how I felt after I finished the book  only I think I would prefer to be friends with Holden not J D  Salinger  2015 pop sugar reading challenge  A book I was supposed to read in school but didn t For some reason I ended up with High School teachers that didn t force us read this book  And I am extremely happy they didn t  really I am  This book killed me  it really did  It s very rare for me to finish a book and want to reread it almost immediately  this is one of those books  I haven t read anything currently with an in depth character such as Holden  so it was a relief to really connect with a character  He is extremely cynical  and I thought it was funny  I actually  LOL ed  in various parts of the novel  I love the way he describes everything he hates  Do I recommend this book for people that enjoy exciting novels  Absolutely not  This is by no means an  exciting  novel  as there isn t much of a plot  It is more of a stream of conscience type of novel   my jugement   listen i don t normally give my opinion on anything on the internet  actually not at all  but i feel responsible for having to say something  parents and teens or even kids need to realize something about this book  whether a book is good or bad is of utter opinion  But the importance of it is all to real  My name is Mohamed and im almost completely isolated in my way of thinking in the sense that i always think in a more moral philosophical view  It is important for me to tell you who i am for you to truly understand  look the world is what it is  It does not provide cushions for you when you face reality  And each person has their own view on it depending on how they grew up  On this particular book  its from the perspective of a specific teenager  so if you dont understand where he is coming from or have no idea why he feels the way he does except through over opinioted reviews  then please dont jump to say your negative 2 cents about it  of course opinions are to be respected and you have every right to do so but think thourougly before doing so because you might drive others away from what might be a life changing read for the reader  both parents and kids of a certain age need to realize that although people are grey areas  the world is black and white  it is what it is  to put it simply I connected to this book in the sense that my way of thinking is the same as Holden  Yes  he is selfish and a madman  Is this bad  It is not for us to say  It has been benifitial to me and everyone around me that i love  Holden is a fictional character that represents what many of us have gone through  and is the manifestation of what just a few of us have gone through  Parents  love it or hate it this book depicts the truth going on around our world  You of all people should know that this vulgar language is only as bad as we make it  It is in every day life  and honestly its not that big a deal Neither is sexuality  Its not so much the age of the kid as much as it is the moral values  intelligence and manor to which the child has been raised  If the child has been raised in a non tolerant household that fluffs up the real world  of course the child is going to be disturbed by this  and kids  teens  whatever  please read this book  hell  you might not make the least bit connection with it but it is a very real statement and your first insight of the truth  All his complaining  which i agree he does frequently is a message  These are very real problems facing the world from ignorant blondes at a bar to the ultimate future and ignorant state of mind that our innocent children are going to grow up to face  I dont recommend you read this book until your 16 though  not because of the language or the sex or the violence or the moral aspect of it  live your life with open eyes and observe silently  if all goes well  when you read this book youll see the very nature of the true geniuses living around you  and youll realize that mostly all the time  the  smart people  arent always the ones getting straight A s   I personally unexpectedly  loved this book  This book is a  coming of age  read  and explores the main character  Holden Caulfield s adolescent years and his struggle to get through school and also his social anxiety disconnection from other people  I related so so much to the character because I felt like he was the only normal person in the book  even though everyone thought of him as an outsider and a loser etc  I found his opinions and views on people relatable also  and the way J D Salinger wrote this made me sympathise a lot for him  and once again  I became attached to another fictional character  He was someone you could really understand  and after you read the book  you felt like he was your friend and I really liked that about The Catcher in the Rye In many ways  this book was like The Perks of Being A Wallflower  and if you were a fan of that book  I definitely recommend this book  because although Holden and Charlie are very different characters  they are also so alike  However  the one thing I didn t really like about this book  was the ending  I won t give away any spoilers   It was just very vague and fustrating because I so badly wanted to know what had happened to Holden  but I guess in a way  the ending was quite good because it left you hanging  Overall  a great read  Where do I start  that it the question  I think I would start by saying  that is  writing  that this book is the best I ve read in a really long time  In other words  it s the only thing I cared about writing since I left my job as a film literary critic six months ago At first  I couldn t quite understand why someone  well  someone other than Virginia Woolf  would write a book about the unimportant details of the life of a sixteen year old who just got expelled from school  The entire book is an encounter of two days in the life of Holden Claufield which  in fact  makes it more of a journal than a novel  Despite this  I hardly found the book boring Of all the writing techniques  J  D  Salinger uses the stream of consciousness  However  he uses it because no other technique could reflect his subject more  Through the irregularity and random nature of the technique employed  he shows how meaningless the life of the protagonist  Holden  is  He shows that his life doesn t just happen to be aimless  it s his reaction to every little situation in his everyday life that add up to form a purposeless life  The reason  in the end  goes to the root of it   the protagonist doesn t have a target in life  He just goes with the flow As a result  he makes mistakes  things that he knows are wrong   despite his principles  He does them because his life is empty  because he is empty  At a point  he doesn t see why he shouldn t do them  But his good nature   his instinct   stops him  And then he goes back to being pulled towards them again before his conscious stops him and so on and so forth  The same scenario keeps repeating itself over and over again until he reaches a point where he can t stand it any longer  He breaks He s seen a lot of the wildness of life that he feels sick of it all  He s seen and experienced life the hard way and knew its real face   its ugly  real face  He even saw the real face of people he once thought he could trust with all he s got  He thought he could trust his teacher  Mr Antolini  who  ironically enough  was the very same person who spoke to him about the shocking experience of dealing with humans  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behaviour  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to And when Holden finds out that Ms Antolini is not the person he always thought he was  he then starts to doubt if he really was bad or if he s misjudged him  He can t be sure about anything anymore But if there s one thing he knows for sure  it s the very fact that he is pure  He is a lamb in a world of lions  Which is why thinks of himself as the catcher in the rye  it s his innocence and good nature that saves people from falling in a bottomless world  He talks about it to his little sister  Phoebe Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean  if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy That s just the way with some people  They live their lives guiding other and catching them when they re about to fall  Sometimes they even do fall and they have to go down themselves and go through all the darkness   the sickening darkness   just to get others out and help them go back to their lives  They are the few that manage to stick to their innocent instincts with which they were born  the ones which life could not alter  not even with its ugliness and cruelness and brutality  As Mr Antolini tells Holden  Wilhelm Stekel  who was a psychoanalyst  wrote   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   As good  perhaps better  at twenty four as it was at sixteen and eighteen   People either love Holden or hate Holden  I love this book and I understand Holden  I read this book when I was 16 and it changed me significantly  The plot is weak  but that doesn t matter  because the book is not about the plot  in other words the plot is not the most important thing  It s the dialogue  It s Holden s opinions and his life and his mentality that makes this book fascinating  A struggling young man going through so many changes in the jungle of New York City  you will be touched by his words  sure he may offend you  but he will also make you laugh  make you think  make you understand how his struggles are swallowing him and how he s having a difficult time coping with them  I personally own this book and will honestly keep it til the day I die  A wonderful piece of literature who can always be read again and again  For chrissakes   read in the 1970s  makes it seem like I haven t read it since I was 9  I have  I ve read it over and over  I think about it all the time  and I get mad at myself for being so stupidly sentimental and wanting to be the catcher in the rye  I try too hard to catch everyone before something bad happens to them  I ve got to stop caring Phonies  I remember when I first read that word   how excited I got  Fourth grade   all I could think about was how dumb everyone was  how clueless  and how brutal  The world was not a nice place  but if I kept smiling  then the phonies wouldn t make a fuss  This had far reaching implications for the rest of my life  I went on a wild journey with this book  I set a personal record  finishing this book in only a few days  There are great reasons for that  The biggest reason I loved this book was due to the tone  It was written by a highschooler  so I connected with the voice  It s always exciting to be sitting in class and read a curse word and giggle  This book made me think  It forced me into some of the deepest thinking I ve ever done  For a few days I was a bit stunned  I was having a thought overload  I wanted to know what point the author was trying to make  I wanted to understand Holden better  I think this overwhelmed feeling I had at the end of the book was due to the ending  Sir  Salinger leaves you empty  he leaves you with nothing but pure questions and thought  It was a joy going on the journey with another teenager  with similar ideas and questions  and how he deals with growing into adult hood  Holden is definately a hard to understand character  but with deep thought  he can be understood and   loved  I would highly suggest this book to any teenager  or adult  and espcially parent  I m glad Im reading this book now and not a couple years ago  so I was able to appreciate it to the full extent  A Money Out  I absolutely love this book  It s a classic for a reason and that reason is that it s absolutely awesome  Other people think that this is a book about a little teenage brat complaining about the difficulties of growing up  but who cares  Isn t growing up hard  I think so and that s why I related to it  He goes on and on  but his raw thoughts were in a lot of other teenagers  Salinger captured so many of my adolescent hardships  The loss of innocence in the world  the need to protect the innocence of those younger  and the alienation from everyone around him  I loved it  because I could relate to it  It might not be the same for everyone else  but it s still a great piece of writing  This book captures the whole raw thoughts of a human mind   lktb lty tdkhrh lwqt l t lmh bynm t lm  nh stkwn Twq njtkkn  lHrs fy Hql lshwfn   hmh  J D  Salinger creates an unusual yet interesting character named Holden Caulfield   The Catcher in the Rye  revolves around 16 year old Holden  a delinquent who tries to find himself by interacting with a variety of people in New York  Holden has strong beliefs  including those about phonies and life      I was surrounded by phonies    13  Holden constantly says  Unusual to its time period   The Catcher in the Rye  provides a new insight to teenagers of the 1900s  Salinger s novel appeals to many because it bluntly reflects the lives of teens  In addition  Holden s humor and witty diction makes the novel even more interesting as readers get to experience a memory from Holden s past  This book instantly became one of my favorites because of Salinger s writing style and unique characters and perspectives  This is one of my favorite books of all time  I hesitate to say this  as this book has been linked to the slaying of many famous people  by their killers   For instance  John Lennon s killer  read this while he waited for the police to pick him up after lethally shooting Lennon  I LOVE the Beatles and Lennon  so I have a conflict of thought when I rave about how much I love this book   However  I didn t know this BEFORE going into the book  therefore maybe I couldn t see why this would lead someone to murder I see this book instead as the journey of a boy who is in the process of trying to live in the balance of expectations from his parents  pressure from his peers  and coming to terms with what he wants to do for himself  The subjects are vast  sex  adventure  male friendship  sibling relationships  etc  All around  top of the notch  Just don t go do anything crazy now that I told you that    The book  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  was a great read that was written from a teenagers point of view  This novel is a work of a fiction narrative  It is about the perspective on life from the point of view of Holden Caulfield  He describes his everyday experiences and challenges that he faces everyday  Everything he goes through impacts his life  influencing the choices and actions he makes through out the book  His choices also impact many people around him like his friends  dates  and even his sister Phoebe  who s a very intelligent girl who is currently in elementary school  Another character known well through out the book it Mr  Antolini  To Holden  Mr  Antolini is a very big role model that shapes the behavior of Holden  Mr  Antolini is also a very intelligent man  influencing many of Holden s choices  The last characters who are most of the time mentioned in the book are Allie and Jane  Allie is Holden s younger brother  also very intelligent  who passed away years ago from leukemia  In the book  Holden keeps the memory of his younger brother very dear to his heart  Jane on the other hand was someone Holden loved a lot  She is also part of his memory because years back he had to move on  She is also something that sits very often on Holden s mind  But what s really amazing about this book is how he reacts to his choices and actions  This is a remarkable book that takes place during the 1950s in the setting of New York  But sometimes life doesn t go as well as planned for holden  that means rejection  challenging problems to overcome when alone in a big city and most important of all being able to take charge of your life when no one else is there  Witness the tragic but also romantic life and experiences of Holden Caulfield My first thought s on this book are  WoW  This is fascinating  I have never read a better book than this one  It took me by surprise every time in it s ever twisting path of tension and anxiety  I could not take myself away from the book  It kept me up reading for hours  At first it may sound boring and confusing  but once you get to know Holden and his world of peculiarity  you will also love it  For example  your reading and the next page takes you totally by surprise  you won t see it coming  That s why I gave it five stars  its unpredictability made it very intense and an astonishing read  But no book is perfect  This book may have been a phenomenal and an eye opening read  but it also contained some texts that made it a bit boring  Sometimes the dialogue would be to long making me want to stop reading and other times there would be tiresome scenes that weren t as pleasant to read  But overall this is a stunning book that is  best in its time  written by one of America s most famous writers  I would recommend this book to eight graders and higher for its mature scenes and language  Give it a chance it won t fail you   This is the most beautiful book I have ever read and I will not be able to get this book out of my system  The descriptions and the narrative style of this book  although atleast fifty years old  is too good and will not let you leave the book till you have turned the last page  The story relates to me very closely as well in terms of the thinking process of the boy  I am grateful to Salinger for writing such a book  Warning  This is not a book for people trying to become  less  cynical  My biggest fear after reading it is that I would finally make the ultimate leap from cynical to bitter    this book had the potential to do that to me  But I love it anyway  Yes  I did read this book in high school  but I hardly had the maturity to read it for what it is truly worth  And it is a goldmine  I was a little more depressed reading it this time    it s one of those books that you can feel completely different about it when you read it at different times in your life  It is definitely a good book  but can be a little dark and depressing at some points  Probably because I reflected upon it too much and was a little too introspective with this    but I think it has a lot of depth and it pretty brilliant  even now  hrchqdr hm Hrf bznm ldht rwyy w zbny yn khtb rw nmy twnm wSf khnm  wq  yn khtb ykh shhkhrh  nkht Zryf nsny y khh dr myn dstn bh myn khshydh my

suggestion couldn tve been better  Saliger s style clearly is still imitated over 60 years later  The novel comments on American society s concrete  individually centered worldview  The protagonist takes the hypothetical and abstraction seriously  which leads to depressed   what if  thoughts  The book  The Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger  is very interesting  While I was beginning to read it  I didn t exactly find the theme of the book  Then I noticed that throughout the book  the author J D Salinger depicts Holden as a sad and depressed person who didn t get a chance to live his childhood the way he wanted to  He seems very lonesome and keeps his thoughts to himself  He loves company and most people  He describes their actions  personalities  and flaws  He somehow reads peoples  minds and tells people what they do and don t want to here  Holden is a very stubborn boy and he basically thinks the world revolves around him  He thinks he is already an adult  This is shown while he is always asking for drinks he shouldn t have at his age  he smokes all the time  and goes everywhere he wants to when he feels like it  He has conversations with cab drivers because he is lonely and wants to enjoy himself by examining people as they are  Caulfield is a very open minded person  he is shaped by his experiences  You can tell that he is a compassionate person because of the love he shows for Phoebe  In fact if it wasn t for her he would end up running away  She reminds him of himself and he wants her to have a great childhood next to the people she loves  He wants her to live what he hadn t lived  I really enjoyed this book because it shows that most people around me could feel what he feels which is  being afraid of growing up to fast and not be able to enjoy your life before you become independent and enter adulthood  Although I really enjoyed my childhood  I can relate to Holden because  I am going to miss being young and not entering the real world full of unexpected happenings  I do recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book full of emotions  thoughts  and outlooks on life  I read this book when I was in 11th grade and it remains my all time favorite book  There is something about Holden that I just find appealing  His personality is one that you can instantly get wrapped up in and it s an amazing piece of writing   It s funny all you have to do is say something nobody understands and they ll do practically anything you want them too The Catcher in the Rye is definitely my favourite book Maybe it s because I m still a teenager  maybe it s because I supposedly  connect  to Holden  or maybe it s because the book is so different from most cliche and predictable young adult novels these days  Caution though  many people don t really like this book and I completely understand  but I think everyone should read it I wish more young adult fiction was like this If they ever make this into a film I would never watch it  Hollywood would destroy this beautiful piece of work   Personal response  I really enjoyed the book The Catcher In The Rye by J D  Salinger  because it was a very good book  The beginning was a little dull but it got better as the book went on  I liked the book so much that it was hard for me to put it down Plot  In the beginning of the book Holden was in his dorm packing to go home because he got kicked out of school  As he was packing he was talking to his roommate and he found out that he was going out on a date with Holden s neighbor  After Holden left the dorm he went to the train station  He took the train to New York and was staying in a hotel by himself  At the hotel they had a dance down stairs and Holden went to it  and danced with two girls  When Holden was going back up to his room a Pimp stopped him and asked him if he was interested in some company  Holden was up in his room when a girl showed up at his door and he talked and she left  The next day Holden went out on a date with an old friend sally  Holden went home and talked to his sister Phoebe and they went outside and played in the rain and Holden got sick in the end  Characterization  the main character was Holden Caulfield  Phoebe who is Holden s younger sister  Allie who was Holden s younger brother who died  D B  who was Holden s older brother who was a writer in Hollywood  Mr  Antolini who was Holden s old teacher that was always nice to him  Sally a girl Holden likes and took out on a date Setting  Catcher In The Rye took place in the 1950s in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  It began in a private school in Pennsylvania and he got kicked out of it  Then he went to New York and stayed in a hotel for a couple of days  After that he went to his house Recommend  I would recommend Catcher In The Rye to 10th graders and beyond because it can relate to some people who have gone through similar situations  Both boys and girls would like this book  I give it a five out of five stars  As far as I can tell  this book is about the internal struggles of an adolescent boy  This book takes us on the journey of a boy named Holden through his later teen years and the choices he faces while trying to find his place in the world  There wasn t much of a plot or even an ending but the way the author described the thoughts and opinions of Holden  I found myself laughing out loud more than once and really enjoyed reading how this young man thinks and speaks  I think we all can relate to the uncertainty of the future and how the choices me make now can change everything  I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to others  For being a classic  this was a very quick and easy read   I chose this book for an AP English assignment and I have never before had so much fun giving a presentation about this book  I ll admit that at first I couldn t quite discern what the plot was leading to or from  but as it went along  I became closer with Holden  the narrator  and started to feel sympathy for his general circumstances  I thoroughly enjoyed it  though I recognize that it s not something everyone can and should read   The Catcher in the Rye is a great piece of 20th century literature  but there is a 50  chance it will grab you like it did me  It takes a particular personality  mindset  or attitude to properly connect with Holden Caulfield  Some of you will find him annoying and whiny  while the rest will think  Oh my god this is me   Catcher is a fantastic book if you happen to connect with it  It draws you in at the beginning and brings you along an interesting storyline that has an unpredictable ending  By the end of the book though  you will be questioning yourself as to whether the mindset you currently have is the right one  This book is a great way to learn from the mistakes of others  J D  Salinger really creates a person you can connect with  but shows us why that may not be such a great thing  I love this book  10 out of 10  Don t be a phony  Read The Catcher in the Rye now  I love this book more every time I read it  Os alunos americanos tem tanta sorte por poderem estudar este livro nas aulas  Quem me dera ter estudado  Uma agulha no palheiro  quando frequentei o secundario  Ok  por aqui ja percebem que gostei do livro Holden Caulfield e quem nos vai narrar a sua propria historia  Comeca entao quando ele acaba de ser expulso de Pencey  que e a escola que frequentava  pouco antes das ferias de natal  Como nao quer voltar ja para casa e ter de lidar com a furia dos pais  pois nao era a primeira vez que era expulso da escola   decide ir para Nova Iorque  onde mora  e vaguear pela cidade  Durante esses tres dias que fica na cidade  vai viver varia situacoes e meter se em alguns problemas  mas sempre reflectindo sobre ele proprio e os outros  O livro e em primeira pessoa mas escrito de forma a que pareca uma conversa entre o leitor e o protagonista  Ele vai nos pondo a par da sua historia  como o seu irmao que morreu  e falando sobre a sua familia e todos aqueles que entram na historia seu conhecidos  Nao posso contar muito daquilo que ele vive enquanto esta em Nova Iorque porque nao quero revelar demais  mas e um livro muito interessante e as situacoes em que ele se mete e as suas reaccoes para com elas  ajudam nos a perceber mos ainda mais o seu caracter  Holden nao nos faz querer ser como ele  como muitos protagonistas adolescentes  Tem 16 anos mas ideais muito definidos  Poucos ou nenhuns sao os adultos que nao o facam ficar  varado   expressao que ele usa constantemente   em contrapartida ele adora criancas e a sua ingenuidade para com o mundo  No fundo este livro e uma reflexao sobre como os adultos sao falsos e usam constantemente mascaras para encobrirem o seu verdadeiro ser  enquanto as criancas nao precisam nem usam esses tipos de mecanismos de defesa pois elas sao espontaneas e verdadeiras  Uma das unicas personagens com quem Holden se entende e a sua irma Phoebe que tambem e uma crianca e com quem ele termina o seu relato  Uma das passagens que mais me marcou e que acho que ilustra bem um dos sentidos do livro e a seguinte   Mas o melhor daquele museu era as coisas estarem sempre quietas  Nada se movia  Podiamos ir la cem mil vezes que o esquimo estaria ainda a pescar os dois peixes  os passaros a voarem para o sul  os veados a beberem nas pequenas pocas  com os lindos chifres inclinados e as belas e esguias pernas  A india  com o peito descoberto  la estaria a tecer o cobertor  Nada se modificava  So nos nos modificavamos  Nao digo que fossemos mais velhos  isso nao  Seriamos apenas diferentes  mais nada    pag 140   First thing I wanna say is that this is a hellavu goddamn book  I mean a hellavu good one  I m not talkin straight old Shakespearean or nothin  but I m talkin damn good anyways  J D Salinger sure as hell knows how to write according to the mindset of a high school dropout  I m talkin   that old bastard sure knows what he s sayin   It sure depresses me though  all that talk about bein  lonely and whatnot  I sure feel pretty goddamn sore about that Holden character and all the bad stuff that happens to  im  I sure as hell am glad though he brought in old Phoebe  she s a hellavu character that one  Perfect emotional relief and all  I m talkin  perfect  Anyways  hellavu depressing book and all  but goddamn amazing writing  That old Salinger sure knows   I read this book in my English class last year  My teacher was Mr  Smith and reading a book with Mr  Smith is so fun  His discussions reveal alot of criteria behind the literature  But  anyways back to topic  I love love love this book  It s a mixture between young adult literature and an attempted memoir of a fictional character  Holden Caulfied s tactics are so realistic that you can draw his name and personality to any subject in the world and it would demonstrate one another perfectly  I d reccomend this book to anyone whose looking for a source to relate to because Holden Caulfied brings out a young  brooding point of view of the world   Holden Caulfeild is an angsty 16 year old boy living at Pencey Prep in Pennsylvania  He gets kicked out for failing almost all his classes and decides to head back to New York where he has a series of increasingly misguided encounters with people who each represent something to him  Eventually he finds a release from his problems through his sister Phoebe  Holden was a very intense charecter but he was also very likeable  He had a continuous stream of witty commentary and insightful thoughts  The way Salinger wrote  him  we get a perfect glimpse into the mind on a troubled teen  He entertained me and made me sad when he was  establishing an emphatic connection between reader and character  The faults that we can see blend together into a natural personality that fits  There are very few characters out there who could have such complexity and insight as Holden Other than Holden  Salinger crafts a tale of the unfortunate you who are misunderstood and wronged because of their differing viewpoints that are contrary to the adult normal  The book is a great lesson in acceptance and acceptance of change  Salinger confronts the hard points of the topics and handles them expertly   Loved it  I loved Holden  too  Maybe I m supposed to hate him  but I didn t   Part of the joy of reading a novel comes from stepping outside of your day to day life and slipping into the mind of someone else  For just a tiny sliver of a moment  real life no longer matters as you are whisked away to a world of wonder and intrigue  Without even leaving the safety of your bedroom  you can explore the crowded streets of New York with aplomb or stare out beyond the edge of the Abyss with a fetterless defiance  I would argue that there is no better outlet for the imaginative mind  movies and video games and drawings can t even begin to compare with the infinite vastness of the written page  It s why books are timeless  it s also why they have endured for so long and why they will continue to endure long after you and I are long gone from the world A good book will hook you  absorb you  and keep you mostly interested  but a great book can go much further than that  A great book can help you decide what kind of person you are  or what kind of person you want to become  It can make you put some distance between your mind and your body  and you can ask yourself things like  Am I this person  Is this what I m supposed to be   A great book can transform you into a better  moar enlightened  moar attractive individual  It can imbue you with self confidence  It can broaden your world view  It can teach you to love  It can teach you to hate  It can teach you to become someone else entirely The Catcher in the Rye is a great book  though it may not be immediately apparent on the surface  It tells a basic story from the perspective of an insufferable nitwit named Holden Caulfield  who decides to bum around New York City for a few days after getting expelled from school  He is a kid that has a lot of baggage in that he hates pretty much everything and everyone  constantly makes unfounded and unwarranted judgments about people that suggests a sophisticated lack of immaturity  and has the gall to wonder why people don t want to listen to him  It is a book in which hardly anything happens  but also in which a lot of things happen  and it can be quite difficult to sit through if you find yourself unwilling  unprepared  or unable to analyze its nuances with any sort of depth Like many great literary works  it doesn t spend much time establishing every minute detail of the scenery  It opts instead to carefully select just the right words and just the right tone of voice to keep the reader engaged  While visuals certainly exist  they are largely subdued in service of staying grounded inside this kid s head  It s an interesting risk to take  in today s visual hungry culture  a novel without much in the way of important and obvious visual cues seems very counterintuitive  But J D  Salinger sets the stage not within the boundaries of the outside world  but within the trappings of Holden Caulfield s mind  Rather than walking beside him as he crosses the street to the Museum of Natural History  we are that person who is walking across the street to the Museum of Natural History  We are that confused adolescentish boy who is perhaps afraid of growing into a man  who can t believe that people exist who are going about their lives completely ignorant of the fact we exist at all or that the world is filled with all these phonies too phony to sit down and have an intelligent conversation about where all the ducks go in the winter time  We become him  in a way To read this novel and NOT be frustrated seems completely unnatural  if you ask me  Caulfield really is an insufferable twerp  even before his various cringe worthy moments that throw an empathetic bone to his situation  Nonetheless  drastic changes to his personality definitely don t occur overnight and he is prone to remain just as pathetic as he was prior to leaving school even well after the story concludes and just as liable to make the same mistakes over and over again  And yet  there is a persistent sliver of hope that things will eventually work out for the kid  that he ll get his shit together  and maybe mend some terribly broken bridges along the way There is a little Holden Caulfield present in all of us  I think  and how we deal with him is an important capstone in defining who we are and who we will grow up to be  Will we accept the fact that we are no longer children and go out into the brave new world with a resolve to make it  and ourselves  better  Or will we withdraw into the realms of our own minds  portraying the world as lousy and phony and not up to our standards  If the latter is the case  should we be bothered to make a change  Is it even a problem at all  Whatever makes us happy and content  right A great book will do more than just tell us a good story  A great book will help us ask the questions we may forget to teach ourselves  even if it doesn t try to offer any of the answers  We may realize that life has a lot more to offer than merely the innocence of youth or the complacency of adulthood  that maybe those two things can coexist comfortably in the middle  And then we can effectively step outside of ourselves  seeing assets and flaws objectively enough to become the people that we want to be  though not necessarily the people we are meant to be  Or maybe we all could just get ourselves a Phoebe  She is super adorable and if you don t let out a huge  awwwwwwwwwwww     when she shows up then you re not a real human   Whenever anyone asks me  What s your favorite book of all time   I always say   The Catcher in the Rye   by J D Salinger  because it s the only book I can read over and over again with as much enthusiasm as when I first picked it up I don t know if it s just the nature of the story  or my own inner workings  but every time I read it I discover something different  This time I noticed how desperate the main character  Holden Caulfield  was as the people he admired let him down and how disappointed he was with himself when he blew it  He just couldn t seem to get it together no matter how hard he tried  For some reason  I never realized before that Holden was recounting his journey of the days that led up to his current situation with a therapist in a California  rest home  and when I did  the tale took on a new meaning for me  I m not sure I would call him tragic  even though he does have the same qualities as Hamlet and Jay Gatsby  but I do see him as cautiously wise and a little bit too jaded for his own good Satisfying and brilliant  The Catcher in the Rye  remains a classic I will continue to pick up and re read in the future  Ach  Holden  Preco si sa mi musel dostat az takto pod kozu  Nemam vo zvyku pisat recenzie  ale dovolim si tentokrat taku mensiu napisat  Mozem hrdo prehlasit  ze som sa do knizky zamilovala  Styl pisania autora je neskutocny a este stale nechapem  ako sa mu podarilo napisat taketo veldielo  Holden je perfektne vykresleny  nie je ako mnohi tinedzeri v knihach  Je ako VY  Straca sa vo svete plnom pretvarky a krutosti  kde vladnu dospeli  I ked mnoho raz pada  nevzdava sa ako ini  Proste vstane a ide dalej Myslienky v tejto knihe su az zazracne  A ked sa nad nimi zamyslite  zistite  co vsetko ste prehliadli  co malo byt vasim ociam na prvom mieste  Myslienka a teda aj nazov knihy je az nadpozemska  Cely cas som cakala na vysvetlenie nazvu knihy a ked sa to dostavilo  knizku som musela na chvilku odlozit  Donuti vas to zamysliet sa  Hovori sa  ze ludia sa delia na tych  co Holdena miluju a na tych  co ho neznasaju Myslim  ze ti  co ho nenavidia  knizku citali v tom nespravnom case  Ako aj sam Holden hovori    You have to be in mood  Takze ak otalate nad citanim tohto  aspon pre mna  veldiela  neotalajte  What can I say  I was completely taken in by this book  Never did I think it would enrapture me so  it took me completely by surprise  I believe I read this book at the right age and the right time of my life  I could totally relate to Holden and the issues and struggles he faces throughout the book  The writing is very good  even though a lot of slang is used  although that s because it s told in first person   I d thoroughly recommend this to anyone who is in need of an amazing read  and a short one at that   JD Salinger  one of America s writing elite  is behind the mind of Holden Caulfield  a boy who has just been expelled from Pencey Prep  Fortunately for Holden  he is used to expulsion  as he has bounced around a few other east coast academies  The novel follows Holden on his journey from Pencey in Pennsylvania to New York City  He tells of his encounters with pimps and prostitutes  as well as loneliness and liquor  He also visits his broken family  and on his trip  makes realizations about himself as a boy becoming a man  and of the society around him  Holden s realizations seem to connect to many  which is the reason the book has gained so much acclaim  The novel does so much to shock the reader  and bring them to reality  Salinger does so well to promote Holden  despite his obvious inadequacies  Holden is made to be a hypocrite and liar  but the reader will never find themselves not in his support  This is the genius of Salinger  and the genius behind one of the greatest novels you are likely to read   This book was beautiful  I loved the non stop flow of thoughts and ideas that come from Holden  The way this book was written is similar to the way I think and the way I feel I would write if were to write  For most of this book I was wondering when the point of the book would come  I mean I was enjoying the ride  but I was waiting for that moment when an author shows you what they want for you to take away  But that never happened to me  not until after I sat and reflected on the book  And that was so wonderful to me  To just be able to read thoughts and ideas all the way through before being faced with a specific theme or meaning  I think that s why I loved this book so much  It wasn t predictable in any way  It was like taking a leisurely walk  This book was not allowed in the curriculum of our Texas public school  I read it shortly after I completed my undergrad degree and both the story and character touched me deeply  I had been Holden Caulfield  as an insufferable adolescent  To see that my experience was somehow universal was life changing for me and it was the first time I can remember applying the skill of  thinking about my thinking  For many years the lack of this book at L D  Bell H S  was one more justification for my disrespect  until it occurred to me that it was probably a good thing  It is doubtful that any of my teachers could have intelligently supported the reading of such a work by teenagers  A lot of people would probably mark this novel as overrated but this is actually one of my favorites  Plot wise  yes  it s shitty and rough and boring  It can even perhaps be considered an accomplishment to finish it at all  But I just really love Holden  The Ultimate Hater of All Time  Caulfield so much because fictional characters have never been this real  Being a satirical figure who embodied the human hatefulness  commonplaceness  insecurities  laziness  disillusionment and and so on  Holden is either deeply loved or intensely hated  He s basically that guy your mom tells you to stay away from  That s fair enough since he s not exactly a straight A guy  I mean  he wants to catch children from falling off the rye field for a living and that isn t very promising  is it    He also has a sailor s mouth that eats infinite platters of hates for breakfast  But if there s one thing I ve learned from literature it s to always pay attention to the guy in the funny hat  So Holden is not the perfect gentleman     he doesn t even know what to do with his days what more his life  he hates social pleasantries and he thinks everybody s a phony  But isn t he right  though  Aren t we all just that  I know I am Naturally Holden is tired of everybody s shit and if he could  he would very much like to preserve the children s innocence before they grow up and turn into the things that he is now disgusted by  But in the end  he came to accept that  sometimes  you just have to let them fall   You just gotta let them make their own mistakes  sculpt their own masks  lick their own wounds and grow up  I get sentimental about things like that     coming of age  adulthood  growing up and the passage of time while accumulating experiences  memories and scars along the way  Maybe that s why Holden Caulfield s one of my favorite literary heroes  I loved his journey from hardcore negativity to hopeful conformity  It s realistic  but the sad kind  A little imposing  yes  but wise   All the two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee  That depressed me  I hate it if I m eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee   I hope you guys can get something enlightening from the quote I cited from this book  Yes  meet Holden Caulfield  a poor little rich boy with a lot of attitude and lot of dated profanity  All I can say from what he said about the nuns he met is he really does have generousity attitude  He feels guilty about being a rich kid  It can be seen from his explanation about his possession of Mark Cross suitcases and the mentioned job of his dad  who is a corporation lawyer  And  he also bounces between expensive boarding schools  which is not cheap He really is a nice guy  This book basically speaks about himself  with first person of pov  Holden himself  This book is then used by him as his journal which tells about all this madman stuff that happened to him around last Christmas  the story begins on December   Right when I reached the first page  about him telling us about his another ax  read  kicked out  for failing all his classes except English  I can sense journal ly thing from this book  Salinger is an accomplished author  but this book clearly shows a 17 year old boy s kind of writing style  Holden clearly speaks as a 17 year old boy who suffers from disappointment that he gets from phonies and hyenas  It is like he is speaking directly to all of us  which makes me feel some of his writing truly represents what is also in my mind  when I positioned myself as a 17 year old girl  Boy  this book is so meaningful and far away from corny As for the title  the first mention I get of this mysterious catvher is when he overhears a little kid singing  If a body catch a body coming through the rye   It makes him feel mot too depressed  because he thinks this kid is singing little kids  song   Until in several chapters later he shares a new fact about it  This is whe his sister corrects him  first of all  it is  if a body meet a body   second  it is not a song  it is a poem by Robert Burns  1796  So I googled the poem  And here it is  Coming thro  the Rye   1796 Coming thro  the rye  poor body  Coming thro  the rye  She draiglet a  her petticoatieComing thro  the rye O  Jenny s a  wat  poor body  Jenny s seldom dry  She draiglet a  her petticoatieComing thro  the rye Gin a body meet a bodyComing thro  the rye  Gin a body kiss a body  Need a body cry Gin a body meet a bodyComing thro  the glen  Gin a body kiss a body  Need the warld ken And I also googled the Scottish dialect like the gin for when  draiglet for drags  wat for wet  and ken for know until I gasped myself to understand the poem All I can say is this Jenny is out in the rye with a wet body  She was dragging her petticoat  and she  meets   has sex with   someone  Does she need to cry or get emotional about it  losing her virginity   Or does the world need tk know about it  If it doesn t  then casual sex is fine And I was like holy sh t The title is more like telling us about casual sex  which is agreeable and understandable  Holden is worried esp when he overhears a little kid singing the song  That is why he wants to be the catcher in the rye  to catch all of those kids playing in the rye  I loved this book  Holden had me cracking up so many times and then got me emotional at others  He seemed like such a simple character at the beginning  but his life is complex and tragic at times  You get to piece it together through little memories he tells  and the way they come up is so natural and effortless  The only negative was way too much swearing  specifically taking the name of the Lord in vain  But honestly  removing the bad language would have altered the book too much   if you don t like this book you re just a phony I guess the first thing that comes to mind for this review is that I wish I would have read this book in adolescence  so as to see how my perception of the book  along with my own thoughts and attitudes about life  may have changed with a second reading in adulthood  I am remiss  Holden is an unreliable narrator  prompting me to consider who really is a reliable narrator when it comes to their own life  If one was able to keep a true longitudinal diary of one s paradigms of the world  and let s face it  no one ever really does this because they do not expect  and cannot anticipate when or how  the paradigm will shift or change   we could see  point for point  the effect of time and life experience on perception  how our biases warp how we see  In the absence of that  we have this text  a short book considering the amount of time that went into its construction  that forces us to see how our own perceptions have changed upon transitioning from childhood to adulthood  how unreliable of a narrator we each are in our own lives  I don t think that Holden is cynical or that he is as unidimensional  ie   mentally ill  as some would have us read him  As he goes through an impromptu transition from life as a kid to one as an independent person  a transition prompted by having to deal with some life experiences that shove you  unexpectedly  out of the childhood bubble   I read him as a generally good guy who is  in the best way he can figure  dealing with the complex emotions that come from reconciling divergent thoughts and feelings about people who aren t iconically  good versus bad  but all shades in between  recovering from the loss of his classmate so gruesomely and without rabsolution  redefining life in a world that does not include his closest sibling following prolonged illness  and exploring adult constructs and contexts to look for answers to these questions  questions that don t fit in a child s world At his core  the character is human in the most ubiquitous way possible  navigating the overwhelming transition point between the dichotomous modes of life that every person typically experiences  There s much more to this text than I can explore in my free time  so I will end in saying that I greatly enjoyed the  cud I chewed  while reading this book  I enjoyed the book  simply for enjoyment s sake  Why it s such a cult classic and has such an extreme cult following  I don t quite understand  But  I am a sucker for self depreciation in books as well as some deep internal reflection    Books like that speak to me since I am so deeply analytical  This book was no exception  I think everyone should probably read this story once  if only to be able to participate in discussions when the topic arises  I was 14 when I read this book  my older brother had read it for school and liked it so much  I decided to read it too  this is my absolute favorite book  Ten years later  I have read it over five times  Each time is familiar and warm  but also new and I take something else away from it  I am female  I ve never been at boarding school or wealthy  My life was not and has never been like Holden s in those major ways and yet  I felt mostly like I was him  or on this journey with him  Being in the first person  you are reading his thoughts  his words  his actions  And his thoughts are constant and raw and full of so much emotion and it is impossible to not become part of his mind   You are on this adventure with him  as him  maybe both  If youre like me and so many others you may forever remember Holden as your friend  as someone who understood  Someone who might have changed your life at least a little if not a lot and maybe for forever especially if you read it as a teenager  I think everyone in high school should read this book  Although fictional  that never crosses my mind when I read or think about this book  To me  the impression it made on me made is as real as anything I wasn t too sure when I first read it  unlike any other kind of book  this book filled me with so much feelings  I could relate very much to Holden  the main protagonist of the book and often I find myself feeling exactly how he felt  I was looking foward all the time to what s the title all about and when I finally did I completely felt amused by it   Books can be your best friends at times  they can really do  Thank you Holden for being with me for a while  I will not forget you and I will come back when I feel lost and lonely  is that OK The end of the book really moved me  I started crying  I don t know why    A little girl in a blue coat suddenly became a symbol of simple happiness  of fleeting moments in time that are our ultimate destination  I enjoyed the whole book indeed as well  Made me smile a number of times  I liked the way Holden perceives the world and exposes all that he thinks and what is not necessarily said aloud  This aspect of the book was really liberating  My favorite quotes   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody    I am always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though    That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are  Girls  Jesus Christ  They can drive you crazy  They really can    People never notice anything    Almost every time somebody gives me a present  it ends up making me sad    I was left puzzled after reading the book  which isn t surprising  It s quite a confused book  Having digested it a little though  I do believe it s excellent  The things I loved are exactly the ones which annoy some other reviewers    No visible plot  The main character sort of lives his days  doing stupid things and fretting about them  I found that very charming    The silly teenage language from the late 40 es   early 50 es  It annoyed me at first  but then I enjoyed it    The whiny narrative  Yep  it was a bit over the top whiny  but I thought it was compensated by the inspired passages that were observant and kind  In fact  the narrative left me feeling the guy may have loved the people he claimed to  hate     The repetitiveness of some key themes and thoughts  I found it very natural  Separately  the characterization was breathtaking  I thought  Maybe Salinger was doing a bit too much of it  e g  characterizing the taxi drivers and random kids in the museum   but I could feel he was having fun with it and it did come out very well  Maybe it s just me  I love the non linear  honest stories like this  that don t drive a specific  plot   but rather explore a person  The Short To sum up my feelings about this book in three words  I loved it  This is one of the best books I have ever read  and I was so entertained by Holden  and his mentality  So good The Good Like I said before  Holden was absolutely hilarious  Whenever he said that he was doing something   like a bastard  I died laughing  His overall outlook on things is very negative  and I really found it entertaining  Also  I think I am Holden Caulfield  so I can t really say anything bad about him without insulting myself too  And honestly  that would be pretty phony of me The book was so fast  It literally took place over like two or three days  but it felt like it was a month  I loved it I m just going to be vain for a second  and say that I LOVED HOLDEN S HAT I just loved the direction that the story moved in  It was really what I wanted to happen  and honestly for Holden s development as a character and as a person  it needed to take that direction  All the symbols  and themes  and metaphors  and all the other literally devices really killed me  The Bad That ending really killed me  It wasn t satisfying enough for me  He is happy  then boom its over  And he mentions that stuff went down  but he doesn t explain  and I m like  BB Plz gimme moar  Phoebe was so annoying  I just couldn t handle when she was around  and I just thought her overall demeanor  while she was somewhat close to Holden  was annoying   I remembered the first time I saw the rendition of The Catcher in the Rye  I was infuriated  Either Holden or Salinger would like the slang  Fucking this world  to use it as front  In chapter 25  when Holden was waiting Phoebe outside the museum  he saw a  fuck you  on the wall   It drove me damn near crazy  I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kid would see it  and finally some dirty kid would tell them   all cockeyed  naturally   what it meant  and how they d all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days   It was against the writer s wish and got a prejudice of the readers  I set the first one upside down  hoping that would help a little  at least to my heart It was actually the first English novel that I ever read  I was wandering at the bookstore and the angry red pong cover jumped over to my face  I decided to give it a try  I was full of emotion after reading it  I thought the character speak for my voice  stand for my position  Maybe that s because he has a sister and I have a sister  Although living in an image driven world  I can hardly consider myself wearing a red hunting hat and a cigarette in the corner of my mouse  But the same longing for innocence  craving for ideal world  our insight was the same  At college  I attended a literary class held by Mr  Luo Yi Jun  From his point of view  Holden was having a enlightened journey  The time he saw old Phoebe kept going around the carousel  he became a mature man  He knew he can be the catcher in the rye because  the thing with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   He said he really liked the character  Phoebe  She comforted his older brother in a naive way sometimes it penetrated Holden s heart and the people who was reading it  I can t agree more  To be continued John Green s summary of Catcher  http   www youtube com watch v LI1Cus     Hilarious  I don t think any book has ever made me laugh out loud so much  If you can make it past the colorful language  the main character really has a genuinely good heart beneath that rough  grouchy exterior  Love it   Or rather the painful acceptance   that reality and ideals are on different plans There is a Holden Caulfield in each of us  Sailinger had the courage to look at the bottom of the despair that is the despair of anyone who needs to grow up and come to terms with the world   So  I have obviously read this book before  More than once  But it had been a really long time and since I go through some sort of thing where I read all the Glass stories once about every five years I thought it was time to give old Holden another go  And  I have to say  I definitely got something new out of it  I m no longer a member of disillusioned youth  but I remember how it felt pretty damn well and that held up  But from my removed point of view there were a lot of sections in the beginning where I have laughing hysterically  Seriously  Holden Caulfield is really funny  But then as I kept going I started to get kind of extremely sad  because hating everything is pretty depressing  and unlike in Franny and Zooey the only real voice of reason is a ten year old girl  And  oh Phoebe  you remain as lovely as always  Please try to get your brother to apply himself  someday he will regret it if he doesn t   It was a good book  It really was  Well  when I first read this book I was in high school  I absolutely hated it beyond belief  I did not think there was a book I hated more  Why  because I thought Holden was just a little whiney brat that nothing could make him happy  Now  around 4 5 years later I reread it  Boy am I glad I did  I loved it  I actually loved Holden too  and even admitting that kills me inside a bit because I once bad mouthed him more than I have anyone  He is a definition of a teenager and what they tend to be  lost souls  He was a real person  now you are probably going to say is not everyone a real person  Which I will answer  hell no  As Holden would say there are a lot of phonies  He is true  maybe for too much for his own good but its a beautiful trait  The story does not really even have that much going on  Just a young boy spending a couple nights in New York City  Yet it has so much depth  and lessons in it  He shows you some facts that have made Holden the way he is  For instance he still recalls himself not taking Allie to shoot bb guns so he recreates the situation  Loss can wreck someones life  He is still recovering from it  I was trying to think of my favorite part  I was debating between the carousel or the winner  when he was talking about the job he wanted  Just being a simple catcher in the rye         I needed to add this book to my collection  I will reread this book every now and again  100 100 My oldest son was surprised to hear that J D  Salinger fought in World War II  He thinks of Holden Caulfield as a contemporary  a peer  anachronistically making his way through a few days of life  The period references in the novel are like props on a movie set  no more real than the phonies Holden encounters  It s perplexing that so many of my son s classmates felt no connection to Holden after reading The Catcher in the Rye  We are told on TV  on the internet and in movies that our teenagers and young adults are increasingly savvy  mature and perceptive  When it comes to technology  they certainly are  But most of the students in the class considered Holden a whiny freak without realizing that often  it s the whiny freaks who walk through life with the clarity of sight and earnestness needed to leave this existence a little better than it was when we entered it  The story itself is a masterpiece  Salinger was firing on all cylinders and tapping into the strange other worldly literary omnipotence we usually attribute to Shakespeare when he wrote Catcher  It s interesting to wonder whether he was even aware of everything he was doing in the book or if he was like a pro athelete who enters  the zone  and emerges at the end of the game a puzzled hero  Every time one of Holden s apologists dies  as his creator did almost three years ago  a piece of Holden dies with them  Fortunately  he is as viral as one of my son s favorite You Tube videos  When we follow his exploits  Holden s DNA intertwines with our own and is propagated in everything we say and do  Fortunately  he will never completely die  but will continue to confound those who think him merely a whiny freak   At first I couldn t understand why this novel is so famous  After reading it  I felt something touched my heart  I like this book The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one When you look back  you will find that lots of people are good to you  you will miss everyone even the ones you might hate  Ugh  I had forgotten JUST how amazing Salinger is  His story comes across with such clarity and directness  one is tempted to imagine that the writing was effortless  I wish authors like Robert Jordan  Brandon Sanderson  and George R  R  Martin would read this once a year  Salinger is all about quality over quantity Reading this  my heart hurts for poor Holden  It s clear that he is struggling with something that he  himself  does not fully understand  Mr  Antolini tries to help him see this  but Holden is clearly too young to grasp what he is hearing I can t say that I really identify with Holden  but I have known people who struggle with his same frustrations  Salinger does an incredible job of faithfully presenting the human condition in its darker  more troubling aspects  Still awesome after my third time reading it   Do you ever stare at a tree for seemingly perpetual hours and wait as all the silence of this world fill up the void you hesitantly feel within  Do you hear the murmuring of leaves as someone stomps on them in your fragile heart  Do you ever converse with someone dwelling in the long past  in your most overwhelming dream  And as your weary eyes look around  do you search at all for something you once lost  but can t really remember  Holden Caulfield does  And don t we all The Catcher In The Rye is the novel of an antihero s disaffected youth  Holden Caulfield  16   a recent dropout  terrified to go home  roams around New York city  As he contemplates his transition from adolescence to adulthood  his life in a dilemma stands before a puzzle  Part of him wishes he didn t have to exist  The psychological battles of Holden serve as the basis for this novel  And as he goes around the city for 3 days  he gives the readers an honest peek into the bewildering world of an adolescent  To this date  What do I wish that I could have saved and protected  I would say   Innocence   As I grew up  a part of me died so flawlessly as if it never actually existed  I no more enjoyed the rainbow or the lullabies  Fairies got butchered and I started asking more for sweet ignorance  Rhymes that I once memorized  games that I once played  riddles that I didn t quite understand  all of it started seeming like a distant dream I someday peacefully had  Now my faith is shaken and I hold dear only my fragile existence as the comfort against the cold world  And every now and then I wonder  If some day I can leave everything I possess and go to my glorious days again  And I know  Holden Caulfield would have gone back too if only he could have   I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them   That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   Holden wants to protect this innocence of childhood from corruption and the bliss of not knowing  He wants to catch the kids before they fall and change forever like he has  He wants them to remain beautiful and silly like a treasured dream  He wants to keep the magic veiled  all the tricks unknown  before someone else grows up and catches the magician But we all catch the magician someday  don t we  Easily in my top 3 books of all time  Why didn t I read this sooner so I could have re read it for the hundredth time At first Holden is such a strange character and then you just fall in love with him   the things he says   i was constantly underlining passages from the book  I could have easily underlined the whole thing  Including the title  It s such a powerful book as well  It s funny and it seems like it s almost about nothing   it s about an annoyed teenager being expelled from school and then you learn about the loneliness somewhere in between the lines  The solitude is very present yet hidden  And it s so smart  I wish i could be sitting somewhere with Mr Salinger  far away from people and we would be not talking just enjoying the quiet and that would make me so happy  Some of my favourite quotes What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though    I don t give a damn  except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age  Sometimes I act a lot older than I am   I really do   but people never notice it  People never notice anything    I was half in love with her by the time we sat down  That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall half in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are  Girls  Jesus Christ  They can drive you crazy  They really can   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive  in fact  I thought what I d do was  I d pretend I was one of those deaf mutes  That way I wouldn t have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody  If anybody wanted to tell me something  they d have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me  They d get bored as hell doing that after a while  and then I d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life  Everybody d think I was just a poor deaf mute bastard and they d leave me alone  I have an impression that there can be two possible perceptions of the the writing style in  The Cather     you either do not perceive it from the first line or you find a very strong connection with it  There cannot be in between attitudes  It is not surprising that the book has been banned several times  and debates regarding it being American classic still arise To begin with  I can completely see the point of the reviewers who find the book extremely boring and the language highly clumsy  Indeed   The Cather     is not an action or suspence narration   the whole novel of almost 300 pages covers a story of just three day period  and and there is nothing particularly extraordinary about these three days  Yes  the language is rough  primitive and is full of almost swearing phrases  But taking into account that the narrator of the story is Holden Caulfield himself  it is not more uneven and sketchy than the feelings and the thoughts of this controversial and complicated 17 year old protagonist  I would be surprised if J D Salinger granted Holden philosophical epithets  coherent thoughts and speech For me  it just clicked  From the first paragraph  It was read with ease  in one breath  and not for a moment has it felt boring or overextended  vice versa  it was interesting to  get into the head  of the main character  I believed every single detail described and every single word said  Not many fiction books are able to leave a sense that everything described is not just an artificially created world  And for the one that do  I cannot give the the ranking other than the highest one  Would I call it an American classic  Yes  I definitely would  Holden s character  spiritually and morally exhausted at this very young age  so deeply alone and hateful towards almost everyone and everything around  is very representative for his generation  The way D J Salinger reveals the nature of his character is definitely different from the Dostoyevsky s deep psychological analysis  the one we are used to comprehend as classic  of his complicated protagonists  Yet  it feels very organic in the view of its time  place  and Holden s personality  I could not keep myself from giving special credits for an awesome  iconic  depiction of the parks  museums and streets of 1950s New York City   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though      J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the RyeI felt like I would wish Jerome Salinger to be a terrific friend of mine whom I could call up  This book is about a boy  on the brink of breakdown  speaking of things that make so much sense  Sixteen year  old junior Holden Caulfield is rebellious in that he wants to defy the hypocrisy of the grown world  He is restless  has failed out of four schools and holds a scar of his brother s death  He alienates himself from the world and is extremely judgmental of everybody that it is almost funny  It s really just his blindness of not wanting to understand the world olden s relationship with his sister is so charming and kind  that it is easy to overlook his faults  It shows that despite being an unreliable narrator  who has a compulsion to lie and be judgmental  he has a genuine love for his sister and her wellbeing  He wants to protect her from the ugliness in the world   An amazing coming of age book   it describes the most crucial problem of them all  that of growing up and wanting to stay the way you are  when there is a world out there trying to fit all of us into a single sized box  There is a Holden Caulfield in some of us  and I for one  am still trying to fathom whether that means I am singularly unfortunate or extremely blessed  khfyh tnh chnd SfHh z yn khtb rw bkhwnyd t shyfth y nHwh rwyt w flsfh bfy yn nwjwn srtq bshyd w wn wqth khh rh khrdn khtb brtwn khr skhty khwhd bwd rwy dstn  hwldn

khrdh y ny  hwldn  myzdm This book is just fantastic  If you want a really good classic  this is definitly one of my favorites  The author is fantastic  My english teacher introduced the book to me  The book begins at a prep school known as  Pencey Prep   the main character in the novel  Holden goes there  In the story he mentions that he ended up missing the football game because he had to cart around the fencing teams things  because he was the manager   He manages to somehow lose the equiptment and then goes to see his history teacher to say goodbye  He goes to tell him hes been expelled and cant return after Christmas break  He returns to his dorm and puts on his red hunting cap and his neighbor Ackely disterbs him while hes reading  They basically have a huge argument and holdon leaves and dosnt look back  There is alot that goes on in this novel aside from this  Holden is one heck of a kid  The way he talks makes him a extreamly lovable character READ IT   This is a timeless novel  Although it was written decades ago  Holden s trials and doubts still hold true  Salinger truly succeeded in this novel by capturing the true experience one feels when they are lost and feel alone and isolated from the world  By offering interesting characters and clashing dynamics  such as the one between Holden and his sister Phoebe  The Cather in the Rye creates a world that is real  a world that anyone from any culture or age group can relate to and understand  In no way is this novel a cookie cutter love story like many of its peers at the time of its publishing  No  rather  The Cather in the Rye presents life in less than idyllic circumstances  Thus  this will always be one of my all time favorite novels  The Catcher in the Rye  A book that captures teenage alienation in a way no other has before starts with a seventeen year old boy  Holden Caulfield  in an undisclosed  crumby place  not too far from Hollywood  Los Angeles  California  where his brother  one who visits him practically every week  lives  There are those who assume he s in a psychiatric hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown  Others swear he s in a tuberculosis sanatorium because he was so sick when he neared the end of his recount  No one knows for certain where he is  and quite frankly  no one cares  When given the chance to look back to the beginning of the book  those who finish The Catcher in the Rye  who have compassion for Holden  and who care about his plight are simply relieved to know he s not killed himself and or gotten killed and is receiving the help he very obviously needs Regardless of where he is or why he s there  Holden cynically   endearingly   narrates his story  beginning when he s at Pencey Prep in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  a fictional town believed to be near Wayne  Pennsylvania  At sixteen  over six feet tall  partially grey  extremely thin  and out of shape  he s been kicked out of his boarding school for not applying himself  With his retelling  it s apparent he s having trouble dealing with his past  his future  and his need to admit his failure to his absent and unforgiving parents  Even though they are inattentive  his parents have expectations of their son  and Holden knows his father will be disappointed once again After leaving Agerstown in the middle of the night via a train and upon arriving at Penn Station  Holden does everything he can to stay away from his parents  apartment    to catch up with old friends flames    to act as if he s already a grown up who lives on his own and answers to no one  While in New York and living in a hotel  he spirals down   mentally  physically  and emotionally   until he has a breakdown while watching Phoebe  his sweet  innocent sister  ride a carousel while living in a world filled with all of the terrible things he wants to protect her from In a depressed and haunting manner  Holden frequently reminds readers that he can never forget Allie  his younger brother whose tragic and premature death from leukemia three years before  has changed him forever  Based on the events disclosed and thoughts shared  Holden realizes he s becoming an adult and will soon be completely responsible for himself and his actions And their ramifications Because this reality both terrifies and depresses him  Holden dreams of becoming the  Catcher in the Rye   someone who stands at the edge of a dangerous cliff and catches children before they fall off  so he can protect young  innocent children from the same fate    from becoming an adult  Logically  he knows that there is nothing he can do for himself or others and that short of dying  like Allie died  everyone becomes an adult  Everything about his reality depresses him in such a way that it s quite nearly palpable for the readers who have invested themselves in his story and the inner turmoil that comes with him The messages deeply embedded within The Catcher in the Rye are numerous  and are ones Holden himself seems to understand as he looks back at his very necessary coming of age adventure  First  he realizes that Phoebe and all other children must be allowed to take risks even when those risks are dangerous  Second  resisting changes   including that of growing older   is resisting life  and resisting life and its changes can lead to misery and madness  After reading some reviews I realize that most people either thought this book was life changing or hated it  I didn t think it was life changing but I totally loved it  I guess it s because I m at a time where I m realizing how many people are phonies  which is pretty much Holden Caulfield s favorite word  and I ve definitely been where he is about getting depressed over the simplest things  but the point where I really figured out I loved this book was when I turned the last page and I realized it was over So if you re on the fence about reading this book  I would say go for it  as long as you don t mind all the cursing   You may think that Holden is a whiny teenager  but remember that you were also once a whiny teenager and the things that he are going through are so real   oh and by the way I find that I enjoy books so much more when you don t look at other people s opinions before you read  This classic tale is  of course  a great story  but also represents a teen losing his innocence as he realizes that the adult world isn t as perfect as he thought  He completely explores New York  doing everything that he thinks a  real  adult would do   view spoiler   The story begins with Holden Caulfield  our narrator  getting expelled from a prestigious boarding school  He then goes through three days of utter misery and depression  showing our reader that adult life is not always as good as it seems   hide spoiler   I can t imagine being older and still not liking The Catcher in the Rye  Then again  I m only twenty  I know that my perspective will surely change due to the effects of varying experience  I don t think that I will ever lose the appreciation for the way Salinger exploit s the ego  The truth that phoniness is something inherent in human nature as it applies to accomplishing something is enduring  no matter the age of the reader  Just because the immediacy of making something of one s self is lost in old age  doesn t mean that an older reader can t reflect on the past and examine how their ego has changed  For example  I have two options for a future life  The first will be influenced by my ego  The second will lack the influence of my ego  In forty years when I am sixty I should be sitting somewhere contemplating the philosophies of Franny and Zooey and The Catcher in the Rye  In scenario one  I will be sitting in a nice leather bound chair in my astute classical library rereading these books how ever people read books in 2049  I will probably say that Holden  Franny  and Zooey were a bunch of whiners and they should probably make something of themselves  I will also have a hinge of uncertainty in my uncanny eyes and wonder what would have been had I not gotten the shinny diploma from some famous school  In scenario two  I will be sitting in a plastic lawn chair drinking a brusky reading the same old tattered copies that I read from back in 2009  I will probably say that Holden  Franny  and Zooey were a bunch of whiners and they should probably wing it and see what happens  I will probably also be watching the old retired man that could have been me driving by in a cushy jag wondering what could have been if I did get the shiny diploma from some famous school  The trick is that I can relate the books of Salinger to the path in life that I have taken based upon the ego I acted on or did not act on  I won t need to make the decision in my sixties because I would probably not need to change too much from that point till I die I know that I am probably going to read this stuff numerous times before my sixties  but the comparison of the older and younger perspectives of these works fascinates me immensely  The older reader is coming from a much different place than the younger reader  For the younger reader  the books are symbols of impending doom and for the older reader  reminders of that impending doom   This is my absolute favorite book because it s the first and only book that I feel has ever expressed the pain of grief so poignantly The whole book is about Allie  Everything comes back to Holden s grief for his brother  Sure  others have probably lost friends and family members and maybe they re sad  but Holden wears his sadness on the outside because he s real  He resents others who don t do the same and resents those who aren t aware of what real suffering feels like  because when you re not aware of it  you re living on a premise of a false truth  That drives him crazy  At the same time  he longs for his childhood when he had an excuse not to be aware  to remain pure and happy and that s why he s the catcher in the rye I lost a close friend as a teenager and I immediately felt isolated from my peers and family because of it  No one seemed to understand and if they did  they refused to talk about it  It drove me crazy  just like it drove Holden insane  Holden wasn t spoiled  He was depressed and he was lonely because he internalized the grief of his brother s death deeply  In my opinion  the grief consumed him  I think the book is a beautiful  poignant story of a boy who prides himself on his awareness of pain  because it s truth  but resents that he has to feel such agony at the same time  Is ignorance of truth the only way to escape pain  Holden doesn t want it to be  but he lacks the tools to find another way   One of my favorites  Maybe I wouldn t enjoy it as much now  but reading this in high school  Holden Caulfield is the quintessential adolescent  He s angsty  emotional  trying on the bravado and swagger of a man  but still sensitive and easily hurt  He wants to do and enjoy adult pleasures  but can t seem to handle the loss of innocence in others This is a book that perfectly captures what it means to grow up  dealing with loneliness  relationships  the  phoniness  of adult life  so true by the way   in my opinion  The best modern bildungsroman  perhaps  I guess it s somewhat debatable if Holden has changed at the end of the novel  but I m generally optimistic about these things   When I first tried this book in 8th grade  I didn t read through because I thought it was very boring  But this time  I realized how well the author depicted the sensitive  confused teenager s strange emotion  and it fascinated me  It was very depressing  but real  I could understand how he felt because I sometimes felt the same way  The novel is unilateral  strange  and honest  and I think that is why this novel is great  Also  I was amused by the way how the author decided the title  Until we get to the climax  we don t know why the title is  the Catcher in the Rye   In fact  this has nothing to do with the story  until when Holden says that he wants to become the catcher in the rye  But the one sentence  is everything  The line explains everything about the character  and that is what the novel is all about  So I was very very impressed by the title    the Catcher in the Rye   I m 14 years old  and we had to read this book in class  Normally  when I read books that are supposed to be a huge deal  I find that they re really not  But with Catcher in the Rye  that was far from the case  Holden  for me  is the most relatable character I ve seen  really  And something else is that he actually GETS it  I mean  I grew up with Harry Potter  That whole series was my childhood  But the thing with that series is that Harry s going to a magic school with his magic friends  and his biggest problems are defeating magical wizards  and that he s too famous  and all that  Not with Holden  That guy was practically my kindred spirit  Honestly  when I finished the book  I was pathetically sad about it  I made a goddam collage of its quotes to vent   The book was certainly full of cursing As I read the comments of other people I came into conclusion that many people didn t like the book In my own opinion the angst shown by Holden was not being used to let other people do what he had done I totally disagree that this book was made to badly portray his own nationality The irony is what really matters and I can really say that this book is maginificent All you need is a sound mind to reflect yourself in him   This book was one of the best books I have ever read  Its about a boy named Holden Caulfield  He just got kicked out of the private school he was going to called Pencey  He has until wednesday because thats when his parents get the letter from the headmaster about his expulsion and also when he needs to leave  After a fight with his room mate though he decided to go early and leaves during the night  He heads out to New York and stays there for three days and three nights  During that time he wanders around thinking and running into or reuniting with people from his past  Most of the people that he meets or thinks about are a bunch of phones and fakes  thats what he thinks anyway  He doesn t know what he s doing half the time and doesn t have any plan for his life  He is one of the best characters you will ever meet  While you are reading you will find yourself wrapped up in the mind of Holden Caulfield  I first read this novel in grade 10 as a requirement for English class  Although I enjoyed it  I don t think I fully grasped Holden s character or the meanings in the novel  so I decided to reread it this summer  I love Holden  He is witty and every time someone mentions the word  phoney  I have an intense feeling of appreciation for Holden s constant use of the word  I think Holden is the original picture of teenage angst  but in a refreshing literary way  that is somehow not whiny or unappreciative  Holden is raw and multidimensional  which makes him excel as a character and narrator  The novel approaches themes such as inability to let go of childhood and impending adulthood  alienation  sexuality and identity with a distinct type of sarcastic grace  Holden is attempting to find himself within his constant criticisms of everyone else  I feel that Holden desires a life so incredible  that he has no clue what he wants  and hates everyone who personifies normalcy  He dismisses many contemporary views of what he should be doing and continuously struggles with himself as a person unwilling to accept the falseness of human behaviour  This book is a great read anytime you want to rediscover Holden and appreciate the critical reflection of society and coming of age   Absolute Favorites  You re going to have to find out where you want to go  And then you ve got to start going there  But immediately  You can t afford to lose a minute  Not you    Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  Many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry       I m not trying to tell you    he said  that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world  It s not so  But I do say that educated and scholarly men  if they re brilliant and creative to begin with  which unfortunately is rarely the case  tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men who are merely brilliant and creative  They tend to express themselves more clearly  and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end  And   most important  nine times out of ten  they have more humility that the unscholarly thinker  Do you follow me at all   People never notice anything    pg 9    People never believe you   pg 37   People are always ruining things for you    pg 87  I told him he didn t even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not   The trouble was  that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch  even if you don t want it to be   This book killed me  It really did  I m glad i went back to reading  thanks  Kaitlin   and discovered this gem  This controversial book centers on the 1st person narration of teenager Holden Caulfield as he deals with his boiling misanthropy and feelings of alienation  rebellion   angst  I disagree that this book is about teenage angst and solely for adolescents  I think it s for anyone who s ever had a itch to break the established rules of society in the way we communicate with each other  I was kind of cheering for Holden at every turn as I m kind of able to relate to how he thinks and how he narrates his own version of  the things we think  but do not say  For conventional book readers  this book may seem  whiny  and  self centered  but i believe most human beings are  I really do  I started this book a week ago and every opportunity I had to read I did so with great anticipation  This book is very well written and has a style specific to the author  Salinger s character  Holden Caulfield  is one of the most unique characters in literature  Through Caulfield  Salinger captures the thoughts of a very twisted and confused adolescent  The world of Holden Caulfield is twisted and perverted  and very seldom does Holden find real happiness  Salinger truly captures an adolescent simply trying to find himself  or simply terrified of his imminent step into adulthood  At times I found myself laughing at Caulfield s twisted observations of the world around him and also found myself interested in Caulfield s almost bi polar personality  The book ends beautifully and really gets at the heart of what I believe Salinger was trying to message to his readers  That is    as we grow in life and face our many challenges  sometimes challenges we bring upon ourselves through poor choices and immature understanding  we often find ourselves finding joy in the memory and innocence of youth  of our own and of others  On three specific occurrences throughout the book  Salinger powerfully captures moments that bring happiness to Caulfield  only to slide back to cycles and thoughts of depression and angst for the world around him  Each of these moments of happiness and peace come as Caulfield is observing children  The end is especially powerful  after a few interesting and tiring days in New York City  trying to avoid his parents and trying to  figure it all out   Caulfield finds himself on a city bench in the pouring rain watching his sister s joy while riding a carousel  When everyone around is running for cover  he finally finds his peace in the innocence and happiness in a life and age that has passed him by  This return to innocence is captured in such a powerful way  To be completely honest I did only get this book because both John Green and Natt Wolf both said it was their favorite book    so I obviously had to buy it  and it blew me away I had absolutely no idea what is was about  Zero  nothing at all  The first thing I noticed was that it was insanly repetitive  like  the narrator  who is also the very amazing protagonist of this novel  HOLDEN  kept saying the same words and expressions all over  and all over again    but that grew on me  That is just the way teenagers speak  We really do It is one of the easiest books I ve read  but in a good way  It s such a great modern classic of american literature  so I feel like you wouln t expect it to be so easy to uderstand  and so damn relatable  That s what s so great about it  It feels like and old pal is telling you a story  and you just get it  you really do  Holden is an increcible character  He seems like the type of guy that I would hate in real life  but it s only because I would never allow myself to really get to know him  like in the book  You know so much about him and it s a really complex way how he sees life and people  He is the kind of guy the kind of guy that doesn t give a fuck about anything   but he CARES about you I don t know    I just believe it s a great novel  specially for young people  If you can t relate to what Holden is saying at some point  you are a very particular individual I would specifically recomend this book to any John Green and Thim Tharp book lovers  I can definetely see how  The Spectacular Now  and it s protagonist Sutter Kelly may be based on this  I want to write a review  but I don t know how  It was just phenomenal  and that s really it   J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye debuted in 1951  some 60 years ago  60  That s a generation and more  Yet the book remains as relevant today as when it first appeared  How and why  Two words Holden Caulfield Holden is the 16 year old narrator of The Catcher in the Rye  He is also the main character of the book and a true character in every sense of the word save one  fictional  Holden Caulfield is more than a literary invention  To his readers  he is real  and in many cases  he is them He was certainly me the first time I read the book in high school  I related to his feelings of self imposed alienation  I m not phony like all the phonies around me  even when I m being phony  I understood his reluctance to grow up  I like being me and don t want to lose him  I followed his academic path  Not living up to potential Who among us cannot relate to Holden  His struggle toward adulthood is our struggle  Times may change  Vocabulary may change  But Holden is eternal  immortal  because he is one of us  He is human  He and his book are so much more than works of fiction  What can I say  Holden Caulfield makes you feel things  See things  Realize how shit life can be  And then  he helps you get over it  If you know how to use it  this book can be the best therapy  If you don t  well   Mark David Chapman  anyone  The Cather in the Rye is a story of a boy named Holden Caulfield when he drops out Pencey prep school in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  He leaves and goes on an adventure and talks a lot of trash about people  One of the things I love most about Holden is the fact that he is straight forwarded  sarcastic and makes me laugh while I read  Holden doesn t really do anything productive and is  the bad seed  of the family  His parents are rich  his older brother writes children s book and his little sister Phoebe who he is really close to is still in school  In the end of all the booze  and drugs Holden finds himself stuck in a place he can t get out of I give this book 5 stars because it is very entertaining and you can relate to it   I actually stumbled on to this book  You can imagine my delight as I sat down with it  having zero expectations  I loved it  Again one of my all time faves and a classic  The book to read when you need to remind yourself how the mind of a 16 year old works  No one understands you  you re too cynical and mighty to be a part of the ordinary  and you re very preoccupied with sex  Yet  you re starting to become who you are and what you believe in  which isn t always easy QuotesI was the goddman manager of the fencing team  6What I was really hanging around for  I was trying to feel some kind of a goodbye   I don t care if it s a sad goodbye or a bad goodbye  but when I leave a place I like to know I m leaving it  If you don t you feel even worse  7I was sixteen then  and I m seventeen now  and sometimes I act like I m about thirteen  It s really ironical  because I m six foot two and a half and I have gray hair   And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve  Everybody says that  especially my father   Sometimes I act a lot older than I am   I really do   but people never notice it  People never notice anything  13I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park  down frozen over when I got home  and if it was  there did the ducks go  18What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it wa a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  25I was only thirteen  and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all  because I broke all the windows in the garage  I don t blame them  I really don t  I slept in the garage the night he died  and I broke all the goddamn windows with my fist  just for the hell of it   It was a stupid thing to do  I ll admit  but I hardly didn t even know I was doing it  and you don t know Allie  50Sex is something I just don t understand  I swear to God I don t  82The thing is  most of the time when you re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl   a girl that isn t a prostitute or anything  I mean   she keeps telling you to stop  The trouble with me is  I stop  Most guy s don t  I can t help it  You never know whether they really want you to stop  or whether they re just scared as hell  or whether they re just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it  the blame ll be on you  not them  Anyway  I keep stopping  The trouble is  I get to feeling sorry for them  I mean most girls are so dumb and all  After you neck them for a while you can really watch tme losing their brains  You take a girl when she gets really passionate  she just hasn t any brains  121He was singing that song  If a body catch a body coming through the rye   He had a pretty little voice  too  He was just singing for the hell of it  you could tell  the cars zoomed by  brakes screeched all over the place  his parents paid no attention to him  and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing   If a body catch a body coming through the rye   It made me feel better  It made me feel not so depressed anymore  150Certain things  innoncence and childhood  they should stay the way they are  You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone  I know that s impossible  but it s too bad anyway  Anyway  I kept thinkign about all that while I walked  158I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  225The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one  244You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  someobdy ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I ied  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive in fact  264 This book was recommended to me by a friend who told me that it was his favorite book  The book promotes some of challenges of life as teenager in the USA  but it also shows strong relations and the power of family  If you haven t read this book it is definitely worth the read   D

character equivalent  Let me claim this  as Catcher in the Rye would definitely be one of my most adored books of all time  J D  s  twitter  account on the other hand  is probably my next fixation regarding this matter  I have practically favorited 99 9  of its tweets  Back to the paperback  it s a funny thing to mention that my name has been on top of the borrower s card for its copy found at the De La Salle University Dasmarinas  sought after library  I can never be more proud Holden seemed removed from society at a very young age  Bros  stupid girls  phonies and their phoniness being among things that he hate  one can t deny that he s got a point to them all  Phoebe Caulfield  his dearly beloved younger sister  is that somebody that pulls him together and understands him best  aww man  I m gonna cry  I remembered that scene when Phoebe gave her savings to Holden as he was headed some place else  Its context was truly heartbreaking  It was needless to say that I wanted to hug this young boy so tight just to let him know that I understand him too Because as Brett Lott puts it in one of his essays  The Most Fragile Book   Inside that ferocious stance is a broken heart   In other words  you re missing out if you haven t read The Catcher in the Rye yet  The first time I read this was back in first year high school  The cover was very plain looking and boring  and yet I got hooked the moment I read the opening lines of the novel  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  This pretty much sets the tone of the narrative  and one would get drawn into the narrator s judgmental yet hilarious observations about the people around him and his deep hatred of phoniness  It kinda makes you want to reflect on the many ways you yourself can be a phony and on how beautiful it is to attain that childlike simplicity  One can also pick up many life lessons  especially in his conversation with his English teacher Mr  Antolini  whom I had just realized in my last reading may not be a  flit  after all as I had often thought  I d have to warn readers though not to internalize Holden s thoughts too much  as although he can have very good insights  he is very immature  lacks focus  and for most part never really thinks clearly about the things he does  Many young readers often don t go beyond the fact that he s hilarious  witty  and  at times  very relatable  which may have them fall into the trap of actually emulating him when he s not worth emulating in the first place  Superficially the story of a young man s expulsion from yet another school  The Catcher in the Rye is in fact a perceptive study of one individual s understanding of his human condition  Holden Caulfield  a teenager growing up in 1950s New York  has been expelled school for poor achievement once again  In an attempt to deal with this he leaves school a few days prior to the end of term  and goes to New York to  take a vacation  before returning to his parents  inevitable wrath  Told as a monologue  the book describes Holden s thoughts and activities over these few days  during which he describes a developing nervous breakdown  symptomised by his bouts of unexplained depression  impulsive spending and generally odd  erratic behaviour  prior to his eventual nervous collapse  If  On the Road  is my favorite book  then  Catcher in the Rye  is a very close second  No other book that I ve ever read deals better with the subject of growing up and loneliness like this one  My Dad bought me a copy of the book before a vacation and the book changed the course of my life forever  If you ve never had a  Holden moment   then you have never experienced the longing  loneliness  and excitement of being a teenager  I would urge anyone between the ages of 13 and 25 who has never read this book to read it  and everyone else to re read it  it s that important  hmmmmmmmmmm    What an interesting read  J D  Salinger was brilliant  and reading his bio verifies it  I belong to a book club that meets monthly over an exclusive but casual dinner at a local upscale restaurant  What fun  Most of the people know each other   it is Gloucester  after all  We eat whatever Ken Duckworth has prepared for us that day   usually including a delicious cream soup made from scratch  a vegetable dish with some not typically seen item  a meat dish  shrimp cocktail  cheese and fruit  coffee  wine  Yummmie  After dinner  we fill our wine glasses again  and discuss that day s book  The last one was  Catcher in the Rye   I thought I had read this years ago  but I was wrong  Perhaps it was because I attended Lutheran schools  and of course Catcher wouldn t have been on the reading list  The discussion became so heated that the facilitator had to gain control several times  Wow  What discussion this book elicits  The symbolism is clear  that we all could agree on  What we couldn t agree on was Salinger s motivation for the character of Holden Caufield  One participant thought he was lying the whole time  Others thought he was a spoiled child who needed to grow up  Still others were convinced he needed love and empathy  support for his misdirection and lack of ambition  What an interesting study in human behavior  That answered the question for me  I think that s exactly what Salinger intended  All that emotion  all that contention  It was banned from schools all over the world  We all know the book AND the character  even if we haven t read it  It was found in the possession of John Lennon s assassin  It was held responsible for that death  True art brings emotional response  That is what makes it art  Salinger certainly achieved that   This is one of my favorites  It s hard to explain why  The writing is marvelous and when I first read it  I had never read anything else quite like it  I felt it was an interesting character study of Holden  I could relate to some aspects of the guy and other aspects were shocking  I guess  my favorite subject in college was sociology  and I adore books that deeply study the psychological and physiological aspects of people  This book is written from the perspective of a young man s thoughts as he drifts through his days at school  It isn t much of a story line if you need that sort of thing  It s more of an analysis  I read this when I was young   it spoke to me in such a stong way about justice   truth   then years later when I had my own children I read it again   saw it thru different eyes  The eyes of a parent   one of my favorite books  This is a masterpiece and a half  To think anything less of it only implies a misread  So much social commentary from the eyes of a teenager who is clearly cynical almost makes it hard to bear at times but also makes you think about what s real and what really matters  The few days in this kids life that seem so tumultuous  where a tragic end seems imminent   inevitable ends with such an easy escape  It brings home the point that life can be such a play of perspective  When stuff is going down and you are in the thick of it  it all feels so unreal and in some extreme circumstances even hopeless  However a smile  a hug  a human touch  innocence  simplicity  any or all of these can bring you back in touch with reality  No matter how bad it seems  look around the corner and don t give up  There is always hope and love   Reading this book for the first time as a 17 year old high school senior  I felt like Salinger had reached into my mind and stolen my thoughts  feelings and fears Holden Caulfield represents the shy  unintended loner with low self confidence in most post pubescent teenage boys  Reading it was almost a sort of therapy for me at the time  It let me know that I that what I was feeling was normal  what I thought was OK  and seeing that the book was written nearly 50 years before  that my dad had probably had the same thoughts and feelings I ve read Catcher probably 10 times  and every time I come away with something different It s definitely a classic  and a must read for everyone    even the women who  just don t get it   It is one of my favorite books  It keeps you trapped from the begginng  You identify the main character with a lot of people you know or treats of your own personality  It s discourse makes you want to keep reading all the time and the plot is great   hwldn nmyndhy admhyy st khh dr dnyy prhrjwmrj mrwz srdrgm shdhnd  hrchh dr zndgy w tfq myftd  bhnw y myhy rnjsh w azrdgy w st  z dwstn w hmkhlsyh w m lmh grfth  t

mwfqtr rzyby mykhnm    spolier alert   I didnt think this book was going to be good  i read it over this summer for summer school and we disected this book and it was very intersting  Its about a teenager that gets kicked out of a few schools and then was sent to a boarding school and was soon kicked out of there to  then it goes on to how he doesnt noe how to handle how to tell his parents and ends up having to deal with the world alone for a while  his younger brother dies  Allie  and it makes his relationship with his yougner sister  phoebie  so much stronger  i really like how everything played out in this book and wouldnt mind reading it again  JD Salinger is a great author  It took me years to figure out exactly why I love Catcher in the Rye  When it was assigned back in high school  I read the scheduled chapters  and kept on going  finishing weeks ahead of the rest of the class  A few of my friends disliked it  claiming it was  just a guy complaining about a really bad day   I insisted it was brilliant  I sensed it was pregnant with meaning  but it took me awhile to figure out what that meaning was  Salinger refuses to explicitly state his theme  He doesn t need to  Holden s actions  interactions  and intimate narration convey it beautifully  He dismisses  conventional  adults  and the guys his age who conform to their standards  as  phonies   He s terrified of sex  illustrated by his scenes with the prostitute  He idealizes the youthful innocence of his little sister  Phoebe  The clear implication is that Holden fears growing up  partially because he fears responsibility  but predominantly because he perceives the adult world as inherently corrupt  What is his dream  To prevent kids from falling off a cliff while they play in a field of rye  an expression of his desire to preserve childhood innocence  What is the climax  The image of Phoebe on the carousel  laughing as shoe goes around and around  Salinger s attention to detail and his protagonist s frequent digressions make it easy to miss the forest for the trees at first  but after multiple readings  the meaning seems obvious to me  Of course  this is just the meaning I found  Salinger leaves much ambiguous  allowing each reader to determine meaning for himself  I try to do the same  As I see it  the story is the raw material  and it is up to the reader to assemble it into a  meaning   If I have to explain my intent  I haven t done my job   Holden is pretty much an angry and depressed Huck Finn but I love the character anyways  Reading the book kind of scared me because I found myself relating a little too much to him  I thought I was done with my teenage angst but apparently not  It is full of some pretty salty language but that is almost part of the charm of the story  It is hilarious and I was always laughing out loud which is something I both love and hate  I wouldn t recommend this book to any kids but it is a good book to read after you ve gone through all of that crap  It s been 25 years since I first read this book   and I remember now why I loved it back then  Such a great one and should be a must read for anyone and everyone  I turned thirty this September  and I d never read The Catcher in the Rye  Even though it s my friend Sasha s favorite book  Even though it s one of the most famous novels of the twentieth century  Even though it s short and I love short novels a lot better than long ones that are padded out with bullshit for forty thousand pages What drove me over the line was that recently my friend Madaline Rielly  who s a keen writer and a fine and curious human being herself  had the gorgeous idea that she d read my novel Kiss Me  Genius Boy  which I ll call KMGB from now on  and then write me a letter about it  Among other things she said that the main character  Joshua Rivers  reminded her of old Holden Caulfield  So I thought I d better get my ass in gear and read Salinger s one famous book at last I find I don t have any reason to object when she says Josh and Holden are alike  Some of the parallels are truly uncanny  For instance there s a scene in KMGB where Josh is standing outside a bus stop and feeling depressed about girls and it starts raining and he just stands there and lets himself get drenched  Actually  I once stood in the rain at a bus stop like that myself  which is how I got the idea  And there at the end of The Catcher in the Rye I see Holden let himself get soaked sitting in the rain watching his sister Phoebe on a carousel And right after that it looks like he gets shipped off to a mental asylum  so I guess that was the point where people thought he d finally lost it Josh doesn t lose it  and neither did I  I don t think it gives anything away to say that Like Holden  there s a pretty strong voice that Josh has  too  and I can tell you  when you read Holden Caulfield practically talking to himself all the way through The Catcher in the Rye  it sort of gets inside of you  Like  today I had an argument with someone in my office about cleaning out the fridge  and I said  I ve never opened that goddamn fridge   and went right on about it  That s how it works I guess some of you might say it doesn t help to talk about characters in books like they re real people  But the thing is  Holden Caulfield is a real person  He s exactly the kind of person that hangs around this world and gets misunderstood and pissed off and nobody realizes that there s actually a really sensitive person in there who in a bunch of ways is really better than the petty bastards around him Thing is  Holden s got a sharp mind  even though he doesn t care much about school  What he sees around him is a bunch of people act phony or miss the point  And the point is the whole thing of that kid who jumped out of a window at that school he went to  and that flitty Mr  A s picking him up when no one else would go near him  Joshua Rivers in KMGB s not nearly so much of a humanitarian  but still there s this feeling of being someone who s actually more sensitive than other people  and gets to being a bit of an asshole just because he s so damn disappointed in how crumby everyone else can be all the time The Catcher in the Rye is that immortal story of the young man who thinks himself superior and gets so pissed off with the phony  petty bastards who want him to play by their rules that he gets the idea he should just give up and drop out  Holden has his dream of a cabin  or going out west  or going out West to a cabin  and taking some girl with him and just letting the world go by  And maybe I m like that and not everyone else is like that  but this seems to be like  the final human dream  the final utopia for the guy whose just been trying to do his own thing and while he was doing it some petty bastard came up and wrote  Fuck you  right on his forehead I fucking love that dream  I get a huge bang out of it That s why I give this goddamn book five stars  This has just become my favorite book of all time  I laughed so hard all the way through this  Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of Prep school  He decides to embark on his own journey home and he takes us through a comical adventure through New York City  It is a masterfully crafted manuscript directed to the reader in such a way  that one can see the nostalgic  yet rebellious attitude of teenagers in the 1950 s  I felt that not much has changed in the last 60 years  The reader can sense that Holden is a troubled youth  and the root of his  I don t care  attitude stems from the death of his brother  Though  he ll never admit it   I hardly found a sentence in this entire book where I didn t laugh at his humorous negativity  Author JD Salinger took ten years to write this book  and I wonder how in the world he was able to capture so much humor in American youth  I think he was a genious  Holden is my hero  and all   This book is definitely a masterpiece and I urge anyone who has a good sense of humor to buy this book  You will want to read this book over and over  My advice  Buy it in hardback  The language is a bit on the rough side  but it makes the character more believable  Holden is the original rebel with a cause   This book kills me  It really does  I love it to pieces  It just makes me so damn depressed  I have so much sympathy for Holden and I think nearly everyone has felt like what he does once in their lives  The ending always makes me bawl  Not a plot based book so if Holden annoys you most likely you will despise the book  and the reader will either love or hate him   Its really a pity few people see truly how broken Holden is from Allie s death  Which causes his strange relationship with death  age  and his siblings  Will for sure read again  one of my favorites   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   I love this book  i had to analyze it for AP English and thought i wasn t going to like it because of too much work to do on it   but at the end i LOVED it     Written by J D  Salinger this novel is a bit famous  It tends to be associated with the murder of John Lennon  Before killing John Lennon  Mark Chapman  who read and re read the book many times   to the point of believing it was his own biography  asked Lennon to autograph his copy before gunning down the musician  However it s also a modern classic in it s own right  Holden Caulfield is the teenage protaganist and narrator of the diary esque story  Set over two three days in December in the early 1950s it s about Holden  who is expelled from his prestigious boarding school  Pencey Prep and told not to return after the Christmas break which starts on Wednesday  Instead of waiting till then he leaves early to stay in a hotel in New York for a couple of days by himself until his parents expect him home  But really as I sit here writing this review it s not so much what this story is about as WHO it s about  Holden Caulfield is this book  we get to see the thoughts and actions of a teenager  a depressed  troubled  contradictory  mind which we witness falling apart  It s not as you d imagine  a chore to read this  parts of it are very funny  parts of it leap of the page and get lodged in your mind and it tells you something you don t know without ever feeling like it is  Lonely  ostracised teenagers should read this  parents of teenagers should read this  the popular kids should read it to  and if like me you re coming late to the party  you should read it too  It s an important book without feeling like it or feeling like it s trying to be  and to borrow a Caulfield phrase  it killed me My last little point of recommendation  there s a line in the book about wishing you could phone up an author and just have a conversation with him cause you like how he writes  Salinger is that author  what a guy  There are so many excellent reviews of this book on GR already  I doubt any of my insights are going to be new  But this is one of those titles that often rises up in my thoughts Holden wishes he wasn t surrounded by phonies yet he admits he is a pathological liar  someone who lies by instinct to everyone for little or no advantage  The chameleon character in John Guare s play  Six Degrees of Separation  claims that his stolen graduate thesis was about Holden Caulfield s inner monologue preparing disturbed men for moments of violence while at the same time being just an accurate portrayal of how most adolescent males think and behave This I think is why Holden s thoughts are so haunting  Because Salinger captures how a young man must transition from the imaginative play of childhood to the dour reality of being an adult  The kind of disturbed men that shoot up schools and assassinate celebrities either haven t made that transition or go back and try to escape to their childhood again This has always been personally sobering  Because I lied a lot when I was Holden s age  It was a game for me  How inventive could I be and still be believable  How long could I carry a serial lie  Salinger s narrative helps me understand that telling those lies to teachers and friends  parents was my way of trying to hold on to the fantastical inner possibilities of childhood  I was lucky because I had a caring and loving family  And I grew out of the game and became  I hope  a well adjusted adult  Yet this book makes it clear how an individual not so lucky could end up on the wrong path Haunting as I say Carac Here s a clip of Will Smith delivering that monologue in the movie adaption of the play  https   www youtube com watch v arPhz     I really liked this book  I didn t see it as much of a anti establishment book as it is often categorized  But that may be because I was born in the 1970s    by then  teenagers were expected to be anti establishment and  so over  all things adult  But I think Holden needed an adult  He needed someone to talk to and someone to give him a hug   From my point of view  The Catcher in the Rye is a really good book  All the things Holden does happens to all teens  One reason I think adults don t want kids in 10th  11th  and 12th grade reading this book is because he gets drunk in bars  he smokes  and buy s cheap hookers  But kids our age should be able to read this book because it shows our point of view and how we interact in the real world  Sirf

Anlatabilsem de  anlatmayi isteyecegimden pek emin degilim   I have never read a book that mixed cynicism  practicality and wit plus a hell of a lot of dry and free flowing humor  This novel exquisitely captured the era  the lifestyles  the lingo and the aura of the period and it also vividly expresses the confines of a teenager s thoughts and emotions and how unstable and erratic they can be  The philosophical and optimism in the novel can be seen in the moments wherein the protagonist  Holden Caufield  contemplates on his action  experiences  passions  ideas and relations with other people most especially with his roommates  girls  his brothers and most of all his sister Phoebe  We see the main character drift from negativity to excitement then to practicality and then he measures himself up and indirectly sees himself as an apathetic and ambivalent intellectual Holden is only able to find solace  purpose and joy when he is around his sister or when he reminisces about his brothers D B and Allie  The novel is truly a teenage thought provoking and emotionally and psychologically charged book that enables the readers to see a little piece of them in Holden Caufield  When I first encountered the book  the Catcher in the Rye  written by J D  Salinger  in my school library  I thought to myself   What a unique book illustration for the cover   I honestly was attracted to this book right away with the eye grabbing cover  It made me want to explore and find out what this book was about  At first  I didn t even recognize that this book was a classic because of how well anyone could relate to this book  I didn t really have any prior reading experience with J D  Salinger either  but after reading his first novel  I would highly regard reading another  He is a fantastic author when it comes to talking about the main character  Holden Caulfield  Holden is a sixteen year old New Yorker who struggles to find himself as a person  He separates himself from what is false and he speaks the truth  I connect with Holden well  because of how much he believes in himself and how well versed he can be  I feel many people can connect with Holden for these various reasons too  Considering this is a coming of age novel  I think the Catcher in the Rye can be a great book for all ages  Holden is a very unique main character  He is quite different from all of the other kids his age who only care about being popular and all that good stuff  Anyone who has experienced high school knows what I m talking about  Most people want to be popular and will do anything to achieve that status  All Holden truly cares about is being real and true to him  In the beginning of the book  Holden tells us a lot of personal stuff about him  He talks about how he attends Pencey Prep which is the fourth school he has attended  granted that he failed out of the previous three in which he was enrolled  He tends not to follow the  norm   Holden also has a very good sense of humor throughout the book  The use of sarcasm and irony by J D  Salinger is amazing  There are multiple occasions where Holden would say a witty remark like on page 73   He was certainly good company  Terrific personality   In this  Holden is referring to a kid in his class at Pencey who is not Holden s favorite person in the world  J D  Salinger really does a great job incorporating funny moments like this into the entire book  I truly believe that with the humor contained in the book  anyone can recognize and get the joke  The target isn t set for just one type of viewing audience  That s what makes this such a great book   With Holden being someone who really likes to be true to the world and everyone  it causes him to get into precarious situations at times  Everyone has gone through a struggle at some point in their life  and I think that anyone who reads this novel will understand and relate to what Holden is going through  He runs into people that he never thought he would meet underground in New York  Once he gets kicked out of Pencey  he doesn t even tell his sister Phoebe that he is back in New York  I think a key reason he does this  is that he faces depression throughout the entire book  He vents his depression by talking to his deceased brother  Allie  He takes a memory where he was talking to his brother  Allie  and reimagines it all over again  This was quite sad to me  I ve seen people struggle in many ways and you probably have too  Everyone can relate to the theme of struggle  especially I think Holden s struggle  I also think that by Holden talking to imaginary  Allie  it helps him solve some internal issues that he faces  Holden is a complete character that many people can relate to  You honestly don t just have to be a teen to relate to this book  J D  Salinger does a great job incorporating many life lessons that anyone of all ages could read If you like books that have characters facing adversity  being true to who you are  and small scale adventure  then I highly recommend  the Catcher in the Rye  If any of the things I said throughout the entire review intrigued you at all  then this is a beautiful story to read  J D  Salinger incorporates laughter along with intense moments greatly  Holden is so well versed in so many areas  I honestly felt that I knew him like he was my real good friend at the end of the novel  I don t discourage anyone to read this novel  This ultimately is a beautiful story for people of all ages to read   I wasn t allowed to read this book as an adolescent  now I m glad I did  This book lives up to the claim that it is not suited for young adults  but then who cares  I thought it was a  hoot  myself  I laughed out loud more than once while reading it  Aside from the many expletives  at least 3 per page  I thought the book was well written and a definite page turner  Don t take my word for it though  Read it for yourself   I have rated this book 5 5 as the book was very interesting  it healed my attention and most of the time it was difficult to put the book down  It had a good story line and kept me guessing what the end was going to be  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and a good story  J D  Salinger s   Catcher in the Rye   deserves five out of five stars  Holden Caulfield  a sixteen year old just kicked out of a prep school  goes on a whirlwind adventure to help him through a transitional period of adolescence  Holden can t bear to face the inevitable and return home  to New York  At the same time though  he can t stand to be at Pencey Prep any longer  After a brief and  heartfelt  goodbye to a cobweb teacher  he goes off on his way to an  incognito  trip of New York While in New York  Holden faces deep depression and loneliness  In the city he encounters sex  liquor  profanity  a pimp  a prostitute  a former teacher  and some sense of self realization  Holden goes deeper down the rabbit hole  until rescued by his younger sister  Phoebe  From there  he has some sense of what this journey means to his future  Salinger uses brilliant language  The character development of Holden builds through the use of figurative language  Holden curses  is a total hypocrite  and frustrates the hell out of you  but that is exactly what a teenager is  The vulgar language may seem rough or unnecessary at times  but really adds insight to the darkness of puberty  Salinger captures the struggles of transition between childhood and adulthood  Some may say the negativity is too much  but Salinger is highlighting the obscure and unknown blankness of growing up  It is so realistic and relatable because everyone has those dark thoughts growing up  exaggeration  and inappropriate urges The book isn t all profanity  The life changing quotes like  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   and  The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   show the remarkable writing ability and style of Salinger  He tastefully uses many allusions about books  movies  and other topics acceptable to the time period  Overall   Catcher in the Rye  will bring you back to your teenage days and bring to your attention the cruelty of adolescence and transition  Both entertaining and relatable  would absolutely recommend   The Catcher in the Rye is an outstanding book for two main reasons  First  the main character  Holden Caulfield  is not your typical protagonist  When someone reads a book they expect the protagonist to be an honest  courageous  motivated  and well behaved person  but J  D  Salinger shows through many instances throughout the story that Holden is none of these things  The first example of this appears early on as Holden tells the reader that he is going to say bye to one of his teachers at his school since he is getting kicked out due to the fact that he is failing almost all of his classes because he just doesn t care about school  Salinger  4   Next  Holden shows his dishonesty when he comes right out and tells the reader that he is a great a liar and that he does it all time for no reason at all  17   Later  Holden shows how ill behaved he is by punching Stradlater  his roommate  in the face to start a fight  which Holden loses  43   Lastly  Holden shows his lack of courage when he cries instead of trying to fight back when Sunny s  the prostitute he hires  pimp beats him up because he did not pay the full price  103   So  through these examples Salinger shows how Holden is unlike the typical protagonist because he is not motivated  honest  well behaved  or courageous  The second is the storyline that keeps the reader guessing because of its many twists and turns  The first comes early on  when Holden picks a fight with Stradlater for going out with a former crush of his  43   Another is when the elevator attendant asks Holden if he wants a hooker to come to his room and do what hookers do for five dollars  91   The last occurs late in the story as Holden stays at Mr  Antolini s  Holden s former teacher  house  While sleeping there Holden awakes to Mr  Antolini touching his hair  and he being homophobic leaves promptly since he takes this to be a homosexual advance  192   Therefore  through these twists and turns Salinger draws the reader in and holds his or her attention throughout the book Word Count  363 Obvious  I know  But millions of frustrated teens can t be wrong  Holden Caulfield was a friend of mineWe go drinking from time to time  The Catcher in the Rye  was different from any other book I have read before  It is from 16 year old Holden Caulfield s perspective after he gets kicked out of his boarding school and is left on his own  Afraid of telling his parents about his expulsion  Holden goes to New York where he lives  by himself and wanders the streets until he is ready to go home  Holden calls up many of his old friends to meet up with  but ends up realizing how much he does not truly enjoy their company  Depressed and broke  he eventually goes home to see his sister Phoebe  the one person he doesn t see as  phony   and she offers help to Holden to get his life back on the right track  The book doesn t end on a very happy note  but Holden has hope for his future  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  I thought Holden s narration was a very entertaining and offered a perspective that I have never seen before in a book  His character had a very unique outlook on life that I think is relatable to many people  It would have been nice if there was more closure in the book  with details about what ends up happening to Holden  but I think the author was probably trying to make the book more realistic by not ending it super happily  Overall  this is a great read that I highly recommend   The book begins with Holden Caulfield directly addressing you  the reader  and he begins to retell the events over a three day period from last December  His story starts at Pencey Prep  a prestigious boarding school filled with  phonies   as Holden likes to call them  It is just before Christmas and 16 year old Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of the exclusive Pencey Prep  a boys  school in Pennsylvania  Considering everything  this reflects more credit on Holden than on Pencey  Life at Pencey is dreary  regimented  artificial and  of course  expensive  This happens  however  to be only the latest of a series of schools from which Holden has been expelled  Understandably he is in no hurry to encounter his parents  but he is also reluctant to linger a moment longer than necessary at Pencey  He therefore takes what money he has and departs for New York  where he passes several days in a weird jumble of adventures and experiences  is involved with a variety of persons including taxi drivers  two nuns  an elevator man  three girls from Seattle  a prostitute  and a former teacher from whom Holden thinks it best to flee in the middle of the night and most of all from himself In New York Holden s nightmarish efforts to escape from himself by liquor  sex  night clubs  movies  sociability anything and everything are fruitless  Misadventure piles on misadventure  but he bears it all with a grim cheerfulness and stubborn courage  He is finally saved as a result of his meeting with his little sister Phoebe  like Holden a wonderful creation  She is the single person who supplies the affection that Holden needs  and just in the nick of time At last  we pull out of the narrative and back to the Holden of one year later  the one who was telling us this story  He s clearly in therapy for getting  sick  in some way  He says he s supposed to go back to school in September  but he s not sure whether or not things will be any different  that is  any better  this time around  He concludes that he sort of wishes he hadn t told us this story at all  since relating it makes him miss all the people he d met  J D Salinger s novel about the fickle nature of protecting oneself through social isolation and how painful loneliness can truly be was my favorite read of junior year  I love this book for its relatable protagonist and its satire of teenage ideals  I admire that Salinger was able to create a completely entertaining novel that retells the events of only a few nights  Its entertaining  and it says a lot about the vices of putting up emotional walls to protect oneself  It s a fabulous story  and one that I plan to reread many times over the course of my life  The Catcher in the Rye particularly came as a gift for me  I have known J D  Salinger ever since  but was yet to read his books  Considering this as one of the all time great contemporary classic novel  I positioned this to be read after Haruki Murakami s 1Q84  which is my currently read during that time  And so  when I was reading it  I stopped midway and drop it out from my reading list  without any particular reason at all  It was only this year  that I pledged to finished this  and without a doubt  it admiringly pleased me with such awe  Salinger s Holden Caulfield remains as one of the great representation of any teenager transitioning to young adult life  His thoughts  actions  and perceptions are basically a mimeograph of reality  Most definitely  one reason why I was purely passionate reading his story was that Holden was relatable  Though I m currently at 22  it felt like I was still living a life like Holden  There are still some uncertainties and immaturity that governs my being  And I m still currently undertaking some mistakes in my decisions  which are part of my falling in the cliffs of rye  There also came my redemption  my attempt to come into full being  by being someone who would catch people  who have gone or who are in the same path as I was before  before they fall into that cliff  But one thing remains for me as a valuable memento from the story is that people journey their own lives  and as they stir  they came into discovery of life s what not  and when they fall  sometimes they just have to fall As for the narrative  it was neatly well written  The prose captures the overall atmosphere of the story  The place was vividly described as well as the thoughts the characters have  Salinger s wording were enough to catapult the characters into their full potential  the characters were seamlessly developed  coming into matter that  I for myself  understood all the undertakings of Holden  as well as his use of language  the cursing  I understood  as it was a part to characterized Holden s character   Reading Catcher in the Rye was effective to the point that it can be finished in just one sitting  The continuity in Holden s becoming and thoughts were a catalyst to why I cringed in going on with the story  hardly ever stopping  Much to it that it was some sort of introspective narration  it was a power factor that catapult the story to why it is quite captivating and engaging  It encourages the reader  to the same effect  to introspect into his own being  It leaves the reader to a state of wandering  It let me ponder all throughout the story  that s where Holden became a person that is somewhat closely related to me  I felt that he exists Also  the story of Holden deserves a second and so fourth reading  It is a resounding testament to one s valuable transitionhood  a monumental story embedded on a bed of curiosity about life and false perceptions  Though others would regard it with simplicity and plainness  it gave me a profound thought about my own becoming  of who I am  of why I act this way at times  it reminded me simply of myself  Definitely  this deserves a word of mouth  a story that must be passed on  I regret half finishing this on my first read  And like Jane Eyre  this is one book I would cater to give time and re read   If you like books where the characters are cute  affable  or funny  then you can skip this  The main character of this book comes off as apathetic and whiny to some people  but he s just brutally honest  The story seems like its pointless to some and if you just take it at face value then yes  its pretty much the story of some white kid who gets kicked out of college and fucks around for a day while he ponders his situation  To me the point of the story is that you ll have a rough run if you just center in on the bad and never stop to take in the big picture  The reason i like this book is because its just easy to read  and i can very much relate to the main character s sarcasm  I don t really ever read this book anymore  its been years  but id still reccomend it for any teen age male  Its a depressing book  but it does have its moments of humor  and beauty  The ending has some very sound advice too   Um livro para filhos e pais  uns leem e identificam se com os dramas  outros recordam os disparates da gloriosa adolescencia Todos por la passamos e com maior ou menor mossa  sobrevivemos e arrepiamos caminho  A semelhanca de Holden  tambem tivemos ataques de mau feitio      ainda tenho alguns     impaciencia perante os mais velhos  uns armantes com a mania que sabem tudo   e um desprezo generalizado por tudo o que mexe E uma vontade de crescer  de ser gente grande  mas sem a chatice das responsabilidades  a pretensao de tudo saber e nao saber o que fazer da vida  a ousadia de virar costas sem hesitar e ir a aventura como se o mundo fosse do tamanho do quintal  Bem escondido fica o medo do desconhecido  o medo de perder o colo  perder a seguranca  perder os que amamos e nos dao seguranca As dores de crescimento de Holden sao iguaizinhas as nossas  e talvez por isso  este e um livro que se le com empatia ou melancolia  conforme a idade em que nos vem ter as maos Nao posso deixar passar em branco o linguajar da personagem  foi muito divertido ler estas perolas  grande parte delas constava do meu vocabulo ha pra i uns cem anos atras  A bem dizer  deixou me sem fala  Bestialmente bom  Timing is everything with this book  I came to this book when I was old enough to have understood where I had been but had far more than I could imagine ahead of me  That s the perfect time to get caught by this story  I can think of no book more beautifully and achingly observed than The Catcher in the Rye  Every character is vibrant and real  from their conversational and behavioral tics to the implied longings of their hidden hearts  There is no line out of place  no sentence that fails to enrich the portraits of Holden and every other character in the story  The humor is off the hook funny  the old history teacher Mr  Spenser reading aloud Holden s essay about the Egyptians    a n ancient race of Caucasians residing in one of the northern sections of Africa  The latter as we all know is the largest continent in the Eastern Hemisphere       The cabbie Horowitz getting testy when Holden questions him about where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter     the three tourist women from Seattle who snicker at Holden while craning their necks in the desperate quest to see a movie star   I just caught a glimpse of him   one says after Holden pranks her by claiming that Gary Cooper has just left the club   Most of all there is Holden  a beautiful  damaged  aching soul in a desperate quest to connect  But whom can he connect with  Everyone is or seems to be  phony     and if everyone is putting on an act  which is what Holden means by  phony   how can you connect  You can t cling to air  But children aren t phony  Certainly not Phoebe or the dead brother Allie  Holden s desperate need to love finds expression with them at least  This masterful book is the perfectly realized portrait of a lonely young man seeking to connect  It is the story of a human heart and of some piece of every human heart  That  Was  Good  Truthfully  I m really happy for Holden  I really  truly am  And for this book  don t go so in depth and try to figure out what he meant there or where is the symbolism  No  Just  Read  It  Dwaahh   it s just so  so  so  so GOOD  Yup  this is the stuff  this is the stuff  This book right here  people What s this damn book about  Well  it s about a boy named Holden Caulfield and how he got axed  kicked out  of Pencey Prep and after thinking  he goes out and wanders New York  It might not sound like much but  the events that happened were interesting and it just reflected things that were happening to him in a way  It was pretty funny at points in the book and I felt the emotions coming through the pages  As if Salinger s intention was to make a scene happy so that you felt happy  And  oh  yes  Holden Caulfield  Since this book is in first person  he narrates it  And he s definitely speaking to you not telling you so that it s like a movie or something of such  Oh  yeah  he s damn awesome  Uhmm  you re just a damn badass killer Holden  He does swear a lot with damn but since I hear damn a lot  I didn t realize it was a swearing word in the first place  Ha for not realizing   and it started rubbing off in me XP  At points I really felt him like  Noooo don t go towards the light  kind of way  But  he  I don t know  he  observes  a lot of things so that he s telling you something and then he goes off point and tells you this other thing and I m just sitting here nodding along  knowingly  He just really needed to be caught by the catcher in the rye  I loved the little things mentioned in this book  I can say for sure that you have to be in the mood to read this book because  well  you just gotta be in the mood for these things  And maybe some people thought Holden annoying and childish but he s awesome to me  Yup  I don t know  it s just so good  not good as in brilliant good but GOOD  that even if he veers off point and you don t get to understand what s up  that didn t bother me at all  in the end  he ties each loose thread he has set and knots them so that  in the end  there s a point and there s a message   I think that one of these days   he said   you re going to have to find out where you want to go  And then you ve got to start going there  But immediately  You can t afford to lose a minute  Not you    it s brilliant one of the best I have ever read  It s a fairy tale writen for sdults  Mature  is nothing but a rediculioius mask that we put on to prove that we are not who we are  Adult is just a broken child Many of us ofetn complain about this dirty complicated world But in fact if we look from  the child s perspective  the world is clean and beautiful  What s dirty is not the world itself but ourselves  ah  Boy  I love this goddam book  I like how spontaneously adventurous Holden is  I love his character  How he thinks  How he asks about ducks and how he remembers that Jane keeps all her kings at the back  I hoped he would call her though  maybe he did  maybe not  I loved how this book is written like it is from one sitting  I love this quote from the book  What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  That doesn t happen much  though  It would have been nice if I can ring J D  Salinger and talk about his book And this   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  He wanted to save all the kids  I wish I could  There are alot more and I do hope whoever reads this review reads the book  Please Please  I have been saying that a lot  And then when I read about it as it ends  I thought I was going to cry  I love old Phoebe  And Holden s hat     Everyone is phony to tell you the truth  But I don t think Holden is one   I loved this book  I guess it s because I am 16 years old right now  I think of this book as a very relatable because Holden just sees the world differently  Holden is like my inner being  I really can relate to him  because of his thoughts  The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger is a novel that made me have some pretty introspective thoughts  I started to wonder if I was following the same sort of path Holden was on  The novel has an interesting take on the whole coming of age and maturation theme that so many young adult writers try to encapsulate in their works  The book was definitely fun to read  Some people may not agree with the wanton use of profanity  but I for one found it very befitting and a nice addition to the story telling  The narration leads to gut wrenching moments where the reader can end up experiencing the same amount of confusion or anger as the main character  Holden  feels The overall enjoyment of this book doesn t come from an action packed story or from some sort of fulfilling resolution to a problem  but from the reader s ability to identify with Holden  The reader gets a sense that the character resembles certain traits that they like  chiefly his desire to save innocence in an ever corrupting world  and some that they dislike  namely his complaining and general distaste for existence   but when I read it I realized that these traits only stuck out because I knew that they fit me  to a degree  This book gave me the chance to analyze classic literature  but through that I found a tool to work on my own personality flaws  In the end it was a pretty good story  but the part that I liked was how well it encapsulated the isolation and angst of the teenage experience  This book I about a kid which does not want to move on with life he can t get over the fact that he s brother died he is a very yellow guy  In the book Holden lies a lot but he tells you what he really thinks  He thinks everyone is phony which is hypocritical because he calls everyone phony but in real life he is one to  The thing is that Holden brother dies and he can t move on  In the story Holden likes this girl but his roommate wants to hook up with her  He has been kick out by that time  He gets kick out of Pence Prep because he does not take it serous  His roommate comes back from his date with the girl and Holden is mad and try s to fight him he gets bloody noise and lives the school  Holden can t fighter out where he belongs  When he gets kick out he goes to New York to see what he can do tell his parents find out he has been kick out of school   I think this is one of the best books I have ever read  This book gives a point of view of a teen and what goes on in their minds  I think this book is good and you should read it  Young adults can really relate to this book because thing that happen to him happen to use and we can learn from this book  You should read this book I strongly recommend this book  This is the saddest book I have ever read  I read this book twice  once in its original language and once in swedish  For me this is the kind of book that you keep coming back to i e  reread  I think there are people who either love it or hate it because of the language  the storyline  the characters or maybe something else  I for one love the book because of Holdens  me against the world  attitude which is expressed quite innocently and the whole atmosphere of the book which gives me a kind of a  pillowy  or cozy feeling  It feels as if I went through the same trip as Holden when in reality I did not  just like in a dream  I am convinced that this book will still be read and enjoyed by me many times in the future   I just finished reading Nine Stories and had no intention of reading more Salinger right away  But I was surprised at how cute and clever I found his writing after all these years  So I wanted to check out one more book just briefly   and what other book could you choose other than Catcher  So I read one chapter  Then I read another  Then I just caved in and kept going  I mean  every page had a quotable paragraph or two  No kidding  I could just quote the whole first three chapters  But what kind of book review would that be  You might as well just read the book yourself Of course  you might have to be in the same kind of Holdenish mood that I am in   like a wise ass and goofy at the same time  I don t think I was Holden Caulfield when I first read this book fifty years ago  But I think I might have reached that level of cynicism now  There must be a least a dozen books out there that dissect Salinger as a writer but most often as a person  I have read some of them and have several more on my shelf awaiting the proper moment  But as I wait  more books are always being added to the stack  I am not the only one needing an occasional Salinger fix So here is the obligatory opening from  The Catcher in the Rye If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  In the first place  that stuff bores me  and in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them Feel better now  I do I am trying to remember why Salinger was banned back in the last century as I am reading Catcher in the Rye in 2014  Could it have been because of paragraphs like this one  I didn t turn it off right away  though  I just kept laying there on Ely s bed  thinking about Jane and all  It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat assed Ed Banky s car  Every time I thought about it  I felt like jumping out the window  The thing is  you don t know Stradlater  I knew him  Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the time   like Ackley  for instance   but old Stradlater really did it  I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to  That s the truth   Sex and profanity  It was the polite 1950s  Maybe Salinger wouldn t have become so famous if he hadn t been so infamous  Maybe it was because he said some things about mothers that weren t so kind  Right that minute  the conductor came around for old Mrs  Morrow s ticket  and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it  I m glad I shot it for a while  though  You take a guy like Morrow who s always snapping their towel at people s asses   really trying to hurt somebody with it   they don t just stay a rat while they re a kid  They stay a rat their whole life  But I ll bet  after all the crap I shot  Mrs  Morrow ll keep thinking of him now as this very shy  modest guy that wouldn t let us nominate him for president  She might  You can t tell  Mothers aren t too sharp about that stuff   I mean  Holden was really good at shooting it and could have gotten Salinger into a lot of unnecessary trouble  In fact  I guess he did  He called Morrow a  sonuvabitch  when the guy s mother wasn t around  Salinger didn t invent trash talk  but Holden  well    And  of course  young sister Phoebe challenged Holden to think of something he liked and Holden imagined the scene we all associate with this book   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy   Is recapturing the moment when you first read that paragraph years ago  worth reading the entire book again  At that very moment it seemed like it was worth it  Five stars  That one extra star is for that moment  I guess that is serious nostalgia Now on to read one more book that dissects Salinger based on too little information  The man was a mystery   I loved this book  Funny  Holden is so likable  Interesting how he sees the world     but also how lost he is in his own imaginings  I thought Holden s moral struggles interesting and thought in general the book had a good  humane moral arc  ok besides the fact that he made fun of pretty much everyone   And I loved how it ended and Holden s love for his siblings   This is the first book that convinced me that fiction may be the highest form of linguistic art  Also  it s the first book that I ever believed earned the description  magical   There is something so earnest and expansive and organic about this book  and all the while it s controlled by Salinger to the point of virtuosity  There s such a beautiful tension between Holden the character and Salinger the author  and I can t escape the feeling that Salinger must have shot his luck altogether on this one  I taught it to a class of community college students without ever having read it before  sad omission in my reading  yes   and I d never realized how vital one young neurotic s struggle could be  Caulfield s crux is an ethical lesson of the highest order  yet the entertainment and pulp quality of the narrative remains as a gut level satisfaction  An unbelievably magical book  in fact  there s something schizophrenically right and true about it  and unfortunately  that makes it ragingly susceptible to misreading and abusive ignorance   To be honest  english isn t my native language and I m very sad and a little bit outraged about the comments criticizing this novel  I ll do my best to make my point clear and in a respectful way  I think it s one of the best novels I ve ever read  But if you are expecting a pretentious novel  this book is going to disappoint you  I am very disppointed with the comments saying this novel has no sense or plot because you are missing the point grossly  Art is very strange  because not everyone understand it  Maybe some of you will never understand this novel  but I will try to share some of my thoughts  not all  because of the language  and hope some of you agree with me  The Catcher in the Rye is the most down to earth book I ve ever read  Holden IS REAL  Salinger made an incredible character and you can feel him like a real person  It s funny how Holden s thoughts and impressions about art and life are developed in the making of the novel  Holden  and Salinger  says he hates falsehood  Then  he hates the cinema  the corny books   they always have a character named David    the  phony  people  he hates when Ernie is playing the piano in a  phony way   when the actors of a play fail to represent truly a character    All those hatreds are thoughts and opinions about art and life from an artistic point of view and A Catcher in the Rye meets these thoughts  is a raw AND TRUE novel with true dialogues  true characters  true thougths and centered on Holden  an extremely alive and true character  This novel it s about true life and that s amazing  It s outstanding the way we can enter Holden s brain and follow every thought  feeling and movement  We can know much more about Holden than most of you will ever know about your own friends  As I said before  this is not a pretentious novel or candidate to win a Nobel prize and IT S NOT the objective  remember  the author and Holden hate when Ernie is ruining songs by making horrible flourish  Also  we have to remember the whole novel it s a speech given by Holden  so it s not going to be any phony or pretentious  The objective of the novel is only TO BE TRUE and to speak about life with all his baseness but with a little of hope  It s pure art because it s pure expression  Holden and the novel reminds me of Le Petit Prince and a little bit of L Etranger  Holden is like a grown version of Le Petit Prince  travelling around the city   the universe   and running into  different planets  with people who annoys him and he is pity on them  But he is older now  and he reacts in a different way  he is anger  disappointed and he can t handle his feelings  Then  he is autodestructive  live an empty life and he is a nihilist  Like L etranger  The Catcher in the Rye conveys us nihilist thoughts and feelings through Holden s life  That s why sometimes you can feel that nothing is going on but IT IS ON PURPOSE  As L Etranger  The Catcher in the Rye tries to show us an empty life  the boredom that hides feelings of helplessness and desperate  Salinger tries to show this  through a boy doing nothing in particular during two or three days  That s why I m saying this book is art  expression  an extremely deep novel with a great plot  A LOT of content and thoughts  and we can learn very much  Holden is an artist and he struggles with the conflicts of an artist  indeed  he is a good writer  according the novel   but it s very easy just to say that  he is a teenager  and to criticize this book because of the language  I have even read this novel and the character of Holden are subversive  This is funny  because Holden does not want to hurt anyone nor to create chaos  and he doesn t encourages people to share his ideas or commit crime  He is disgusted  disappointed  anguished  lonely  he can not see the road and that s it  This novel is very dynamic as we are in Holden s brain thinking what he is thinking and remembering what he is remembering step by step and he always do something  It s great how the little things can cause him a depression or a great happiness  and that is the real heart of an artist  The problem of Holden is that he can t find happiness whatever he do and wherever he goes and that leads him to an empty existence  The novel also has a lot of simbolism  Holden is psychologically interesting  dynamic and interesting dialogues  Mr Antonelli  for example   interesting characters and a lot of beauty in small things  Holden and the author believe in the beauty of little things that not everyone can see them  Also  Holden has a story with a little brother  When his little brother died  Holden broke the windows harming his hand for ever  It s not said  but Holden remember this episode any time  he only has to close his hand and it will hurt and then he will remember the day that his brother die  That s a great example of the beauty  a painful beauty in this case  of this novel  This novel is about existence  death  sadness  feeling lost and lonely  hating  disgust  society but IT S ALSO ABOUT love  remember how much Holden loves his sister  his brother and Jane   searching of happiness  hope  remember the dialogue with Mr Antonelli   sensitivity  tenderness and the big heart of Holden  It is not said that Holden is right  I clarify this because it is a sensitive point among critics of this novel   One of the dilemmas in this novel is whether Holden is right or wrong  Almost all the characters believe he is wrong and he feels like an idiot and that he is not right  but he can not think otherwise  Here  to follow this dilemma and to offer some answers  it appears the conversation with Mr Antonelli  Antonelli provides a bridge between society and Holden  makes a very convincing speech from school  society and adulthood  in fact  he s the voice of the critics of the novel   However  to continue with the dilemma whether Holden or society is right  Antonelli touchs Holden s hair while he s sleeping  This is an assurance to Holden  he thinks Antonelli is spotted like the rest of society and he feels isolated from society again  It is poignant to read the memories of Holden  and the casual manner in which they arise  as in real life   how he loves Jane and her brothers and how dearly loves the small details   he does not care if she Keeps her kings in the back row or not    His love  is similar to Le Petit Prince s love and his rose   If you can truly understand this novel and Holden  you ll love it  Even if you can not understand him  it s a great novel  remember that it is not said that Holden is right   During the novel  many of the characters seemed cynical with Holden and they don t undersand him  I think The Cather in the Rye is so bright that even in real life there are people who see Holden boring  If we all understand  the novel would have less sense  The thoughts about life   to be and not to be    the nothing  are very popular and interesting among the greatest novels and writers of all time  but people in this web for any reason doesn t like them in these novel  I m sure Holden would be really disappointed and sad if he read these comments  because you are not actually reading and putting focus on this book  Once  I ve read a book that said that a Russian could say thousands of truths to a classroom full of people  but no one would understand him  No matter how many times he repeats them or how strong he talks  The original text is so long so I had to cut it short  reluctantly  and delete the work cited as well  P First published in 1951  The Catcher in the Rye continues to be one of the most popular novels ever written as well as one of the most frequently banned books in the United States   Salzman  head page  To some degree  The Catcher in the Rye arouses people s attention to individuals  particularly to an alienated teenager in this context  which leads to a continual discussion about teenagers  painful growth  In a typical example  Daniel F  Davis and Norman Langer  authors of A History of the United States Since 1945  argue that Holden s  adventures say a great deal about the worth of the individual in American society  They also remind readers how vulnerable every individual can be    71  This is true  in looking into Holden s character and the world he lives in  we can see so many instances which give us a deep impression of the cruel world and how it beats down a unique individual    Some critics interpreted The Catcher in the Rye under a post war background  I would rather look at it in a postindustrial world  or in other words  from my perspective  The Catcher in the Rye is narrated more in a postmodern circumstances  The context of this specific book  not only tells a boy s adventures in a period of time  moreover  it shows how an individual has been socialized and how an individual is left helpless with his own fate      If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before the had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap      Salinger  1  At the beginning of the novel  Salinger makes his hero refuse the reader this kind of biographical information  which Holden finds boring and irrelevant and too  personal   Salinger s postmodernist unease with the culture and literature of inner direction is based on a perception that American society  at the middle class level  is no longer operating through rugged individualism although vestiges of the old ideology remain   Salzman  68     In a world all that people think of is to  make a lot of dough and buy a goddam Cadillac   Holden is totally a jerk  Everyone has something to pursue and you always have to be like other people if you do not want to be called a freak or a madman  That is everybody s fate  no one can deny it  otherwise you will lose the game of life      Perhaps the most impressive of Holden is his being different from all the other people  his peers  his teacher  all the other people in this society and even his beloved little sister Phoebe  When everyone else is all the same except you  you are destined to be the one to get hurt  This is what Holden has to face      Holden seems so weird and alienated in a world  people never notice anything   9   while he still thinks about the ducks in Central Park and wondering where would the ducks go  he cares that  a girl kept all her kings in the back row   and he cherishes the hope that one day he can go away and live in the mountains  This delicate concern for the creatures of nature  sensitivity to the mysteries of nature  and cares about the innocence are beyond other people s perspective ability  To deal with a different case  people whether assimilate it or oppress it  Similarly  being different can lead to two separate ways  one way may bring people s admire and appreciation  yet it is still based on a certain common ground  However  the other way may cause an understanding failure  hostility and even deprivation  Apparently  Holden s case leads to the second way  which makes him confused  always depressed  and cynical      When Mr  Spencer told him  life is a game that one plays according to the rules   Holden refused to take  since he never believes that life is a game  In fact  he believes the opposite   he is so serious about life  he cares every detail of life  But this world is never meant for one as Holden  it is a world where everybody else is playing the game  so if you play against it or not according to the rules  you get kicked out   Game  my ass  Some game  If you get on the side where all the hot shots are  then it s a game  all right  I ll admit that  But if you get on the other side  where there aren t any hot shots  then what s a game about it  Nothing  No game    Salinger  8  As I see it  these words is not only scorn and sneer  it is Holden s rebellion and revolt  He does not want to play according to some rules he disagrees with  so he tries to break out and go away     Holden is endlessly called upon to perform in this way  to sense other people s needs  to negotiate his way into and out of interpersonal situations with teachers  fellow students  cab drivers  brothers and sisters  What Salinger shows through Holden is someone cracking up and breaking down under the pressure of a society in which social leisure and communication have become full time occupations  The culture of the adolescent has been invaded by the needs of personnel management and diplomacy     Along with Holden s lonely hunting in New York City  we see what Holden sees  we feel what Holden feels  Through the encounters with different kind of people  Holden tastes the bitters of life  a life outside the fences of prep schools  a life that is more real  yet even more tough and harsh  Cab drivers  the prostitute Sunny and her pimp Maurice  the piano player old Ernie  Carl Luce the expert on sex  they all teach Holden a lesson  But I am not sure how much Holden has learned     There are many special individuals in the literature world similar to Holden in some ways  such as Mark Twain s Huckleberry Finn  Jack Kerouac s antihero Dean and F  Scott Fitzgerald s Gatsby  The all seek for some kind of dream and freedom  but unlike the rest  Holden has no place to go and he is totally let down by the entire world   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any    Salinger  204  Holden says  So he dreams about going away and hiding in the mountains  He dreams of a Huck Finn like asylum  a cabin in the woods that he would build after he went  somewhere out West where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobody d know me   a place where  I d have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me   So that if D  B  came to visit  he couldn t write any movies in my cabin  only stories and books   Salinger  198 205  These fantasies reflects his failure in the real world  there is not a place that he can call his own  he always feels uneasy about whoever is with him  But what he pictures in his mind is only a dream  the asylum he finally fids  out west  is for the insane    He can find in the real world no sanctuary  no place to call his own  a dilemma that is not only adjunct to his existential angst but one that is warranted by what it meant to be a kid in the forties  for whom a car of one s own was just another impossible dream   But at least Kerouac s antihero knows where he is heading and what he is hoping to find  a romantic  even a quixotic and one completely different from Holden s aimless   roundabout wanderings  Whether you style it a  quest  or a  flight   Holden s trip has no final destination  being a passage without a rite    Salzman  27      The fear of change also acts on Holden s loneliness and depression  When someone is in a world full of changes  the most probable feeling he might have are insecure and uncertainty  Life changes  people come and go  beloved one dies  kids grow up  and you have to deal with all the loss and absence  Although Holden claims that  I never care too much when I lose something    I never seem to have anything that if I lost it I d care too much   Salinger  89   he clearly does have some experiences and individuals in his past that he does worry about having lost   Being entirely alone is on of his greatest sources of pain   Salzman  51  Even his fantasies of escaping west or to the woods involve being with someone  For him  loneliness and depression go hand in hand      Every time when Holden feels really depressed  he talks to his dead brother Allie  During his terrifying walk up Fifth Avenue  he also talks to Allie  However  he does not pray to Allie to save him from dying but rather asks him repeatedly   Allie  don t let me disappear   198   The worst thing in the world is not the thought of dying  it is the thought of being forgotten   The solipsistic action of merely talking to himself is not enough to confirm his presence and identity   Salzman  51       I m sorry I told so many people about it  About all I know is  I sort of miss everybody I told about  Even old Stradlater and Ackley  for instance  I think I even miss that goddam Maurice  It s funny  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   When Holden finishes all the narrative  he is segregated from all the people for the moment  Partly because it is impossible for any individual to break away from other people and the society  you always have to go back to the normal life anyway  Sadly  this world is never meant for an individual like Holden  It is the reality we have to face  and it may be a paradox that will never be solve     This timeless coming of age classic stages a conformity adverse Holden Caulfield  against many common struggles and evils of society in the 1950s  and today  Being controversial in its day for its prolific motifs of sex sexuality  anti hero Caulfield struggles with finding meaning to life  and a reason to conform with society s strict structure  I enjoyed this novel for its fluid  colloquial narrator  Holden Caulfield  and his relatable narration of his ideas and events that happen from his memory  Holden s constant trials with himself and his own life makes the plot engaging and thrilling  While challenging many norms and  rules  of society  Holden proves to be a relatable and understandable teenage narrator I would recommend this novel to every teen and adult  Its coherent and smooth narration is fully complimented with dark and dirty humor  while still challenging many ideals of society  including the dangers and benefits of conformity   It was a wintry day in December 2005 when I laid my hands on this book after persistent remarks by a friend saying  you are going to Love Holden Caulfield man  you are going to love this book for your life  if you read it once   It was a statement that could turn on any book reader lover  I took  Catcher in the Rye  in my hand and the first thing I searched in the dictionary was the meaning of the word RYE  The meaning didn t satisfy me so I thought i will get to know the meaning of the title when i finish reading the book  With that hope  I dwelled with the book and I was surprised that I am besieged by F words  Texts full of slangs  abuses and a 17 years lad s quest for life  Holden Caulfield seemes to be a highly frustrated adult who does not know what to do out of life  He is a character for whom the world surrounding is an endless serpent which is killing the very existence of his happiness  Through out the book  Caulfield loathes the people in his family  except for his sister   in his locality and people as people around the globe  The frustration of Caulfield brought an equal disgust about the book  I didnt find a single thing to like about this book  In a rage to finish it and to finish all the torments of my world  I read the book in one sitting and decided not to look back at it Things changed  from winter came the summer and with time  my views about the book changed completely  After just one year  in December 2006  I felt that there is a Caulfield in me  there is a Caulfield who resides in each one of us who is nonchalantly frustrated and does not belong to this place  The words of the book came crashing into my dreams and I realised that I have become A CATCHER IN THE RYE   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everbody  Salinger s stream of consciousness style brings out everything Holden is as a person  not a character  Holden is the every man  er boy  and his experiences and thought processes are so real  it s as if Salinger was in the mind of a teenager when he wrote it  Although Holden hates the artificial  his own personality is sometimes just that which makes him one of the most ironic characters I have ever met  When asked why he wouldn t allow a movie to be made of his book  Salinger responded by saying that he couldn t do that to Holden  he hated movies and there was no way Salinger would put him in one  Dedication to a character and motiff have unfortunately  become a thing of the past   Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry   The Perks of Being a Wallflower leads me to this book  I love it so much  As much as I love The Perks of Being a Wallflower  Coping with depression will never be easy  When we thought that we are living a normal life  we actually don t  How Salinger portray Holden leads a normal life  but I knew that he wasn t  He seems to hate everything he sees  But deep inside I felt that we are actually like that  We do hate everyone and everything sometimes  especially when we are too depress to face the world  Maybe that s what Holden felt  Lastly  thank you Salinger  I guess this is my kind of book  Tenth graders should read The Catcher in the Rye because it talks about the challenges that kids go through to stay alive  The part where Maurice  the pimp  beats holden up might not happen to kids now but facing and older  bigger guy is something most boys have to face  Being  yellow  or not being  yellow  is a decision guys have to make regularly  Teens should read book  yn khtb rw tqryb ykh w nym br khwndmntwr dsht ykhy z tthyrgdhrtryn khtbhy dby dnyst w b Dy nHTT hy nsny    r bh jm h gwshzd my knd whwldn khlfyd mnw yd

this  I found it too obscene and too much  slangy  but as you go on  you will realize that it has a story to tell   about teenage alienation that each of us humans experienced  I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Catcher in the Rye  As I was reading the story  I was wondering who or what was the  catcher in the rye   And then  toward the end of the story  Holden explains it when he sees himself as a catcher  Children are running wild in a field of rye and he is standing near the edge of a cliff and catches the children so they won t fall  Professor Antolini said that Holden was heading for a fall  I asked myself who in the book was the real  catcher in the rye  for Holden  Who would catch him and prevent him from falling off the cliff  And then while reading the last few pages  I realized that Phoebe  Holden s little sister  was his  catcher in the rye   I highly recommend this book to readers  and I hope you find it as interesting and wonderful as I have found it to be  Well  I believe this is like a Historical account  if you can say that for a certain  age   Many have suggested that most of the controversial  totally misleading sentences should be removed from Mein Kampf  Hitler s autobiography   And some wise people oppposed them  And all of them finally agreed on one thing   It s a historical document and lets leave it that way  Why did they concur on that particular opinion  Because whether it s misleading or not  that book suggests the mood  the position  the behavior of that particular being  whoever he is  in that moment of his life  One can learn about him by reading that book  unless the one is gullible  I too concur with their opinion  none of the words in that autobiography should be changed Well  the reason I m saying that here is   The Catcher in the Rye  is not only a Novel but also a representation of the teenage angst and also a representation of how a teenager  having not been effectively powerful in the society yet  tries to calm himself down from all the frustration he faces everyday  He rants continuously  to his friends  At least to himself  About how unfair the world is  About how phony everybody is  Tries to do it with a hooker  Does cheap tricks to get himself a girl friend  calls her after he s drunk   Imagines himself as a war hero or something when the world is not recognizing him well  But he isn t a bad person  It s just that teenage period of life  Not much in hand  Not youth yet  Teenage  Mind is still maturing  Want to do a lot  Don t know exactly what to do  World seems phony  Unfair  And rant  along with being a Novel  this book is a teenage boy s rant  His typical teenage efforts to solve his typical teenage physical and psychological problems You see  that s what makes this book special  This book is a portrayal of the Teenage  Most people see it as a misguiding book  They say it spreads a wrong message  But this is not about that  It s an exact excellently accurate portrayal of Teenage and the mood everybody goes through at that time  For that sir  I gave this book a five out of five  It s refreshing to experience an unfiltered mind  especially with all the swearing  Reminded me of how I felt when reading Perks of Being a Wallflower  and how it compares to The Stranger   Cynical and psychological  Salinger s Catcher in the Rye serves its purpose well  In fact  what could be more morose than following the teenage sardonic protagonist  Holden Caulfield  around for a few days  Dreary and illicit  pathetic and captivating  if there is one thing the reader can glean after finishing this novel  is that Holden really is one sad sack of a human being   not unlike myself This psychological realistic novel will project a self examination onto the reader  and make the critical of their internal wants  and their existential actions  Certainly  for me  this is exactly what it did If there was one theme that stuck out to me throughout the novel  it was Holden s relationship to his ten year old sister  Phoebe  Although Holden is six years older than Phoebe  their mutual affection for each other is one of close knit sibling love that is only bred out of dysfunctional living situations  and traumatic events that bind the two together Reflecting on this theme  it got me really thinking about my relationship with my little sister  13   who is ten years my junior  Previously  I hadn t enjoyed an especially close relationship with my little sister  as I figured we just didn t have  anything in common   Phoebe s child like trust of Holden  and ethos like respect for her older brother helped me realize that I can enjoy that privileged relationship with my sister if I make the effort From the time I finished the novel hitherto  about a year and a half   my relationship with my little sister was grown infinitely  I ve realized she s not just a  little kid  anymore  and took the action to form a deeper bond with her  We talk everyday  hang out  and even have tons of inside jokes  I m thankful for this growth between her and I  and am looking forward to a deeper bond as we grow closer to each other in the future  For all of this  I have Phoebe and Holden to thank  Many tears I have cried over their relationship throughout Sallinger s narrative  and many more I will cry in the future Brent McCulley  11 4 13  This was the one of the very first books that opened my eyes to the wealth of classic literature  I have always been a voracious reader  but growing up it was more likely to be the Baby Sitters Club Boxed Set  1 series  or Sweet Valley High  rather than something that Rory Gilmore might approve of Several years ago I started reading more classic books and the quality of writing blew me away  The Old Man and the Sea and The Catcher in the Rye where the first two books that made me appreciate the skill of the writer I didn t like the story but I loved the writing style  Every sentence left me wondering why it had taken me so long to read good literature I didn t like Holden Caulfield at all  and I felt the book was a whiny ramble about nothing  Having said that I am keen to read it a second time to see how I appreciate it differently  I have lately found great value in reading a book along with a book club  as the discussion opens up a book Usually I write reviews immediately  however it has been five years since I read this book  I am being heavily influence by a radio discussion on Books and Arts Daily  Australia s ABC Radio National  that I listened to last week I have to throw out a vote for Logan Lerman as the perfect actor to play Holden  I saw him in  Gamer  and he was just dark and angry enough to play it well   I know that Salinger isn t releasing movie rights  and I think that is kind of cool too   This is the first book of Salinger s that I wrote strictly because it was a  Classic  I hadn t read  I didn t know what to expect because the book doesn t give you a great idea Now  with The Catcher in the Rye  there are two types of people 1  You love it  You relate with Holden and you find the book all in all fantastic   me 2  You find Holden just another annoying  angsty teen and can t stand the book It all depends on how you are as a person with if you re going to enjoy said book or not From my experience  a lot more artistic people have a better appreciation for this book  If you re more judgmental towards idiotic things  this book is not for you Salinger has a million ways to say just a few things  It s rather amusing  His dry  dark  sense of humor has a nice ring to it  His books always made me do that little giggle in the middle of reading a simple paragraph It s not so much WHAT the book is about  but more so the experience the writer put down   Still an all time favorite for sure   Holden Caulfield was my angst Holden Caulfield was my shield Holden Caulfield was my innocence Holden Caulfield was my End of an Era If you have a problem with that  then you re a goddam phony   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die  and they stick me in a cemetery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive  in fact    Finally happy to have read this after all these years  I understand why it s a classic and why so many people find it for the first time every year  If you re over the age of 18  don t read it  If you re under the age of 18  read it four times  I decided to see what this book was like because there is a bit of controversy in the UK at the moment  the school curriculum is probably going to be changed to only include British authors  and this is therefore one of the books going to be dumped  creating much wailing and gnashing of teeth from educationalists I was certain that I d never read it before  but about a quarter of the way through my memory was jogged and I realised that I had  Can t for the life of me remember when though  Certainly wasn t at school but it was a long time ago  I don t think any films have been made of it either as the author was dead set against it A Catcher in the Rye is a great book  Set  mostly  in New York during the 1940s it follows a few days in the life of over privileged and over alienated Holden  a boy of 16 or 17  He has just dropped out of boarding school and is travelling by himself round the big city before his parents find out  It is narrated in the first person to allow you hear his inner monologue The author hits the emotional and psychological turmoil of being a teenager dead on  it was written in the 40s but the story applies to any era  Everything is black and white to Holden  there are no grey areas  Although what is black one minute can be white the next  And if you are not with him  you are against him and he hates you  The desperation to grow up is balanced by his obvious need for an adult   or at least more mature   presence  obvious to us  but not him  nicely done   His naive escapades with drink and sex are quite cringe making in their truths From a purely historical and foreign perspective reading the slang used by the youth of 40s and 50s America is interesting in itself and gives it a sense of authenticity  I ve no idea if American teenagers really spoke like that  but when substituting the modern British equivalents it doesn t seem unrealistic in terms of the style of dialogue at least I probably appreciate this a lot more as an adult than when I first read it  Perhaps the passage of time makes the trauma of teenage years a bit clearer  Recommended for anyone who thinks that the films  Pump up the Volume  and  Ferris Bueller s Day Off  are the last words in American teen rebellion  Salinger got there first  I know that the novel  the catcher in the Rye  is a very crazy book  But what people don  t realize is that Holden it s not the main problem   It is the fact that he was emotionally beaten into his bad vibe attitude  It is a common and repeating theme of life and society today  Many people suffer the same problems as Holden because other bad people influenced a completely stupid and negative way upon the victims like Holden   For example bully s and people who emotionally hurt others are the main cause of others emotional pain  Another reason why Holden and other victims are the way they are is because people who enjoy to bully others and don t care how much pain and damage they create  So don t get mad at Holden get mad a his source of hurt  And if this review comment does t let you see the truth then you are being the bully your self  And finally remember how the other half really lives I love this book  but wait  I know those who run away when that phrase is spoken about this book  Let me explain why i like it  Now before we start I do openly admit my bias about this book  I own four copies of it  Three of the Little Brown versions  and a Penguin edition  This novel  like i assume most people who like this book  came in my life when it suited best  I was around 14 15 the first time I read the book  It spoke to me  as a friend who knew exactly what I was going through  I went to a small religious school  not unlike Pencey  I knew a guy like Ackley  we all know a guy like Ackley  My best friend at the time was the essence of Stradlater  This novel was the literate and angst filled friend I never had  I know the novel is generally like by men more than women  I don t think it has anything to do with the profanity  like my English teacher was proud of saying  she was proud of herself that she was appalled by such a book she also admitted she never was able to get through the first chapter   she was always a wee bit self righteous  I am not really sure why most of the girls  I know that is  who have read it  do not like it  This book was a lifeboat  in the sea of adolescence  I do think it helps to read this novel younger  After reading it years later  it seems less poignant  This book  contrary to what some think  is not  for everyone   It is like The Smiths  There music is wonderful  but sometimes I don t feel like hearing about picnics at cemetery gates and death by bus  When i do though  it is the only music that can consul a sad soul   The Catcher in the Rye gives a very realistic view of the world today  If a reader goes into this book with no preconception of what it s about the reader may be turned off by the swearing and a few vulgar scenes  but nothing in the book is gratuitous  Salinger is trying to demonstrate that so many things that people do in our culture are very fake  The main character of the book is a young adult who is trying to find himself in a confusing world  but can t seem to do it because he is unable to find anything genuine  Although the book is about an young adult  I would not recommend this to a younger audience  but it would be great for an older young adult  There are a few scenes in the book that may turn some away from reading it  but a mature audience is perfect for this book  The story is very relatable because the instances depicted happen in many people s lives  We see someone do something and we realize how fake that is  The main character has a hard time acting fake and is unable to be a part of society  There are some really great questions presented by this book  It is a must read for any American adult because it lends great insight into some of the terrible things people do while trying to find a genuine relationship  I like this book because J D Salinger does a beautiful job of writing a book which sums up a nearly all of teen emotions and thoughts that are almost always disregarded  Thrown aside as they have no value or merit  He captures the sudden decisions  the momentum gained after you ve decided  and the regret when you realize what you ve done  The indecisiveness  the arbitrary decisions and the hatred of facades  J D  Salinger captures all of these things  characteristic to the average teen and more  in this book The Catcher in the Rye  That s why it s a classic  It s connects to every generation and to every teen with universal themes like keeping appearances  maintaining good grades  maintaining relationships  dealing with a loss  being the disappointment in your family  and being socially awkward at school  This book is a beautiful work of a teen s mind and I would recommend it to anyone  I think of The Catcher in the Rye as Salinger s portrait of the artist as a young man  Holden Caulfield is more than just a sensitive boy going through teenage rebellion as he wrestles with the phonies  and I can t help but think Holden s internal conflicts were not unlike those experienced by great artists such as John Lennon and Kurt Cobain in their teen years  When Holden rails against the phonies I am reminded of Lennon s lines from  Gimme Some Truth   and when Holden yearns to protect the children I hear Lennon s  Imagine   The Catches in the Rye is in my opinion one of the best books i ever had to read in school  because the book really manages to capture the essence of growing up  Holden is a very relatable character  because to some extent we all are just like him  Holden s problems in the book are also very realistic  Most people experience or will experience at some point the same problems Holden had  maybe not as extensively or in such a short period of time like it happened to Holden but they will happen  and most people will feel like Holden did to some extent  But the best thing in the book must be how well it captures growing up  Growing up is filled with problems  possibly not as big as holdens but it is tough nevertheless  but no matter how hard growing up is you are still able to restart and learn from your mistakes and come out of it stronger that you where and wiser  but also rethink your priorities and have a whole new perspective on life  like holden demonstrated in the book  I think it s the downside of being an introvert  but I observe things more than usual  More often than not  the people I observe strike me as fake  That is what made me relate to Holden s viewpoint  I could totally understand his situation  Plus  the way the book is written is so funny that I didn t feel like putting it down  Also  I felt it was kind of a more adult version of  The perks of being a wallflower   which is a book I really liked   This book was an assigned book in my school  Generally I like all the books I read  until my teacher pulls them apart  and I realize they aren t what I thought they were  but as I have thought about this book more and more  I realized that J D  Salinger hits on many themes that relate my life  and the life of my younger brothers  I thought that This book  was truly an amazing book  even as my teacher pulled it apart  I love the symbolism  especially they kind of weird and abstract symbolism  If you are teenager who has not read this book  and may or may not be struggling with the idea of maturing  this is a must read    Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   The Catcher in the Rye by J D SalingerHave you ever been into school out of state and away from your parents  The fact that you are expelled from the college that you were attending and unable to face the truth  Holden was able to experience everything i just talked about in this book  Holden often criticizes the students and staff members of Pencey for being  phony   After he was expelled from the school  he returns to New York and stays in a hotel since his family did not know about his expulsion  Holden did not want his parents to notice that he had fail to meet their requirements to attend college  Holden spent the night dancing with 3 girls and also ended up at the Museum of Natural History and encounter with many other people  While Holden also misses his sister one time and he tries to slip inside his parents apartment in order to see how she is doing  Holden is not the typical teenager that you would see on a daily basis and he have to do a lot of traveling alone  It is a great book that describes how a lost teenager was able to find his true identity  I would recommend this book to all the teenagers and it would help shape up your personal goals in order to become successful in life   The Catcher in the Rye was a really good book  It took place like in the 50 s or 60 s  Its about Holden and hes journey in New York  he got kicked out of high school and doesn t want to tell his parents  He decides to run away to New York and stay there until the thanksgiving break and then go back home  He had to learn to survive on his own  because he was only depending on himself  He calls to meet up with some friends but they all end up not talking to him or not liking him  He had to waste a lot of money on going to the hotels and buying food  he was on a short budget though  and he also wasted lots of money on unnecessary things  He goes to visit his sister to see if she will her  and she does  She gives him money and promises not to tell their parents  Holden is a very crazy person  He tells this girl he hasn t seen in a long time that they should get married and run away  He also kept calling her in the middle of the night  Even though his parents weren t there and weren t suppose to know he was there  he decide to smoke in his sisters room  when his parents came back he was hiding  Phoebe had to pretend she was smoking to coverup for his brother  By the end of the book he realizes his mistakes and decides to do home  The ending of the book was bad because it didn t say what hes parents said when he went home  or what he did after  But at least Holden realized that he had to do that right thing and go home  or maybe he ran out of money  Catcher in the Rye had a huge impact on me as a kid because I understood it  I don t think most people understand Salinger s purpose with it and that s why they don t like it  Holden s character is an exaggeration parody of how so many adolescents feel and think  When I was a kid  yes  I can say that I often times felt the same things as Holden but I took up the book as a calling to not think like he does  I learned that judging people like Holden Caulfield is not what we should do in this world  And people don t realize what Salinger has done here  Holden is so complex  Salinger is brilliant by creating such a recognizeable and emotional character  Everybody knows how Holden would be in real life if we were to meet him  We might even know some Holden Caulfield s out there   I recently finished this  and I m giving  Catcher  5 stars in my nearly useless attempt to pump up the review average  which sits at a paltry 3 76  which seems inappropriately low  Yes  this book can be credibly argued as overrated  Yes  the protagonist of Holden Caulfield is completely whiny  self obsessed  and his observations that most adults are phonies is really just a classic case of what psychologists would call  projection   Yes  all these things are true    but to all the pretentious pseudo intellectual windbags on Goodreads that gave this book 1 star  my message is  Get over yourself already  One freaking star  Are you kidding me  You do realize that 1 star indicates a book of very poor quality  right  You do realize that it s not supposed to be a reflection of that fact that you may have hated the main character or some such superficial reason  One star  Is that supposed to be some joke  I could understand maybe giving it 2 stars  i e   average      sort of    maybe    but 1 star  So the writing quality  the caustic and often funny anecdotes  the themes presented    yeah  that s just all crap  right  Phonies  Whatever  My favourite book  Also the only book I have read more than once  I have read it about 5 times  When I first read it as a 17 year old girl catching the train to her office job  I could not believe how many times I was thinking  me too  about a story of a 16 year old private school boy in New York circa 1950  I love a  me too  moment in a book and this masterpiece has plenty of them  This book definitely lived up to its hype with me  I can t believe how long it took me to finally read this  I could tell why this book was a classic   If you are a grown up  keeps a bit of a child inside  it s special  I felt nothing sort of great but it kept me reading till the very end  And it winds up nicely with lot of cool kid kind stuff  Review from 7 31 12 re read Pretty much by now everyone knows the story of Holden Caulfield  He s a troubled teen that s flunked out of every school he s been to  But he doesn t seem to care too much  or at least that s the front that he puts on for everyone  He s just failed out of his fourth school in a row  Pencey Prep  and has been told not to return after Christmas break  After calling everyone phonies numerous times and getting into a fight with his roommate  he decides to pack his bags and leave early  spending a few days in New York City  There he spirals into a horrible depression and drinks himself into a stupor  trying to figure out the next step in his life  seemingly having just one thing keeping him going  his younger sister Phoebe  the love of his life  I read this book in high school and loved it then  and I loved it now as well  but for entirely different reasons  I identified with Holden back then  He was lost and didn t identify with anyone and felt all alone  Now I just felt incredibly sad and sorry for him  He was clearly miserable and confused and depressed and I felt at any time that he could just snap and end it all  He was such a clear representation of a teenager in distress  it was heartbreaking at times  But since he was such a real teenager he was also incredibly annoying  One minute he loved something or someone and the very next he hated it  Boy  do I remember that  And he s busy judging everyone for everything and at the same time he really needed to take a good long look at himself  As his sister pointed out  I just wanted him to definitely say one thing that he truly really liked  actually liked  But mostly I just felt like he needed a big hug  He needed help  And his sister  his little sister that was only ten years old  was the one that saw him the best  for what he was and she still loved him anyway  I mean  the ending  which I don t want to spoil for those who haven t read it  was really beautiful with the two of them together I still  to this day  have never read a novel that had such a true to life representation of a teenager and teen angst  if you will  as this one  Maybe many people don t see the benefit of being able to speak in that type of voice or being able to tell that kind of story but I think it s incredible  This remains one of my all time favorite books      Probably the first book I read and really fell in love with  Salinger just makes Holden seem so real  I read it in high school and finally felt like someone understood me  I think that s why it resonates with so many people  Because you read it as a teenager and finally feel like you re not alone in the world  That s what I got from it at least   People I know from the industry used to come   tell me about this one book that started it all   the novel which gave birth to a whole new genre  After reading it  All I can say is  I feel cleansed This book goes beyond any regular norms set aside for novels  This is what remains if you cut a soul open and leave it out to dry  This is truly an immortal piece of literature  There are many guys around whom I don t really like  They are all phony  One of them told me that he has read the catcher in the rye and it is his favorite  That killed me  It s alway like that  People you don t like  like what you like   This novel was an exciting and quick paced read  It was hard to put down at times  The main character  Holden and the setting of some sort of mental hospital was interesting to read  Normally  I shy away from listening to stories from mental patients  but having a deeper sense of the emotions and struggles that they endure gave me a little better perspective on them  Holden s struggle to fit in and keep going is difficult  and reading his personal stories on why it is allows me to have a deeper appreciation for his life  Side characters such as Allie  Phoebe  Maurice gave the novel an important level of depth that made the novel intriguing   It took me up until 6 years ago to read this because of the amount of hype that was pushed at me about this book  It was like people telling you that the Beatles are the best band who ever lived and everyday someone asks you  Have you heard the Beatles   I don t know about you but for me after a while I was like  Fuck you  I will never read that goddamn book as long as I live   But I did and I loved it  I read it faster than I have ever read any other book  How could you stop  You just have to keep going and find out what s on the next page  I had heard how nuts this kids was from everybody and I read it and thought   This kids not nuts  he s just a kid and actually so am I and I feel like this too   Truly a masterpiece as it is said it is  no interest in being popular or social  From the very beginning he lets us into part of his personal life  His parents are very touchy and his mother is especially protective  It becomes clear very quickly where Holdens interests lie and where they start to veer off  He tends to lean away from the fake in the world and is a teller of what is real  Holden is not a fan of the movies at all  He saw his brother D B  throw away his natural writing talent all for a large Hollywood check  Any other boy Holdens age would have been absolutely ecstatic to have a sibling working amongst the stats in Hollywood  but not Holden  It was all far too phony for him and phony is his worst enemy  Salingers use of sarcasm and irony is beautiful and hilarious  As I read through each chapter I found myself highlighting funny  sarcastic things Holden would say or think and trust me  there are dozens of time where this occurs One specific time in Chapter 8 he is talking to a cab driver who is acting like a real fool  Holden says to the readers   He certainly was good company  Terrific personality I remember reading this book as a teenager  and just thinking it was ok  I remember I enjoyed it  but I couldn t really relate to Holden  I guess because I thought he was too judgmental of people  However  after reading it again  I really liked it  I love how descriptive Sallinger is in giving us Holden s hilarious internal dialogue  Somehow I related to him more when I read it as someone in my mid twenties  especially with regard to how  phony   a word he uses a lot  people can be I guess me liking it after reading it a second time goes along with what Holden says   Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   I read some of the criticisms of this book and they all made me laugh although at some parts they were correct  This is one of the greatest classical books ever written and I cannot believe that it has only received about 3 75 in ratings  This is the kind of book that teenagers can relate to  the kind of book that is so brilliant and modernistic that those who have truly read it can never cease to be amazed that the book was written not by a teenager but by a mature adult who can still recall about how it feels like to be a teenager  This is the kind of book that people usually hate because of their seeming to be dense characters that are truly realistic in nature  It was written in the 1950s  mind you  And also it tackles about the issues of teenagers  People might regard this book as too whiny but it s actually because the character is whiny and that s just how the author wanted to portray him  This is the story of Holden Caulfield  a sixteen year old boy that is telling the story of the events that happened over a few days in New York that led to him getting Tuberculosis  This story is very relatable for most teens because Holden is very insecure and has trouble commiting to anything he does  which is why he is always Flunking out of the schools he goes too  This book is hard to put down because the author tells us what Holden is thinking and its very interesting to see how the character in the book has similar thoughts about things going on in his life  The author puts you inside Holdens head  you get to see how he thinks and what he wants  I recommend this book to teens and adults because it has something for everyone  Holden s story is very easy to relate to for most teens  because he feels alienated and completely different from everyone else that he encounters in the book  I like this book a lot because Holden thinks a lot like me  We both have similar views about people and school  He is in many ways similar to how teens are today  insecure about alot of things and nervous around girls and all of that normal stuff  I really enjoyed this book and i recommend it to teens and adults  I think that we should still read it in high school because it has something for everyone  I think people should read this book because Holden is a very interesting main character  the decisions that he makes and the way that the society was like in the 1960 s really keeps the pages turning  Everything was so different in the 1960 s compared to today  kids were smoking cigarettes and drinking at a really young age  Holden travels around by himself and does whatever he wants without telling his parent  the society that he lived in is completely different than the way that ours works nowadays  Overall this book was extremely good and I d recommend it to anyone  The author makes it very relatable and interesting for everyone  I also read this book in high school  probably in 1980  I have loved this book ever since I still liked the book but I look at it a little differently  In high school I saw Holden as a rebel  a kid who had a lot of guts  Now  as an adult and a parent of two boys  I see a sad  desperate  depressed boy who needs help and a lot of love  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger was a marvelous book that contains various life lessons throughout itself  The novel is told in a first person point of view by a teenager named Holden Caulfield who seems to have many problems and issues with life  some can say with his a very misunderstood person while others can say he is corrupted  Many people say that Holden is very misunderstood because he does not seem to have any really friends and because not a lot of people know Holden really well  Other readers can say his corrupted because he seems to make many bad decisions like smoking and drinking and slacking in his classes  One of the life lessons in this book can be seem through the actions of Holden  some may believe that Salinger s novel is a way of showing young people what will happen if one makes bad decisions and does not tried to redeem themselves  Along with life lessons this book also contains many plot twisters and sometimes the reader can get bored but once you keep on reading you will not be able to stop  I remember I laughed a great deal in the first half of the book  but after it got pretty serious  and in the end very sad and depressing  The ending reminded me alot of my little sis and me   A great book  I believe we all have a bit of Holden in us  some more than others  While Holden s actions seem rash  I find that everyone has to go in a little adventure to figure themselves out  This book just really left me feeling more understood than I possibly could ve imagined  I was left with pity self hate admiration  basically every adjective possible  There s so much angst in this book and I love it because not many authors can express it in such a way that Salinger did  It s a book about kindness  Missing kindness  Looking for it  stumbling over it  clamoring for it  Wanting it  Wanting to give it  At that age when everything is so scary and confusing  It seems easy  and it isn t  it isn t easy  yet it is  And there is nothing much to go off of  but you and your own thoughts and fears and longings and terrible terrible doubts  So much sensitivity  and nobody to share it with  So much loneliness  Didn t we all have it when we were 18  Didn t we all go through it  I felt for Holden  and that catcher in the rye poem  that catcher in the rye image  that thing he wanted to do  catching  it made me cry  It makes me cry even now  Holden Caulfield  18  flanks out of Pencey Prep  a private school full of dolts and morons  Of course he does  Nothing makes sense  Nothing has any purpose  Everything is boring  Nobody understands him  So he sets off to go home  scared of what his parents will think  him flanking out of school again  Good parents  Good home in New York  How he gets there  what happens when he does  all around Christmas time  through the snow and cold and the Central Park with a frozen pond  that s where you ll go reading this book  I ll leave you here  It s a beautiful journey  And the ducks  I m still wondering about the ducks  You ll know what I mean once you read it  Excelente libro  Imposible no sentirse identificado con el protagonista en algun momento de nuestras vidas Deja cosas para pensar acerca de como vivimos y vemos la vida Es un libro que independiente la epoca en que se escribio es transversal al tiempo   What a classic  The main character is an old soul  and has a deep capacity to react to life in a worthy fashion  His frustration seems to be driven by his lack of patience for a ton of non sense in his world  but his words fail him in presenting that through his communication  BUT  when you see his actions  you see a very deep young man  who knows what is most important to him    The swearing is a bit much  but at the end of the day  this book is an incredible classic  Any kid that has lost their way  not wanting to grow up or finds they don t belong in this world would connect to this book  The Catcher in the Rye is about a young teenager Holden Caulfield who is stuck between adulthood and childhood who got expelled from his school  he seeks refugee in New York City for a few days because he doesn t belong anywhere else  he is on a journey to be heard  This book is a best seller for a reason the story it told although nothing amazingly suspenseful or exciting happens  was something that made you want to fight and believe  Holden Caulfield in his fight to be heard and to keep his innocence of childhood was wonderfull  I never really like books in first person especially with characters that whine like Holden but I have to say I didn t mind it  I was on Holden s side for most of the novel and by the end of it even though nothing really special happens in the plot all I could do was smile  All I needed was that red hunting cap and that carousel and everything that happened small or large in the novel was enough and was perfect The last two chapters of the book really pushed me over the edge for this novel  I didn t really get the message or what Holden was trying to say to me until the end  and just like that like my subconscious already knew  I saw him and what he had to say  Holden finally got heard and you go away with the love and want for childhood but the ability to grow up  Absolutely brilliant  This is my favourite book    Holden Caufield  the protagonist of The Catcher in the Rye  is a bitter  cynical  lonely 16 year old  His narration of the days directly following his expulsion from Pency boarding school is brilliant  Through symbolism of his red hunting hat  readers see a struggle between childlike innocence and adulthood phonieness  In the end  readers must decide which of these categories Holden finally falls into  Does he learn the lessons he sets out to learn This book contains a lot of swearing  but the overall message of this book is so importatnt that the swearing should be overlooked  Salinger shows the shallowness of meanigless phisical intimacy  He shows te difficultiy people had with connecting to each other during the changes of the modern world  This struggle with connection teaches everyone today  I m so sad it s over    One of my favorite books of all time for sure  I can t even think of reading another book after this  I m also feeling lonely and depressed  This book was sad  it also made me laugh and want to cry sometimes  I loved how Holden worried about everything but his own way of thinking  he never wondered if he was doing it right    I fell in love with Salinger s writing  this was a huge lesson for me  Just write what the hell you re thinking  don t wonder if it makes sense because it surely does for you and let yourself go     3 The Catcher in the Rye was a fantastic book it was relatable and interesting  Holden is such a complex character  it is so interesting to see how everything in his life has affected him and to see how he acts around people because of his past  This book actually taught me to look towards the future because living in the past can almost destroy you in a way  I recommend this book to any living thing that can read  Positively concise  realistic and all in all well written litreture  While It lacks unexpected twists and adventures  you wouldn t enjoy it even a tad less  Heart wrenching transition of a troubled teenage boy to adulthood  Masterfully manifested  I admit at first I wasn t very sure about this  I thought I d be  to borrow a word from Holden  a phony if I started reading a classic just because everybody did  But then I realized how much I loved the cover and the title  basically what drives me into picking a book at random  I started reading ignoring everything I heard about it  This is probably the mother of all coming of age stories  Holden really is a classic  A depressed  misspelled  spineless teen  Everything he encounters sets him off on a rant about how sad it is  He curses  has very limited vocabulary AND is a smoker  Everything about him guarantees him a one way ticket to my no no list  And I yet I didn t hate him  I thought he was pretty fine for a kid  The way he attends to the tiny details is kind of peculiar  Tiny details set me off on the opposite direction  I loved reading about his family Essentially  nothing is happening in this story  It s more focused on how Holden responds to what goes on around him rather than what s going on  That makes for a lousy story if your protagonist had no thoughts to speak of  The part is when he tells Phoebe about the rhyme he misheard and how he goes on with it and concocts his catching dream job  I am very touchy about title references  Especially when it s too obvious  oh please don t mention it  It s like explaining a joke  there  RUINED  Except here it was more of a split reference  Remember  ever so slightly  we hear it in the kid s rhyme  It wasn t very subtle but I simply loved it  I know how differently people respond to this  I had mixed feelings at first I had too  I liked the monotone  Salinger really knows how to make a story flow  but I didn t see what the overhype was about  but Then I read Holden s thoughts about the poem  If I read this on Kindle  that would be the only part I d highlight  With paperbacks I settle for remembering the page number  173  I m very glad to report that I m not disappointed   I have read this book later in life than most  I think that from my perspective  I have a lot of mixed feelings about the main character  Older people may view him as a privileged slacker  Younger people might relate to him for his rebellious  carefree demeanor  At that age  a lot of things in adult society would seem very phony  so it probably feels good to hear that vocalized in a book  I see him as a more complex figure than that  He s a kid who is sensitive and intellectual above his years  He sees things in black and white  when he should really see the shades of grey  He struggles to get over the death of his brother  and struggles to find his own way in the shadow of someone who he sees as being the ultimate person I found this to be a brilliant narrative  brimming with the complexities and absurdities of being in between youth and adulthood  This is the original young adult book   You re a student  whether the idea appeals to you or not  You re in love with knowledge  And I think you ll find  once    you get past all the Mr  Vinsons  you re going to start getting closer and closer  that is  if you want to  and if you look for it and wait for it  to the kind of information that will be very  very dear to your heart  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior    Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  It has been years since I have read this book  and it is just as brilliant as I remember it  One should always go back and reread the important books of their youth  It keeps you from being too much of a phony  Para tener dieciseis o diecisiete anos  el protagonista es toda prudencia entre lo que piensa y lo que hace  Yo no era asi a su edad  yo era mas callada por temor a que se me notara lo nina que aun era  el no  el solo se siente alegre o deprimido  y en alguno que otro momento le da un ataque de ansiedad  No parece darse cuenta que siempre esta furioso por convencionalismos  es decir  los detecta  los define y los deja enfurecerlo  o deprimirlo  o hacerle cinico   a veces parece un adolescente tan maduro que ello le pesara y por ese mismo peso se quebrara  otras  con su hermanita  por ejemplo   es el imberbe mas fuerte y feliz Cuando estan afuera del museo  senti que yo era Phoebe y  debe ser porque yo siempre quise tener un hermano mayor  llore un poquito El final es de encanto agridulce  asi me lo parece    Ese Holden Caulfield es simpatiquisimo  De verdad   The Catcher in the Rye is an intriguing and fascinating book  I admire J D Salinger  the author of the novel s  way of writing and how he formed the main character  Holden  The book is about a young  troubled teenager named Holden who struggles to find himself especially with the death of his brother Allie  The book is narrated by Holden from his own view  thoughts  and words  I like that the book comes from his perspective because I feel like it helps show the full essence of the novel and the true meaning behind the book  Holden  as one can see  is hurting inside and it is seen through how he cannot interact with others in society and so forth  Overall  the context of the novel  and its well written story line and plot  leaves me speechless and drawn to read it again  I would highly recommend the book to students and even adults  It is sort of a depressing book though  so I would recommend it for learning purposes to teenagers who are trying to  find themselves    One of my favorite parts in the book  and probably the one that relates the title the most is when Holden s sister asked him what he liked to do in life  he said he would like to be the catcher in the rye to catch those kids who start to go over the cliff  It shows really  despite all those swearing and calling everyone phonies  Holden has a purest and the most innocent mind  I liked kids  but after reading this i begin to like them more  for they are simple but never stupid  and never phony   As a former English teacher I am supposed to love this book and say it is one of the greatest of all time  But  I can honestly say that this book has had a continued impact on me as I think about the character of Holden Caufield  as I think about the era of conformity in which the book takes place  and as I think about my senior English students who were moved by the book and still mention it when I run into them from time to time  The book is controversial  though I don t know why   and it is profoundly deep and true to this day  It contains one of the best characters in all of literature and leaves a lasting impression far beyond the words on the pages  so important  I would read it outloud to my students just to make sure they all get the messages from it  coming of age story  prompts great discussions So I figured I would finally write a review for a book on goodreads  and what better book to start with than one of my all time favorites  It s truly difficult to sum up my love for this book  so instead I will point out why I don t hate it  this is a very polarizing book  and I think that one of the most off putting things about its negative reception  even more than the  controversy  surrounding it  is that pretty much every person I ve ever known who dislikes this book is a total stick up the ass bastard  They ll make statements like   The book is about nothing   or  Holden s so angsty   or  The style is so annoying  or  I loved it when I was a teenager  but     as if I m supposed to give a crap when they missed the point completely  Look  this isn t a book about how goddamn WISE Holden is  or even about  growing up  exactly  But it does shed some light on the teenage experience  and  yes  the human experience  and it s real fucking funny on the way to its conclusion  The greatest sin  to me  is a complete and utter lack of a sense of humor  and every uptight bastard who hates this book completely fails to experience its hilarity  They re too busy with their holier than thou attitudes about how they re too mature to like it  Maturity has nothing to do with it  they ve forgotten how to have fun  Or  more likely  they never knew to begin with  I ve read this book three times now  and I feel like it gets better every times I read it  I was 14 when I first read it  so some of the stuff when right over my head  I thought  back then  that Holden was an alright character who said Boy a lot  I was 18 the second times I read it  I got more of the things that wen t over my head the first time around  I also identified with Holden in a different way  At that point in my life  I was a but lost and felt like leaving everything behind  just like Holden  I sympathized with him  and was a little sad when he didn t leave  I felt like I was also doomed to be stuck in the place I was at the time  both emotionally and physically  I m in a better place  now  at 21  Reading this now  I tried to imagine what Holden would be doing at my age  If  like me  he had stopped wondering and started on a path to happiness  If he looked back and thought he was silly for ever thinking the way he did  I wonder what I ll get out of this books when I read it again in 2018  when I m 24  I absolutely adore this book The style of writing is witty  humourous  I didnt feel like putting the book down  The characters in the book though crazy have their own uniqueness  be it Holden or his sister or even his hostel mates   This novel will change your life  I had not read Catcher in the Rye for many  many decades  After I watched a documentary on its author  JD Salinger  I picked up a hard copy version at the book store  No e books for this classic read  Catcher is a truly great book  featuring Holden Caulfield   one of the most tortured and wonderful young characters in modern literature  Check out the opening sentence  If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born  and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  As Holden might say  if he were doing a review of this book   See what I mean  It just kills me how good this book is   really  Try to put it down  I dare ya    I first read this years and years ago when I was 15  The first page got me HOOKED  I didn t know there was someone like Holden  Okay  so yes  Holden s got a lot of growing up to do but I think he s just very afraid of change and adulthood  so am I  I quickly realized how much Holden and I had in common  which I now realize wasn t always a good thing  but it made me feel a little bit better about myself and a little less lonely  Finally  there was someone who understood me  Now  forward a few years  I still love this book as much as I did when I first read it  and despite that I definitely recognize Holden s faults  I also still love him very  very much  This book means so much to me and it s definitely my favorite book  together with Fight Club  and I can t wait to read it again for the millionth time  When I had to read it in school I did everything I could to get out of it  I read only the parts I needed to to my homework  then came the exam  I spent a weekend inside at the cottage reading the whole thing  HATED IT  but I got an A  A couple of years later I tried it again  and I loved it  It s one of the few books I ve read more than once Holden s disconnect with the world and how his experiences have made him the way he is are open to interpretation  the reader can relate as much or as little as they like  Personally  I don t see him as the hero that many make him out to be  and I don t really have a list of reasons why it s an all time favourite for me  I think we re all judgemental in our heads and we would love to but never dare to be as frank about it as Holden  I don t usually write reviews but this book is my all time favorite  Holden Caulfield has recently gone through 2 traumatic events that have shaped his attitude and has left him desperately searching for someone to talk to  However the world just doesn t seem to have time for Holden Caulfield and this leads to several very lonely days for him until a final revelation  Most people say that Holden is an unlikable character  and to most people he is  However  don t let that extinguish your enjoyment while reading this book  as it s chock full of amazing writing and heart felt metephors  If you read this book for school and didn t like it  I highly recommend that you give it a reread and you lll be amazed   this book is great because salinger shows that life is a changing growing experience that we cannot always understand  adults who read this will come to realize what adolescents are going through  and adolescents who read it can connect with a character who most likely is going through at least some of the same emotions experiences they are in real life  i love this book  it is a classic  it should be a book that all young people read  banning this novel is censoring what kids are experiencing in real life  and i do not support banning this novel  however  i do not know if this book being required reading for students in middle or high school is needed  it should be something that a person wants to read purely because they are interested in finding more about life and alternative perspectives  doing a lesson for class on this would be awesome  hopefully i will be able to teach this novel someday   The teenage years can be a weird time for anybody  Many stories seek to capture the feelings of loneliness  confusion  angst  depression  and restlessness that everybody feels in these uncertain phases of life  The Catcher in the Rye stands as one of the best and most successful  because it captures all of this in one tight  punchy package  and the experience of reading it is quite the trip Through the narrative eyes of Holden Caulfield  the story can come off as totally random  It s all about Holden s wanderings from Pencey Preparatory school to the streets of New York City  where he sees and experiences a number of things that continuously alienates him  It s a pretty bizarre series of encounters  which includes a lot of horseplay  bar hopping  and interactions with particularly seedy areas of the city  It might seem like a weird  plotless mess  but the characters and themes keep it all glued together as a cohesive plot  this is not so much about  plot  as it is about Holden reflecting  and ultimately discovering  his own place in the world  Through all the flashbacks and all the people he meets  he eventually finds something that inspires happiness in a world full of  phonies   The journey to discover what it means to be the  catcher in the rye  is what this story is all about Even though the book covers a lot of ground between covering Holden s past  present  and future  it is a short and incredibly characteristic  The whole thing is written in a very casual style  using Holden s voice and all his mannerisms and colloquialisms to place the reader in his shoes and make us understand all his thoughts and feelings on an intuitive level  Because of this  the book is not only consistently entertaining  it s also highly immersive and it succeeds at eliciting sympathy for the character  It s just as evocative as it is easy to read In spite of everything  JD Salinger s prose is quite brilliant in its own ways  He makes great use of language   the best and worst of it   to bring the character and story to life  and to make sure we can follow it to its end  The book entails some intriguing metaphors  especially in its title   Dialogue seems quite authentic  The language overall can be rather uncompromising  especially in the liberal way it uses curse words  but it fits the character and story pretty aptly The Catcher in the Rye is an interesting  bittersweet classic full of character and themes that are worth reading  It deserves to be read at least once 4 5 5 Holden nao se trata do tipo de personagem que atrai a simpatia imediata do leitor  ao contrario  somos tentados a rejeita lo  reduzindo o a figura caricata do tipico adolescente mimado e incapaz de demonstrar apreco por qualquer coisa  Porem essa impressao negativa aos poucos vai se desfazendo a medida em que entramos em seu universo e comecamos a enxergar pelos seus olhos o drama de uma vida angustiada pela impossibilidade de encontrar seu lugar entre dois mundos muito diferentes   especie de limbo existencial que parece lhe sugerir apenas dois caminhos  a fuga ou mesmo a morte  que se vislumbra cada vez mais presente no decorrer da historia  Vivenciar essa tensao e a chave para a compreensao das atitudes aparentemente contraditorias e paradoxais de alguem que resiste a passagem do tempo  aprisionado a memoria de uma grande perda  Uno de mis libros preferidos hasta ahora      es un libro escrito desde un lenguaje muy cercano a los jovenes con lo cual muchos nos vamos a sentir identificados  Durante toda la novela Holden va a hacerse preguntas existenciales sobre politica  religion  guerras  etc  Este libro tiene muchos puntos en los que te mueres de risa  pero cuando Holden se pone serio y empieza a contar su vida uno descubre que no ha tenido mucha suerte en la vida y que le han ocurrido cosas verdaderamente tristes que lo han llevado a una situacion muy frustrante  La historia de un chico que trata de vivir la vida hasta el ultimo segundo y que esta fascinado por las mujeres  la musica y que solo odia la vanidad  el orgullo y la gente falsa  Holden va a tener que asumir muchas tragedias que han sucedido dentro de su entorno  se va a dar cuenta de que en realidad no tiene casi ningun amigo verdadero y que va a tratar desesperadamente de encontrar una salida a esa espiral sin fondo que se ha vuelto  pues  su vida  Sin duda uno de mis libros favoritos This novel got surprisingly better on this  my third read  I read it the first time as a teenager or not much after my teen years and identified with Holden  esp  in his hatred of  phonies   I read it again in my mid 20s and found that it was not nearly as good as I remembered it and was a bit disappointed  Then  I re read it for a class this year and enjoyed it as much as the first time  maybe more because I caught on to the fact that Holden is not a reliable narrator  I had never noticed how the reactions of those around him can tell the story in ways that we don t get from Holden  Like when Sally tells him to be quiet  that he s yelling  Also  just like when I lived in Berlin  I really appreciate American things when I am outside of America  Maybe even more so now since when I was in Berlin I appreciated anything English  not specifically American  whereas now I realize the quaintness of our idiom and the accent since I m not around it much  I m planning to get this for my nephew if my sister in law allows it  This is a novel  I know it s what everyone says but I have to say it again  that all teenagers should read  Really enjoyed reading this book and I m not really sure why  Even through reading it I acknowledge that the story was more like ongoing thoughts than an actual plot  yet I never felt bored  Criminal minds taught me this book has been linked to murderers and I like to think thats not why I liked it It is also a favorite of John Green s  I felt that Holden held a deep angst that teen characters in today s book seem to lack  He wasn t cookie cutter and that made him seem more real and relatable   I really enjoyed this book  the narrative was filled with character  Although a lot of the time I wanted to kill Holden  I slowly ended up sympathizing with him  The way Salinger brings you into Holden s world is too be admired  Salinger saw a lot of horrors during the war and when he came back he wrote a book on this big phony  Holden s resentment for the adult world and this desire to return too innocence becomes extremely meaningful when you look at Salinger s own experiences  I think theirs a lot to take from this book if only we open our minds a little bit and look in the right places  Holden is a clever and complicated character who doesn t have to be liked  but I feel the need to understand him  He poses questions about the world that leave you thinking a long time after it s read It s not about what s written  it s more about how it s written  Salinger put all his life into this book  as far as I could make out  It s not the kind of book that leaves you in awe but if you read it once  and if you re a fan of good honest writing and intellectual take on things  you ll love it and would def go back to it  Championed by many as a seminal novel and a  must read  it s very hard to explain what happens in the novel as the protagonist merely waltzes round New York offering his observations  venting his anger and sharing his loneliness   and yet it is fantastic  In Holden Coldfield  Catcher in the Rye has one of the strongest character voices in fiction I d read in a long while  I shared his rage  shared his observations  share his sense of phonyism and injustice  I don t know if that says more about the book s far reaching appeal or the fact I m still thinking like a teenager  It s a powerful book  slightly hypnotic in the narrators skewed sense  the whole way through you believe this teenager is capable of anything  He spins through the spectrum of emotion and that is perhaps why it s still so popular  It taps a nerve  somewhere in everyone about what modern life is like A friend said this books is only readable if you yourself are a teenager  Aged 28 and three quarters  I loved it    Hbbt lrwy  kthyran  bl bshdW   t lqt fyh  sh r bfrG  trkh hwldn  lHyqy  l  dhkr  smhlrwy  jmyl  jdan jdan lHd

bok det er veldig vanskelig a skrive om  og det er vanskelig a si hva den handler om  Hovedpersonen i boka  Holden Caulfield  rommer fra skolen sin tre dager for juleferien etter at han har stroket i nesten alle fag  Han drar til hjembyen New York  og det viser seg a bli tre vanskelige og deprimerende dager Spraket er enkelt og sylskarpt  Jeg liker veldig godt de korte setninger som skjaerer i lufta som knivblader  I begynnelsen var det en smule irriterende med de samme ordene og uttrykkende som ble gjentatt hele tida  men etter hvert var det nesten som om jeg ble skuffet om ordet  goddam  ikke var nevnt i et avsnitt  eller om  and all  ikke ble slengt pa slutten av hver setning  Det er en del banning i boka  og ord som  sonuvabitch  blir gjentatt  Det er en sann type bok som bruker  ya  istedenfor  you  og  whadduyacallit  istedenfor  what do you call it   Du vet hva jeg mener  Jeg klarer ikke a bestemme meg for om jeg liker eller misliker Holden  Han tar en del darlige avgjorelser  og jeg liker ikke at han er sa opptatt av at jenter skal se bra ut  Han ser ned pa andre  og  alle  er uintelligente eller mangler hjerne Jeg kunne tenkt meg at noen flere av karakterene i persongalleriet faktisk gjorde en opptreden i boka  som barndomsvennen Jane og broren D B   men man fikk vite sa mye om dem at det var nesten som om de gjorde det  Denne boka  blew me away   Dette er en av de beste bokene jeg har lest noen gang  muligens kanskje den beste  Den var rett og slett brilliant  genial og original  Jeg elsker det henslengte spraket og karakterene  og jeg liker hvordan Holdens synspunkter pa ting fargelegger hele historien  Min favorittdel av boka var slutten  Den var gjennomfort  til tross for at jeg folte at noen tradene fortsatt ikke var knytt sammen til en knute i det jeg lukket boka  Jeg likte den siste setningen  det var en sann type siste setning som representerer  refererer og jobber godt sammen med spraket og uttrykksformen i resten av boka  Jeg gir The Catcher in the Rye 5 5 stjerner   I bought this as it was one the of books Charlie read in Perks of begin a Wallflower  After reading it it became one my favorite books  At first I love Holden but by the end I realized that just a guy that really need to grow up  This book is a perfect example of teenage angst and rebellion  During our teenage years we are trying to find our standing in this world trying to understand the intricacies of life in general  our hopes rising and crashing with the smallest of incidents  This novel is a story about Holden Caulfield and his experience with searching for an identity  trying to fit into society  experiencing personal loss and hoping to find a connection with people who aren t  phony   I loved the narrative and how his relationship is depicted with his deceased younger brother Allie and his older brother DB  But the defining part of the book is his relationship with his younger sister Phoebe  It is sweet and heartbreaking all at once  To sum it up  this book  killed me    The Catcher in the Rye is about a boy  Holden Caulfield and a little bit of his life when he was sixteen  Holden tells us about how he doesn t want to go home until he gives his parents a couple days to digest that he has flunked out of yet another school  So instead of going home right away he stays in New York for a couple days  He tells us about his time there and all the phony people he meets and the lousy situations he gets into while he s there  I gave this book five stars because I felt like I understood Holden s character and I appreciated how he treats his sister  Even though he wasn t careful at times and didn t think things through I feel like that s what makes his character relatable  People will either will love this book or hate it  I believe it depends on your sense of humor   I read this book for the third time this year  and I have to say that I enjoyed it the most I ever have  I think that my appreciation of it has grown each time  I guess I finally got it  The prism by which I view it now is like the movie Rushmore   I guess I didn t realize before that Max Fisher is Holden s spiritual descendant  I also think that one of the most interesting things about Catcher in the Rye is that every time I read it  I forget the finer points of it until I read it again  Has the CIA programmed me Of course not  The book is classic Beat writing   free flowing stream of consciousness  like On the Road it s not the details that are important  but rather the overall tone and theme  Awesome book  Everyone should read this  My favorite part  when he s talking to the driver in the taxi about how the fish stay alive in the winter  and the driver says the fish eat through their pores  Hilarious  I also liked the merry go round at the end The characterization is one of the best jobs I have ever seen  And it s horribly symbolic   This book is one of my favorite books I ve ever read  Salinger does an excellent job of relating to the teen angst that many teenagers experience  I really enjoyed how Holden narrated his life by explaining his feelings in such a relatable way  and he did it with so much detail  I recommend this book to all teenagers  This book is totally up my alley  Loved it so much  especially Salinger s message    Holden Caulfield may seem a bit strange bearing in mind he s a sixteen year old boy  and sometimes he can even be a little mean   but I think that his intensions are good  though  It s just that things don t always end up the way he intends them to  I strongly recommend this book  I first read The Catcher in the Rye when I was a 15 year old misfit  The story or  rather  musings  of the young Holden Caulfield struck a chord with me  as with millions of other people who have found the book during an opportune time in their lives  Caulfield gave a voice to the edgy  slightly neurotic  adolescent parts of my mind  which had begun to take shape but could not yet be articulated  Like Caulfield  I feared the change that I knew would come with adulthood  which I was quickly approaching  I found I wanted desperately to hold on to my childhood and my youth  To keep everything as it was  It was the book that helped me make the transition from young adult fiction to  grown up  books  This is why when somebody asks for my favourite books  it is the first one I think of  When I read the book again a couple of years ago  in my early twenties  it didn t have quite the impact it did back when I was a teenager  staying up all night to pore over a friend s old  tattered copy of the book  I found I had outgrown it  Perhaps I am turning into a dreaded phoney  The Catcher in the Rye The ultimate coming of age novel  which continues to furrow the brows of young people all over the world  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry   I think I will name my next boy dog Holden  A very difficult coming of age story  I really liked Holden  He hated phoniness  sp  and hypocrisy  He loved the innocence of kids  He only wanted to be the catcher in the Rye when he grew up     wow  I got creeped out for a second because I thought he was sexually interested in Phoebe  I was dead wrong  He loves kids and their innocence  The dude was a good guy stuck in a bad world which is what I am sure the youth in todays world are struggling with  Sigh     I hope Holden ends out being o k And Mr whas his name  the teacher  the  flit  will die one thousand deaths in his mind taking advantage of a struggling youth  ARGH  I would kill him in real life if I could   Cosa dire di questo romanzo  Io lo lessi intorno ai vent anni e ancora oggi lo ricordo benissimo  sara un caso Consigliandolo ad amici ho avuto feedback contrastanti  alcuni l hanno amato alla follia  altri detestato o non capito  Girovagando in internet le opinioni sono piu negative che positive     bha Pero  secondo me  un romanzo che attraversa generazioni su generazioni  scritto nel 1951   che attraversa continenti e riesce ancora oggi ad essere attuale e costantemente venduto  deve per forza avere qualcosa di speciale Ricordo che mi ritrovai esattamente dentro al personaggio  al suo modo di pensare    Ho condiviso le sue paure  la sua sensibilita  il suo senso di inadeguatezza rispetto ad un mondo che parla il linguaggio degli adulti  Una storia semplice ma molto introspettiva e malinconica sulla fase di transizione tra adolescenza e mondo adulto  scritto con un linguaggio ancora oggi innovativo Non c e grande trama e non ci sono colpi di scena Non poteva essere che questa la prima recensione  perche da qui  tanti anni fa  tutto e cominciato Black Barthttp   www pescepirata ithttp   www pescepirata it aspiranti_s    We all have a child in us  likewise we all would have experienced a Holden Caulfield with his confusions  deepest desires  regrets and more  Could immediately relate to his teens  One of my favorites for the protagonist is a pained individual and I may have been there  The first time I read this I was 15  I don t think I understood at all what it was really about  All I remember was that Holden was a sensitive and testy kind of guy  the rest was hazy  I am almost 21 today  and I just reread this book again  All in all it s a very good read  It s quite brilliant the way Salinger structure his book  I love the part about the creative process  You write unconsciously something that doesn t interest you  just to get started  and you will find what interests you the most as you go along  Of course it s pretty smart of him to enact digression in his narration then have the narrator say that he prefers it when somebody digresses  The effect is pretty interesting and you can get a pretty clear sense of the narrator s mind  The last 30 pages killed me  I understand the book now as kind of a Kunstlerroman  The part with Mr  Vinsons is a sort of a paperweight that anchors the other angst y  digressive passages  i e  most of the book  down perfectly  This fall I think you re riding for   it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement s designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  So they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even started  You follow me       Once you get past all the Mr  Vinsons  you re going to start getting closer and closer   that is  if you want to  and if you look for it and wait for it   to the kind of information that will be very  very dear to your heart  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And isn t education  It s history  It s poetry  I m not trying to tell you  that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world  It s not so  But I do say that educated and scholarly men  if they re brilliant and creative to begin with   which  unfortunately  is rarely the case   tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative  They tend to express themselves more clearly  and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts to the end  And   most important   nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker  What Mr  Atolini says about literature is absolutely beautiful  It made me think of the times I got so angry with old professors in class and how I thought they had nothing to teach me and school was a huge waste of time and money  The solipsism that comes with coming of age angst can really be soothed by reading about it in books like this   The first time I read this book I was probably about 14 15  and I HATED it  Hated it with a burning passion  to be honest  But then I started my kick of reading through  1 001 Books to Read Before You Die   and I knew I was going to have to give it another chance  I had hated it with such intensity that literally all I could remember about the book was the fact that I hated it  so it didn t feel right to  check it off  without reading it again Now I understand that I was simply to young to appreciate the genius of J D  Salinger  This book was incredibly insightful and a pleasure to read  I m glad I put my feelings aside and gave it another chance  It s very open and all  Explored how the world is  That killed me   Certain things they should stay the way they are  you ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave then alone    Here s what he said   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one    Those are two of my favorite quotes from this book  but my God there are so many  I can t believe how much I can relate to Holden  I thought I was one of the only people that felt about Mercutio like that  but apparently I m not  It amazes me how a book written so long ago could still relate to many problems today in society  Although I shouldn t be so surprised as humans rarely change  I started reading it in my English class  but then I bought my own copy and I couldn t stop reading it  It makes me depressed to hear the things people in my class say about this book  I know they will probably never fully understand what is said by Salinger  I am surrounded by fake people  but everyone s a phony  I am too  Life is a shitty game and if you don t play it  or go against the rules  you end up like James Castle  or Holden  It sickens me that people tried or succeeded  I m not quite sure  to ban this book  because of one man s actions  As you can see  many people can relate to this book  So I leave you with this that describes my life so well   Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb  I had this feeling that I d never get to the other side of the street  I thought I d just go down  down  down  and nobody s ever see me again    Read this book when I was in high school the first time  But being as old as Holden  I could not then fully appreciate how good this books really is  Reading it now  I see how wonderfully crafted it is  The way the ready is totally immersed into the mind of a teenager protagonist of a quintessentially New York ish setting   lost among the crowd and lonely  But also  the novel is full of delicately placed insights  Holden who wants to be a catcher in the rye preventing children from falling over the edge   ends up watching Phoebe on the carousel not holding on   he says its better to let kids either hold on or fall by their own without catching them   another book I was unsure about  after hearing so much criticism  I actually really enjoyed it  there were a few times  such as Holden s constant repetition of phrases or words  that grated on my nerves  but I get what the author was intending with that  I ve also read several reviews that criticize Holden as an unlikeable character  and I get that  too  he is a bit rude  a little hard to like  towards the end of the book  I felt so sad for him  though  I think he didn t really know where he was going  and I have felt that way several times in my life  overall  this book is very good  very readable  if you can get past the constant repetition   and I recommend it to anyone  especially teenagers who aren t quite sure of anything  At the start of the book  we are introduced to an opinionated and judgmental 16 year old  Holden Caulfield  Although written in the 1950 s the characters and plot completely shatter this stereotypical 1950 image  Holden attends prep schools  all of which one way or another  he is kicked out  After being kicked out of his most recent school  Pency Prep  he has many experiences in New York  alone  He learns about life and the sad reality of himself Holden is a character that is easy to hate  but easier to love  He embodies almost a picture perfect image of a teenager  struggling through life  love  and the future  Salinger effortlessly creates a version of ourselves  that some of us deny we have  Holden is scared  sad  curious  and stubborn  much like many of us are  It is a book that can easily relate to many people  and it plants a curiosity in our mind of what happens to Holden Caulfield holden is the reason I ve always had such a potty mouth   The Catcher in the Rye  is now my favorite book without a doubt The main theme of this book is alienation  Holden Caulfield  the narrator in this book  is a 17 year old boy  who doesn t seem to fit in anywhere  He keeps failing all his classes  except for English   he is very good at writing  He gets kicked out of every college he goes to  because it doesn t really seem to interest him  He calls himself  dumb  all the time  but through his way of writing  he shows that he is very intelligent  he just looks at the world in a different way  Everything he hates is  phony  and a lot of things are phony to him   especially a lot of people  In the book  we follow him on his journey of finding out what he wants to do with his life  He doesn t want to go to college  because it is filled with phonies  He just wants to run away and live in a place where no one knows who he is  He is naive and he keeps himself distant from other people  The only thing that holds him back from running away is his sister  who is very dear to him  The book reminds me of  The Perks of being a Wallflower   because of the main character and the way it s written It is a fantastic book and I recommend it to everyone   The Catcher in the Rye is an American classic tale set in the 1950 s about a more rebellious child who decides to come home early from his boarding school after being expelled few days prior  He begins his travel home learning devastating news  experiencing more mature situations and Holden Caulfield is the perfect example of an alienated teenage boy who hasn t quite figured himself out  This book has received much criticism for its risque topics but it depicts exactly what goes on through the minds of angry  confused and hormonal teens  Holden goes against the  norms  of society and views a lot of things as  phony   For teachers I think this would be a great classic for the class to read so that each student can see how they relate to Holden and what aspects of his life relate to teens in todays modern world  Since this book has been challenged numerous times to be censored in schools  educators can also use this book to facilitate a discussion on censored books and the students thoughts on why this book should or should not be censored  Salinger  J     Mitchell  E   1951   The catcher in the rye  Little  Brown and Company  After a long time read something that blew my mind away  Maybe the last book I rated 5 star was Steve Jobs  Its been two years since  and I have read around say 25 30 books in the meantime  but Catcher In The Rye is the kind of book I expect to read before starting a novel  I mean in terms of satisfaction and the way I could relate to it  Its a classic  So now begins the search of the next book to be read  and I just might re read this who knows     SPOILERS    Catcher in the Rye was suggested to me by a few people  and I d heard of it before as something I might like  So I picked it up  and certainly wasn t disappointed The time period isn t exactly specified  but as the book was written during the 1950s  I imagine it would be around then  It takes place primarily around New York  over the span of a few days  though is later revealed to be a giant flashback  told to a psychiatrist  The protagonist of the story is Holden Caulfield  a 17 year old teenage boy  enrolled at a prep school in New York City  The book begins right before he is expelled from it because of poor grades  He is a very judgemental character  thinking of most people as  phonies   believing that no one truly acts like themselves in society  Because of this  he is untrusting and depressed  He s fairly vulgar  and views everything in a more or less simple manner  He doesn t really have any friends  and the only person he s really close to in the world is his younger sister  Phoebe  He is awkward with people  even when he doesn t mind them  as shown when he tries to convey his feelings to an old female friend  He s a bit of a compulsive liar  seeing little harm in lying to strangers  or even himself at times  Few other characters are seen or heard from in the book apart from bit parts  but minor characters include a pimp who beats Holden up for not paying extra after he hires her to simply come up to his room and talk  an old teacher who allows Holden to spend the night at his place  but is found watching Holden sleep when he wakes up  insinuating him to be a pedophile  Phoebe  Holden s 10 year old sister  who is down to Earth and worries about her brother  and his older brother J B   a screenplay writer in Hollywood that also cares about Holden  but can t show it quite as well  Holden believes him to have been corrupted by the phony world around him  I find Holden to be an incredibly relatable character  and one of the best written I ve ever read  That said  many people will disagree with me on this point  I find that with The Catcher in the Rye  you either love Holden or hate him  There doesn t seem to be a grey area  His looks on society  his questioning of people  and in himself  all lead me to think about my own views  When I first picked it up  I found myself drawing many parallels to myself  but by the time I put it down  Holden became more of a warning than a mirror  I looked at him  and how things turned out  and concluded that perhaps it would be best to change my ways  to avoid coming out like him  Nevertheless  his questions and wonders in the world are very much things felt by many teenagers  or not at all by others  He can be summed up in one wonderful quote   I thought what I d do was  I d pretend I was one of those deaf mutes  That way I wouldn t have to have any goddamn stupid useless conversations with anybody  If anybody wanted to tell me something they d have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me  They d get bored as hell doing that after a while  and then I d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life   The plot itself is actually quite simple and short  Holden is expelled from another school  and is to be sent home at the break  His parents don t know  so he packs his bags and heads out to New York City to have some fun before going home to face them  He checks into a hotel  goes dancing at a hotel  hires a prostitute  though he doesn t actually get into anything with her  he simply wanted someone to talk to   gets beaten up by her pimp  gets rather drunk  visits an old English teacher  a museum  meets up with an old friend whom he had feelings for  sneaks into his parents apartment one night to visit his younger sister  and then takes her on a merry go round  All in the span of three days  At the end  his views are changed a bit  and he hints that he s in a mental institution  talking to a psychiatrist  The main message of the story is looking at society  and how your view of it can influence your life  While it goes about saying it through a dark and cynical tone  it could serve more as a warning than a statement of how it is  It seems to say to simply live your life  be happy  and be yourself  J D  Salinger writes Holden completely in dialect  and it s truly written as if it were a giant monologue  and for what it is  it couldn t be written better in any other way  It really allows the reader to get inside of Holden  to understand him  As much as you can understand anyone at least  It is more vulgar than many books because of this style though  The conclusion was resolved  though seeing as how there wasn t much of a conflict  it wasn t too difficult  The book isn t something that you sit down and read to hear a story  It s something you sit down and read to think  about the world and about yourself  The ending is however  a little abrupt  but fitting  As a novel  I d classify this as one of my favourites  It was a fast and easy read  not too challenging vocabulary wise  but it really makes you think  As I mentioned earlier  you either love The Catcher in the Rye  or you hate it  And I absolutely love it  I m not sure if I d recommend it to the classroom  It s taught anyways  and it really is something that every troubled teenager  IE  all of us  should read at some point or another  Not everyone might relate to it  but it s still quite interesting  At the very least  it should provide an image of how not to act  It is the cause of a lot of controversy  and with good reason  The themes and language are ones not usually found in the classroom  despite being major ones in reality  So from an educational standpoint  it might not be 100  school appropriate  but it is still a very good teaching tool  The problem I see with this book is that you either love it or you hate it  And to the haters  I can see why  Holden s arguably one of the nastiest characters ever  and is obviously not someone we should admire  However  that is not why we love this book  I loved it because of how perfectly many teenagers were captured  just how well I could relate to him  even taking into consideration how long ago this book was written In the end  I conclude that it is one of the greatest books in recent history  despite being written more than fifty years ago  This is probably my favourite book  on part with The Little Prince   It s funny how it has stirred up so much debate over the years  I am never taking this one off my shelf  It s one of those books that made you feel okay about yourself  made you feel that you re not alone  and it s okay to be constantly drawn to the small things rather than the big picture It s okay to be depressed over the small things and it s normal  it s okay to be constantly changed to the opposite poles of everything  I laughed  I sighed  I cried and all  It gave me a good mood  I loved it   spoilers if you fall into one of the following categories about Catcher in the Rye  1   thinks it s genius because of how it sees through the lies society gives us  i e   wow look how jaded he is so cool and above the world  2   thinks its awful because it glorifies this jaded viewpoint on the worldthen you don t see the point of this book yes  Holden s cynical  cool and intelligent  yes  he s hypocritical  unwise and dark but the real message here is not to glorify that  it is to OVERCOME that  he has his circumstances thrust upon him   his brother dies  he has been failing school  he is in a place where people who question unwritten authority are so badly attacked that they commit suicide  he considers suicide himself  he has probably been molested  etc  as a result he has a deservedly jaded viewpoint on the world   am I saying this is ideal  no  of course not  if he had come past those with a beautiful perspective on life and tragedy  he would have been all the better for it  but we can t really blame him for being the way he is   as the book continues we see him fall more and more into himself and less and less into the people around him  as this happens  he becomes lonesome  depressed  and almost insane  but then he begins his path back to happiness at the end of the book  he sees his sister  a symbol of purity and intelligence  doing something simplistic  going on a carousel   and suddenly he begins to cry  he doesn t understand why but it s clearly because he recognizes  subconsciously  perhaps  the simple joy in her life  and the fact that life is joyful  despite all the problems that he so eloquently describes earlier in the book CitR is brilliant  beautiful and misunderstood  if you really feel like it s glorifying cynicism and edgy lifestyles try again  the most uplifting art accepts that the darkness is there but ultimately defies it against all odds  and that is why this identified with so so many people  if you are one of those who likes it then these are words of God for you   if you dont then keep enjoying your life   nothing can ever get better than this   a smack on face to this phoney world   Ich glaube  dass es einfach ist  das Buch nicht zu mogen  Wenn man Charaktere einer Geschichte nicht mag  ist es oft schwierig  die Story selbst zu mogen  Aber wenn man Holden Caulfield nicht mag  macht man es sich zu leicht  Hinter ihm steckt so viel mehr als das  was er vorgibt zu sein  Und in ihm verbirgt sich die ganze Geschichte  eine Geschichte  die schnell erzahlt ist und dennoch irgendwie komplex ist  Und auch  wenn man sich weigert  fruher oder spater findet man eine Stelle  an der man sich mit Holden identifizieren kann  Ob man das will oder nicht  Fur mich eine der schonsten Adoleszenz und auch alle anderen Phasen des Lebens Geschichten uberhaupt  Not much I can add to the discussion on this one  I m afraid  I will say that it was rewarding to re read this  as I ve done every couple years of so  and to be flipping through the very same copy I read my freshman year in high school  Yes  the very one  complete with pink and green highlighted text sprinkled with comments including such thoughtful zingers as  many things depress him   page 5  and  not a trusty narrator   page 99   Thanks  professor  Honestly  there appears to be no pattern to what text I highlighted and that which I didn t  as though my young teenage self was waffling between the need to underscore the parts I thought were tantalizing or scandalous  going so far as to number all the fucks there toward the end  I guess in case I needed to go back to reread them  and the parts I thought I d be quizzed on  character names  critical events  things that were Important   I found it interesting that this go around  though  I would have made notes and underlined things that my younger self would never have touched with a highlighter  owing  I suppose  to the cumulative experience of my life here in 2008  a bit different than me in 1991   Iyi bir kitapti   gercekten   Dili diger edebi eserlere gore bayagi yalin olsa da bunu

elestirisi yatar   Este es uno de los libros que en mi opinion personal no debe faltar en la coleccion de  libros que hay que leer   Creo que causo controversias en los anos en que se publico el libro porque era una epoca en la que la sociedad norteamiericana era mas recatada y con mayores prejuicios que hoy en dia  Aunado al hecho de que el libro fue prohibido  no recuerdo en donde y cuando  y de que es posiblemente un factor instigador de rebelion a las leyes  se dio la  Casualidad  de que el asesino de John Lenon estaba leyendo ese libro dias antes del asesinato  yo creo q vale la pena leerlo  es una preciosa joya que critica a la sociedad  moderna    el protagonista presenta una aberracion lo que le conlleva a tener problemas con las personas de su alrededor  ya que no es comprendido  tipico de un adolescente en busca de su identidad   de hecho  el protagonista me dio la impresion de que podria ser la  juventud  del protagonista de La Nausea de Paul Sartre  un asco a lo que le rodea y un fastidio de las relaciones interpersonales   Por lo que mas me gusto fue porque me identifique mucho con el protagonista  asi de amargada yo   No se que decir de la historia  Fue extrana  no pense que se fuera acabar tan rapido  Un libro corto e interesante  Pero creo que a los que nos gusto fue porque nos agrado Holden  Una de las razones por la que lo lei fue el morbo de saber porque causo tanta polemica en su epoca  acerca de la tematica de sexo  drogas y demas  Y tambien que debe parte de su fama al asunto con el asesino de John Lennon  Otra de las razones fue que el libro debe su nombre a un poema de Robert Burns  que me gusta mucho  En fin  un libro que se lee muy rapido y se disfruta mucho   M n   n cox t sir ed n ed n kitab o kitabdir ki  onu oxuyub

Rye  and said   Read it with care   I didn t know what to make of it  Probably he was alluding to my slight aversion to YA  But I decided to heed his advice  but turns out it was not needed  TCITR  as I will be referring to this book from here onwards  is not like any YA found on the bookshelves of today  which though not necessarily  bad  aren t really to my taste  But this one certainly sets the bar quite high  The story begins with Holden Caulfield  our brash and narcissistic narrator  recounting the events of three days of his life starting with the day he decides to  leave  school  Well  he decides to leave earlier than intended considering the school kicked him out  I should also mention that this was not the first school that he was kicked out of  But that wouldn t faze our fearless teen angst ridden quixotic Caulfield  He perceives the institutions and its occupants  phony  disguising their selfish endeavors and with gentility  I won t reveal more of the story but suffice it to say that the story pretty much follows Holden after his escape from the  graveyard of phonies  to New York  There s drinking  bars  cigarettes  sex and wild abandon  And right there in the hotchpotch  Salinger addresses so many issues and not in the manner of waving the flag right in your face but with so much delicacy  it permeates all the more deeply for it  What more could you want  What struck me throughout the story is the excess use of the word  phony  that is used to describe everything that the child in Holden despises  In fact I believe the child within was the narrator that was in constant loggerheads with the inevitability of the future that ushered adulthood  Adulthood represented artificiality  a joyless  dark and gloomy world  And even so  a constant gloom seemed to be in the very backbone of the story  Which makes sense now that I know the story was supposed to been written from a mental hospital  Another thing  in a long long list  that struck me was how brash and cocky H sounded even though through his own voice it was so clear that he suffered from insecurity issues and felt alienated from a world that didn t quite  get  him  His constant criticisms served as a reflection of his own inadequacies  I found the book like looking into the mind of an adolescent boy without any filter  hence it very beautifully brings forth the deficiencies of mental faculties  not yet refined thoughts and the delicate lack of empathy so true at that age  The tone in the book was monopolized and while to some it may seem quite repetitive  was for me the best tool in the story  It was unadulterated and an excellent coming of age thing  And oh yeah  the book was depressing  How lovely  P S   If I wasn t clear enough already  J D Salinger is a genius  Thank you  I first read this book when I was in high school  I fell in love with the book and carried it around with me  re reading it at least fifty times  The book is written from the point of view of Holden Caulfield  a young teenager from a rich family in New York City who was kicked out of yet another private school for his horrible grades  lack of effort  and general not caring  In the book  Holden wanders around the city alone  going to adult places and observing life as a depressed  detatched person  This book gave me a lot of hope and may have saved my life  because through it  I understood that as alone as I felt sometimes when I was growing up  others had felt that way before me The book was published in 1951  and also gives insight into being a teenager in a wealthy New York family at that time  This book was surprisingly interesting  I liked Holden a lot although I thought he had some issues to resolve  I also enjoyed the constant movement from place to place  it reminded me that when I have something on my mind I can t stay in one place and I can t find peace  This book made me think of how out of perspective we see things sometimes when we can t share our deepest emotions and can t communicate effectively with others  Everything we do is great  we are true to ourselves and everyone else is phony and sometimes mean  We just can t realize that sometimes we are the reason we are unhappy and nobody else but ourselves  It is interesting that Holden while he hang out with every random person he had met and could get in touch with he dared not get in touch with the only person he had really communicated effectively in the past  I enjoyed the fantasies he had  for example the ones with him being shot like on movies  This book had many layers  many themes to ponder about  great humor and it was pretty easy to read  I liked it so much I thing I am going to read it again soon   In most books the narrater talks like he or she is giving a presentation to a large group of people they have never seen or heard of  In Catcher  Holden Caufield seems to talk to you and only you like he is your best friend in the world  this is one of the few things I love about the book  What I also live is the hidden meanings and metaphors in the book  like the red hunting cap or him getting kicked put of every school Salinger also called it  getting the ax   as to say that it as violent to Holden in a way Salinger was amazing and Holden seems like he gets the reader  no matter who the reader is  A definite five star book and a must read for everyone  Touching  sad  extremely well written  Have to digest this a bit  Un  must  de la literatura juvenil  Lo mejor de El Guardian Entre El Centeno es que no sabes a que va toda la historia pero seguis leyendo  Con esta novela me identifico mucho en el gusto por los ninos y los buenos profesores  Al final me va pareciendo como que toda la historia que se lleva leida es una mentira mas de Holden Los buenos libros teenager deberian ser solo los escritos por adolescentes de verdad  Incluso el papa de esa categoria  El Guardian  no logra plasmar por completo la forma como pensamos  El problema es que nadie toma en serio lo que escribe alguien de 17 anos  Ojala llegara un fenomeno tipo Lorde a la literatura  LO VOLVERIA A LEER Despues de algunos anos  I really like the way this book is narrated  it feels like an honest conversation between the reader and narrator  Holden brings something up and then he connects it with an anecdote  and then when he finishes talking about it he brings it back to the place where we left off  This could ve been a pain if you didn t really like the character  I think  For me  the narrator was very relate able  It felt as if I was reading a book about myself   He started off with about fifty corny jokes  just to show us what a regular guy he was   16   He told us what ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all  He said he talked to Jesus all the time  Even when he was driving his car  That killed me  I can just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs   17   Sensitive  That killed me  That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat   55   Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective  She s supposed to be an orphan  but her old man keeps showing up  Her old man s always a  tall attractive gentleman about 20 years of age   That kills me   68   He was one of those guys that think they re being a pansy if they don t break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you   86 87   The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to ve met each other  Which always kills me  I m always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though   87   People are always ruining things for you   87   I used to think she was quite intelligent  in my stupidity  The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff  If somebody knows quite a lot about those things  it takes quite a while to find out whether they re really stupid or not   105   The thing is  it s really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs  if yours are really good ones and theirs aren t   109   It always smelled like it was raining outside  even if it wasn t  and you were in the only nice  dry  cosy place in the world   120   All I can say is  don t see it if you don t want to puke all over yourself   139     I wish more movies would have reviews like this  You should ve seen old Phoebe  She had on these blue pajamas with red elephants on the collars  Elephants knock her out   163     Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior    189   Credo siano pochi i libri in cui il protagonista e cosi invadente  cosi iconico da travalicare la storia concepita dall autore e dare il via a una vita propria  In questo senso  il titolo italiano mi sembra quasi piu adatto dell originale   il centro nevralgico di tutto e Holden  ed e impossibile abbozzare un qualunque commento senza riconoscere questo dato di fatto  Holden e giovane  come dice il nostro titolo  e come tale si comporta  anzi  sembra incarnare alcuni dei difetti piu irritanti dell adolescenza  Spaccone  finge di non curarsi dell opinione altrui  inventa storie per non doversi giustificare con nessuno  talvolta e vigliacco  spesso non fa quel che vorrebbe  e fa quel che non vuole  il punto  pero  e che lui stesso se ne rende conto  Holden e il primo a riconoscersi tutti i difetti di questo mondo  ad attribuirseli e a dolersene  anche se in una maniera un po  sbruffona  come se tentasse cosi di allontanarli  e nasconde allo stesso modo la malinconia che permea la sua anima  una sensazione con radici profonde che nel corso del romanzo si affaccia sempre piu spesso nelle riflessioni del nostro protagonista  E  una caratterizzazione che reputo valida ed emotivamente vicina anche ai giovani di oggi   tant e che mi sono intravista in alcuni tratti  e in molti altri ho visto difetti e convinzioni che spero di aver lasciato indietro  insieme ai miei 16 anni   Ci sono alcuni commenti di Holden che sono evidentemente figli degli anni  40  50  ma ad eccezione di queste credo che si possa vedere in lui una figura di giovane che trascende il suo determinato tempo storico A dirla tutta  pero  penso che se lo conoscessi nella vita reale finirei per litigarci  penso anche che berrei volentieri due dita di whiskey con lui  ci parlerei e proverei ad ascoltarlo  Nessuno  in questo libro  sembra davvero ascoltare Holden  in parte perche lui stesso non sa ancora bene come esprimere il turbamento che lo smuove  in parte perche nessuno si prende davvero la briga di farlo  abbandonano quello che a loro sembra un guazzabuglio  quando basterebbe dargli un poco di vera attenzione per aiutarlo a mettere in ordine il suo subbuglio interiore  Il libro  cosi  sembra andare avanti di episodio in episodio  tant e che e quasi impossibile riassumerne la trama   ne e esempio il mio misero tentativo   Ci sono solo brevi incontri  in cui Holden cerca di comunicare e l interlocutore lo rigetta  consapevolmente o inconsapevolmente  Suscita pena e una sorta di desiderio di aiutarlo  almeno finche non ci si rende conto che rigetterebbe tutto questo con qualche parola sborona  Holden cerca qualcuno che lo comprenda e che lo accolga  senza compassione L unica persona che sembra riuscire a dargli questo e Phoebe  la sua sorellina minore  La vecchia Phoebe  come direbbe lui  e un personaggio che non appare molto ma che viene spesso richiamata attraverso i ricordi di Holden  cosi come i suoi due fratelli  D  B  e Allie  C e un forte senso di vicinanza  di sostegno reciproco  quando Holden parla di loro  anche chi non c e piu sembra essere in qualche modo presente  Phoebe risulta senza dubbio la piu tenera e la piu vicina  a livello affettivo  al nostro protagonista  Credo che Salinger sia riuscito a descrivere bene anche il suo atteggiamento  non e facile rendere realistico il comportamento di una bambina di dieci anni  Mi e piaciuta particolarmente una scena in cui tiene il muso a Holden   perche e un momento vero del rapporto tra fratello e sorella  Mi sarebbe piaciuto poter vedere anche Allie  in azione  purtroppo  ci si deve accontentare delle reminiscenze di Holden  Il suo guantone da baseball e un oggetto dai forti connotati simbolici  che mi ha colpita per l aura di serenita che sembra portare con se Volendo tirare le somme  credo di aver capito perche a tanta gente non piace questo libro  e tutta una questione di simpatia o meno nei confronti di Holden  Proprio per la sua centralita cosi pervasiva  l empatia nei suoi confronti diventa fondamentale per apprezzare il libro  se manca  diventa impossibile  Prima di leggerlo pensavo fosse il linguaggio l ostacolo piu grande  dato che tutti parlano della tendenza del protagonista a esprimersi con determinati modi di dire e con un ritmo narrativo particolare  ma in realta credo che sia una particolarita a cui ci si abitua in poche decine di pagine  personalmente  una volta entrata nel meccanismo  mi ha reso molto piu facile l empatia con Holden e mi ha permesso di vivere questa lettura come se fosse un effettiva conversazione con lui  A tal proposito  la traduttrice Adriana Motti si merita solo applausi e complimenti  perche la resa in italiano dev essere stata davvero ostica  tra i vattelapesca  i colloquialismi e il gergo americano  E ovviamente merita i giusti complimenti anche il primo creatore di questa parlata  ovvero Salinger  all epoca la sua fu una scelta particolare e d impatto  che si riverbera senza alcun dubbio su parte della narrativa odierna La conclusione lascia una forte malinconia e  allo stesso tempo  l impressione di essere sull orlo di un momento piu felice  di un cambiamento dettato finalmente dal confronto  Eppure non voglio chiudere il mio commento con una nota triste  perche Holden e riuscito a farmi sorridere  quindi  permettetemi di sdrammatizzare con un suggerimento e un affermazione  Il suggerimento e quello di vedere i video di John Green su questo libro  qui e qui   dato che in America questo libro e un classico riconosciuto  la sua analisi e molto piu approfondita della mia e si rifa a letture e analisi di livello universitario   oltre a essere davvero piacevole e simpatica da ascoltare  come tutte le lezioni del canale Crash Course e  in generale  i video di John e di Hank Green  L affermazione e questa  Holden  rivaluta Addio alle armi  So che hai scritto che non ti e piaciuto  ma secondo me gli devi un altra chance  I m generally very black and white whether I liked a book or not  Contrary to what I ve heard about the book  I ended up liking The Catcher in the Rye  It s not a hard book to understand  it s a pretty basic adolescent novel that doesn t take that much intellect to piece together  It was still a lovely quick read and a lovely story  It reminded me of a classier  actually well written  John Green novel  But unlike Looking for Alaska  Catcher in the Rye was a pleasant book to read  As whiny as the book was  It was enjoyable  what coming of age novel isn t whiny    I hated Holden and loved him at the same time  I d have to say the main reason for liking this book is that its terribly blunt about society  It doesn t take shortcuts around the unavoidable eyesores of life at the time  the whole purpose of literature   I love this book  it s one of my favorites  I just finished another book I compared to Catcher in my review and thought to myself it had been 20 years since I last read Cather  I thought I should re read it to see if I still remembered it accurately  He was one of those guys that think they re being a pansy if they don t break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you  God  I hate that stuff  The king of hyperbole  I identify so much with Holden   But my parents  especially my mother  she has ears like a goddam bloodhound  So I took it very  very easy when I went past their door  I even held my breath  for God s sake  You can hit my father over the head with a chair and he won t wake up  but my mother  all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in Siberia and she ll hear you  I love the wording  the language still feels fresh and new 75 years later  This is the original teen angst book that started the ball rolling for generations of copy cats I think this also may have been the first book I read that dealt with homosexuality Fuck you  Prev zkhodna kniga  ot tiia deto nishcho

the hell is this book a classic  It s just about a teenage knucklehead who has no motivation   I actually put the book down once and wasn t going to finish it  But I picked it up again for some unknown reason  Then  when I figured out what was going on  I became engrossed  I believe that the protagonist  Holden Caulfield     perhaps the author    at least part autobiography   has ADHD and some level of autism  It s amazing to me that this book became a classic long before anyone had ever heard of these conditions and despite the fact that the book was banned in many places because of the bad language  On some level  I guess many readers even then realized that something was  wrong  with Holden  and therefore felt sympathy for him  But one must ask   given that Holden saw most people as phonies  and worried about things like where the ducks go in Central Park when the lake is frozen   was something really wrong with him  or is something wrong with the rest of us  I have never read something like this before  I don t mean to sound melodramatic and all  but boy  did this book knock me off  Like hell it did  Infact it killed me  I swear I am not kidding  The Catcher in the Rye was ground breaking and shocking in 1951 and it would be the same if it was released today  Anyone who has ever experienced anxst  social pressures  alienation  or sadness can relate to Holden Caulfield s internal and external struggles  Holden is the most memorable and sympathetic character I have come across in reading fiction  I have read this book 6 times and plan on reading it again soon  The novel is fast paced and hard to put down  From Holden s last day at Pencey Prep to his stay in New York  his dust up with a prostitute and her pimp to his awkward and uncomfortable situation involving a drunken  overly friendly ex teacher  the protagonist experiences the full spectrum of emotions and experience If you haven t read it more than once  please do yourself a favor and read it and read it again  I can t even begin to describe this book  It made me feel a mix of emotions  Hatred  sadness  and sometimes it just pissed me off  It hurt to see him like that  At some point I felt his pain but really  I don t even know  Depression is horrible and it sucked that he had to go through it specially alone I feel like he was just another lonely kid looking for approval  Looking for someone to hold him and guide him  A little paranoid  yes  but understandable  Loosing someone does that to you  I definitely recommend this book  100 percent  This may not be a very good review but I just had to express my thoughts  I just loved it and hated it at the same time  I found this novel humorous because of the contrast between Holden s struggle to be viewed as an adult and his hypocritical opinions on the world  I found the way he stands in the way of himself to be a very relatable theme and it added to his complexity as a character  He outcasts himself and has very strong opinions about the  adult world  mostly consisting of the belief that most people are fake  His experiences as a 16 year old boy in the mindset of someone much older makes for a very interesting story although I found the language repetitive  I believe this use of language was intentional to properly reflect his tone as a young person and it added humor to the stories as Holden described them  I really enjoyed this novel and would definitely recommend it  I absolutely loved this book  Salinger created a book and a character that can be understood on many different levels  I m not always a fan for the clasic coming of age novel  but The Catcher in the Rye proved to be something different and unique  Readers who experience the world through Holden s eyes will come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live  Being a teenager myself  I connected with the teen angst that conflicted with Holden s everyday life  I liked it so much I read it twice this summer and I found that with each reading I was provided with so much more illumination into the main character and the message of the novel  The Catcher In The RyeSince his debut in 1951 as The Catcher In The Rye  Holden Caulfield has been fighting to live in a society in which where he believe theres phonies  In this novel detail are from post WWII  Many of his frustration you can find from his childhood when he moves from prep school to prep school  The Catcher In The Rye was published in a time where America was the economy was making everything prosperous  Salinger used profanity and slang in his text because he discussed adolescent sexuality in a complex and open way  The Catcher In The Rye caused many controversy upon its release because of this  Many critics believed that this wasn t serious literature  Although many people argue that Salinger was way ahead of his time when it came to writing  Due to many books like this a counterculture began from through the 1950 s 1960 s  This was a tale of a individual s alienation within a heartless world  Holden seems to stand for people who feels like they have a pressure of growing up and for people who revolt on the social norm   From his teachers to his classmates Holden realizes a pattern of corrupt within the people within his life  The story starts of by giving a brief synonymous of his life then it continues by explain his school and his teachers which some were very close to his heart  Holden after a few days tells us the readers that he has been expelled from his school  Then he gets into a vicious fight with his roommate who s so disrespects his soulmate from his childhood  Holden the runs away from his prep school and then goes fades in the dark for a long time as he struggles to find himself in this society  He eventually finds some kind of peace within his sister  He continued to go back a play with his sister  This concludes at the end with him standing the field of rye proclaiming that if any child falls to society he will be there to catch him   This book is rediculously good  Its strange and altogether different from anything I have ever read  Holden Caulfield is one of the best and most misunderstood heros of all time  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger Imagine living in a world feeling that practically everything around you was phony  crumby  or lousy  What if you were also lost and out of place in society  What if you didn t know where to turn and what direction you wanted to go  That is the story of Holden Caulfield  an adolescent who is flunking four classes and is kicked out of boarding school once again  He decides to come home a few days before Christmas break because he feels he doesn t have a reason left to stay at Pencey Prep  The book takes place mostly in Manhattan  New York   Holden s home city   in the late 1940 s  and describes Holden s several day journey in New York after he is kicked out of school  We go on adventures with Holden and learn about his troubles with sexuality  loneliness  communication  and alienation  Will Holden try to redeem himself  Will a different side to Holden be revealed  What will he accomplish while in New York  The Catcher in the Rye is a classic because it has been around for over fifty years and stood the test of time  The emotions and journey that Holden goes through are relevant to all adolescents from any time period  and the lessons learned from the story can teach us principles that are important to understand in our world as well  I think Salinger did an exquisite job of incorporating motifs  themes  and symbolism extremely precisely and carefully to reveal a spectacular novel  ex ducks  loneliness   Salinger also developed the main character  Holden  beautifully  so that by the end of the novel I really understood his personality and the troubles he was facing  I would have liked to see more redemption in Holden by the end of the story  but I will admit it added a mysterious aspect to the narrative  In my opinion  The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger is a wonderfully executed classic novel  where Salinger masterfully creates a symbolic meaning and shares many insightful messages Rating  Exactly unlike Holden s view of the world   how ironic   Literary term shoutout  The book was brilliant  insightful  and thoughtful Bibliography  Salinger  J D  The Catcher in the Rye  New York  Little Brown and Company  1951  I ve wanted to read this book for a long time  and now that I ve finally gotten around to it  I was surprised to find that it s one of my favourites What appeals to me so strongly about The Catcher in the Rye is Salinger s fantastically original style  It s blunt  straightforward  and repetitive  and it s full of casual swearing and  50s slang  The narrator protagonist  Holden Caulfield  really comes to life through this text  and you feel as though he s musing with you at a party about his recent experiences getting kicked out of school and loitering around New York City for a few days  He s whiny  chauvinistic  and bitter  but he s also emotionally fragile  insightful  and deeply sympathetic  Like a real person  he often behaves frustratingly  yet he has many moments of kindness and is really a gentle person  Salinger succeeds excellently at creating a detailed and moving portrait of a troubled but determined youth I both enjoyed being taken back in time to the  50s  led through the chaotic but colourful streets and trains of New York with Salinger s cleverly descriptive writing  and becoming acquainted with the protagonist  his nervous habits and opinions  and sharing a few days of his difficult  unusual life  The story made me nostalgic for my own youth but also reminded me of the beauty that can be found even in trying times  I wish I would have read this when I was 14 instead of 41   To understand much of modern literature  I believe it is essential to read The Catcher in the Rye or at least have an understanding of its concept  It s an interesting book  one which I found difficult to read until you understand  Holden Caulfield is misogynistic  arrogant and self proclaimed  best liars in the world  and I hated him  Oh  I hated him so much  I think everyone did initially regardless of gender or age  Holden was the embodiment of everyone you never wanted to meet And yet  one finds themselves sympathising with him by the end of the novel  Not because he isn t a dick or a homophobe  not because you realised he was right all along and not because you finally understood him  I think the best way to describe your feelings towards Holden by the last page was  you got him  You finally understood why he was who he was  why he behaved as he did and why all his actions had meaning and purpose behind them There s something about The Catcher in the Rye  it s not a book I would necessarily read over and over again but it s one I would urge everyone to read at least twice in the life   once  blind to the ending and then again because knowing one little detail makes a hell of a lot of difference to the story   The first time I read this I was 15  Going back to it now as a mature   ahem   adult it s interesting to see what was either forgotten or didn t register  Holden s relationship with Phoebe and his drive to erase all the  F  k Yous  wherever she might see them I remembered well  His difficulty fitting in and his cries against the phonies are what spoke to me most as I was struggling with these things myself  His privileged private school life and entitled attitudes I d apparently forgotten  This may ve had something to do with the fact that for my 15 y o  self  they were foreign countries to me  as was New York City   I ve since lived there   His brush with a family friend who may ve touched him inappropriately and his sensitivity to such overtures through his experience I also didn t remember  Like returning to Disneyland as an adult  I may ve been disappointed by what might ve been my overwrought expectations  The book has loomed so large in my memory for so many years I guess I couldn t help but be a little disappointed in my return as an adult  It s still a great book  mind you  Recently I was inspired to read the rest of Salinger s work   Franny and Zoey   his short story collection  and I enjoyed those immensely  It was disappointing to realize that I d run out of Salinger s work so quickly  Whether I loved Catcher as much the second time  though  almost doesn t matter  It was something I had to do  It s something we should all do  if only to  measure  our adult minds against our teenage ones  I went into this novel with low expectations  I was aware it was a classic  but after reading the first 10 15 pages  I was actually a little put off by Holden s views  Diving deeper into this book however  I found Holden Caulfield to be a very gripping and interesting character  The narrative was excellent  and I felt as if a very dear friend was speaking to me throughout the entire plot  I still wasn t 100  about Holden s ideals of phonies  but the way he described his life  and a simple course of 2 days  I was hooked from start to finish  and completely understood his mindset and his views  After all  you don t have to agree with someone s mindset to understand it  Overall  excellent narrative  As the pages flipped  and finally ended  I felt as if I was saying good bye  to a very dear friend  I really did   I finally got around to reading this mostly mentioned book in must read book lists  I thought it would be difficult to read since it is said to be a classic but I found it to be much relatable even as it was written about half a century from now  Even though I m way pass my teens I can still relate to Holden Caulfield  His angst and his thoughts i find similar to mine  The way he sometimes lables some people of being a phony  I get that sometimes when I get around hypocrites  I love getting inside his thoughts it make me feel less alone and normal I also find his relationship with his sister  Phoebe  very cute  Then that part about Phoebe asking him what he likes a lot and Holden mentions Allie as one and second would be that exact moment he was spending with his sister  I enjoyed reading this book  A new addition to my favorite books  for those of you who struggle with your identity crisis  maybe you could try and read this book  since i started to question my identity and belonging as well afterward  i read this book back in highschool  somehow at first i cant really enjoy this novel  just because its cumpolsory so i read it  until i realize that this book actually wasnt that bad  a lot of good quotes comes from peculiarities teenage boy  holden caulfield somehow i like the way Holden s criticizes and philosophizes about people who are boring  people who are insecure  and above all  people who are  phony   that   stucks in my head and i started using the word too  there is something about his discontent  his vivid way of expressing things  or how extremely judgemental he is  how he manifests complete apathy toward his future  obviously his emotional state have something to do with his traumas in the past  however  with Holden s cantankerousness  i staggered to make him my hero in this book   hwldn z my kynd  f   frynd  l sbb kthyr  wmjrd krhn lmshtrk llmjtm  syj l mn  Sdq mqrbyn

kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around  nobody big  I mean  except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy   Again  I understood so much more of this book the second time I read it  I feel that this time around I really identified with Holden s inability to understand and accept certain parts of society  Even though I recognize his obsession with preserving youth is unhealthy  I can relate to his fear of growing up  and fear of entering the foreboding  adult world   A world full of phonies  I am most fascinated with the way that Holden interacts with people around him  half the time he wants them there  and then as soon as they get close  he pushes them away  Well  I suppose I shouldn t go on with this review  Reviewing a book on the internet  to be honest  is quite phony   It raptured hell out of me  Really enjoyed this book   I remember the moment when I was reading thatevery page connected me to Holden Caulfield  I felt that the author knows what s on my mind  Phoebe is also lovable  Goodness  Can t wait to reread this book on vacation I thank JD Salinger for creating this novel  such a wild imagination  thlth   ym mn Hy  mrhq  bry  thy r

only just read Catcher in the Rye  I read it in a single sitting and was engrossed by the astonishing stream of consciousness voice that J D  Salinger captured so skillfully  Creating an authentic child or adolescent voice is one of the hardest literary challenges and few manage to succeed  Salinger allowed us to live inside Holden Caulfield s head for a few days  And now he lives inside mine  You have to read this book in its FULL UNCENSORED ENGLISH version  I don t think any translated edition will keep the spirit and words used in New York in 1951 It s a novel about finding you own destination  about the dilemma of doing what you want to or what the others expect you to I loved the ending so much  It was really brilliant You might think you are the catcher and  all of a sudden  you realize that you re the fallen and some little kid is your catcher   I absolutely just loved reading this book  I felt like I actually had a mutual connection between the main charactar Holden  which is kinda weird to say  the way he was always lonely and felt as if he didn t have anyone  but that person was right under his nose    very good overall  first couple things are little boring  yet the history becomes more and more engaging  new facts are being disclosed  the connection with this guy who is in the first place here is being created and at the same time all the surroundings become pretty nasty for this young fellow  the reader is submerging in the new york city walking with Holden  observing  liking him    although he himself has at least something from a dark in his thoughts and acts  behaves strange many times much older guys wouldn t do what he does  yet he speaks and faces concerns with sensitiveness and maybe little exaggerating them  finally it s unclear if it s him who s too sensitive to cope with all of that or maybe the the reader is yet too cynic or disconnected to understand    I must agree with my good friend on this book  if you read it and hated it  you missed the point  Many of the criticism stems from the adolescent narrator  To quote a review I recently read   I wanted to tell him to grow up   I think that s the reaction Salinger wanted the adult readers to have  Being 20 years old  I may be too close to his age to really tell the  more mature and sophisticated  readers that it s not Holden s flaw  but your own  I still agree with Holden that there are so many people that are jaded  and  to put it like he would  that kills me  I know that I  sixty years later  still yearn for a genuine person to have a friendship or relationship with because the pickin s are slim  I d argue that if you hated this book  you are the definition of phony that makes Holden sick  I believe your enjoyment of this book will really boils down to how you view life  If you re a cheery I love life kinda person  this book can be quite a drag  If you re the why am I always sad type  you might take comfort in Holden s words  I admit that I did not like this book the first time I read it some four or so years ago  I was in 11th grade and was too naive to understand or comprehend any of the crap that Holden was talking about  I am very happy that I gave this book another chance  And you should too Side note  I am convinced that Holden was molested when he was a child P S    Why can t everything just go back being cheap like it was back in the good ole days P S S    J D  Salinger spelled  good bye  as  good by  throughout this entire book  That killed me My favorite quotes  which is every single shit that came out of Holden s mouth but I ll try to keep it short and sweet  She wasn t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire   The more expensive a school is  the more crooks it has     It s partly true  too  but it isn t all true  People always think something s all true   I was trying to feel some kind of good by   I don t care if it s a sad good by or a bad good by  but when I leave a place I like to know I m leaving it   I felt like I was sort of disappearing  It was that kind of a crazy afternoon  terrifically cold  and no sun out or anything  and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road   I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot  and if you thought about him too much  you wondered what the heck he was still living for  I mean he was all stooped over  and he had very terrible posture  and in class  whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard  some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him  That s awful  in my opinion      but people never notice it  People never notice anything   Boy  you can t imagine how sorry I was getting that I d stopped by to say good by to him  He started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something   I m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life  It s awful  If I m on my way to the store to buy a magazine  even  and somebody asks me where I m going  I m liable to say I m going to the opera  It s terrible   I m quite illiterate  but I read a lot   What really knocks me out is a book that when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   He was always in a big hurry  Everything was a very big deal   But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his picture in your Year Book  they d right away say   Who s this boy   I mean he was mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy   He was always asking you to do him a big favor  You take a very handsome guy  or a guy that thinks he s a real hot shot  and they re always asking you to do them a big favor  Just because they re crazy about themself  they think you re crazy about them  too  and that you re just dying to do them a favor   Ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row   He always had to know who was going  I swear  if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere  and you rescued him in a goddam boat  he d want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he d even get in   People never believe you   That guy had just about everything  Sinus trouble  pimples  lousy teeth  halitosis  crumby fingernails  You had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch   I can t remember  I was so damn worried  that s why  When I really worry about something  I don t just fool around  I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something  Only  I don t go  I m too worried to go  I don t want to interrupt my worrying to go   He hated it when you called him a moron  All morons hate it when you call them a moron   I felt so lonesome  all of a sudden  I almost wished I was dead   Every time I thought about it  I felt like jumping out the window   It made me feel pretty sad  She bought me the wrong kind of skates   I wanted racing skates and she bought hockey   but it made me sad anyway  Almost every time somebody gives me a present  it ends up making me sad   I hate saying corny things like  traveling incognito   But when I m with somebody that s corny  I always act corny too   As a matter of fact  I m the only dumb one in the family  My brother D B  s a writer and all  and my brother Allie  the one that died  that I told you about  was a wizard  I m the only really dumb one   The only trouble is  she s a little too affectionate sometimes  She s very emotional  for a child   In New York  boy  money really talks     That s the thing about girls  Every time they do something pretty  even if they re not much to look at  or even if they re sort of stupid  you fall half in love with them  and then you never know where the hell you are   Most girls if you hold hands with them  their goddam hand dies on you  or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time  as if they were afraid they d bore you or something   Ernie s a big fat colored guy that plays the piano  He s a terrific snob and he won t hardly even talk to you unless you re a big shot or a celebrity or something  but he can really play the piano   I certainly like to hear him play  but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over  I think it s because sometimes when he plays  he sounds like the kind of guy that won t talk to you unless you re a big shot   New York s terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night  you can hear it for miles  It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed  I kept wishing I could go home     People always clap for the wrong things   He was one of those guys that think they re being a pansy if they don t break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you   The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to ve met each other  Which always kills me  I m always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though   People are always ruining things for you   It was against my principles and all  but I was feeling so depressed I didn t even think  That s the whole trouble  When you re feeling very depressed  you can t even think   You never know whether they really want you to stop  or whether they re just scared as hell  or whether they re just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it  the blame ll be on you  not them      and when I went to open it  I had my suitcase right in the way and I fell over it and damn near broke my knee  I always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something   It made me feel sort of sad when I hung it up  I thought of her going in a store and buying it  and nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all  The salesman probably just thought she was a regular gil when she bought it  It made me feel sad as hell   I don t know why exactly   It wasn t that I didn t use to take him with me when I went somewhere  I did  But that one day  I didn t  He didn t get sore about it   he never got sore about anything   but I keep thinking about it anyway  when I get very depressed   I used to think she was quite intelligent  in my stupidity  The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff  If somebody knows quite a lot about those things  it takes you quite a while to find out whether they re really stupid or not   I took a look out the window before I left the room  though  to see how all the perverts were doing  but they all had their shades down  They were the heighth of modesty in the morning   He kept saying they were too new and bourgeois  That was his favorite goddam word  He read it somewhere or heard it somewhere  Everything I had was bourgeois as hell  Even my fountain pen was bourgeois  He borrowed it off me all the time  but it was bourgeois anyway   It isn t important  I know  but I hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases  It sounds terrible to say it  but I can even get to hate somebody  just looking at them  if they have cheap suitcases with them   It s one of the reasons why I roomed with a stupid bastard like Stradlater  At least his suitcases were as good as mine   Catholics are always trying to find out if yo re a Catholic   Goddam money  It always ends up making you blue as hell   It always smelled like it was raining outside  even if it wasn t  and you were in the only nice  dry  cosy place in the world   The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody d move   Certain things they should stay the way they are  You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone   Girls with their legs crossed  girls with their legs not crossed  girls with terrific legs  girls with lousy legs  girls that looked like swell girls  girls that looked like they d be bitches if you knew them  It was really nice sightseeing  if you know what I mean  In a way  it was sort of depressing  too  because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them  When they got out of school and college  I mean  You figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys  Guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars  Guys that get sore and chlidish as hell if you beat them at golf  or even just some stupid game like ping pong  Guys that are very mean  guys that never read books  Guys that are very boring     If a girl looks swell when she meets you  who gives a damn if she s late  Nobody   You ought to go to a boys  school sometime  Try it sometime  It s full of phonies  and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day  and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses  and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day  and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques  The guys that are on the basketball team stick together  the Catholics stick together  the goddam intellectuals stick together  the guys that play bridge stick together  Even the guys that belong to the goddam Book of the Month Club stick together   Look  Here s my idea  How would you like to get the hell out of here  Here s my idea  I know this guy down in Greenwich Village that we can borrow his car for a couple of weeks  He used to go to the same school I did and he still owes me ten bucks  What we could do is  tomorrow morning we could drive up to Massachusetts and Vermont  and all around there  see  It s beautiful as hell up there  It really is   No kidding  I have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank  I can take it out when it opens in the morning  and then I could go down and get this guy s car  No kidding  We ll stay in these cabin camps and stuff like that till the dough runs out  Then  when the dough runs out  I could get a job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and  later on  we could get married or something  I could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all  Honest to God  we could have a terrific time  Wuddaya say  C mon  Wuddaya say  Will you do it with me  Please   I said no  there wouldn t be marvelous places to go to after I went to college and all  Open your ears  It d be entirely different  We d have to go downstairs in elevators with suitcases and stuff  We d have to phone up everybody and tell  em good by and send  em postcards from hotels and all  And I d be working in some office  making a lot of dough  and riding to work in cabs and Madison Avenue buses  and reading newspapers  and playing bridge all the time  and going to the movies and seeing a lot of stupid shorts and coming attractions and newsreels  Newsreels  Christ almighty  There s always a dumb horse race  and some dame breaking a botle over a ship  and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pants on  It wouldn t be the same at all  you don t see what I mean at all   I laughed  And I have one of these very loud  stupid laughs  I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something  I d probably lean over and tell myself to shut up   The trouble with girls is  if they like a boy  no matter how big a bastard he is  they ll say he has an inferiority complex  and if they don t like him  no matter how nice a guy he is  or how big an inferiority complex he has  they ll say he s conceited  Even smart girls do it   You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies  and nine times out of ten they re mean bastards at heart  I m not kidding   You could tell he didn t feel like discussing anything serious with me  That s the trouble with these intellectual guys  They never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it   Maybe I ll go to China  My sex life is lousy   He said he would  be he probably didn t even give her my message  People never give your message to anybody   Who wants flowers when you re dead  Nobody   All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they ll do practically anything you want them to   But my parents  especially my mother  she has ears like a goddam bloodound   You can hit my father over the head with a chair and he won t wake up  but my mother  all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in Siberia and she ll hear you   I know he s dead  Don t you think I know that  I can still like him  though  can t I  Just because somebody s dead  you don t just stop liking them  for God s sake   especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re alive and all   Lawyers are all right  I guess   but it doesn t appeal to me  I mean they re all right if tey go around saving innocent guys  lives all the time  and like that  but you don t do taht kind of stuff if you re a lawyer  All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot shot  And besides  Even if you did go around saing guys  lives and all  how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys  lives  or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer  with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over  the reporters and everybody  they way it is in the dirty movies  How would you know you weren t being a phony  The trouble is  you wouldn t   I thought it was  If a body catch a body   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of litle kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I wmean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  I know it s crazy   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose  Try it sometime  I think  even  if I ever die and they stick me in a cementery  and I have a tombstone and all  it ll say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under that it ll say  Fuck you   I m positive  in fact      lots of time you don t know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesn t interst you most   This fall I think you re riding for   it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement s designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  So they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even got started   Once you get past all the Mr Vinsons  you re going to start getting closer and closer   that is  if you want to  and if you look for it and wait for it   to the kind of information that will be very  very dear to your heart  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior   Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement   Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb  I had this feeling that I d never get to the other side of the street  I thought I d just go down  down  and nobody d ever see me again   Allie  don t let me disappear  Allie  don t let me disappear  Allie  don t let me disappear  Please  Allie   Finally  what I decided I d do  I decided I d go away  I decided I d never go home again and I d never go away to another school again  I decided I d just see old Phoebe and sort of say good by to her and all  and give her back her Christmas dough  and then I d start hitchhiking my way out West  What I d do  I figured  I d go down to the Holland Tunnel and bum a ride  and then I d bum another one  and another one  and another one  and in a few days I d be somewhere out West where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobody d know me and I d get a job I figured I could get a job at a filling station somewhere  putting gas and oil in people s cars  I didn t care what kind of a job it was  though  Just so people didn t know me and I didn t know anybody  I thought what I d do was  I d pretend I was one of those deaf mutes  That way I wouldn t have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody  If anybody wanted to tell me something  they d have to write it on a piece of paper and show it over to me  They d get bored as hell doing that after a while  and then I d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life  Everybody d think I was just a poor deaf mute bastard and they d leave me alone  They d let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars  and they d pay me a salary and all for it  and I d build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough I made and live there for the rest of my life  I d build it right near the woods  but not right in them  because I d want it to be sunny as hell all the time  I d cook all my own food  and later on  if I wanted to get married or something  I d meet this beautiful girl taht was also a deaf mute and we d get married  She d come and live in my cabin with me  and if she wanted to say anything to me  she d have to write it on a goddam piece of paper  like everybody else  If we had any children  we d hide them somewhere  We could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to read and write by ourselves   A lot of people   keeps asking me if I m going to apply myself when I go back to school next September  It s such a stupid question  in my opinion  I mean how do you know what you re going to do till you do it  The answer is  you don t  I think I am  but how do I know  I swear it s a stupid question   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   I somehow missed out on reading this in high school  so this is my first time through it  It is a very different read than I expected Written during WWII it follows Holden Caulfield  a NY prep school student  who has just learned that he has flunked out of school as he withdraws from almost every thing he knows to hide from his family in NYC  His only strength is his relationship with his little sister  Phoebe  Holden seems to be a complete looser  stepping further and further into self destructive behavior  and the book has become an icon for teen rebellion  But given the way the story ends  it becomes clear that this is very much not the case  I believe that  though it pervades most of the book  the teen rebellion status is misplaced It was actually painful to get through the first 3 4 of the book  and the ending  while well foreshadowed  was still a little unexpected  I struggled with the 5 star rating because Holden seems to be so obnoxious until it becomes clear what is really happening  But by the end  I have to really applaud Salinger for his courage and creativity in telling the story in this strange rambling way The rambling first person POV is annoying  disturbing  and rather unique  It feels almost like stream of consciousness  but in the end it becomes clear that it is something entirely different  But it does really make sense in the end  when it turns the whole effort into a really powerful and focused tool for telling the story  Synopsis  Holden Caulfield has gotten kicked out  again  from his prep school  so he flees to New York  where he does some things and takes some time for himself before going to his parents and explaining what s happened  That s it  Pretty much I ve read this book so many times that I ve lost count  and I think it s the sort of story that will only appeal to a very specific sort of reader  If you enjoy colorful personalities  think that excessive swearing is funny and you spend some of your time reflecting on how fake and screwed up everyone is to some degree  then this is the book for you  Holden says  goddamn  every page and has a very distinct and realistic voice for the more misanthropic  To him  anyone who is an adult or on their way there is a phony  Personally  I think he s absolutely hilarious  I m not sure if the characters feel like people that you d meet in real life  then again  there are some people you meet in real life that don t seem like people you d meet in real life   but there is a realness to all of them  There are little funny stories surrounding them that give them memorable quirks and make them interesting  The story is mainly an emotional journey  which again  only a certain kind of reader is going to go for But if you like people  or you aren t angst ridden  or you like an eventful plot  then Holden will strike you as whiny and or this book will be boring because there isn t a whole lot that happens  I wouldn t recommend it to everyone  but I do love it  Somehow  I expected to not like this book  But  then  I found that I did like it  When a book is as renowned as Catcher in the Rye  I know that I have nothing to add  However  I do think that Perks of Being a Wallflower is simply a modern version of the same story  Wonder who agrees   The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel written by acclaimed novelist J D  Salinger  The book follows the life of Holden Caulfield  a cynical young man that seems to spot the inner  phony  in almost every person he meets  At the novel s inception  Holden is expelled from his boarding school  Pencey Preparatory  after failing to pass a majority of his subjects  with the exception of English  From there  Holden finds himself embarking on a journey to New York  where he encounters experiences that push him further down the road towards adulthood  The most interesting aspect of this novel is that  while it appears to be a coming of age novel  it s clear that its protagonist seems to be opposed to growing up  This can be seen through his desire to be a  catcher in the rye   standing in a rye field at the edge of a cliff  catching children that might attempt to tumble over its edge  It s clear that this is simply a metaphor for saving children from entering the the  phony  adult world  It is this aversion to adulthood that makes him such an interesting central character for a coming of age novel  Another interesting theme of this novel was Holden s continual use of the word  phony   He uses it to imply that  not only was a person fake  but they were also conventional or stereotypical  What I found particularly interesting about his use of the word was the fact that it basically stood as a representation of Holden s fear of adulthood  He uses the concept of  phoniness  to distinguish between childhood and adulthood  and it is this fear of adult  phoniness  that keeps him from growing up   Cynical  wandering  repetitive  comically deadpan  exasperatingly written  and yes  very easy to hate   but what a brave and true thing it wants to say  A rambling monologue from a disaffected adolescent uncovering the  phoniness  and hypocrisy that comes with adulthood  So accurately observed and deeply felt that I shed a few tears during that carousel scene  you ll know the one I mean when you well up at it   I d call it The Bell Jar for men   When people ask for my favorite book  this is the book I tell them about  Nothing has ever come close  The stream of conscience was a brilliant writing technique that writers seem to overlook  Most amazing book of any time   This is ostensibily the story of a psychologically distressed young man who runs away from school and home after the adults in his life fail to recognize the warning signs of his precarious situation  In reality  it s a valentine to youth  rebels  and all lost souls  and  let s face it  we re all a little lost   Young Holden s existential crisis has resonated with readers for more than 5 decades and is as relevant today as when it was first written in the 1950s  The author uses first person narration from the perspective of the young protagonist  but lurking beneath the microcosmic view of an angry young man lies themes and a storyline that are both timeless and universal   Leer El Guardian entre el Centeno es semejante a leer una oda  Una oda brutalmente honesta y de lenguaje muy explicito acerca de todas las contradicciones que representa aquel tetrico umbral que es la adolescencia  La sensacion de abandono  cuya respuesta es una apatica  a veces impulsiva y a veces inquisitiva rebeldia  procede de un ambiente de perenne hipocresia  de mascaras y juegos de fuerzas que a los ojos de nuestro Holden resultan abominables  Por momentos parece que Pencey puede aparecer firmemente anclada en la epoca contemporanea porque  nos guste o no   las generaciones cambian  pero las elecciones resultan ser las mismas   Las bravuconadas de los companeros  la generalizada incompetencia  y otros vicios  del personal academico resultan como la boca de un embudo que solo aparece magnificado en la sordidez del mundo real  Un mundo que nuestro confundido protagonista aborrece con todas sus fuerzas y del que busca escapar refugiandose en la inocencia de su hermana Phoebe Solo queda concluir que El Guardian entre el Centeno es una de las novelas  si no es la que mas  hermosas que he leido    The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger has become one of my all time favorite books  simply because I was able to relate to the main character  Holden Caulfield  Within the book there are many themes such as rebellion  loneliness  alienation  pain  and my personal favorite  the one about phoniness  I believe this book is about a young rebel teen  who has gone through many unfortunate events  like getting kicked out of many schools and is just trying to find his place in life  like many of us  He does some ridiculous things like when he wanted to run away with Sally Hayes  marry her and then live the rest of their lives as recluses  which had totally freaked her out  I actually read this part a couple of times over and over again and found it pretty interesting  One major theme within this book is teenage rebellion and Holden epitomizes this throughout the entirety of the novel as a nonconformist  like many of us  One other theme that stood out to me was the one of phoniness and how many adults display this  Also how the world is filled with hypocrisy with its socializing   getting to know each other   and other societal  bullsh t   With the themes of youth rebellion and phonies it s no wonder why this book has been so controversial  because of the way it displays the human condition and can influence teens  This book is a must read and I would recommend this book to every single person out there   I don t quite recall how I learned of The Catcher in the Rye when I was in middle school  but the copy my parents gave me bears the year I was in eighth grade  After all the time that s passed  when Garrett suggested we reread it together  I was curious to find out how my experience of the book would change To say my experience changed is perhaps an understatement  and probably the best proof that Catcher is not  in fact  a young adult novel  but a work of literature that merits multiple readings at multiple times in one s life  The aspects of the story I remembered from all those years ago   the jagged path Holden takes  his encounter with the prostitute and her pimp  his shivering visit to the duck pond in Central Park   are trees in a forest I m pretty sure I missed completely I trusted Holden more  back then  I didn t notice how subjective his account is  how frequently the motives he ascribes to others are very likely wrong  how distorted and unattainable his ideas of personal authenticity  falseness  purity  and corruption are  I accepted his frustration with the world  not realizing that while Holden is absolutely mismatched with his world  there is no place for him to go that would suit him any better I understand now why he is so fascinated with the ducks at the pond  Each winter  their habitat becomes uninhabitable to them   so what do they do  If Holden can figure that out  it might give him a clue about what he should do about his own world that he finds so uninhabitable There were moments this time when I wanted to diagnose Holden with any number of conditions  ADHD  depression anxiety  something on the mild side of autism  But the truth is that Holden is a teenager  A young man who is incredibly perceptive about the people around him  but equally incapable of making accurate interpretations of what he perceives  He is an idealist  particularly when it comes to the young women in his life who represent purity of a sort a medieval knight might ascribe to his lady  He is the victim of a fifties educational system that presumes that privileged  wealthy boys will do the modicum of work necessary to become privileged  wealthy men  but that has no idea how to cultivate those boys with more sensitive  more vulnerable natures  And he is circling the drain of a nervous breakdown because he has enough monetary resources to sustain him through a cycle of bad choices  but not enough human resources to act as a safety net The marvel of Catcher is how ambiguous it is  Every chapter   particularly in retrospect   can be peeled like an onion  offering debates over motivation and meaning  Holden is in some ways better off at the end  he has apparently landed in some sort of sanitarium  but in some ways worse   his over the shoulder interpretation of events reveals him to be as maladjusted and unformed as he was when they took place  if not more so  The reader can spend numerous readings connecting dots  noticing patterns among events and relationships  this instance of poor judgment and that  but that only points up the fact that we are trying desperately to save a fictional character who will always be just out of reach At several points in this reading  I thought of Holden as a type of anti Ulysses  perhaps as much in Joyce s version as Homer s  Holden is a man on a quest to return home to a woman he loves  in this case  his sister   and he must navigate a series of challenges  in his case  trivial and absurd  rather than heroic  before he gets there  And I wondered if Holden might be viewed as the id of American culture after World War II  when so much was right  if you were male  white  and wealthy  and at the same time so much was wrong  if you weren t   and the fabric of society was beginning to tear in ways that couldn t be predicted in 1950 Both of those comparisons are probably overreaches  What I can say for sure is that Holden s character is one of the most richly drawn in American literature  even if his is a portrait of alienation and desperation  Whether we want to march next to him as a disaffected youth  as I  a depressed  self involved teenager  did  or try to find a safe harbor for him  as I  a slightly more adjusted adult  do   he is a mirror for our troubled souls and times  So much more interesting after reading it again after high school  after experiencing life after college  So much is painfully true  we all have a Holden in us  I really enjoyed reading this book  Holden is a really connectable character  and listening to this story from his point of view is interesting and extremely funny  I would recommend this to anyone  especially guys though   This book was first introduced to me in a school environment  so naturally I was turned off to it  None the less J D Salinger soon had me glued to it so much that I read it again this past summer  For many teens and young readers this classic american novel can seem boring and dull as the story takes a while to develop and action is not found until later in the story  The reason I find this book to be so enticing is that the journey that Holden Caufield goes on is one that is so uncommon for a kid his age that it makes the reader step back and marvel at it  Considering his background and where he is coming from he should not be that much different then most kids that would be reading this book in High School  However you shorty realize how mentally sick and unstable Holden is and that the demented mind of a troubled youth is not always a bad thing  For example Holden can feel and read peoples emotions on a whole other level way better then any psychologist  and that him smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are just masks for his own problems I feel that this book can connect to many young people because of the misfit factor  This is crucial in making this book applicable to a young persons life because without Holden being odd and abnormal this book would not interest young people and connect with them  It is only natural that young self conscious people want to fit in with their peers and looking through the mind of someone who might be having similar troubles to them and seeing how they cope with them couldn t be a better way to connect to teens and young adults  The bottom line is if Holden was a normal kid he would have never done any of the things that make this such a valuable and hypnotic story   This book is read in high schools all over the nation  Pointless self doubt and insecurities from Caulfield makes him so relatable  But there s a sarcastic twist from Salinger in that he s not Caulfield but we sure feel like WE are  In other words the book reaches an unfortunately negative society of kids with a victim mentality  who always think the world s against them and life is pointless  Which is only a faze in high school  I recommend this book twice  while you re in HS and when you ve grown up  I love this book  I love the character Holden  and I hope someday I have a friend like Holden  because he is real  rude and wonderful  He is rude  when it beckons to be  but his heart is pristine  and rich  I know it is only a metaphor  but Holden touches me to such a great extent that he opens up my wired personality  He shows me that I need not be robotic  and aim to please personally  He shows me more than anyone has  I admire his use of language  and his care for people and his expressive need to understand the things around him  and more so himself  I love him Salinger closes this novel with you truly wanting to have a second part of it  Why didn t he just write another part  I guess that s the beauty of it  A friend of mine  who in fact  got me this book didn t understand the title  The evening we were discussing it  I did not either The Catcher in the Rye is centered on the the grounds of sexuality  For the most parts  Holden wasn t ready to give to a young lady his emotions and desires  because he just didnt feel it right to just be with someone because you just had to be  He wanted to feel things  and he needed to feel them deeply  He was fervent  and for that he is amazing  He refused upon many occasions beautiful young ladies  all because he did not feel   Sexuality is inherently perverted and corrupting  in which case  yes  Adulthood is always tragic  because it involves growing into sexuality  Holden is right  I mean  I have the same problem understanding it  although it is inherently a part of life  I still think there is a lot more one can understand before he she dives into it  The Catcher in the Rye is no one but little Holden trying to figure things out  Guess what  He did more than just figuring  He matured  He realized he was not going to die and be a legendary story  but he was going to have a purpose to live  and be I loved it When a book ends with this   it s funny  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   how can one not be a little sad Yours truly and ever blossoming Taymara  V SShA schitaetsia klassikoi  izuchaetsia  Kogda to let dvadtsat  nazad i menia

novel of all time  My  1 Book CrushHolden Caulfield He is dark and mysterious  childish and strange  but there s something about how Salinger portrayed him that made him so darn wonderful  He thinks and observes  He accurately perceived people and their motives  identifying with them  He lies but he s honest  Salinger ended the novel wherein Holden  the character  had gained no sign of maturation  He is what he had been from the start  in his awkward transition form adolescence to adulthood  I loved it about him  He need not change  being in his undesirable state  I liked it better that way knowing something  even if only in novels  need to stay as they were  I loved him that way  damaged and all  Holden had claimed that he wanted to preserve children s innocence  in this case  Salinger had preserved Holden s as just the opposite  Girls shouldn t think of their Prince as the perfect adorable man walking along some forest singing to the birds on his way to rescue them  Do guys really sing their hearts desire  I think they punch the hell out of it  Holden does that  You ll probably wonder what I thought about reading this book  Well  if you want to know the truth  I absolutely loved it  I m scratching my head  wondering why I hadn t read this book until now  Oh  I know  it was banned in my school district As an author myself  reading the words of J D  Salinger through his protagonist  Holden Caufield  has changed my life forever  It killed me  It really did  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE Es dificil escribir algo que este a la altura de este texto  o de la sensacion que me ha provocado su lectura   Esta es la tipica lectura obligada cuando estas en el colegio o el instituto  No fue mi caso  aunque hay una copia del libro que ha permanecido en mi casa por mas de veinte anos y que probablemente pertenece a mi hermano  a quien si que le debio tocar leer este libro en su momento  Yo que no lo hice  leerlo cuando era un adolescente  quiza deba dar las gracias  no se si una lectura temprana me hubiera permitido apreciar este libro en su justa medida  mas aun cuando lo hubiera tenido que leer traducido y  por tanto  adulterado  Tal vez fue una pena  pues pese a todo  quizas hubiera sido capaz de captar parte del mensaje que el libro contiene  En cualquier caso  desde un punto de vista literario  adoro este tipo de libros donde el poso que finalmente te deja no se construye en base a frases que subrayar  sino gracias al subtexto que termina haciendose evidente para todo aquel que lo sepa ver   The first time I read this book I was blown away  I thought it was written so well and I really felt each character and of course at the age of thirteen I thought I was pretty mature to be reading this book  During my book report my english teacher said to me  read this book again in five years  it will mean something completely different to you  She was right  every winter I d pick it up again and re read it and I d catch something new  I became a huge fan of J D  Salinger as a result  At the time it felt like such a badass novel but as the years go by and you re read it becomes more about sentiment and the desire we all have at the crucial moment in our lives where one realizes there is no going back only forward  cynicism at its best  a teenager s continuous evaluation of the world guided by two simple rules   it totally killed me  and  it made me puke   or made jesus puke  because  it was supposed to be religious as hell   a treasure trove of quotes  One of my favorites  The recurring theme is that the protagonist would like a little solidarity  seeks out some by making heady choices only to find the relentless welcome of looming loneliness  I think I enjoyed it most because Holden felt lot more closer to reality and was the best departure from the conventional protagonist who has to be strong  brave and poignant in the most conventional way  I loved Holden s brand of thinking  analyzing  actions and choices  It was very liberating to come across a protagonist like Holden  Unconventional and intriguing  His voice is so starkly and hauntingly strong  clear and engaging  It s like he narrates the story of his psyche in a brutally honest voice  He does not stew in sorrow when there is not a kindred soul around but simply carries on  I loved Holden exactly for that  I have found myself thinking and wondering more than a couple of times how Holden would have played out as an adult  I am most interested in knowing what choices he would have made in his life because characters like Holden are usually steeped in cutting edge experiences I somehow have the notion that the story of this book was not a one off experience that Holden was having because he was suffering something  but rather his choices seemed to be a good reflection of who he was  I also felt that age mostly had nothing to do with it  because someone who originally thinks the way Holden does  can t be undone to fit in and think like the herd  The most age might do is wear off the hyper mode of idealism and tone down a little of those idiosyncrasies that youth so generously bestows The best bits that stayed with me were Holden s need to get a goodbye  his picturesque opinions about movies and his desire to be the catcher in the rye  I found a lot of meaning and profoundness in these three aspects  I laughed out hard at the unique way in which he bids farewell to his dorm residents  Will be re reading it again this year  I ve read this book twice  It is my absolute favorite novel  True  it didn t have a big plot like most books  but that is what made it so different  It s a great little book that enhanced my love of reading  ntwr dsht dr qlb gftry sdh mfhym  myqy rw byn mykhnh  chyzyy khh hmh mydwnym m z khnrshwn bdwn twjh rd

most profound and sociologically impacting books ever written  It is a favorite of millions and now I know why  J D Salinger has created a few characters  primarily Holden Caulfield  who bring out the bitter struggle between conformism to and the rebellion against popular culture  societal norms  conventional education and life s  accepted  rulesets The struggle is all depicted through Holden s psyche and a brilliant narrative uncharacteristic of the 1940 s  A teenager bordering benign deviant behavior and mental illness  Holden narrates his few teenage years and entwines several Common Joe characters most of whom he calls  phony  or  crumby   A few that appealed to his liking   his dead brother and a school mate who committed suicide   clearly bring out his bitterness towards the living society In times of burgeoning teen sexuality  not written much about until then  Salinger s work has brought out the confusion  recklessness and peer pressure that teens can be subjected to in regard to adoloscent sex  Holden stands out as a venerable protagonist when he speaks of his conviction of  sex with respect and with someone whom you care and desire  as opposed to being hapless teens in a hormonal maze  The idea is brought out vividly in the many intereactions between Holden and his girlfriends  their boyfriends and the night with Sunny for whom he paid ten dollars Phoebe s character seems to be more mature for her age and personifies childhood innocence that draws Holden close and warm to her  Endearing moments where cynicism and satire take an acceptable back seat  Dirty graffitti on the school walls and in museums strike Holden hard in the face and the heart and bring out the viciousness of dark minds masquerading as clean souls  dirty hands around him wrapped in spotless gloves  Salinger s pen reaches a satirical and bitter crescendo when he says he wouldn t be surprised if someone scribbles graffitti on Holden s tombstone after he s gone  And to talk about a few snags    Holden s overt expression and unbridled scorn for convention throughout the book seem like an overdose of negativity  His condemning people in a fraction of a second and passing judgement with quick sneer are devoid of reason at most times  These instances could have been supplanted with realistic cause and anecdotes in Holden s view  Also  Salinger s brazen comments about another classic book  albeit cleverly expressed in Holden s words  are uncalled for  cross the boundary of literary freedom and step into disrespect A magnificent work overall  To put it in Holden lingo   in a phony  crumby and corny world  this goddamn book really killed me  A swell work and a must read    Reading The Catcher in the Rye felt like talking to a friend  only the friend is really stubborn and doesn t listen to what I say It was fascinating to listen to what Holden has to say about different things  He is very opinionated and no matter what anyone says  he s in my list of Fictional Characters I Would Love To Have Dinner With  We would just probably argue the whole time  but it would still be fun I would equate the feeling of finishing this book to the feeling of losing a friend   The story is very entertaining  Once I got to the interesting part  I just can t stop reading it  However  i don t know why but i just don t really like the ending  It just ended that way without enough descriptions like the other parts  I probably would like it more if the ending shows us that Holden realizes what he did wrong and finally be a better person About Holden Caulfield  I think there are many people out there who have the same thoughts and opinions as him  I  myself  have to admit that  to some extent  Holden was right  He was right about many people being phonies  He was right that somehow  in order to be able to make everyone thinks we re being nice we have to be a little phony  It s actually confusing to see how phonies are sometimes labeled as sociable  nice  or other positive traits  What s going on in his mind is actually not so extraordinary  I bet those things have ever crossed our minds even once  Maybe most people just keep denying it that they finally choose to become phonies themselves  Nevertheless  I believe that most of the time Holden was overreacting Overall  I am very happy to have read this book  The story is really good and easy to understand for anyone at any age  If you re around Holden s age  you can even relate more to the story  Bu kitabi daha kimsecikler bilmezken  suan neredeyse her bookstagramcida goruyorum   3 4 yil

incelikte zaten  bir sans vermelisiniz bence  3 i dont know how i convinced myself to read this book  but boy am i glad that i did  I loved being able to read from Holden s point of view  and how he saw the world  I just completely loved the book  it was brilliant   Before I read the book I took a look at some of the comments  When it comes down to it  you either relate with Holden or you don t  and if you don t then you probably won t enjoy the book  Personally  I felt like I was reading about myself a lot of the time  This guy puts himself into situations and feels sorry for himself when something goes sour  He s intelligent  but doesn t feel like proving that to a bunch of phonies in a damaged school system  I feel for him  This book wasn t life changing for me by any means  but it definitely made me think about where I m at in my own life  I read this book during high school three decades ago  and I read it again this time for book club  It was a different experience this time  I actually understood the angst of high school student Holden Caulfield better  having the hindsight and  I would hope  wisdom of my older age  I was surprised at how timeless his emotions  and even his language  were  For me the most memorable part was his time with his younger sister Phoebe  It touched me and made me sad  Not much to say other than I can t abide the tedious twerps who get off on informing literally everyone they meet how AWFULLY overrated they find this because  you know  they re so TERRIBLY well read   arrrggH     Back in my high school days  there were several classic novels we had to read for English classes  Scarlet Letter  Lord of the Flies  etc etc  most I was bored to sleep by  but this one I remember had me riveted  I loved reading back then and now that it s back to being my favorite passtime  I decided to give this one a go again  I still love it  despite being such an aimless story  I slid right into Holden s shoes and enjoyed the ride  My more experienced brain gleaned some new insights from it  while it held up to my 15 year old nostalgia of it perfectly   I was worried that this book wouldn t hold up to rereading  I ve read many reviews that Holden is a much harder character to like when the reader is an adult  not a high school student  I didn t find this to be the case  Holden is an immature  confused  frustrating kid  But he is also insightful and quite self aware  He realizes when he is being inconsistent  he calls himself on it in his narration  He has already been through a lot in his short life  and his observations are amazingly astute  For all his cynicism  he has a good heart  I was especially touched by his descriptions of his brother  Allie  and sister  Phoebe  The scene where he interacts with the nuns is another example  and the part where he notices the little boy walking with his parents down the street  singing  Really  his descriptions of younger kids in general   his genuine affection for them  and his instinct to try to protect them endeared him to me  Holden is a hypocrite and a contradiction  but  really who isn t  especially as a teenager  His honesty isn t played for melodramatic effect   it just is  My favorite quote from the entire novel was this part about visiting his younger brother Allie s grave   When the weather s nice  my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old Allie s grave  I went with them a couple of times  but I cut it out  In the first place  I certainly don t enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery  Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all  It wasn t too bad when the sun was out  but twice   twice   we were there when it started to rain  It was awful  It rained on his lousy tombstone  and it rained on the grass on his stomach  It rained all over the place  All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars  That s what nearly drove me crazy  All the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinner   everybody except Allie  I couldn t stand it  I know it s only his body and all that s in the cemetery  and his soul s in heaven and all that crap  but I couldn t stand it anyway  I just wish he wasn t there  You didn t know him   If you d known him  you d know what I mean  It s not too bad when the sun s out  but the sun only comes out when it feel like coming out   Salinger has a gift for offering up a narrator who is a negative and judgmental wreck without allowing him to become one dimensional caricature  Holden is a character who is afraid of growing up  but in recognizing that he is guilty of all the sins he judges others  he will eventually be able to deal with the unsettled future  This book this book this book  It shattered me into pieces  With every abnormal word  With every repetition  It made me think  and these are the kind of books i prefer  The books where a wrong use of grammar can make you know whats wrong with the main character  I loved holden  the book is a story about coming of age  and i will truly remember this book till i die  This was the first time I ve read a book in the perspective of a boy s in a while that isn t a re read Generally all boys in those books were either too busy pondering on how to defeat Voldemort  destroy the ruler of the Titans or how annoying older brothers can be This story gave an uncensored view to the average male s mind  Scratch that  The mind of a completely complex  confusing  lazy  judgmental and brilliant boy  In a way it was sort of eery seeing things in those views as I couldn t relate to the character in any way  But Holden entertained me  his witty sense of humor and his sardonic point of view was to say the least  interesting Sure  I gave it five stars  But do I truly  completely understand the book  No  Basically every book I read is about fighting some fantasical creature  how to fix problems in a dystopic world or a life full of the human like  yet crazy trauma  The Catcher in the Rye was different  It wasn t about people dying or someone in this great state of depression It was just about life  And to some people  even if it s normal  It just sucks And being a person with a perfectly happy life  I can t relate to Holden in anyway  So I m giving it five stars because I liked Holden  But I m going to come back to it  and then maybe I can make a fully matured recommendation  review and rating   4 5  DPRONTO LA RESENA As a reader  I thought that this book was really dumb and hard to understand  But then I realized that it is a really good book once I understood it  As I read Catcher in the Rye I could see how teens could relate to Holden  He is feeling isolated  Reading about people with the same problems helps you cope with your own  I think teachers should use this book with 10th graders to help them realize they aren t alone  One of my most re readable favorite books  Part of that is just that it s relatively short and has an easy to read conversational tone  But every few years I find myself thinking  I should read that one again  So there s a ton of nostalgia value for me  and I know the book is pretty dated by now  but I think many readers who decide to read this will like it  I have never thought of it as a book that makes grand statements about life  or has tons of symbolism in it  or a plot that will astound you  or really anything that usually comes in the package of a good novel   other than Holden  the main character  There are only a handful of fictional characters that I feel I know as deeply  I m thinking of Levin in Anna Karenina as one   and that writes  if unreliably  about his efforts to find something to do with life that isn t  phony   He s definitely an angry guy  and since his sense of morality and self is still forming he tends to judge everyone else with ever changing standards that usually don t work in their favor  I ll stop psychoanalyzing him there because I m sure there are more detailed analyses out there  but you get the idea Reading this book is always refreshing to me  for its nostalgia value but also for its ability to remind me that it s important to really investigate and respect people  and not write them off as  phony  immediately   but also to write what I really think at a moment  even if I ll later change my mind  5 StarsRated R for language  alcohol smoking  and sexual referencesRecommend to 16   upI absolutely love this book   and Holden Caulfield   I really wish we were friends and that he were real  I d love that  I could really relate to Holden  struggling with depression myself  though I don t talk about that much  The writing was so personal  like we were having a conversation in our heads together  This is the third night that I was up late reading because I ve been unable to put it down  The Catcher in the Rye is the best classic I have ever read  and probably now my favorite  I can see myself reading it again and again just for pure enjoyment   even if Holden Caulfield is plumb depressing at times  I just loved it    The coffee  the smokes  the Cokes  the striking it out on his own  the figuring out how to deal with life  The Catcher in the Rye If you haven t read this classic yet  READ IT  Holden  dear Holden  you break my heart   Spoiler ish review Everyone knows what it s like to be stuck in that place between childhood and adulthood  and Holden is stuck there with nobody to turn to  nobody who ll listen to him  He hates all the phonies at his school  at the bars  in the stores  Everyone s a phony  even Holden himself when he tries to fit in  He doesn t want to take his education seriously  because that would mean taking responsibility for the rest of his life  which is too much to handle  when all you want to do is hide behind your red hunting hat  I loved this story  because even though Holden isn t admirable as a partner or a role model  we are or have all been Holden on some level  So much insecurity is tangled up in the proces of growing up and we all handle it differently  Holden tries to separate himself from his life so the pain of losing yesterdays innocence isn t so overwhelming  The hunting hat is his shield against the world  but it won t hold the distance for long  The world will come crashing in eventually  like we all experience  and when you let go and let it in  you ll survive the changes anyway  I got pretty soaking wet  especially my neck and my pants  My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection  in a way  but I got soaked anyway  I didn t care  though  I felt so damn happy all of a sudden     Well to start off with I had wanted to read this book for so many years  I am so glad I finally got to it  It was absolutely nothing like others had previously told me and it was nothing that I had expected  But it was nothing short of amazing  Not much really even happened and usually that would have bored me in a book  But J D  Salinger really did capture the art of detail  I had no idea what was about to come next  and I love when an author can pull that off  I really did feel like Holden Caufield was talking directly to me  and that I had known him my entire life  I know this may be over exaggerated and a lot of people may not have gotten as much out of it as I did  but i will admit this is probably my favorite book  I do not regret one minute of it  This is the funniest literary work I have ever read  I just couldn t stop laughing at what Holden thinks about the people around him  Even though there are a lot of things he does that I despise  I just can t help liking him  and then loving him because he is so delightfully hilarious Apart from his  probably unintentional  humor  Holden impresses me by how well he uses his slang  He actually manages to slang enough to sound really cool  yet not too much to sound low and vulgar  Apart from d   and maybe bastard  he never uses swear words either Honestly  Holden has inspired me so much that I ve now decided to be serious and learn more slang  spoilers ahead What ultimately made me really like Holden though  is how much he sincerely loves his siblings  He may seem to hate everything and everybody  well almost everybody   but he really cherishes his siblings  It s really touching when Phoebe asks him to name something he actually likes  he talks about his dead younger brother Allie  and Phoebe says  but he s dead  but Holden protests that just because someone s dead doesn t mean we stop caring about them  He also says how much he likes it at that moment  when he s just there with his little sister and talking to her But what touched me most was when Holden watches Phoebe go round and round on the merry go round  and feels so deliriously happy just watching her  Aside from how much I appreciate Holden s love for his siblings  I also really liked all the moral messages near the end  I don t buy that every adult is  phony   because some really are true  but I still enjoyed hearing Holden s perspective  The advice from his English teacher struck me too  about the importance of finding a direction in life  I loved how he said many people feel the same disgust or contempt for the things happening in human life too  but only the most educated are able to express what they feel into words  I really love this justification for why we should get an education  Eloquence and the ability of verbal expression is indeed so important  You may have it in you but if you can t say what you feel  no one will know how you feel Also  I was quite moved when Holden says  indirectly  that a real  valuable  true  something  is spending time with your beloved brother or sister  but that many other people don t think that this real  something  is a  something   That was really poignant  Cuando pienso que este libro es de 1950 aun no me lo puedo creer  Les cuento primero que esta lectura no la comence por voluntad propia  vale  si por voluntad propia  pero no estaba en mis planes   sino que me uni en febrero a una LC  Lectura Conjunta  por Goodreads y de entre los 3 libros que habia para escoger  este fue el que mas me llamo la atencion  Y les cuento con una sonrisa en la cara que le apunte al gordo  Tenia sangre por toda la boca  por la barbilla y hasta por el batin y el pijama  En parte me asusto y en parte me fascino  Me daba un aspecto de duro de pelicula impresionante  Solo he tenido dos peleas en mi vida y las he perdido las dos  La verdad es que de duro no tengo mucho  Si quieren que les diga la verdad  soy pacifista  A la vez que leia After  mi mas ultima y fracasada lectura  me sumi en la vida de Holden Caulfield  un chico de 17 anos que narra  en primera persona  unos pocos dias de su peculiar forma de ver el mundo  Desde las primeras lineas  la narrativa juvenil y desenfadada del protagonista atrae al lector  Si de verdad les interesa lo que voy a contarles  lo primero que querran saber es donde naci  como fue todo ese rollo de mi infancia  que hacian mis padres antes de tenerme a mi y demas punetas estilo David Copperfield  pero no tengo ganas de contarles nada de eso  Asi inicia lo que seria una cita con los pensamientos mas profundos de nuestro protagonista  un chico que se siente sumamente inadaptado a una sociedad falsa y corrompida  que repudia desde lo mas hondo de su ser pero a la que sigue de igual forma  Aun cuando su familia es de buena situacion economica  tiene padres comprensivos y tiene unos hermanos a los que quiere mucho  me encanta en especial la adoracion que le profesa a su hermana pequena Phoebe  Holden se siente solo y necesitado  recurriendo en muchas ocasiones a las personas que ama odia por momentos Sus grandes y extensas divagaciones acerca de toda clases de temas hacen que en realidad no pasen muchos dias dentro del libro  constantemente debe frenarse con un  Pero como les iba diciendo  para seguir explicando las cosas  aunque pocas veces puede dejar bastante claro lo que quiere expresar  Su personalidad es muy compleja  es un chico fragil  narcisista  depresivo  espontaneo  generoso  expresivo y pacifista  y por lo mismo  es un desafio  pero de los buenos  seguir sus pasos  Su curiosidad hace que saltemos de temas como la forma en que se comporta la gente en sociedad  pasando por la amistad  el romance y el sexo hasta otros mucho mas triviales como el cine y la literatura  Holden se deja llevar por la corriente  y es la razon por la que a cada momento me tenia pensando que se le ocurriria hacer  me parecia una caja de pandora  cualquier cosa podia salir de sus pensamientos  Al fin vi a Sally que bajaba por las escaleras y me acerque a recibirla  Estaba guapisima  De verdad  Llevaba un abrigo negro y una especie de boina del mismo color  No solia ponerse nunca sombrero pero aquella gorra le sentaba estupendamente  En el momento en que la vi me entraron ganas de casarme con ella  Estoy loco de remate  Ni siquiera me gustaba mucho  pero nada mas verla me enamore locamente  Les juro que estoy chiflado  Lo reconozco  Lo que mas me gusto del libro fue el estilo del escritor  ya que es sumamente facil de leer y tiene las frases tipicas de un adolescente  abundan los  jo    hacer el indio  o los  isimos  falsisimo  malisimo  guapisima  y aunque eso a algunos les puede molestar  a mi me hacian mas amena la lectura  Me rei en muchas ocasiones con las ocurrencias de Holden  su forma de ver la vida  tan confusa y a la vez tan clara  llena de reflexiones y en ocasiones muy filosoficas hicieron que se transformara en uno de mis personajes masculinos favoritos Uno de los momentos en que mas conecte con el protagonista fue cuando decidio contestarle a su hermana una pregunta que a esas alturas todos nos haciamos     Que es lo que realmente le gusta o quiere Holden  La pequena cita a continuacion nos da la respuesta  a la ve que revela la razon del titulo del libro  si no quieres spoilear esta parte  saltatelo como un ninja    Crei que era    Si un cuerpo coge a otro cuerpo     le dije    pero  veras  Muchas veces me imagino que hay un monton de ninos jugando en un campo de centeno  Miles de ninos  Y estan solos  quiero decir que no hay nadie mayor vigilandolos  Solo yo  Estoy al borde de un precipicio y mi trabajo consiste en evitar que los ninos caigan a el  En cuanto empiezan a correr sin mirar adonde van  yo salgo de donde este y los cojo  Eso es lo que me gustaria hacer todo el tiempo  Vigilarlos  Yo seria el guardian entre el centeno  Te parecera una tonteria  pero es lo unico que de verdad me gustaria hacer  Se que es una locura   Lo que no me gusto del libro fueron cosas tan insignificantes que en esta ocasion no merecen la pena de hacer mencion  Por esta clase de libros  en que inicio sabiendo que tienen medio siglo encima y que luego olvido a los 5 minutos  es que amo leer  son atemporales y aperiodicos  seguramente lo disfrutare de la misma forma la proxima ve que decida leerlo y seguramente sacare muchas otras cosas en limpio   En resumen un libro fantastico que no puedes dejar de leer  Con una narrativa facil y ligera y un personaje increiblemente motivamente  podemos adentrarnos en los temas que mas nos preocupan como adolescentes  Y Holden  un chico algo confundido aun  nos explica cual es su filosofia

 mfhym  myqy rw bh khwnndh mntql my knh I loved this book  I loved every bit of reading it  It was never boring  It was nearly always entertaining and often insightful  despite its desperately well meaning but unreliable narrator  Holden Caulfield is a fascinating protagonist that had me puzzling over what was going on in his head  even as he spilled his guts over 200 fast pages  This book is an exercise in existential journeyman ing  The plot is one guy gets bored and goes to look for something to do  but it s so much more than that  Structurally  it is ambitious  Sociologically it is sympathetic and heart warming  despite the character s seeming desire to bash people s heads in and become a cool noir hero As the book reaches its middle  some readers may fall by the wayside  or say it gets repetitive and slows down  Even I took a break from reading it for a time  but I m glad I went back to it  I would disagree with this being seen as a criticism  I would actually say this middle is where the book heats up  because it made me crave a resolution for the character s internal quandary  Happily  I can say that it did give me a satisfying resolution  and that looking at the book as a whole reveals it s not only incredibly fun  but there are some subtle through lines for a very poignant story of self realization and coming of age And that ending   wow  I can t say anything about it except that it was bold  thought provoking and effective I don t know if it s propaganda or killer creating  and I ve heard it s also the only good book Salinger ever wrote  but man  This is a good book ps This book is also boosted by a great title  and a beautiful title drop that was worth the wait for it to all make sense  I read this first when I was sixteen  then read it numerous times over the years that immediately followed  and it remains one of the few books I have read more than twice  it s very slight after all   but I have not read it for years so I don t know if as an adult I would still be bowled over by Holden Caulfield and his search for truth in a world of  phonies  as I was back then  I should really have re read a few chapters before this review but I didn t want to risk being underwhelmed by it  I will do that soon though  just pick a chapter at random  I can remember all the events  what there are of them  but the plot was an irrelevance really  the book was just about evoking a teenage view of the adult world  Salinger was in his 30 s when he wrote it I think  so he was far from being a teenager himself  I recall everything ringing true to me at the time  which was 1990  though the novel was first published in 1951 You never know when a book is going to start to become hopelessly dated  and I think a story that was contemporary to when it was written and uses a stream of consciousness first person narration to muse about the world around  especially a teenage narration   must always be teetering on the brink of quintness  Still  I know they still study it at college as the book stores still stock it in number  and it will certainly be one of the books I encourage my nieces and nephews to read when they are teenagers I will be really hoping that they like it   Holden Caulfield is kind of crumby  The reason I say that is just that he is always doing the things that he hates other people for doing  He really kills me  I am Holden Caulfied  I m sorry   I really am  Sometimes I m just like old Holden  I hate phonies too The story is meandering  the vocabulary is weak  and the protagonist is shallow  All of it is exactly perfect  There aren t many books that as soon as I turn the last page I know that I will read them again   Escribe Alberto Fuguet en su libro Transitos sobre los temas de Salinger  la sensacion de vacio de sus personajes  la fragilidad del alma humana y que al final del dia el verdadero enemigo sean los posers y los falsos  Un libro que no puedo creer que no haya leido antes  Una exploracion a la vulnerabilidad de un adolescente con el que uno puede sentir una especial atraccion como lector  Nos metemos a su cabez  y mientras pasamos las paginas es como si lo estuviesemos acompanando en sus aventuras por New York y esa busqueda de algo que le motive a vivir  GENIAL  No cuenten nunca nada a nadie  En el momento en que uno cuenta cualquier cosa  empieza a echar de menos a todo el mundo   El libro indicado  en el momento indicado  mas no puedo decir  Me conmovio bastante el final  Los personajes vienen y van  aparecen y desaparecen  ninguno en realidad importa  y mas aun para Holden  a excepcion de su hermana menor Este libro no pretende  sencillamente es Hay algo que encontraras en sus paginas  y lo encontraras en grandes cantidades  se llama ansiedad  Y si eres varon  te identificaras con mas razones  Tal es la contundencia de este libro  tal es su fuerza  que vivi la historia como si fuera la mia propia  Ya casi al final  el monologo del profesor fue sencillamente alentador para mi como estudiante universitario Un gran libro sin dudas  sobrevalorado quizas  pero un buen libro al fin y al cabo   This novel is exceptional At first I was kinda skeptical about the good comments it had received  because it was so tiring to read Holden s way of speaking  It wasn t really going anywhere at first  but then you realize that there are not enough pages to cover his entire story  taking into account the length of his narrations and pages left   you definitely start enjoying it and even relating to him  He is definitely a teenage hero  I loved it  I read Catcher years ago but then read it again during the last few weeks  It is unlike any other book I have ever read and can still be read as though fresh and alive today  It is hauntingly sad but I don t think that Holden s depression is just due to what happened to his brother  It goes beyond that  It echoes all the pent up emotions of teen years and how they explode at random against everything that is forced upon a person as part of  growing up   He is quite right about  phony   there are people who play a game and others who pamper to it  There are kids who seem to sail through everything and play the game beautifully  Holden is at heart a good kid and very  very lonely and constantly looks for contact and communication but never finds what he s looking for  This book is easy to read and it gets at you in unexpected ways  It should be read by teens but it also should be read by parents  It is sharp wake up call  Fantastico   As most American high school students I was required to read this book  and usually school assigned books are terribly boring yet this time wasn t the case  Even though this novel was written decades ago it still perfectly defines an average American teenager Now the main character  Holden displays every feeling a teenager goes through  He goes through anger  alienation  depression  and certain degree of detachment from society  He also curses  drinks  smokes  hates school  lies  and in some way deals with sex J D  Salinger makes Holden feel so realistic that its almost like the story is real  That realness just seems so fresh while other works in comparison seem phony Catcher in the Rye was extremely enjoyable  without the cheap tricks of using suspense to grab my attention  I recommend this book to any teenager who s tired of everything phony or any adult who needs a reminder what it means to be true to themselves  The first chapter of the new Salinger biography made me  re read The Catcher in the Rye with an entirely different insight  The authors of the biography argue that this is actually a World War II novel more than it is a coming of age novel  I have to agree  This book shows the shattering of Holden s rose colored glasses  and the realization that life isn t perfect or fair or even beautiful  These were very real and very paralyzing feelings many men had when returning from WWII  including Salinger himself  who carried around the first five chapters of The Catcher in the Rye during WWII to help him remember what he had to live for   and they are entirely manifested in the way Holden sees and interprets his world   This story has much drama and a lot going on for one person  Holden tries not to grow up but still act like one in some ways  Holden has a little sister  big brother  and a dead little brother  Holden loss his innocence somewhat when he was 13 when his little brother died and never been the same since  Hes explored New York all on his own in 48 hours and got expelled from his last school  Pency Prep One reason why I personally like this book because I have experience the death of a loved one and I am always being sarcastic and have similar traits to the main character Holden  Holden has a weird personality and looks very old for his age because of his height and gray hair  You will love this book because it tells of the teenage behavior and interesting topic on some themes that you will notice in Holden s way of mind  What I love about this book is that you either get it or you don t  I love the fact that I get it  I be all phony and try and try to come up with the underlying subtext and the hidden meaning behind Salinger s words but I don t know all that stuff and so I won t pretend I do  What i do know is that this is the book for any person who has ever felt  even fleeting  that they don t quite fit in  This is the book for the loner and the introvert and the kind of person who can walk around a city by themselves for a full day and have the best time  My opinion is that if you don t like this book  if you don t get it  then it s not the book for you  And that s okay  Don t be phony and pretend to like or try to like  just put it down  walk away  and leave it for that person who needs it  Leave it for a Holden Caulfield to find and i promise you they will thank you for it  it was supposedly a required book in high school  i never wanted it to affect my view of myself and how i regard my future  but nevertheless it has made such a great impact in me that i have to reread it over and over again just to feel that same guidance i had when i first read it  and every time i do read it  i get the same feeling and some other things  it grows with you as you yourself unravel your own life I wanted to be the catcher at the end of the cliff because it was the only job that makes sense  because it was the effective way that I could prevent my siblings from falling  Yes  falling in the same pattern of a life I have  Better that I fall and dwell in the dark than have them see misery and slowly die Catcher in the Rye  a coming of age novel  J D  Salinger writes about Holden Caulfield  a seventeen year old Pencey prep student voicing out about his lonely  life changing twenty four hour stay in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of the adult world  In doing so he is attempting to deal with his overbearing compulsion of lying  After getting into a fight with his roommate  Stradlater  Holden leaves school two days early to explore New York City before returning home  Interacting with teachers  prostitutes  nuns  an old girlfriend  and his sister along the way  This books remains one of the best books about adolescence ever written  This is not to say that The Catcher in the Rye is a straight forward and simple  It is anything but  You might have to go back and re read pages but it is completely worth it  The Catcher in the Rye can teach you many things about life  And it is still relevant after almost 64 years  Social niceties aren t always phony   This is one of the many things you will learn reading this book  I read this book for the first time on my own during high school  I definitely didn t appreciate it then  Reading it again as an adult  and English teacher  completely changed my perspective on this book  It was interesting pulling comparisons between my favorite book  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  and Catcher  Salinger s obsession with innocence is so clear and he can truly capture the struggle of being in between youth and adulthood  What could I possibly say about this one  I discovered it during the tough transition period from high school to college  and I credit it with  or maybe blame it for   my aversion to  phonies   Some of the critical feminist thought I started exploring in my early 20s has helped me see that it reflects a pretty narrow set of experiences  straight  white  upper middle class  male   which I suppose explains why this book remains sort of divisive among my friends  All of this considered  it will always be one of my favorites  I love the scene where Holden runs into one of his brother s ex girlfriends with her new boyfriend and he describes him as  one of those guys who feels like a pansy if he doesn t break forty of your fingers when he shakes your hand   or something  Comedy gold  The Catcher in the RyeBy J D  Salinger214 pp  Back Bay BooksISBN  0316769177 The Catcher in the Rye is a unique and interesting book about a young man named Holden Caulfield  Holden is rebellious because he transfers out of almost every private college he gets into  He doesn t enjoy following rules and he lives in whatever way he can  Throughout this book  Holden tries finding himself  This book may seem weird at first  but I have learned that throughout it  it contains a lot of Holden s opinions  Salinger makes Holden sound like a very different kind of guy  Hold switches topics a lot  and includes many parts of his past  Therefore  Salinger uses a lot of foreshadowing  I read The Catcher in the Rye twice and I enjoyed it both times  I remember reading it in middle school  and reading it at this age made it seem very different to me  I understand certain parts of the book more and I found it more interesting  Salinger s style is unlike any other I have read before  He makes his characters realistic and I had no trouble with understanding this book  This book holds many meanings  so I recommend it to teenagers and adults   El Guardian entre el Centeno ha sido mi libro de cabecera y uno de los tantos catalizadores  vias de escape  elementos de evasion  todos los nombres son para lo mismo  que use en mi vida diaria  Nunca planee comprar el libro  Cuando fui a la libreria esa manana  recuerdo que lo vi en uno de los estantes y me llamo la atencion su tapa color granate  Recorde entonces que se trataba del libro que aparentemente habia influenciado a Mark Chapman para cometer un crimen  Dada mi fascinacion por los asesinos y toda la controversia que giraba en torno a susodicho libro  recuerdo que no dude en comprarlo  La novela esta escrita en primera persona  El protagonista  Holden  relata cuatro dias de su vida  desde que escapa de su cuarto internado  Pencey  en Pennsylvania  a Nueva York  hasta que se decide a llamar a sus padres y contarselo todo  En esos cuatro dias el miente a los demas  se miente a si mismo  se delata  cruza sus propios limites y llega a conocerse mejor que nunca  Holden es rebelde  si  O al menos lo es en la medida en que todos queremos serlo  Holden no sabe lo que quiere  pero tiene muy claro lo que no quiere  Y si hay algo que no le gusta  pero no porque sea conservador o intolerante  son los cambios  En esos cuatro dias el entiende que hay cosas que no deberian cambiar  que hay cosas que es mejor dejar en una de esas vitrinas de cristal de los museos  y dejarlas alli tranquilas  Es muy facil identificarse con Holden  Asumo que muchas personas se sienten  se sentiran  y se habran sentido identificadas con un personaje asi  Salinger narra la historia de una forma tal que conectarse con Holden emocionante no es cosa dificil  Te imaginas que tambien estas en Nueva York viviendo su vida  O mejor dicho  viviendola con el  Porque   de que sirve un libro si no te transporta a otro lugar  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be  Talking about this book in a mere review would be a shame as it would take me a whole book to write about it and that wouldnt even suffice  thats the reason I have withheld myself from writing about it  I have read this book 5 years ago  It s the kind of book that dictates how you really feel when you dont know what you re feeling or cant pinpoint a name for your current emotion  so you read a line and you re like   There goes  I think I have been there before  but I couldnt truly express it  it captured every little fleeting thought that I never thought someone would flip his mind and come to think of the same thing as I never imagined that someone might be feeling the same even if its something so lame and small  Holden Caulfield  the character in the story is the love of my life  I m not crazy but he really is  I would never find someone who understood me the way he did  he was troubled by human existence that he preferred just to watch and succumb into solitude while cynically disregarding reality as something so silly he couldnt find any reason why he would participate in such a phony world  he wasnt bitter but people around him made him feel bitter  he felt sorry for them  he wanted to save them but then he realized he couldnt do so  people gave meaning to the most meaningless stuff  they cared about the wrong people  consumed their existence in pointless unrewarding experiences that they thought this is the meaning of life and this is true joy  he was looked upon as a troubled person who is an introvert and stuck up  truth is  people only judged him from afar  thats why he was always in his own shell  protected from all this human misery that made him feel depressed all the time  I wouldnt recommend this book to people who understood what the hell is going on because this book summrizes the absurdity of being a in a world where everybody thinks they know the truth when in fact the only truth is that there s no truth I havent finished my review yet and I never will     I remember not reading this book when I was 15  In school  I think we could choose a subset of books from a list and decided not to read this  Just read it for the first time at the age of 33 If I had read it at 15  I would not have been able to relate to Holden  He was a privileged atheist from the city that suffered a devastating loss  I was a poor catholic from the suburbs that was numbed by TV and video games  I think the only thing we had in common is that we both hated high school  Things were also a bit different in the 40s  the drinking age was 18  minors traveled unescorted  Holden s views on sex were simultaneously nobel  wanting to make love only to the woman he loved  and sophomoric  raunchy discussions with his older friend at a bar   My views on sex were catholic  no sex until you are married  Holden has been blessed upon belief  white  male  American  wealthy parents  two great siblings  and a true gift for literature and writing  One wonders what went wrong Reading this book at 33  being married with young children  it is so easy to see how immature the teenage characters are in this book  lying  stealing  gossiping  bullying  cliques  fighting  wasting money  wasting time  It is also easy to see how much the adults in this book wanted to help Holden  but they could not understand him and connect with him  They could not figure out why he just did not want to play their game  school  college  career  family  cars  vacations  retirement  death  He clearly wanted something out of life but did not know what it was There are many reoccurring themes  such as the ducks disappearing in the winter  Holden disappearing as he crosses the street  Holden disappearing as he leaves school after school  tombstones  loved ones disappearing  Another reoccurring theme is sexual perversion  a seedy hotel  cross dressing  multiple dive bars  an over affectionate teacher  an over sexed roommate   flits and lesbians   a turbulent encounter with a prostitute and her pimp  There were innumerable references to being  phony   writing screenplays instead of short stories  laughing to jokes that are not funny  narcissism  His loneliness was evident by seeking companionship at every turn  from a mother of a schoolmate to a little kid he helped tie their shoelaces  In my opinion  Holden had two major moments of character development  the first being when he was able to articulate what he really wanted to do with his life  and the second when he made a lasting memory with his kid sister  Without giving too much away  I think that Holden s desire to hold on to the childhood in his life and protect this innocence in others is the essence of who he is  This is evident with the numerous times he talked about the nuns and the children in his life  and his obsession with erasing graffiti that could itself steal the innocence of children  This is contrasted with his pursuit of growing up  smoking  drinking  swearing  and getting laid  But unsurprisingly  the more responsible aspects of adulthood were absent  studying  working  sacrificing  protecting  nurturing I think that Holden will grow up to be a fine functioning adult  despite how screwed up he is right now  I think back to my coming of age years  about how adults really do want the best for you but don t quite know how to relate and communicate  how teenagers find themselves in high schools  which is probably the exact worst place they can be at this point in their lives  how at that age  you really cannot see the future ramifications of your actions  This was all captured very well in  The Catcher in the Rye   Perhaps society  adults  makes the transition worse by pretending that the transition is easy and normal and it is now time for kids to act like adults  and take on all of the same values and responsibilities of adulthood  While at the same time adults try to shelter and protect these teenagers by putting them in artificial environments like high school  I think if high school were to last until 21  then we would expect to see the  teenage years  last until 21 as well  Perhaps there is value in the old rights of passage of past societies that have been discarded in modern times I think this is one of the greatest books ever written  a true Great American Novel  immortalizing the child to adult transition  But  I don t know what is the right age to read this book  Should 15 year olds be reading this book  I think it comes down to how fast we think children should grow up and lose their childhood innocence  Or maybe by that age the innocence has been lost and this book is a way to help make sense of the hypocrisy   Well where to start  i ll start by stating this has been my finest  enjoyabley thrillingly  laugh out loud book i have thus read this summer and that is saying quite lot considering it rather tastefull competition of books i have read these last two months This is one review I am not sure how I really start  or how I shall finish  I guess i should start by covering the basics  The Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J  D  Salinger  setting   New York  Main Chracter   Holden Caulfiled  Plot   It is about a young adolscent going through his teenage rebellion and being quite upfront with the views he shares  along the way  George Bush called this a  marvellous book  and that would probabley be only thing George Bush ever said that i agree with Now I am aware this is a contrevisol book  so i feel i must do my bit in defending this book as i loved it so much  The controversiory  John Lennon killer Mark Chapman claimed he had killed John Lennon because he was as Holden Caulfield would see him a  Phony   First of all Holden Caulfield said he was a  pacifst  and although he admits to having the occasional violent thoughts  he saids he would never go through with any of these thoughts  So Mark Chapman has been quite hypocritical in my opinion Also there have been many complainets about the use of vocabulary and lanuage used in this book  which i find rather prospetrous  This is novel seen through the eyes of an 17 year old who is rebelious  Salinger has written this so people can relate with Holden Caulifild and believe in the chracter and feel strong about the chracter   if he was to make him some saint then he wouldnt be the Holden we all admire and love  Why I loved this book so much was quite simply Holden Caulfield  I agreeed with all of his opinions and views  i could completly realte and translate with him  i understood when and why he got sad  i immulated his frustation and felt his happines  Holden is at various times disaffected  disgruntled  alienated  isolated  directionless  and sarcastic  I as a young indidvidual of around the same age feels and goes through all of these srting of emotions myself  Even his idea of an ideal live that is  just living on a filed of Rye and catching the children form falling off a cliff  i can understand and reason  everthing Holden says is in my opinion truly spot on  This is truly a must read for teenagers all over the world and not just teenagers though I firmly believe any one of any age can read this book and go back to time where they felt like Holden  Holden Caulfield is now one of my favourite and most admired fictional chracters  you got that you goddamm phony moron ass bastards  I liked Holden but like anyone  whether you like them or not  you just find yourself wanting to slap the shit out of them sometimes  But  like any teenager  or everyone else  really   Holden is just trying to find connection but failing due to his pre conceived notion that everyone is a phony  What a fucking hipster  Right  He s thoughtful  I loved that story he told about his brother Allie and his relationship with Phoebe  He made me laugh  out loud  even  He understands and sees things but is quite unsure how to go about his life  Sounds familiar  This book doesn t have an actual  climax   and it actually doesn t need one  To me  it s just one of those books that feel like you re just having a conversation and as it happens  that conversation could change your life  I kept thinking about the moment  If you ve read the book  you ll know what I m talking about  I kept thinking that  as overrated as it sounds  a moment is all you need  A moment to see clearly  A moment to change your life  A moment to make things happen  And in this book  that moment was a pivotal moment for Holden  And really  I m happy for him  If you re on the fence about reading this book  I say read it  You might hate it  you might love it  Either way  you ll still get something from it  Frustrated youth  checkCynicism  checkSomewhat debilitating obsession with authenticity  checkSelf contradictory  checkBewilderment  checkOveruse of slang  checkOveruse of favourite expressions  checkConstruction of personal reality  checkRationalisation   self justification  checkRidiculously high levels of criticism  checkStubbornness  checkSelf deprecation  checkExtreme opinions on novels  checkSo  I m a little concerned by how much I seem to identify with Holden Caulfield  However  it s comforting that I can also recognise his faults   and boy  he s got a lot  But I ll take a troubled protagonist over a perfectly balanced one any day  Plus  Holden s just really entertaining  sometimes you literally  yes  I mean literally  NOT figuratively  laugh out loud at his train of thought or his absurd self justification  Sometimes though  once you ve gotten your head around the slang and his phrasing of things  you do take a step back and realise that yes  you know what Holden s getting at  The concept  idea  argument  whatever  It might not have been the way you d have phrased it  but you do understand the convoluted point he s making  It could be about the disconnectedness of society  a repulsion to the phoney fake lame  whatever name it goes by   or just the existential crisis of the teenager  But it s something  I suspect that to really enjoy this novel  a reader needs to be okay with not holding the protagonist in high regard  It would probably also help if the reader has a slightly dry sense of humour   Ne

vs  innocence of childhood  Recommended for teenagers  To me  The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that you either love or you hate  And I love it  The voice is so strong  from the first line to the last  Each word is carefully chosen to reflect Holden s perspective and each anecdote echoes his personality  His recount of every event throughout the story says something about how he views the world and also contributes to the message of the novel  I stayed engaged through the entire book because of this voice that connected everything together  Another aspect of the book that I really appreciate is the plethora of symbols  I often hate it when high school English teachers over analyze novels for motifs  and pull random proof out of what feels like nowhere for such symbols  But the Catcher in the Rye is filled with symbols that relate to the theme in really interesting ways  One of my favorite quotes from the Catcher in the Rye encompasses one of the biggest symbols in the novel   Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   This novel is beautifully crafted  I recommend it to everyone   I had to read this for school and initially didn t want much to do with it  After the first page I was in love  Holden Caulfield is a very relatable teenager and has a very easy to understand way of thinking  After getting kicked out of school  and being permitted from going home Holden roams around New York city and undergoes many interesting characters  Reading from Holden s point of view of the world gave me a new outlook on things too  For example the innocence of kids  I wouldn t have thought very much about that until Holden talks about being the catcher in the rye  and catching all the kids  not letting them fall  or fade away from their innocence El guardian entre el centeno o The catcher in the rye es una novela narrada en primera persona por Holden Caulfield un adolescente de diecisiete anos sobre lo que le sucedio un ano antes tras ser expulsado nuevamente del colegio  Cumplio ampliamente con mis expectativas  no es necesario que yo lo diga porque es sin dudas un gran libro  definitivamente Holden llego a mi vida para quedarse  A seminal piece of literature in my developing teenage years  Holden Caufield is an imbeded archetype of my psyche  The self absorbed hero who loses his way but in the ends find a taste of gratification in the realization that we are not alone in this world  I have been the distant older sibling  I ve been the drunked phonebooth caller  I ve been the disenchanted student among the drones of an education system at odds with my way of learning  Another book that i read in a single sitting  I think that absorbing the book in this way gave it an immediacy in my imagination that other books have failed to achieve  I had to read it for a class  and i had to write chapter summaries for every chapter  The proccess of reading  analyzing  intepreting  and writing was an awesome experience that i ve since yet to replicate   probably never will A must read for all teenagers   Though many are turned off by the  foul  language of this book  it gives it character  This isn t a black and white book with a clear protagonist and antagonist  this is about real life  I personally love books like this because it takes gut to write about the real humanity and emotions  It doesn t have an ending that raps it all up  what the average person likes   it leaves you pondering and contemplating the characters  The Catcher in the Rye left me true feelings of connection with Holden because my life isn t as black and white as other books seem to perceive our existence  I don t have three attractive guys falling head over heels for me  I have feelings of despair and grief  I found this book life changing  This book cannot be read lightly  it is much more fulfilling to read in between the lines and to really try to understand the characters  This is a great choice of literature for a teen who is losing his innocent  for one who cannot be saved by the catcher in the rye   Okay so I read it thinking it was going to change my life and Holden was going to be my savior or whatever  but that didn t happen  Don t get me wrong  I did really enjoy the book but it is not something I can relate to  At all  Like never  I get that some people do feel isolated and alienated but I feel like this is a book more for adults  I don t know  I just didn t relate to it  On the surface  this book is like what the heck is going on  why is he like this and what is the POINT of this stupid book  But once you start digging to the deeper meaning you realize that all Holden wants is to protect the innocence that abandons you as  fall  into adult hood  I really liked the meaning behind the title too  That made me smile  I guess im not you typical moody teenager since I did not relate to Holden  I liked him and this book depressed the hell out of me  I just didn t relate  OH and that s another thing  IT IS SO FREAKING DEPRESSING  Was it just me  I wanted to cry so hard every time Holden try to make some connection to other people  I wanted to hug him when he talked about his dead brother  I wanted to be there for him whenever he felt confused and isolated and alone  But sadly  I was not there and he s getting better  Knowing Holden  he probably refuses to get better  Anyways  I like that the author didn t make this into a movie or allow spin offs  I think this book is something so special  you just can t duplicate it  It a great book and I totally recommend it  BUt don t read it if you don t appreciate cussing because there is ALOT of cussing in it   One of my favorite books of all time    The Catcher in the Rye is a classic  I knew some people who didn t like this book  but I think that s because they never read it in their formative years  This book must be read when you are in high school  because only then can you understand what Holden is talking about  After you ve read it once in high school  it is a lot easier to read later in life  because then you remember what it was like to read it when you were 16 or 17  I love this book for that reason  I thought it spoke to me as a teenager revolving around the same issues that approach Holden  I think almost anyone  whether or not they mirror Holden  can identify with him  For that reason  this book has been a success and will hopefully remain a success for may generations to come   this is a book I will never not read  It joins the ranks of The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank  The Outsiders by S E  Hinton  Lord of the Flies by William Golding and The Hobbit by Tolkien  as one of the greatest books I ve ever read   More than everything else  what kills me about The Catcher in the Rye is old Phoebe  I totally wish to be there every single time Holden says  I wish you could see old Phoebe   i m not kidding  Imagining her dragging the big suitcase and asking Holden to take her with him almost made me cry  it really did  I mean there are all those phony novels and movies in which siblings talk to each other in sentences that I swear no real brother or sister would ever use  And then there are Holden and Phoebe  Wish I could write more but it won t really matter  you know  You have to read the book to understand why it won t matter  But then maybe you won t understand  One can never be sure about these kind of things  One can never be sure about anything at all   I don t want to write a book review for The Catcher in the Rye  because I know if I do  it ll only end up sounding like on of the millions of essays I wrote for this book in both high school and college  And really  this book has been around for ages  It s been cherished for ages  It s been analyzed  nitpicked  argued over and dissected for ages  There s nothing I could say that hasn t been said before  So I m not going to  Instead  I m just to relay what The Catcher in the Rye means to me It s me  I mean  I think Holden is more difficult than he needs to be  but when you re a teenager and you read this book  it s you  It s everyone  It s the literal representation of what it is to be a teenager  be it in 1950 or 2013  Because Holden is the voice that teenagers generally don t let out  Sure  teenagers whine and bitch and complain about things  but the serious stuff  the stuff that really eats away at them  they keep inside Think back to when you were a teenager  or maybe you are one now  You know you looked around the world at least once and thought it was the biggest crock of bullshit you ever did see  Holden repeatedly has this obsession with phonies  and in a lot of ways  that defines him  But that defines teenagers too   Teenagers draw the divide between real people and phonies every day in real life  I remember being a teenager and being obsessed with people who were fake  or put on a show  or who just weren t real  The Catcher in the Rye is an exhausting book  It s utterly exhausting  It s one of my favorites  and it s weird  but I both look forward to reading it and detest it  I try to read this book at least once a year  but by the end I feel like I need a vacation    It s an exhausting book because it reminds us of who we are when we re young  when the world doesn t make sense and people are fake  and it all feels pointless  It s depressing  and depression can make a person tired  But it can also make them wake up and look around  That s what happens when I read this book  Obviously The Catcher in the Rye isn t a fair representation of ALL teenagers  but I d like to think that for the majority of us  the book means something  Maybe that s why it s all the better to go back and read this book as an adult  It doesn t mean less  but it means something different  and it s amazing that you can find a book that can do that to a person I don t just want to ramble on forever about this book  though I m sure I could  I just want to say that for me  The Catcher in the Rye is an experience  It s something that gets into my head and my heart and it makes me think and act and feel  The Catcher in the Rye is required reading for a reason  It doesn t pull punches  it gets so dark  and there really isn t a light at the end of the tunnel  But you re better off for reading it  rereading it  and thinking about it  im going to be like holden   maybe after a few years i will go to live alone   stop talking with people hhstill have hope in the humanity   but i cant change anything   i cant change my self  so i should have decision about that   live alone or no   im hamlet now hh Now that Salinger s dead  a bunch phonies are publishing the praises of Salinger s work  instead of focusing on crap like his hermit s life  his self chosen decision not to publish and his whacky mystical activities  which is all I ve read about since the eighties  I remember being stunned  in college to hear a goddamn professor talking about Caulfield s  mental illness   for crying out loud   since he wasn t a hippie  a beat  a slacker  a member of any counterculture  but a wealthy prep schooler   I thought that I must be mentally ill then  too  Sensitivity  alienation  soulfulness  which so many readers identified with  were seen by lousy academics and critics as Caulden s dysfunction  So we got to hear the praises of the big mouthed hot shot American Virile Men of his generation  like Hemingway  Updike  Roth and Mailer who either made it in the crappy conventional world   despite Mailer s shooting of his wife  or Hemingway at least having the grace to kill himself  Those hot shots kept publishing and satisfying the  mostly male  publishers and critics  Whereas  Salinger  Vonnugut  Heller  and Harper Lee  the soft hearted  soul searchers  who were the authors that were most influential and beloved by Readers  male and female  of that generation  were put on the B list  for christsake  It seems only Wallace Shawn editor of the New Yorker  his original publisher  respected his wishes not to publish and didn t judge his choice of life style  which was partly exaggerated and mythologized Catcher in the Rye is funny and moving  with beautiful details and dialogue  It speaks to us  not just the adolescents  but those of us who who are sensitive and still carry the sting of feeling like outsiders  And because of it  we sought out his short stories  Franny and Zooey and the search for meaning in life  partly finding some  still searching for it  and partly sensing the futility of it   Quelli che mi lasciano proprio senza fiato sono i libri che quando li hai finiti di leggere e tutto quel che segue vorresti che l autore fosse un tuo amico per la pelle e poterlo chiamare al telefono tutte le volte che ti gira   I ve loved this book since middle school  It was the first book that got me to realize I was a writer because our class had to read it  then write an extra chapter to add to the end of the book  It opened a whole new door for me   My honors English teacher in 11th grade said she couldn t recommend that any of us read The Catcher in the Rye because she would  have parents calling up furious with her    But she also said in an aside  that if we wanted to read it  go ahead  and she would give us extra credit for a review   In addition  my dad hesitated to lend me his copy of this book when I was 16  but eventually relented  The objections  I suppose  are the language  which contains a fair amount of garden variety swear words  and a brief scene that involves the short visit of a New York prostitute to 16 year old Holden Caulfield  he sends her away before anything happens   The book consists of Holden s first person account of two days he spends in New York City after ending his stay at a detested New England prep school   He got kicked out after the first semester because he refused to  apply himself    Holden bums around the city  afraid to go home to his wealthy parents  Although he tells us at the beginning that he isn t going to give us any background about himself or his parents or  any of that David Copperfield kind of crap   his story is so honest and revealing  that by the time one finishes the book  one knows everything about Holden and one has gained a finely enriched sense of adolescent angst in the years immediately following World War II  Holden has such a magnetic presence throughout the book that most of the other characters seem pale by comparison  The one other solid character is his 10 year old sister Phoebe Caulfield  who embodies a favorite Salinger concept   sophisticated innocence   that is  a young woman who is smart  savvy  and perceptive  but still relatively untouched by all the bad experiences with which life taints others  think of other Salinger heroines such as Franny and Esme   Holden s personality is characterized largely of his hatred of anything  phoney   which includes just about everything and everyone he encounters  and his ideal  which he knows is impossible  to keep children safe and unsullied from all of the stupidity and danger in the world   This desire is summed up in the book s title  but it s a little complicated  and I won t explain   Whether Holden will be able to go on and work toward some of these ideals is not clear  since he is looking back on those fatal few days in December in New York a few months later from his older brother s home in Hollywood  What happened in between was some kind of serious personal or mental crisis that he does not fully explain  One can only hope Holden can somehow get himself together and fulfill all the longings in his confused and gifted mind  Meanwhile  he has given the rest of us a lot to think about regarding our society and its often troubled youth   The Catcher in the RyeFind each quote and underline it in your book I d the quotes  Who

be the catcher in the rye and all     Who is he with  10   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody    Answers 1  Mr  Spencer in chapter 2  This quote is ironic since Holden never believes that life is a game  In fact  he believes the opposite   he is deathly serious about life  and he doesn t accept the rules set before him by phony adults 2  Holden in chapter 4  This quote demonstrates Holden s child like nature  Though he s a seventeen year old in high school he is still captivated by early memories 3  Stradlater in chapter 6  Here  Stradlater rejects more than Holden s paper  but he also unknowingly rejects Allie  This hurts Holden deeply  contributing to his self frustration and alienation from society 4 This shows not only Holden s personal frustration but also his overwhelming inferiority complex  He feels guilty when anyone offers something of value to him without his payment 5  Holden in chapter 10  Again this shows his lack of self confidence and feeling that he s a failure to his family 6  Holden in chapter 11  Here Salinger suggests that Holden has no control over his body  it seems to move itself  This also suggests that Holden has no control over his world  Although he wants to protect the child like innocence that he s already lost  he finds it almost impossible in such a large and unfriendly world 7  Holden in chapter 12  Here Holden underscores his entire philosophy of life  He attempts not to keep himself alive  but to keep alive the innocence of those around him  He wants them to think he really is glad to meet them in order to preserve their innocence 8  Holden in chapter 14  Like the previous quote  Holden is striving to preserve the innocence of those around him  He doesn t want anyone to have to see his bloody body after his suicide 9  Holden in chapter 22  Here Holden tells Phoebe the basic theme of the novel  Holden sees himself as a martyr and protector of innocent children  He wants to keep them from falling over the cliff into adulthood 10  Holden in chapter 26  This proves that Holden has really learned nothing from his long narration to the reader  He is still unable to differentiate between good and evil people and like a true catcher in the rye  tries to absorb everything and everyone into his base of experience  When I first started reading this book my english teacher told the class that this is a book that we would either love or we would hate  that we would either be able to identify with Holden or we wouldn t  I loved this book  It is the kind of book that can be life changing  For me it was that way  The book is ripe with symbolism though understanding the complex ideas is not completely necessary for you to enjoy the story that is contained within these pages  Holden s story is one that I was able to identify with at the age of sixteen  almost seventeen  while approaching adulthood and the decisions that come with it yet not feeling ready to grow up  I found Holden  as a character  to be complex  And yes  many will find him callous and for this reason not like him very much though I found him to be a very enlightened character  in many of his views of the world  yet struggling with the isolation he has thrust upon himself in light of the events that he has lived through  This book is one that when read the right way can be an incredible experience   Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  then you start missing everybody  Narrated by a 17 year old dropout in a mental ward  Surprisingly  or maybe not surprisingly   one of the most relatable main characters ever  Different aspects of his personality reminded me of many different people I ve known in school and outside of it    and of myself a bit  I guess that s why this is such a classic His thoughts sometimes jump around with a manic energy that today we would call ADD   Asking the cab driver   Do you know where the ducks go in Central Park when the pond freezes over    is one of my favorite moments   He s so terribly lonely  but irritated by the comments and actions of almost everyone he interacts with  even those he respects   Except for his sister Phoebe  who is indeed pretty awesome   He abhors  phony  things but ends up going there anyway  to nightclubs  shows  movies   yet can t enjoy them because he s watching so closely to detect anything not genuine  He can t stand his roommates  but misses them when they re not around  He s easily depressed but also finds unexpected joy in small things he notices  even in strangers  He wants to get away from everything and everyone    it seems to me because he just cares too much  A remarkably kind and sad character Also  this book highlights how a good author can somehow express a lot of meaning and nuance through a character with a limited vocabulary  I ve never seen the word  goddam  so much in my life  Un libro que no pude soltar hasta que lei la ultima pagina  Fue un viaje en el tiempo a mi mente adolescente Holden Caulfield es mi antiheroe particular  Es un adolescente que esta siendo forzado a convertirse en alguien funcional y util en una sociedad que no lo entiende y que el tampoco se interesa en entender  El protagonista describe una lucha incansable contra la falsedad y la hipocresia que la sociedad impone  Poco a poco fui entendiendo lo que Holden sentia  esa ansiedad de saber que todo esta jodidamente mal pero nadie se da cuenta de eso y lo peor  no saber como cambiarlo  no tener los medios para repararlo  Sin duda  de mis libros favoritos y uno de los protagonistas con los que mas fuertemente me he sentido identificado  Es una novela genial  Muy recomendable   I read this book as a pre adolescent and an adolescent  Not good  It gave me license to feel like I was entitled to believe in phonies  That said  it is a remarkably well written novel that has moved generations who have identified with the angst of Holden Cauffield   Hold in  get it  It was written during a time in American History when people were just beginning to experience rebellion and it gave them a voice  My all time favorite book  While am travelling this book is always with me   Reminds me of my rebel teen days   Also  Holden caulfield thinks you re a phony  P   I read this for the first time when I was 15  It was almost exactly 4 years ago  And I loved it then  I really did  I thought it was absolutely fantastic  Because that whole  phoniness  thing that Holden s constantly criticising is something that I criticised too  I don t remember much about reading it except that I loved it  and I told all my friends about it I figured I had to read it again  And I figured I had to read it while I was still  teenager   I ll cling onto that until the exact second I turn 20   So I read it again  And I m SO glad I did Because I still love it  I still love Holden Only now  I m older  wiser  and more critical of dear Holden  also I read the sparknotes when I read something that sounds deep important I want to know more   Because now I see just how messed up Holden is  I mean I knew it before   but now I REALLY get it  He s really on this downward fall  Which is fascinating given his obsession with  catching  children who might  fall  into adulthood Because among other things  Holden is really struggling with the fact that he s basically an adult  He idealises childhood and innocence  but he kinda sees himself as an adult  Even in the beginning that s evident   with his comments about being tall having grey hair  but acting like a kid  Anyway I m so glad I read this again  Especially now  It s still one of my favourites  Despite the fact that this book was banned in so many countries and libraries  I still found myself loving this book  I did expect a lot from this book since people kept yapping about how marvellous it was  but well  it really was great I remembered back in 10th grade  our EL teacher Dee  gave us an assignment to read a book and described its semantics  tones  and all  One of her recommendations was this book but I decided to go with Looking for Alibrandi by Melina Marchetta instead  She said both book are slightly similar since both were about  looking for their own identity however The Catcher in the Rye was on a boy s point of view  At first I thought The Catcher in the Rye would be delivered in a rather sophisticated style of language with unfamiliar used of vocabularies but to be honest  I found myself finished reading this book in only several days  It usually took me weeks to finish classic books  Anyway  the fact that Holden Caulfield  the 16 year old boy main character  was looking for his identity was not obviously pointed out in this book  However it described his personality as clear as the water in Karimun Jawa  He was such a pessimistic boy and he seemed to hate everything  He also seemed to be a rough person since his used of words and he swore a lot  But he did have a soft spot  which was his feelings towards his younger siblings  Salinger described Caulfield s love for his late brother  Allie  and his sister  Phoebe  implicitly  Holden Caulfield didn t just directly said   Boy I love Phoebe   But instead he delivered it by telling his memorable experiences with Phoebe and how he paid attention to every little details of his siblings and how he often taught of them Overall I found myself really enjoying this book  Worth the read  Catcher in the Rye is a story of a young man named Holden Caulfield  who undergoes certain events in his life due to a traumatic event that happened to him in the past  when he was only thirteen  Holden flashes back to his lone times he spent in the big city of New York  just after he had gotten kicked out of his school for his poor academic performance  During these times  Holden is troubled and depressed for he is alone in the city  thus having a strong desire for companionship  To Holden  life is a never ending game  Unfortunately no one can really help or guide Holden through his problems  Holden must learn to slowly get rid of his fears for adulthood and move on with his life  He must come of age and learn the true values of life and how everything must change at some point  eventually  This was a great book because the amount of detail and the great organization allows me to see through the main character s eyes clearly  I can interpret the meaning behind the character s thoughts and actions  The events in the book are tied to such realistic events that teach great morals that some people can relate to  I recommend this book to teens and adults because of the true meaning the book gives and the lessons that the main character learns by finding his mistakes and learning from life  It is truly an incredible novel that had me very entertained and pensive  nZrt mkhtlfy bry yn khtb nwshth shdh  khyly khlnjr dshtm byn khwndn w nkhwndn yn khtb  wly fqT 3 SfHh  fqT 3 SfHh wl alwdh m khrd w mnw brd

bykhwby hm dchr myshyd      Se sair para comprar uma revista que seja e alguem me perguntar onde vou sou muito capaz de dizer que vou a opera     A escrita desassombrada  frontal e acutilante de J D  Salinger  As peripecias bestialmente arrebatadas  impulsivas  imoderadas e inconvenientes de Holden Caulfield  A ambiencia e as circunstancias da leitura  As refracoes das luzes da organizacao do romance  A humildade e a desafetacao artisticas  As abordagens reincidentes sobre os paradoxos da existencia humana  o absurdo do mundo  a hipocrisia  a velhacaria e sonsice dos adultos  os armantes  peneirentos e mandachuvas que por ai andam  As frases de rasgo genial Tudo e causador de espanto e deslumbramento em   A Espera no Centeio        Nao sei bem o que quero dizer com isto  mas e isso que quero dizer         O que realmente me enche as medidas e um livro que  depois de acabarmos de o ler  nos faca desejar que o autor que o escreveu fosse um grande amigo nosso e pudessemos telefonar lhe sempre que nos desse para ai      I didn t buy this book during the recent Manila International Book Fair for the same reason  but I ended up reading it for Banned Books Week  And it was probably one of the best decisions I ve ever made  because The Catcher in the Rye is a classic without needing a complicated language or a complex plot The story was quite simple  really  It started with Holden Caulfield  the charming main character  about to get kicked out of school for the nth time  He left days before he s supposed to  then went to New York and smoked  drank  and  horsed  around  calling up and visiting some of his past acquaintances  The story s just all that  really Only  it s not  Holden did all that while reflecting on everything he saw  and for me  those were the best parts of this book  I haven t seen what he s seen or experienced what he s experienced  but I can still relate to him and his thoughts Holden got depressed quite easily  but he s really entertaining  He s crazy  to put it simply  At times  he clutched his stomach  pretending that he s shot  And he s quite the smooth liar  A very funny person  he was  I also loved how he just did what he wanted to  I wish I could be as brave as him Overall  The Catcher in the Rye was very good  and totally unworthy of being a challenged book  It reminded me of John Green s novels  which I also enjoyed  though  unfortunately  I have not yet read them all   I m looking forward to reading Salinger s other book  Franny and Zooey MY FAVORITE PART was his encounter with who was possibly the true Mr  Antolini  That was hilariously shocking  This review was originally posted at My Library in the Making  I m pretty sure if I met Holden Caulfield  I would hate his guts  He has got to be one of the most obnoxious  self centered  irresponsible protagonists in the history of literature  I can understand why so many people love to hate this book  The funny thing is   I loved it  I found myself laughing out loud several times at Holden s sarcasm For example   I have one of those very loud  stupid laughs  I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something  I d probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up   It s not difficult to see through Holden s tough  independent cover and to realize that he s just a child who needs protection  He shows just enough of a good heart that even though I wanted to shake him  I also really felt for him and wanted him to succeed This is one of those few books that I wouldn t mind reading again  I only wish the ending provided a little more closure   I think the point of this book is to not criticize the small annoyances in others  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE    This book was perfect for 16 year old my it was exactly what I needed and wanted to read i have re read it multiple times and I still love it as much as the first time  Pound for pound  The Catcher in the Rye would win the American novella category and rank highly among all the novels I have read to date First person narrator Holden Caulfield is America s first literary teenager  opening the door for a new genre  the teenage confessional  Like East of Eden  Ordinary People  The Outsiders and Rebel Without a Cause  The Catcher in the Rye authentically portrays the struggles of teenage boys in a certain place and time  The quality of the writing is exceptional  While first person point of view can be a challenge for young readers  the authenticity of the narrator s voice and the book s compactness make it more accessible  A lot happens in four days trapped inside Holden s head The Catcher in the Rye can be seen as a young adult novel or an adult novel about the teenager within us all  a lament on the necessary loss of innocence on the way to adulthood  You can t read it as an adult without getting personality insights than were impossible as a teen because teens are by definition living within the transitional state exemplified in Holden  They can t see it as transitional because it s the only reality they know  the fog they are living within  Caterpillar  pupa and butterfly are different states of being  The vast majority of teens are emerging from pupae ville  just starting to sample the sights and smells of the world  For them  death  James Castle s mangled body  is an abstract notion  something in a video or book or some stage or screen rendition of Romeo and Juliet  The average teen has never been in the presence of a lifeless body and smelled death s pungent vapors  well  maybe a frog in biology class  let alone lost a beloved sibling Only an adult can look back on their teenage years with perspective  yet academia keeps throwing The Catcher in the Rye at teenagers because of what it says about the challenges of growing up The Catcher in the Rye depicts an upper middle class male in an urban setting going through a crisis  He s overwhelmed by the pressures of becoming an adult  but too much has been thrown at him at once  He hasn t gotten over the death of his beloved younger brother  Allie  when he witnesses the suicide of a dormitory mate  James Castle  He s been traumatized and can t function  How much can a guy take He s looking for answers and can t seem to get them  like Conrad Jarret in Ordinary People and Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause  All three boys struggled with the death of people they cared about And the one person Holden respects and looks to for help  Mr  Antolini  he mistakes for a pervert  a threat  It s too much  so Holden withdraws  He wants to go live in a cabin in the woods  which is a metaphor for  Time out  I need a break   Phoebe rescues him with unconditional love  She accepts him no matter what  If she d been a brat the message would have been entirely different Holden goes from being antagonistic and callous to highly empathetic  He wants to protect children from the brutal realities of adulthood  But the trip has been too exhausting and he ends up in a rest home Cal  in East of Eden is similar to Holden  acting out  raging  doing strange things  But all four of these books films are about males  The world of teenage girls is different  so all the guy stuff  fighting  jealousy  possessiveness  etc   may not come across for the female reader I reread the book at age 67 and discovered that Holden could be suffering from PTSD stemming from the death of his brother and from witnessing the suicide of dorm mate James Castle  who bailed out of a dorm window wearing the sweater Holden had loaned him  The symptoms Holden was exhibiting  depression  poor concentration  attention deficit  crying  uncontrollable rage  lack of motivation  self isolation  sleeplessness  etc   are typical of PTSD  To me The Catcher in the Rye is partially about a kid struggling against the downward spiral of mental illness  Without professional help he was doomed to submerge  and did  Holden was barely  holdin  on  There s a lot of cultural and psychological meat in there  a  how boys interact with each other when living in close quarters  b  particularly when two have or are dating the same girl  Jane Gallagher and one feels protective or possessive of her  c  how a sensitive boy might behave because of a deep emotional wound and d  how that boy might become neurotically protective toward his younger sister and toward children in general because of c  Most teenagers aren t mature enough to comprehend the psychological ramifications of what I ve just described unless they ve been prepared for it by a mature adult who does comprehend  And there are many adults who can t Most adults have psychological defenses that don t allow even them to comprehend what I ve just described  It s either too abstract  too complicated or too scary  I suspect this is the main reason the book is so controversial  Most people don t get it unless someone points the way A greater sense of Holden Caulfield through JD Salinger can be found in the film Finding Forester  which is purported to be based on Salinger s life  The reclusiveness of Forester appears rooted in the trauma of losing his beloved brother in a car crash In World War II  Salinger was at Utah Beach at Normandy and at bloody major campaigns like the Battle of the Bulge  where Allied troops were decimated  He was among the first Allied troops to liberate a German concentration camp  He was hospitalized for battle fatigue  he understood first hand the effects of trauma In a 1953 interview with a high school newspaper  Salinger said that the novel was  sort of  autobiographical   My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book    it was a great relief telling people about it  Salinger  when writing The Catcher in the Rye wouldn t have had a clue about PTSD  as it wasn t even in the diagnostic manual  DSM  for psychologists until decades later  He was just writing what he felt  blasting his feelings onto paper and letting the chips fall Many people see Salinger as a sort of literary genius because he sold 70 million copies of one book  I m not saying he wasn t talented and educated  he had plenty of both going for him  I m saying he leveraged his talent on top of some inner need to get this desperate crisis part of his life onto paper and out of his head A great segment of the literary world has quite understandably interpreted Holden s PTSD symptoms as mere teenage angst  but this is a gross oversimplification  It is his masterfully presented array of extreme symptoms that is largely responsible for the success of the book It s too complicated  or too sensitive  for English teachers to talk about mental illness  so they focus on the simple and more obvious interpretation  Such teachers are missing a phenomenal opportunity to reach kids who are in crisis or know someone who is  We d have fewer cases of teenagers going postal if The Catcher in the Rye were used for exploring mental illness One point of the book is the redemptive power of unconditional love  revealed and brilliantly illustrated in the climax scene at the carousel Even at Phoebe s tender age  she knew how to get her point across  On the way to the carousel she digs in her heels  throws a fit  making Holden promise not to run away  Because of the depth of her devotion  Holden realizes she s doing it because she loves him  wants him to be safe and come home and return to school This revelation makes him so happy he begins to cry  He shows his love for Phoebe by fussing over her  making sure she gets a good seat  watching over her as the tears stream down his face in the rain  Teenage guys are supposed to be tough  but he s  practically bawling   And as if that weren t enough  Salinger practically spells it out with those two songs   Oh Marie  and  Smoke Gets in Your Eyes   Holden wanted Sally Hayes to run away with him  but all she wanted was someone to trim the Christmas tree  skate and go to the theater with  All Jane Gallagher wanted was someone to play golf and checkers and hold hands with in a movie  The raw fierceness of Phoebe s simple  innocent devotion redeemed Holden by showing him that among all the  phoniness  and flaws of mankind there is a niche of happiness if we open our eyes hearts to the possibility There was no one in Holden s life  not parents  not friends  not teachers  to let Holden know he was loved  except Phoebe  She proved her love by standing her ground to keep him safe  Phoebe represents family  clan or tribe  People are social creatures  like most higher forms of the animal kingdom capable of love  Love is a bonding emotion with survival implications If a writer has to STATE the obvious  it ruins it for the reader  cheats the reader of that glorious  Ah ha  moment of discovery  or worse  insults the reader s intelligence  But by not spelling it out  he she runs the risk that some readers won t get it  Herein lies the artistry  the use of symbol  ducks  fish   metaphor  pond   mood setting  rain  Salinger strikes a balance between showing and telling  with the knowledge that some readers will get it and others will walk away shaking their heads  or come up with interpretations that he had not intended  We tend to find what we are capable of seeing  or need to Nature symbols are used sparingly but effectively  Ducks flying south and the  part frozen  and part not frozen  pond can symbolize Holden s transitional state  neither boy nor man  The fish symbolize nature  a reminder that a natural process   Mother Nature   is taking place  The seasons come and go  we live  we die  we get sick  we get well  we get hurt  we heal  Are the Central Park ducks there to remind us that to survive and thrive we must stick together  You decide A final word on the so called  Peter Pan  interpretation of Holden  I find little support in the text for the position that Holden was resisting growing up The passage often cited as evidence for the Peter Pan perception concerns the naked breasted squaw diorama at the museum  Holden  The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was        You could go there a hundred thousand times  and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish        and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket  Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you In an article in the October 14  2014  The New York Times Sunday Review of Books  author Mendelshon says   The all too evident regret in that last sentence is striking    one of the novel s many markers of Holden s problem  which is a refusal to grow up   What regret  There is nothing in the text that conveys regret  Mendelshon may be projecting from his own history or it could be academic influence  some popular professor s interpretation that caught on because it was easy to relate to Practically everyone  Youtube star John Green included  parses out this naked breasted squaw passage and Holden s liberal use of the word  phony  as evidence Holden doesn t want to grow up  while overlooking a mountain of evidence to the contrary Holden smokes  drinks  lies about his age  critiques theater and music performances  frequents museums  hires a prostitute  repeatedly seeks out adult conversation with peer level engagement  acts protectively toward children  How many examples are needed to prove Holden is experimenting with adulthood  Criticizing adults as phony means he s evaluating adult behavior  not resisting  This is engagement  not avoidance Note further that Holden never seeks advice from his parents  or even thinks about it  Not consulting parents shows independence of mind  the embrace of maturity  not dependency or disengagement from the responsibilities of adulthood  Holden expresses compassionate concern about his mother  indicating that she hasn t been the same since Allie died  Compassion toward a grieving parent is adult thinking It shouldn t escape notice that Holden was also eagerly embracing the dessert of adulthood  sex  smoking  booze  nightclub music  dancing  flirting  dating  literature and the dramatic arts  while agonizing over the spinach of social hypocrisy and rationalization So  how DO we interpret Holden s comment about the bare breasted Native American The key is in that last sentence  underlined above   The only thing that would be different would be you   Holden is telling us he is aware that he is changing  This level of intuitive self reflection is adult thinking  It also shows maturity to appreciate that  some things don t change and never should   because they are part of our cultural identity Nostalgic awareness is mature thinking  Mature people want to protect and preserve cultural icons Think of the loss and disorientation after the Twin Towers were destroyed  Icons like the Statue of Liberty are signposts reminding us of who and where we are  Holden was feeling lost  In his agitated state he desperately needed that bare breasted squaw to be right where she had always been  That s all he was getting at with his comment  You Peter Pan theorists  give the kid a break and stop projecting your own history onto him Holden pondered and wrote down the Wilhelm Stekel quote Mr  Antollini gave him   The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   This is another sign he was putting a lot of serious and strenuous thought into growing up There are teenagers and even some adults  who resist growing up because their parents don t want to let go  They ve been infantalized  encouraging dependency  Holden shows no evidence of having been infantalized  Quite the contrary  sending a kid to a military style prep school could be evidence that Holden was too independent and possibly hard to control Many readers are perplexed by the book  for it is way over the heads of many  even some who teach literature  The book must be read slowly and thoughtfully in order to absorb its meaning The Catcher in the Rye even gets into the very meaning of life in the Steckel quote cited by Antolini   The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   You can shrug your shoulders and flip the page or you can sit and ponder what it means  which could take days Many readers  teens in particular  resist The Catcher in the Rye because of the book s capacity to trigger self reflection  It resonates with their own transition from juvenile to adult  a vital period for personality development  when boys and girls become men and women and are confronted with one another s sexuality and the struggle to think and  be  independent from their parents Check out the date rape scene in Ed Bankey s car when Holden overhears Stradlater abusing a girl in the back seat  You can t just blast through that scene without stopping to ponder your own early dating experiences  The evidence on the page shows that Holden was not resisting adulthood  he was aggressively embracing it  Holden was no Peter Pan The book is a masterpiece of art and insight  Who will ever get into the head of a teenage boy so deeply  so thoroughly and with such an authentic and authoritative voice  More about me at http   www wattpad com user MHeying w     One of my faves  I read it every couple of years and always find something new and discover a new appreciation and understanding for Holden and his journey  This story is about a 16 year old boy named Holden Caulfield  it all started when he suffered from a nervous breakdown  which happened shortly after he got kicked out of Pencey Prep  Being kicked out of school brought him to two roads  go back home or head off to New York City and start his own life  He chose latter of course  which later brought him into many troubles since he is such an anxious person himself  While he s living his life  he dreamt of being the catcher of the rye  which is literally catching children as they fall of the cliff This book is about saving innocence  and reminisces about childhood and I recommend this book to teenagers who face troubles connected to adolescence  Holden was a rebel  who is confused about adulthood and his future  but he lived through it  and I guess this book is trying to tell every teenager that it s okay to be confused  because in the end  you will prevail  I finished this seconds ago at 5 21 in the morning because I spent the entire night reading it  I read it because it s part of my English summer reading homework and an essay is due in two days  I m quite the procrastinator  I thought I was going to hate this book  I had absolutely no idea what it was about  I think I wanted to hate it too because my dad kept telling me to read it  God damn was I surprised when after five pages of reading this book I realized how good it is  This book is amazing  Maybe it s because my mind is so tired after staying up all night  maybe it s because I just finished the damn book and I haven t properly thought about it  but right now all I can say is that this book is amazing  I don t know if others would agree  but it s freaking hilarious and really sweet  Is sweet the right word  I don t know  I m too tired to worry about my adjectives  Anyway  read the goddamn book  I love it  I really do  Well  what can I say about this book that hasn t already been said before  Its probably the most loved and the most hatted book ever to been written  Holden has been accused of been a hormonally tormented teenager with too much time on his hands  to a psychotic adolescent  The question still remains however  what was actually wrong with Holden We can all relate to Holden at the start of his twisted story  Hes just a kid with a chip on his shoulder with  phonies  and  Hotshots  that all encounter through out our daily movements  We all identify with his dislike of the principle that only wanted to talk to the parents of the wealthier students  while he brushes off the Dads with the big shoulder pads  This is an annoyance  a person we all know of and regularly suffer their presence by biting down on our tongues  Holden is quite a bright Youngman who could identify this person and pick out their flaws  On the subject of Holden been a bright kid  it leads us onto the subject of how good a liar he is  a characteristic best associated with psychopaths  Holden doesn t hold back when he starts lying and admits that himself  He does it to get a kick out of tricking the other person and I think he gets a kick out of been in the power position or the driving seat of the conversation  His convulsion to lie to the mother on the train for the hell of it is one example of this and he enjoys knowing that he has tricked her into believing her son was president of the class when he was nothing of the sort  In that one conversation he not only manages to put the poor mother into a fluster of emotions from joy to sorrow  he also manages to leave the genitor in an awkward situation as he uses his name as a pseudonym I would however be committing a literacy crime if I led you to believe that Holden Caulfield was that straight forward a character  In the chapter when he hires a prostitute essentially for a chat   it s the dress hanging up in the wardrobe that gets him as he thinks of the person who sold it to her that didn t realise exactly who it was going to  In saying that Holden felt bad for her  he was also too timid to go through with the process of entering adult hood  for lack of a better expression  and sends her packing with the agreed price for the night  The fact he had even paid her shows just how nice a guy he can be  Still this proves nothing  As the novel brings us deeper and deeper into the mind of Holden we can t help but get lost along the way in his thoughts  just like he did  At the end of the day  we can all admit that we do identify with him at one stage or another and still to this day the piece he said about the museum and that some things should just stay the way they are and not change  Think back yourself if you haven t already and you will agree  All in all  I think that Holden manages to capture the worst parts of human nature  which is what Salandger wanted to get across  I think he wanted to relay to us the faults of human nature from his point of view  This book is a little harrowing and is known to leave the reader wondering what  Is that it  Is that how it ends  And I m afraid to be the bearer of bad news but yes  that is how it ends   This book has always impressed me  not just for the way it makes me feel when reading it but also for the way it makes others feel after having read it  Some will love it as I do  some will hate it more than life itself  But  in the end it will affect you   I think Holden will end up becoming a pretty good  Catcher in the Rye  Devlin  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody    I really liked this book  From an objective standpoint  I don t think I would have enjoyed Holden s company  but I thought Salinger did a phenomenal job in developing him as an engaging 3D character  I felt that his subtle hints about his affluent and perverted childhood corroborated his angsty  idiosyncratic character  I like how Salinger uses symbols to show Holden s fear of adulthood  Overall  I see why people would abhor the book  but I think it s important to look past his judgmental behavior and see why he is the way that he is   The Catcher in the Rye was written by J D  Salinger  it is a story about a troubled boy named Holden Caulfield  Holden is 16 years old and a junior in high school  Holden doesn t make it clear where he is in the story  but he does say that he is undergoing treatment in a mental institute  He is the narrator throughout the book  Holden is a troubled boy who has been kicked out of many schools  You could basically say he is a trouble maker  He is about to leave for New York due to being kicked out of his latest school  Pencey High  The start of the book begins at the end of the first semester  close to Christmas time   When he gets into a fight with one of his roommates  Holden decides to leave early three days to Manhattan  His parents do not know that he s been kicked out of school  again  His parents live in New York  and when the three days are up  he plans on going to tell them what happened  It talks about all of Holdens expierences while he is in New York  Too me he seems like he is looking to have sex a lot  While he is in New York  he gets close to having sex  but looks likes he gets spooked  and it never happens  He seems to be the classic troubled teen  drinking all the time  and looking for sex  He also seems to be very afraid of homosexuals  I say this because during a scene in the book  Holden visits one of his old teachers  Mr  Antolini  He goes to his place  and is so tired he falls sleep on Mr  Antolini s couch  When he wakes up  Mr  Antolini is stroking his forehead  and Holden thinks that he is making a move on him  Holden gets up and run s out of the room  This shows his phobia for homosexuals  I also get the feel that Holden is somewhat antisocial  In the beginning of the book  the first chapter  he is at the top of a hill all by himself looking down at the schools football game  He says that everyone that goes to the school is down there watching  Yet  he is all by himself at the top of the hill  Even when he goes back to his dorm for the night  he tries to stay hidden  Many parts of the story  he is by himself  It only seems when he his drunk or wants to have sex  he begins to open up and look for people   This book had some twists and turns to it that I didn t expect  I really recommend this book to anyone who is looking  honestly  for a good laugh  Some of the things that he does are funny  yet sad because he really should be the right track  Salinger uses descriptive detail and words that applied to your senses to get you hooked  This is one of those books that tell a story the way it is  no sugar coating or anything else  This book is not for someone that doesn t not like foul language or raunchy talk  It s one of those rough edged books  Once again I liked this book and recommend it to anyone looking for a good read  That s one helluva book  Though it s a little bit phony sometimes  Anyway  he should definitely give old Jane a buzz  I mean  when he s in the mood  You can t do that kind of thing when you are not in the mood  I am not saying anything that hasn t been said before  this book is incredible  Point of view  dialouge  language       it is all genius  It was hilarious and sad   fyh rwyt btHs nh nktbt  shnk  w nktbt  shn mtHsWsh nk lwHdk  wdh bybq  kfy jdan lmHbth  twq ty llrwy  mn lly qr th  nh knt mnkhfD  jdan  mkuntsh mutSwr nh htw thr fyWa bhdh lshkl  There are some books you should read when you re a teenager  That s not to say that these books aren t worthy of an adult audience  simply that there are certain things you should read when you re young because that s when you ll get the most out of it  The Catcher in the Rye is one I wish I had read years ago  That way  I d be fondly remembering passages right now  instead of being overwhelmed by them for the first timeHolden Caulfield is probably one of the greatest protagonists ever created  His nihilistic commentary is so powerful and complex  He approaches all of the important aspects of growing up and learning about the world in a way that we all did  His experiences are colored by his very distinct point of view  As an adult  I see the flaws in his thinking  but  at the same time  I completely understand him  I m thankful that I read this one when I still remember what it s like to be seventeen There are so many powerful passages in this book that it would be impossible for me to name all of them  The one that stands out to me the most is when Holden wakes up to find himself being petted by Mr  Antolini  one of his favorite teachers  Holden deals with the situation in the only way he knows how   by running away  After he s gone  he still doesn t know if he did the right thing or not  Holden as a victim was one of the most impressive parts of the book  Holden has his body physically molested by someone he trusts  It is very reminiscent of what his school roommate did to his emotions by possibly  giving the time  to a girl he had pleasant memories of  Although Holden is the protector of childhood innocence  his own is compromised throughout the story The Catcher in the Rye is nothing short of brilliant  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody   Holden Caulfield J D  Salinger s The Catcher in the Rye mesmerized me with its detail and interesting characters within the book  This book is also different from many other books as it is a little more descriptive and more joyous to read   This book has many themes and lesson that anybody can relate to  It shows the audience that although things may seem boring and even a little negative  if you want  you can make a brighter future for yourself  In this books  J D  Salinger wrote it in a way that can relate to many people whether they can relate from personal experience or just seeing that in their everyday life  J D  wrote in in a way that we knew just about everything Holden was thinking  especially his own beliefs on others and things that he experienced  Even though we re never told exactly where this story takes place  we are still given details about the setting alone with Holden s own description of the area he s in  The story has a little bit of everything  a little suspense  some drama  actions  and even a little romanticism  The way the book is written  it makes me feel as though I can actually be there  I can even get the feeling that I slowly get to know Holden throughout the story more and more and get to learn more about his character  It just makes it seem different from many of the other books you would usually read  J D  Salinger is a great at making it seem as the characters in the story as real people that you could meet any day  the characters even seem as though they really do exist and this story was almost an autobiography  He made the characters all have different personalities even though some were mentioned once and disappeared the rest of book  Holden Caulfield  the main character  is whom the story revolves around  He says many quotes throughout the book that I believe many teens  and possibly even adults  could relate too  At one point in the story he says   I am always saying  Glad to ve met you  to somebody I m not at all glad I met  If you want to stay alive  you have to say that stuff  though   In another point in the story is says   The best thing  though  in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was  Nobody s move        Nobody s be different  The only thing that would be different would be you   He says many things throughout the book that are either very deep or relatable  In the story  we are never given a real life location but throughout the books we get many descriptions of the area he s in  Sometimes  the descriptions given are so well written you can actually get the sense that you are there   In the story  he explains how he s just been expelled from his school along with a few previous schools  He is expelled from school but isn t scheduled to go home until a some time later  Shortly after he goes back to his room and talks to his roommate about things and finds out that his roommate is going to go out with his ex crush  When he returns  Holden tries to find out if he managed to have sex with her and they end up fighting  causing Holden to start bleeding  He decides to leave and catch a train to Central Park and rents a hotel room  That point on he wanders around the city  meeting different people and doing different things  catching up with people he hasn t seen until he can go home to which he writes a letter to his little sister saying he s leaving forever  Phoebe  his younger sister  packs a suitcase and insists that he goes with him  he refuses but knowing that she will follow him  he goes to the zoo and spends the rest of the day with her  it begins to rain and he gets sick and that s when we ends the story saying that he will be starting school next fall and is optimistic about his future  This book in my opinion one of the best books that J D  Salinger has written  I would strongly recommend it to any reader regardless of what kind of books they prefer  for the simple reason that this books has a little of everything which makes it undoubtedly an amazing book to If you are looking for a book for high school students to read  Catcher in the Rye it is  This book is perfect for young adults because it brings to light the rebellious stage that many might be going through  As the reader follows the main character  we worry about the safety of this student who leaves school and decides to roam around the streets of New York  Although the character of this book is from an upper middle class background  if analyzed well all readers will be able to relate to his need for companion  This book can work wonders if one is trying and get young adults to become reflective of why they act out a certain way  For adults that read this book  it will help bring to light the attention that children are in need of and how neglect that can have dire affects on a child s emotional development  It is because of this and other underlining issues that J D Salinger places into his stories that it has made him one of my favorite authors  Let s Talk About Holden Caulfeild Throughout my reading experiences I ve found that you either identify with Holden Caulfeild or you think he s a whiny  pretentious  twit  In my opinion both viewpoints are equally valid  Salinger s  The Catcher in the Rye is a book with with depth  Holden as a protagonist is an adolescent meditation on adolescence and that I think is the greatest strength and weakness of this book  To appreciate Holden I believe you have to be in the correct frame of mind and by that I don t mean you have to be an adolescent  Holden is most certainly pretentious  but then again almost all teens are  At that age we all believe to some extent that we know everything  that we can do everything by ourselves  It is only through reminiscing that we realize how poorly equipped we were to deal with life at the time  Whenever I hear adults discussing what is  wrong  with youth these days I usually hear words like pretentious  entitled  and emotional thrown around  While Holden is all of these things  he is also a young boy who is trying to come to grips with who he is and why he cannot function in society the way everyone else does  I won t get into the argument about whether Holden is mentally ill or if he s just a spoiled brat who is acting out after Allie s death but he clearly is reaching out for attention  Holden talks about people he  knows   He also tells us he is lonesome but he can t seem to make friends  When he does reach out to certain people in the novel he only seems to aggravate them and doesn t quite seem to know how to converse with someone  This leads me to one of his favorite quotes in the novel  phonies  When Holden calls people a phony  I don t believe he means that they re all fake  Instead I believe that he doesn t understand how people can function at a level where their stresses do not show on the manifest level  This to Holden is phony  Why can we not all let our emotions show through all the time  This is the question Holden is asking of the world and of us as he narrates his tale to the audience  The Catcher in the Rye is a powerful novel because it allows us to look back on adolescence  For those of us who can remember well why it was hard to fit in  it has become a life changing bildungsroman coming of age novel   For those who feel like Holden is pretentious  you re right  he is  But we have to remember that mental pain is just as valid as physical pain  We have to remember why we felt the way we did and why it shaped us into the people we became  In the end this novel  which is full of powerful quotes one in particular that resonates with me and also fits in with another Salinger quote  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry  and from Salinger s  Raise High the Roof Beam  Carpenters   Seymour  An Introduction  I have scars on my hands from touching certain people   Certain heads  certain colours and textures of human hair leave permanent marks on me   The real question of The Catcher in the Rye and Holden Caulfield is not   Can we relate to this character   But is  what do we learn from him  Did we allow his scars to offer us something and do we have something offer others  Holden raises these questions to us  and it is up to us to impart what we have learned to other and maybe just possibly make their lives a little easier   This is a bit dodge    and lazy    but Catcher is my all time fav  I love anyone who loves it and hate anyone who doesn t  Anyhoo  I ve been reading another book  much much different  but just as much honestly and there I come across an entire section on Holden  bliss  Bless  So I share it here in my pathetic attempt at my first review   but hey if it s better than I could do then why not   BWT from a book called  IS IT TO BE   by Jeremy Griffith   That sublime classic of American literature  J D  Salinger s 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye  is a masterpiece because Salinger dared to write about that forbidden subject for adults of adolescents having to resign to a dishonest life of denial of the human condition for The Catcher in the Rye is entirely about a 16 year old boy struggling against Resignation  The boy  Holden Caulfield  complains of feeling  surrounded by phonies   p 12 of 192  and  morons  who  never want to discuss anything   p 39   of living on the  opposite sides of the pole   p 13  to most people  where he  just didn t like anything that was happening   p 152   to wanting to escape to  somewhere with a brook    where  I could chop all our own wood in the winter time and all   p 119   He knows he is supposed to resign in the novel he talks about being told that  Life    is  a game   you should play it according to the rules   p 7   and to feeling  so damn lonesome   pp 42  134  and  depressed   multiple references  that he felt like  committing suicide   p 94   As a result of all this despair and disenchantment with the world he keeps  failing   p 9  his subjects at school and is expelled from four for  making absolutely no effort at all   p 167   About his behaviour he says   I swear to God I m a madman   p 121  and  I know  I m very hard to talk to   p 168   But like the boy in Coles  account  Holden finally encounters some rare honesty from an adult that  in Holden s words   really saved my life   p 172   This is what the adult said   This fall I think you re riding for it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind    where you  just keep falling and falling  utter depression    p 169   The adult then spoke of men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with   So they gave up looking  they resigned     adding  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior   pp 169 170   Yes  to be  confused and frightened  to the point of being  sickened by human behavior  indeed  to be  suicid ally    depressed  by it is the effect the human condition has if you haven t resigned yourself to living a relieving but utterly dishonest and superficial life in denial of it   One of the actually great books we assign to high school students And we definitely deal with a lot of phonies in this life EdmundRe reading right now  Absolutely fantastic book  as good as I remember for 20 years ago  The first section reminds me a lot of F  Scott Fitzgerald s  This Side of Paradise            Found the second section a slower read as I got distracted by all the other books I am reading Beautiful little ending Definitely a book that felt more my experience when I was 16  then it does now Still excellent and highly recommend Sad Salinger didn t write more  But this one took him 10 years Fame isn t meant for everyone  This book is truly avant garde  A quei tempi avevo diciotto anni ed era estate  la scuola era da poco terminata e cercavo  il libro   quello giusto  quello che desse senso alla vacanza nel mio tempo  Lo iniziai a leggere nel pomeriggio e continuai per tutta la notte fino alle prime luci dell alba  Un libro illuminante  critico  dalla lingua policroma e con un velo di tristezza  Non riuscivo a smettere  sentivo che Holden mi faceva sentire meno sola  piu compresa  I suoi pensieri erano i miei  le sue inquietudini anche  Ora da adulta  mi rendo conto che una parte di me e ancora alla ricerca di qualcuno che si chieda dove vadano a finire in inverno le anatre del parco  perche sono quesiti che mi pongo anche oggi  non riesco ad intrecciare il mio vivere a quello adulto  quello in cui le parole sono svuotate dal loro etimo e le giornate sono fogli di calendario da staccare via  Giorni che si accumulano e servono solo per il computo degli anni da festeggiare Questo e un romanzo di formazione atipico perche non attinge ai topoi del Bildungsroman  non vi e in esso la sequela di difficolta da superare per sancire una  crescita  che permetta di considerarsi adulti  Holden non vuole far parte del mondo adulto perche ne rifiuta la sua ipocrisia  la sua mediocrita  i rapporti superficiali  la visione qualunquista  Si rifugia nella letteratura e nelle persone  quelle belle  quelle ricche per una ibridazione tra amore e comprensione che permetta l ascolto del mondo nella sua purezza  Che senso ha crescere se dimentichiamo di contemplare cio che ci circonda  Di porci quelle domande su cose inutili  ma assolutamente necessarie per sentirci vivi  Tutto vive intorno a noi  il mondo accade e  a volte  chi ne e consapevole si sente un po  piu solo  After the first 1 4 of the book  I thought I was a bit too old to be reading it  but by the final 1 4 of the book my impressions had done an emphatic volte face  Salinger presents us with Holden Caulfield  a character easy to dislike and even easier to misread  But behind all of his transparent machismo and affectations is an adolescent struggling to assimilate to the cutthroat  heartless world of adulthood  Clearly anguished by his younger brother s death  Holden wiles away a few days in NYC in what becomes a downward spiral of mimetic depravity and sincere depression  But The Catcher in the Rye is not a cautionary tale nor is it a hackneyed account of teenage rebellion  Instead  Salinger s novel raises questions of our current state of callousness toward human suffering and the loss of a childhood innocence that preceded it  Salinger did not intend this book only for teenagers  but for us all  he simply chose a teenager to present the ideas  Even at 24  I understand why this book is a classic  Honestly  I can see why people hate this book  Holden is obnoxious  as any typical teenage boy can be  and he s hypocritical  But other people love it  worship it even  I like it  and I have no problem picking up my copy to a random section and reading it when I m bored  But my affection stops at  like  only  There isn t a book I ve read that I worship  The things that I like about this book is not how I can relate to Holden  but the era in which he s speaking from  A time where American dialogue is like a whole other language  and things we find important today weren t even on the back burner for people during Holden s time  I like how he spoke the entire time  what little things mean so much to him  and why he cares about the things he does  Like how he idolizes his brother Allie  I just call this book memorable  You are no longer a teenager   Thank God for that    Reading THE CATCHER IN THE RYE   again or for the first time  when you re thirty    means it s less about the awesome adventures of that nonconformist Holden Caulfield and much more about the strange world he inhabits  Here s a young man dealing with the same problem many adults still do  an overwhelmingly alien world  populated with strange creatures whose only resemblance to humanity is that they look like  well  them  JD Salinger taps into the same metaphysical wavelength that Herman Hesse did with his bildungsroman coming of age novels  But Salinger s craftiness lies in compressing his young hero s stream of consciousness into one debaucherous week  ironically  Christmas weekend    making the reader s experience very very intense  Symbols abound  sex is never consummated because it s the implied doorway to ruinous adulthood  Salinger s interest in eastern philosophy and Western religion  namely  Catholicism finds expression through subplots and characters  and an English professor called Mr  Antolini lays out the perfect exit strategy for those of us wanting actual meaning in an absurd life   I think the reason why CATCHER will continue to capture the imaginations of both the young and old is the honesty  purity and lack of pretense embodied by Holden Caulfield  He represents the very best in us  like a child he yearns for the experience of the new  confused  he optimistically fumbles his way through the monolithic labyrinth built by adults  themselves lost souls  This book is sure to bring you years and years of comfort  Remember  you are not alone   the catcher in the rye is a book mainly about a young boy named holden caulfield holden went to an all boy school and he thought everyone there was phony  he wasnt getting good grades so he got himself kicked out of the preparatory school he attended holden decided to go back to new york were he lives but didnt want his parents to know he got kicked out of school holden had a little sister named phoebe a big brother named D b and a younger brother named allie who died of lukemia holden kepted his brothers mitten because it reminded him of the good times they had together well on holden new york adventure he stayed in a hotel where he met new people  he also smoked cigarettes and loved to drink at the end of the book holden ends up in a crazy people hospital because he wasnt very sane  The main character of the story is Holden Caulfield  16 years old guy  who can seem wild  unmanaged  longing to the independence on the one side and wise  honest  timid person on the other  Basically  his appearance is not paying much attention  though the odd red hunting hat makes easily recognized  The first fact the story tells you about Holden is that he s just dropped out of famous boy school Pency  for not passing exams  and doesn t worry about that too much  Moreover  later you start seeing that he doesn t care about own future at all  So  after leaving school he s going to home and his traveling is turning into a life journey  I can t not agree with people who think this book doesn t have neither beginning nor ending  That s true  Because actually  the whole story is just Holden s thoughts  about himself  about people  about the world  It doesn t have ending  as this strange thing  which is called life  will last forever  That s what I like the most about the book  You can hear Holden  see and f e e l him  My second favorite character is Phoebe and seems like I m falling in love with her more and more each time I reread the book  and it happens very often   She s perfect in all ways and immediately pay your attention making you understand why Holden loves her so much  I would do too if I had a sister  Though  I ve always wanted an elder brother  especially after this novel  Now It s time to end my small review and if say I enjoyed this amazing book it will mean nothing  Because it s got something more inside what is impossible to describe for those who didn t read this  You can only feel it with your heart  So  read and I hope you ll fall in love with it as I did   Before I started reading  I thought this book was going to be a big bore about something useless  However  once I actually did start reading I was pleasantly surprised that it is purely a monologue of the main character  Holden  While he is painfully repetitive  it is entertaining to read and it focuses on growing up and the struggles teens face to mature and conform into society to become a working part of it  I believe it ending somewhat abruptly  but Holden as a character only talks about things for as long as he wants to  and that is why it ending like it did was logical  Also  life usually doesn t wrap up nicely like most novels do  Life is a constant battle of high and low times  boring and exciting  a whole range of things that doesn t stop  til we do  I recommend this book greatly  especially if you have a lot of time to sit down and read it all at once  The chapters are set in a way that feels like J D  Salinger wrote the whole book as one monologue  then decided to space it in chapters  Good book  even if it is a bit phony   A delightfully misanthropic teenage perspective of life  Can t really believe it s taken me so long to get to this book  I absolutely loved it  Holden is such a real character  he feels and thinks and acts like a human being would  The realness and bluntness is what appeals especially to me  something i miss in for example many recent YA books  Yes  he does seem a bit crazy and strange at times  but isn t that was being young is all about  I love the way it s written in a sort of I don t care language and the present beautifully woven in with memories and thoughts  some typical for a teenage boy and some strike you with their depth  It s a book about nothing too exciting really but told in such a way  and seen through the eyes of an extraordinary person  that nothing is really  really something  Reading this in high school was a treat for me   I was fairly cynical  but this guy took the prize  I thought I was really getting away with something reading all that naughty language and stuff  NOTE 08 07 08  I read this again  I really did  I mean  it was just so funny and all  It really was  That old Holden is such a sarcastic bastard  I don t think he realizes that he is talking about himself in so many of his descriptions of other people  Of course I don t know him too well or anything  but boy  his teenage angst and all just killed me  it really did  You gotta read this one  you really do  Holden Caufield has got to be one of my favorite characters I ve so far read about  He s an unreliable narrator at best but when you actually start to understand him this changes  This is aided by the fact that his character does change near the end as well  and though the amount of change can be viewed as incomplete or of little prominence  I dare say it is far from negligible  But that is my opinion Holden experiences this struggle from what he believes is adulthood and what he believes is childhood  Based on his warped views of adulthood  commonly associated with corruption due to the fast paced and cruel nature of it he is so used to  he creates a view of childhood being like a  rye  where children play all day and laugh  unconcerned with any worldly corruption  This is backed up by the idea of his little brother Allie and his older brother D B   Allie being very revered and loved by the association of him to an eternal childhood  as he is only known from memory  and D B  being called a prostitute  etc   not literally  by his association to more adult themes  although he has a fondness to his older brother  which shows his interest in growing up though of course he gets confronted with um  bullshit basically  Holden tries entering adulthood  much like his brother  but he finds it much difficult when he sees all the demands society puts on him with sex  acknowledging homosexuality  going to school  being  phony   and because of his childlike nature  he can t express his confusion in any other way but a blatant dislike and contempt  Of course I think my favorite part of this book is when Mr  Antolili revises his idea of the  rye  and tells him that Holden is not the only person who sees the corruption of this world and tells him what true adulthood is like  I found it particularly funny how the reader  or at least I was  was more engaged than actual Holden when he was explaining this  I think this has to do with his characterization  for he was not meant to have a full 180 degree change of heart at the end  Many of his revelations  for example  a more complex view on Mr  Antolili  at the end were left unresolved  But I am content with this  I thought both Holden and the ending were fitting to the story  But despite Holden s apparent contradictions like his smoking drinking habits  lying  etc   I just love him  He is a nice guy at heart and this part of him is so significant and hard to ignore  Truly he deserves to be better understood  but again that is part of the tragedy  it s really hard to My second favorite part of course was Phoebe when she is taken to the carrousel and her significance  and there was also that little part where he was at the museum and talked about Egyptians to the two kids  I ve yet to see this part analyzed but to me it s showing how more comfortable he feels and how his idea is more readily accepted there in a child s world as opposed to being bashed in the adult world  Mr  Spencer at the beginning   But when he sees profanity on the wall of the museum  he then says  That s the trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any   revamping his idea subtly on childhood  I would go on on how I love this book some more but there s enough people already doing so  In short  this is an awesome book  I loved it  5 5  This story depicts Holden Caulfield  a 16 year old  who attends a prep school  He feels out of place because he thinks that everyone around him is a  phony   He tries to find himself by walking around New York  He talks to his ex girlfriend Sally to try and escape with her but she won t and thinks he s crazy  His sister  Phoebe  is his best friend who he tells that he will leave  She gets sad and he decides to stay instead  We later find out that he s in a mental hospital probably for depression  This is one of the best books I ve ever read and one of the saddest  Holden was depressed throughout the entire novel  This is a great novel for adolescents because he deals with many situations that they face and will face  He struggles finding his place in society which is what many people in general go through especially at 16  He also has at least someone close to him  his sister  Overall  a great read   Second only to sacred scripture  Mi libro favorito  por lejos Es una lectura simple pero obsesiva  Poco libros atrapan de la manera en que este lo hace  Plantea temas bastante profundos y dilemas tan contemporaneos como perdurables en el tiempo  sobre todo en la etapa de la adolescencia  topico y contexto central de la narracion  por cierto Lo que mas destaco del libro es el hecho de que  aunque contempla tematicas tan interesantes como complicadas  lo hace de una manera dinamica  sin tornarse aburrido ocupando varias paginas en divagaciones filosoficas  Como dije en un pricipio  es una lectura simple  pero definitivamente sabrosa  En mas de un pasaje me senti identificado con el inadaptado personaje principal  Holden  y su actitud en extremo curiosa y  la mayoria de las veces  pesimista Su abrupto final me dejo  sin duda alguna  con ganas de mas  pero tal y como nuestro incomprendido amigo eventualmente lo deducira a lo largo del relato  a veces es mejor dejar  lo que sigue  en el tintero de la vida Altamente recomendado  The catcher in the Rye is one of those coming of age books that you will remember  The main character is comical yet sincere in what he believes  This book revealed a whole new dimension of the world to me through Holden Caufield s eyes  Salinger also wrote the book like a madman  couldn t have been more smooth to read   Holden Caulfield says   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it  I say that I don t know if Salinger and I would have much to talk about  however  I really wish I could sit down and have a conversation with Holden  I think it would go something like this  Hey Holden  I just wanted to say hi  Mind if I have a cigarette  You know  I haven t smoked in 20 years  but your story really  really made me crave a cigarette  I don t remember ever reading another story that made me feel like having a cigarette  But  your story  you know  it killed me  But  I wanted to tell you that that stuff you said about Jesus  well  it killed me  Yeah  you are just so right about that Well  you don t know me and all  but I also wanted to say to you  about that girl  Jane  well  I think you should phone her some time  Yeah  none of my business  I know  but think about it anyway  I hope you will be well  I think you will  But take care  all right  I will be thinking of you  If you don t mind  I may come around some other time just to say hi  Bye for now  then  And thanks for the cigarette  it saved my life   I have just finished re reading it again after many years and it would be quite lame of me to review a masterpiece like this  It is still so relevant  I can hardly believe it was written 60 years ago and I can hardly believe it is disliked by so many reviewers on Goodreads  I am not sure if I am still immature or others just lack the angst I sometimes share with Holden  I started reading this before I went to bed and ended up not getting any sleep at all  Now  every time I m kept up at night frantically turning the pages of some bestseller  I ll feel like I m sleeping with a prostitute in comparison It was strange  because I usually say that some books you devour as quickly as you can in one go  others you taste and chew as to savor the taste  This one  I wanted to devour  but as slowly  and with as much self restraint as I could manage   I was terrified I d miss something This is the best american novel I have ever read  and I plan to read lots more if only so I can give that statement some more magnitude What this book did for me  more than anything  was make me feel understood  There s this moment when Holden s old teacher is telling him that he s not the only one who s horrified at the world and the people who live in it  and that s exactly what I felt this book was telling me the entire time I was reading it    You re not the only one who reacts to this as something unnatural  you re not alone  you re not crazy  Holden sees it too Beyond that there s so much more to talk about   the amazing narration  the symbolism  how delightfully unpretentious this book is   but none of that is more important than what this book gave to me emotionally  I feel like I have gained a friend  No  not a friend   an ally  I feel like I have gained an important and unrelenting ally against what is at times a mad  mad world To borrow the vocabulary of Holden Caulfield  This is the least phoney book I ve ever read  and it killed me  Este foi sem duvida um daqueles livros dificeis de adquirir  Por ser um classico e por todos os elogios que ja lhe tinha ouvido serem dedicados  queria muito que integrasse a minha coleccao  Mas  ainda assim  queria um exemplar perfeito  com direito a marcador e em portugues de Portugal  Demorei quatro anos a encontra lo e a traze lo para casa e tres dias a le lo  Bem  na verdade  foram apenas umas horas que  aliadas a falta de tempo  prolongaram a leitura por tres dias Nao sei bem como me posicionar face ao livro  As expectativas eram altas mas nao sabia bem o que esperava  Se me perguntassem  ate a passada sexta feira  quando adquiri o livro  nao fazia ideia do que se tratava  Nao me desiludiu  e um facto  Mas talvez esperasse mais  Esta e uma obra intemporal e inesquecivel   arrisco ate dizer  que se assemelha ao Principezinho nessa particularidade   cuja interpretacao e certamente indissociavel da idade do leitor e que  nesse sentido  procurarei reler daqui a uns anos  Ainda assim  com 19 anos  afeicoei me a este Holden que nao e mais que um personagem tipo representativo da maioria dos adolescentes da epoca e da actualidade  E  nao nego  a historia de um adolescente expressamente deprimido que nao se afeicoa a nada nem a ninguem  que nao perspectiva um futuro a longo prazo e cujos objectivos sao limitados ao agora  Porem  nao deixa de ser um rapaz inteligente  criativo  perspicaz e  ate certo ponto  realista  E apenas um ser que  tendo perdido um dos seus pilares e vendo se sozinho no mundo  procura lutar contra a estranheza de ter perdido a inocencia da infancia mas nao se rever os ideais hipocritas no mundo adulto Porem  se ha algo que podemos   todos nos   reter desta obra e guardar desta experiencia de crise pela qual todos passamos e  sem duvida  a grandiosa oportunidade de crescimento e mudanca que esta nos oferece e que  por ser exigente  implica necessariamente escolhas  de conquista e renuncia  que nos trazem sempre alguma dor e desamparo  No entanto  e ainda assim algo natural e construtivo que  potencialmente  nos eleva e aproxima de nos proprios  Esta construcao da identidade  do ser Eu e aqui representada segundo a perspectiva que  a nao ser que estejamos a passar por ela  ninguem recorda e todos criticamos e julgamos  E derivado desta amnesia selectiva  penso eu  que advem tantas criticas a obra  Pois quem se lembra  ainda que possa nao o ter experimentado da mesma forma  reconhecer se a certamente nas duvidas e nas problematicas abordadas ao longo do livro  I really recommend reading this book to every teenager  even adults  I actually successfully encouraged a friend to buy this book after I told her how I view the main character and all  which was my biggest achievement in this stuff so far  I ve always wanted to casually talk to someone about how I like that side of Holden that wants to be the catcher in the rye  but it seems that I can t find anyone around me who have read this book  and that kind of made me sad  I remember freaking out in our school library  cause I saw a guy was reading it  It was Wednesday afternoon   I mean  it s still up to them if they ll like it or not  if they will ever read it  One s life is not complete if he hasn t read it  I dare say  I m telling you right now that reading The Catcher in the Rye will definitely change the way you look at people and everything around you  even the way you view your life  like what happened on me  That is  if you ll rate it five starred  This book is about a young man named Holden Caulfield  He is a teenager that is getting kicked out of Spencer Boarding School  He decides that he is an adult and tries to go out into New York City and make a living but in this story he realizes that the world is hard and he isn t ready to take it on  He goes through some problems along the way to let him realize what he really needs to do  I noticed that the theme of this book is that the world isn t always rainbows and sunshine its a dark place that takes patience  I think this story relates to a lot of teenagers across the world and the trials they go through and the thoughts they think  This books relates to me because of how he feels and his emotions towards a lot of things  I honestly loved this book its great  It s well written and has great action its never boring and its understandable  This is absolutely my favorite book  I read it at just the right time for me  when I was the same age as Holden Caulfield  It s a coming of age story about the loss of innocence  and it resonated with me deeply  Growing up is difficult  awkward  and complex  This novel is a classic and is so poignantly beautiful  I can t imagine not enjoying it  It isn t to be read for the plot  but for the characterization and the symbolism and the overall message  It may be written in simple language  but this book is complex and has such depth that the only way I could see a person disliking it would be because it was misunderstood  It s definitely worth a read  Or several     To be honest going in to this I didn t think i would be as engulfed  i like that word  in this book as i was  But as i read it i was looking back at myself as a teenage and even in to my late twenties present day   I was and still to a point am Holden Caulfeild  It was after i started that i couldn t put this book down by choice  I see why it is a recommended reading in some High schools  To be honest i don t think there is a person who ever went to high school that can t relate to someone in this story  I did like Allie esp the story about that baseball mitt  I will admit the story was kind of a downer in a lot of parts but that is what made it such an amazing read  that you get into is and i didn t let you go  I am now left with the feeling of curiosity  Like did Holden really grow from this experience or was it just a load of crap  All and all a page turner   I had to read this in high school and was actually excited to read  because not only was it so controversial but people seemed to have very definitive opinions on it  As the class began reading it we all seemed to like it then as the book went on people either hated it or got so uninterested in it they just wouldn t finish it  Personally I loved it  Being a self proclaimed realist I really could identify with Holden s antagonistic outlook on life  I also felt like a lot that happened in the book wasn t meant to just be that   It was meant to signify something  make you think deeper about life and innocence  I think Holden goes through what everyone once in their lifetime goes through  A reflection  a reflection on how easy life was as a child  how innocent we were and how life as an adult is dreary and full of worry and anger  And I completely agree with him  I really did love this book   What can I say about this book that hasn t been said a thousand times before  Well  this  actually I first read The Catcher in the Rye when I was in school  it might have been late elementary school  or it could have been junior high  In any case  it was in the late 1970s  And I believed that it was a contemporary book  Years later  I discovered that it had been published in 1951  That simply amazed me  Some of it certainly went over my head as a young teen  of course  I was fairly innocent back then  Now I get it  of course  But even now  in early middle age  I can t help but feel that Holden is a friend I see I m wandering into cliche One thing  I did find a book which is remarkably similar in tone to The Catcher in the Rye  It s fundamentally different  mind you  I certainly don t want to imply that there was plagiarism involved  Not at all   The Teddy Bear Habit  was written in the 1960s  is written for the 10 16 year old age group  roughly speaking   and includes a lot of humor as well as action and suspense  the hero has problems  but they re nowhere near as serious as Holden s  On the other hand  the book is set in Greenwich Village But something about the internal narration by young George Stable is so reminiscent of Holden s inner voice that in my memory I ve sometimes mixed the two together  So if you love The Catcher in the Rye  you may want to give The Teddy Bear Habit a try  See if you can pick up one of the older editions  illustrated by New Yorker illustrator Lorenz  they complement the text wonderfully  1950 s NYC phonies   2000 s NYC hipsters The Catcher in the RyeSalinger s  The Catcher in the Rye  is a coming of age novel that follows the cynical musings of sixteen year old  Holden Caulfield and his reluctance to enter an adult world full of  phonies  as he describes them  Having been my first encounter with this infamous classic I wasn t sure what to expect  Regrettably  I was never required to read this novel in high school  however  after experiencing it for the first time  it quickly became obvious to me why a private Christian school might not include this one in the curriculum  with the amount of cursing of course   Regardless of the language  which admittedly added to the humor of Holden s sarcasm   I found Salinger s story rich and full of important themes that surround the transition between adolescence and adulthood  At the core of this bildungsroman  Caulfield wears a mask of cynicism to display his frustration with the phoniness of an adult world while ironically hiding his own  phony  waywardness  Too often  more times then not  we  like Holden  are quick to point out the many faults of others while simultaneously oblivious to our own  As a result  we end up alienating ourselves from people because they don t live up to our individual standards  In the novel  Holden alienates himself as a means of self protection and unfortunately we never directly discover the source of why he is so troubled aside from the death of his brother Allie  As Holden is in the process of figuring out what life looks like growing up we discover a glimpse of his dream for the future and also the source of Salinger s title  Given the few careers his sister Phoebe rattles off including the possibility of become a scientist or a lawyer etc   he simply admits   I d just be the catcher in the rye   Salinger 173   Holden expresses his desire to catch the  thousands of little kids  and save their childhood innocence from the  phonies  of the adult world  Salinger 173   Yet interestingly enough  through Holden s cynicism and own naivety of the world before him  he himself is blinded by the complexities of adulthood  a stage of life we all  at some point  are on the path to discovering  Overall  I thoroughly enjoyed this story  I look forward to adding Salinger s Nine Stories in my reading repertoire too  What can I say about  The Catcher in the Rye   I m confused  How can words fathom what this book is  Can words give it justice   Catcher  has simply left me speechless  wordless and enlightened  I m sure millions like me felt like Holden  our hero   his voice  his actions  his sadness  his anger  his confusion is something all of us have felt when 16  I felt like I had written this diary and then someone published it  When your done with it  you ask yourself   how can something be so perfect  So true   it s unreal  What is it about  Well to me  it s acceptance  Accepting the world as it is and accepting that to be a part of it  you have to be what the world expects you to be  This of course is my subjectivity  Bottom line  just get it  Once in your lift time meet Holden Caulfield  trust me  you will never forget him  As a teenager  I was really struck by how relatable Holden was  He was relatable in a way that really no other teenaged protagonist I ve really ever read has been  I don t know how to explain it    but this is  truly  a classic  Sumerki uzhe

novel  Holden Caulfield  a seventeen year old prep school adolescent tells of his lonely  life changing twenty four hour stay in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of the adult world while attempting to deal with the death of his younger brother  and other life experiences  What I liked about the book was that while Holden s outlook on life was negative and blunt  it was still funny and strangely true even if we sometimes wouldn t want to admit it  I enjoyed laughing at his charismatic  and sarcastic attitude  and his thoughts of the events around him  This is a superbly written  no bull account of the life of an outcast teen  The Catcher in the Rye  in addition to entertaining  inspires to question our own existence and encourage ourselves to be better people through compassion and understanding of the human condition  This book is a must read  especially for teenagers  as you will find something in this novel that you can incorporate into your own personality  The Catcher in the Rye is an amazing novel  capturing the tedious and tenuous thoughts of a teenager amidst his transformation from boy to man  The meaning of innocence is explored through the protagonist s  Holden Caulfield  encounters as he stumbles through New York after being expelled from his boarding school  Holden s story is narrated in a way that allows the reader to become absorbed in both his present  past  and future of  catching in the rye   5 5 stars  one of the greatest novels of the 20th century  shyd wn Sdqt w bzrg nshdnh twy khlm nwysndh w shkhSyt Sly khtb zyd bh chshm byd lbth zbn

But I guess none of my thoughts ran parallel with his then yet  And that s why I did not understand him  Three years later  here  I read it again  It was the book I chose for psychoanalytic reading  I can t believe I missed a lot from my first reading  I found out I wasn t able to read the symbolic language  I only read the forms of words  I did not bother to go in deep  Since my close reading of The Catcher in the Rye  I realized that really  you can t truly appreciate a book without reflecting on what you ve read  You see  I m fond of jumping from one book to another without really reflecting on what I ve read  though  that was then  Anyways  Holden s death thoughts  worries  language and all  the loneliness and depression  too    Three years later in my rereading  I am finally able to empathize with Holden  My favorite book  I read this book every year or so  I love the way that Salinger writes  Holden is flawed  critically flawed  and is whining for relatively no reason  but that is what makes this so phenomenal  So many people don t want to grow up  Holden has become obsesively compulsive about it  This book takes what many people feel when they are young adults and takes it to the farthest edge of the spectrum which makes Holden a character that while you can identify with him  you can t identify completely with him  unless you are an assasin apparently   Salinger writes in a frantic pace giving you the feeling that Holden is truly telling the story  I will probably read this many more times in my life and will continue to enjoy it   Such a great one to read again as an adult   I loved this book as a teenager  I had a friend who was just like Holden  unfortunately  she killed herself  She loved this book too  Well  it was about her  rest in peace  Vera Although I deeply respect anyone who dislikes The Catcher in the Rye  because anyone has all the right to do so   I feel like I should defend my point of view when it comes to this book  It s not simply about a guy complaining the whole time about life for any reason whatsoever  Holden is far from the label of being a  rebel without a cause   and I feel that most people should read this book at least once  because it really exposes the angst and anxiety often experienced by young people who believe that they have no place in this world  The main point is that Holden is completely lost in his own existence  and since he can t find a proper way to relieve such feeling  he tends to blame the world around him for being unable to provide comfort  It is from this perception that Holden keeps a defensive and distrustful conduct towards adults  mainly those who occupy a position of respect  constantly described as  phonies   And of course  we must consider that the whole book has a symbolic approach  starting with Holden s name relation with the book title   Hold them    being all this catcher in the rye thing about Holden s fear of children losing their innocence and becoming just as lost as he believes he is  and his desire of stopping them from growing up  that s what the whole thing about  coming out from somewhere and catching them  is   In conclusion  Salinger s work must not be diminished  he still remains one of the best authors of his generation and The Catcher deserves immensely to be considered a classic  since it is able to sum up the terrible feeling experienced by a whole generation due to their historic background  and which is still felt by many youngsters  not only americans  until nowadays  It is superficial to consider the narrative to be only about a vain boy and his grumpy thoughts when  in reality  it is the exposition of a profile that deserves to be studied    Mi sentivo cosi maledettamente felice  tutt a un tratto  per come la vecchia Phoebe continuava a girare intorno intorno  Mi sentivo cosi maledettamente felice che per poco non mi misi a urlare  se proprio volete saperlo  Non so perche  Era solo che aveva un aria cosi maledettamente carina  lei  la che girava intorno intorno  col suo soprabito blu eccetera eccetera  Dio  peccato che non c eravate anche voi    El Guardian entre el Centeno es un libro especial    no se si solo es la edicion que consegui  que supongo es eso  o que si todas las ediciones que han salido de este libro son asi  pero la cosa es que no tiene sinopsis en la parte de atras  NO ES ASOMBROSO  Solo tiene ese extrano titulo con grandes letras y nada mas  es muy intrigante      Puesto que esto es una resena pues les hablare sobre que trata este libro  tranquilos que no les arruinare nada     La historia es narrada en primera persona por un INCREIBLE chico  Holden Caulfield  Quien nos cuenta lo que ocurrio en menos de una semana hace ya un tiempo en su vida  Comienza hablando del colegio al que asistia  Pencey  un internado solo para hombres  Por ciertas circunstancias queda expulsado  el Director planea avisarles a sus padres dias despues  lo que deja a Holden con mas de cinco dias libres para tranquilizarse y ver como le va con sus padres  pero el MARAVILLOSO chico decide salir del internado y NO ir a su casa  sino pasar unos dias de tranquilidad por Nueva York       En estos dias Holden se hara cientos de preguntas que pasan por la cabeza de todo joven  sexo  amistades  familia  futuro  madurar  chicas  chicos y el por que de vivir siendo el       Mi opinion    Probablemente no sea una historia llena de misterio  de hecho no lo es  jejeje   es la historia de un chico sorprendentemente fresco  la forma de narrar la historia es clara y sin trabas  tiene muchas ejemplificaciones  sarcasmos  PERO lo que mas interesa es la forma en la que te deja entrar en su mente al momento de hacer algo que probablemente no tiene una explicacion logica si lo ves de pasada SOLO tienes que ESCUCHAR a HOLDEN     Me he reido con este libro como no lo hacia desde hace mucho           El Guardian entre el Centeno fue publicado en 1952  y para la fecha que es hoy HOLDEN tiene una mente muy al siglo XXI         Su forma de pensar sobre las chicas es muy particular  deberia decir su forma de pensar de las MUJERES        Es un chico que logra insultar  de forma extrana  y al mismo tiempo agradar a la gente o ponerlos furiosos       Se pone histerico de momento  pero todo pasa en su mente  ESE CAPITULO 17 como lo ame        Te sientes identificado con sus inseguridades y preguntas        Su voz es completamente atrapante  gracias a su sencilla y peculiar personalidad           Hasta su descripcion fisica te habla de que Holden no es un bad boy personaje literario por el que todas mueren Holden es mas REAL y mas SINCERO que cualquier personaje del que haya leido su historia         Se le considera un CLASICO JUVENIL pero creo que toda persona deberia de leerlo en algun punto de su vida  ese momento en el que haces cientos de preguntas sin obtener respuestas y te frustras por ello como dice en una parte del libro  Lo que distingue al hombre inmaduro es que aspira a morir noblemente por una causa  mientras que el hombre maduro aspira a vivir humildemente por ella    No les huele esta frase bastante a Augustus Waters de Bajo la Misma Estrella escrito por John Green  A mi demasiado  tanto que siento que Augustus nacio de aqui      En cuanto a personajes secundarios me gustaria resaltar a PHOEBE  es la hermana pequena de Holden  y es una pequena INTELIGENTE  creo que las personas pequenas llegan a ser mas ASOMBROSAS que nosotros las personas grandes  Phoebe podria ser la unica persona que entiende a Holden y trata de sacarlo donde se encuentra          Por ultimo  cuando descubres el por que de ese intrigante TITULO te das una risa que no puedes parar         Un asombroso libro  con un personaje principal mas ASOMBROSODatos curiosos  Mark David Chapman  el asesino del musico y cantante John Lennon en 1980  llevaba una copia del Guardian entre el Centeno en el momento de su arresto         John Hinckley Jr  quien intento asesinar a Ronald Reagan en 1981 llego a mencionar que le gustaba  este libro en un grado que rayaba en la obsesion         Robert John Bardo llevaba el libro cuando visito el apartamento de Rebecca Lucile Schaeffer a quien asesino el julio 18 de 1989                Descubrimientos interesantes    El gran Gatsby  Unas frases                     Me dio muchisima pena haberle tomado el pelo  Hay personas a las que no se debe tomar el pelo  aunque se lo merezcan                                    Me la paso diciendo   encantado de haberte conocido   a personas que no me encanta nada conocer  Pero si quieres seguir vivo  tienes que decir esas cosas                                    Todo ese rollo de los dibujos del Saturday Evening Post en los que aparecen unos tios esperando en una esquina hechos unos demonios porque su pareja llega tarde es una tonteria  Si la chica esta guapa cuando llega   a quien le importa que llegue tarde  A nadie                                    Si haces algo demasiado bien  o te andas con cuidado  o con el tiempo empiezas a querer lucirte y entonces ya no eres tan bueno                                    Nueve de cada diez de los que lloran a lagrima viva por esas cosas tan falsas de las peliculas en el fondo son unos desalmados  En serio                                 Lo que distingue al hombre inmaduro es que aspira a morir noblemente por una causa  mientras que el hombre maduro aspira a vivir humildemente por ella          I have been accused of not understanding what this book is about because of my young age  Here s the thing     One of the points of this book is to try to understand and experiment no matter how old you are   When I finished this book I thought    It s a bit overrated    it took me another book to change my mind and that s Shoeless Joe  I don t now if you have read Shoeless Joe but the character in this book is so obsessed with J D Salinger that he goes to meet him and asks him questions about Holden  I didn t relate to Holden because I m not a rebel  because I m nothing like him  but the book is a piece of art  I actually read the book because Charlie in Perks of being a Wallflower recommended it  I started reading it the day I finished Perks  I noticed the similarity between Perks and Catcher in the Rye  I bet Stephen Chbosky intended to mimic J D Salinger s flowing kind of writing in his book  I don t have any further comments  I ll adjust this review later  D The thing about Catcher in the Rye is  I read it in high school   Of my own free will  btw  not as an assignment   And back then  I was like    meh But this time through  the whole time  I kept thinking this is the most amazing  voice   This is why people who write first person should be careful that their narrators voice is distinct and unique  Otherwise  you re failing even if telling a story from first person is easier   My book is third person  I m no Salinger  And then after I was done marveling over the voice  I was marveling over the thoughts  It isn t very often when I stop reading a book and think wow  that was a well done  thought  sentence  scene But J D  Salinger  I know your dead  I know you weren t cool with being famous  but I love this book I mean look at this  I gave her a look  She didn t look like any dope to me  She looked like she might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of  But you can t always tell with somebody s mother  I mean  Mothers are all slightly insane  Or this I don t want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something  just because we never necked or horsed around much  She wasn t  I held hands with her all the time  for instance  That doesn t sound like much  I realize  but she was terrific to hold hands with Or this I m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life  It s awful Don t those just snatch you in or ring true or make you want to keep on going  Do you care about the plot  All you really care about is whether or not Holden ever holds hands with Jane again and if Phoebe loves the record he got her and if he ever moves past his brother s death to become as wonderful as the spark of him shows  What s the plot  Who the heck cares  What you re reading is so lovely it just doesn t matter Do I recommend The Catcher in the Rye  Absolutely  In fact  I imagine I ll be reading it again shortly  BTW  John Green was right about The Great Gatsby too  If you like lit discussions  you should check out his show on youTube called Crash Course Literature  It was lovely  When I first began this book  I was told by my teacher at the time that I would either love Holden Caulfield or absolutely hate him  As I followed our main character on his journey through New York City  I found that she was right  Reading about his encounters with a young prostitute  an old teacher  and even a couple of nuns  his inability to deal with his brother s death and his love for his younger sister  I found myself sympathizing with him  So much so that by the end of the novel  when Holden has to force himself to cross each street he comes to because he fears disappearing  I felt as though my heart might break  Whether the reader finds themselves in the same position I am with Holden  or even if they find they can t stand him  none can argue that Salinger s ability to create a believable character isn t one of the highlights of this novel  Holden is deeply flawed  yet he has his high points too  Rather than the usual  cliched protagonist we are given  here we have a character who s odd mannerisms and quirks make him round and believable  even tangible   something every aspiring writer should aim to achieve with their characters   The Catcher in the Rye was an amazing novel by J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Rye is very interesting  and caught my attention when I first started reading  I was into the book which is very odd  because I am always a little bored when I start reading  then I get into it  I was very impressed  The Catcher in the Rye is about a seventeen year old gentleman  Holden Caufield who is at Penncey  a boys  dormitory  Holden Caufield has always had problems ex  kicked out of his last school  because he was annoyed with all the phonies so he didn t try hard at school  At times I was so frustrated with him  Why do care about the other people  try to ignore them if they annoy you  Although I felt bad for him  he sort of reminded me of my friend  he was always confused  or never knew where he would end up  Even those times when he did some really stupid things  I was always intrigued by him one way or another The Catcher in the Rye was real  it wasn t like everything is a fairy fairy tale and everything is perfect  yeah sure things will improve  but these things actually happen in life  There is underage drinking  cheating  and getting kicked out of school  In most books these subjects are hidden  and we pretend like we don t know that it happens  I really admired Holden even if he pissed me off at times  I loved how J D  Salinger wrote this book  My least favorite part was when Holden kept on saying he was going to call Jane or whatever her name was  My favorite part was when he went back to his house to see his sister Phoebe  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves classic novels  I rate this book 4 1 2 stars   Holden Caulfield  Born in 1934  the book got published in 1951  and Holden was 17 in it   admired even today  Had premature grey hair  but log onto any fandom website of his  and you ll find girls and women alike declaring that Holden s THE MAN for them  The question that arises is  why do people love Holden so much  Is it because he s an indefatigable extension of our teenage selves  Yes  I believe so  Which one of us has not felt lonely  utterly exhausted by the  grand phoniness  of the world around us  How many of us would like to be on our own just the way Holden was  just once  Generations have laughed with Holden  cursed Sally Hayes  wanted to meet Jane Gallagher just once  wished to read one of Phoebe s Hazel Weatherfield stories and DB s book and cried over Allie  We have all understood Holden s obsessive need to  know  just where do the goddam ducks in the lagoon go in winter  simply because most of us know the feeling of getting obsessed with something and trying to find the answer to it  Salinger s novel has touched teenagers the way few other books have  simply because he wrote about us  the way we re children even though some of us may look grown up  Holden is not just a character  he s an embodiment of adolescent angst  which has not changed much since the 1950 s and will probably never change much  People identify themselves in Holden  and that is probably the only triumph of a good story  that people look at printed characters  and see themselves  Long live the spirit of Holden  Long live the spirit of renouncing all things phony and grand  Long live the spirit of JD Salinger  who never even gave his fans a chance to feel some form of goodbye  Jan 1997 first read  Started reading at work the other day because it s been on my mind  Even before Mark said I am like Holden Caulfield in that I hate movies  Then he said   This fall I think you re riding for   it s a special kind of fall  a horrible kind  The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling  The whole arrangement s designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with  Or they thought their own environment couldn t supply them with  SO they gave up looking  They gave it up before they ever really even got started  You follow me   p  187     Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even  sickened  by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them    if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry p  189 I believe that to really appreaciate this book you must read it when you re a teenager  That s exactly what I did  and I will love it for the rest of my life  I was 13 when Holden first spoke to me  about me and for me  He was saying the things that I didn t even know I wanted to say  He was perfectly articulating my feeling lost  lonely and aggravated for no apparent reason  I know that people are irritated with the fact that Holden complains A LOT about everything and everyone  but hey  that s what teenagers do  I remember myself when I was that age  nothing pleased me  Well  some things did  but there were many more things that made me angry  And sure enough  almost everyone around me seemed like a phony  Almost everyone  So yeah  I get where Holden s coming from  a 100 percent Also  for those who complain about the plot  or lack thereof  I think that some books are about the plot  and some books are about the feeling  And this is pretty much the ultimate feeling book  Again  relate this to your life  Do you always need epic events to go through an erray of feelings  No  The world can stand perfectly still  and you ll be swept up in a roller coaster of emotions  And if described well  this roller coaster could be worth any epic physical journey  Salinger does an amazing job creating that journey for Holden and the readers I love this book  Holden got me like no one else  and I will be coming back to this book again and again  for sure  Beatrice EdmondsEnglishBlock 8This was  hands down  the most influential book I have read in my life  I ve never read a novel that changed the way I viewed things  but The Catcher in the Rye did  Holden Caulfield takes you through just a few days in his life  after having been kicked out of boarding school  but in those few days you get know him like an old friend  There is no structured plot  you just see the world through someone else s eyes for a while  Holden s strong voice is what made the novel so outstanding  Although he is in no way pedantic  he is clearly brilliant in his own way  Holden has been through hardships and it becomes apparent that they have impacted him and caused him to walk through life in his own world  where nothing seems to matter and nearly everything has a negative spin  However  in my opinion  we are all a bit like Holden  in a sense that we don t agree with a lot of what society influences us to do  Despite this  it is still amusing to see the small things that bring joy to Holden  like children s note books and ducks on a pond  The aspect of Holden s complicated  and often warped  thought process is how well he knows himself  He knows exactly what  kills him   and what he thinks is  phony   and that was what most influenced the impact that the book had on me  Now  I find myself thinking about my own  and other people s actions  with an analytical eye  On a lighter note  the books touches on many teenage dilemmas including school  sex and friendship  The author managed to create a story that is both complex and simple at the same time  making The Catcher in the Rye a must read   I hate Holden Caufield  I love Holden Cuafield  This novel is a piece of shit  This novel is piece of art  It is an on going debate since the book was released  At the end of the day who cares  The Catcher in the Rye is one of this work of fiction which is too personal  you re either hooked or you re not This is my second time reading it  I remembered loving it but I had a sort vague or difficult idea about what exactly made me love it I m still quite uncertain  but I have some ideas sorted out  The Catcher in the Rye touches me beyond words  irony huh    The portrayal of this teenager wandering is touching  is honest  I made the connection easily  Everything he says have such truth to it  it is overwhelming I loved the conversational tone  as if a friend were talking to you  telling you about all those crazy things that happened to him I didn t remembered it being so funny  so it pleasantly surprised me  Sarcasms  irony  blase attitude prevail but it is not  absolutely not the essence of this novel  I just loved this  And I loved reading the reviews of all the other Goodreaders out there  It was rich  It really was  Although this would be THE place to not have to name my absolute favorite book  I can confidently say that this is my flat out favorite read  and has been for years  It makes me laugh  It makes me wish I could read 10 000 more books just like it and at the same time it is so satisfying I was scared  at first  to read anything else by J D  Salinger  It illustrates growing up  emerging from adolesence   finding oneself  amidst the most awkward years possible an optimistic yet genuine way  What I learned from this book is how it feels  upon finishing a book  to know in your heart that it is your favorite book and sometimes not be able to explain why  The best way I know how to explain  ironically enough  is to steal a line from Holden himself   that I really wish this author were my best friend and I could call him up whenever I liked  I think we really would get along   Simply a masterpiece  I don t quite see why people dislike this book so much  but what I have seemed to pick up is that people don t like it because all Holden  a 17 year old boy may I add   complains   Umm  no  Holden is not a complainer  he merely see s society in its bare skin  He takes every flaw and every little thing wrong with society and his puts in your face  And that   that is why I think people REALLY dislike this book   because everything Holden mentions about society and people is true  Salinger took what may very well be his opinion on things and used a teenager  on the verge of losing it because of his very analytic mind  and made him this person who saw things for what they were  This CLASSIC will forever remain relevant to whatever day or month  or year  This book  in my opinion  will always be a symbol and a reminder that  the world ostracizes people who know their dirty little secrets and lies and they treat them like garbage  and they let all of the phonies into their phony little lives  Let this book live on to prove that there might still be hope for humanity and what our current society is becoming   it s the thing i d save if i could only save one thing if my apartment were to burn down   Not much of a story in it  So  if you re probably going for a smooth story  this one isn t for you What I do admire is the writing style and the short disjoint stories  Especially the line  Maybe I should give old Jane a buzz   In fact  some people who weren t directly represented in the story are sometimes the most expressive Loved Sally s role and the darling kid sister Phoebe What I would want changed in the story is the title  but I just can t think of anything better right now  I would like to say this is a gracious  appealing stuff I have ever read  I love it  Excited and charming tone narrated by his major character s soul  which is  in my opinion  an egoist and a stranger to his world he has lived for quite a long time  But I like him  though  He is a sort of persons I have been  and still am  a sort of complex features  lacking of communication skill  pleasure in my created own world  sort of strange mind that few people hard to understand  attractive by literature  imagination  musics and films  although Holden Caulfield would not love films as much  I admit that   and so forth  Fortunately  I read it  I bet this is the one I love for all time One stuff I wish to criticize is that an attitude of education the author discusses in his novel through Holden s former teacher s speech  for which I am quite sure that Salinger estimates the value of education system too extraordinarily well  We have to consider that education in any state system is not really good at making human haman being  or conscious of cosmopolitanism  but a competitive  unimaginative  short sighted  aggressive labour  I did not blame that everyone is it  but it strongly infleunces  I do not want you all regard that you or your kids have to quit of schools or something like that  I just want you to consider  always consider  that our education systems in modern states is been set to train our pupils  as well as me myself  for becoming state workers in the future  Studying in this sense is not a process  but a substantial  It does not give you a whole damn connected knowlegde  but a cutting  It is  for instance  very funny to hear ones reading Foucault without considering his influences such as Nietzsche or Max Weber  I mean  you don t care anything where and how Foucault got and shaped his ideas before his lecturing or pulishing his goddamn great books  Moreover  some students do not care for reading Foucault s original texts to achieve their theses  but secondary texts which one produced for suggesting his view of interpretating Foucault  It usually occurs in my faculty s master s degree  How funny it is  but it also sad  Generally  if education system is set to prepare labours  it is difficult to go far of making pets  You know  I mean pets  licking boss  pants  giving hands whenever you order  saying  yes  for everthing and bhlabhlabhla  System makes untalented banals  not a creatives or philosophers   in other word  lovers of knowledge  Contrast with Holden s old teacher  literature and knowledge are strong not because of high literacy  but of imagination  enthusiasticism and open mind  of which education system gets rid  Love of learning is a long process to establish  not originating by forcing ones to do  this  but don t do  that   In Thailand  my most beloved like ass country    beg your pardon  you blind nationalists    no one can speak English because of studying in education system  it makes you ashamed like a hell bastard to talk to foreigners  imposing studying grammar for exams   but the result is likely the worst  you bet   as well as music and art  system does not concern of those stuffs and makes everything worse by forcing kids to do  whether they like it or not   Oh  my son  you can not do it  so you a shit fucking guy  stupid one   I said that  yes  I did  I am an out from hell phony  I hate goddamn education system and all those bitches old and outdated minded like dinosaur and that closed social condition Of course  that only matter I want to complain  but most of all delight me  as I told you before  I think the author brilliantly titled his book  The Catcher in the Rye   What a cool name  From my perspective  it is suitable for what is the author talking about and indicates Holden s and all of adolescents  present life and future they are expected to see and face whether they like it or not  It is a time of confusion  lonesome and loss  Holden wants to play hide and seek with children in the rye  where you can not see anything  but rye  right or left  back or fourth  there growing around is rye blowing along the wind  Children hide  you a seeker try hard to seek where they are  It is a scary game  isn t it  You don t know where they are  All you know is they hang around  silently  breathlessly  praying to God you can not see anyone on your sight  The catcher in the rye as you are is a person with destiny  but your last destination has never come  it is too far distance to reach or be in sight  And you can be lost in the rye  You seek  seek and seek  The result is a bare cup  It is a fantastic game if the catcher is a tireless player    also never be bored  but how long and weight of frustration  hollow and boredom laid on one s shoulder one can overcome before been smashed into piece  Adolescents as Holden are impossible to prevent this circumstace to happen  Everyone have to confront with it once or twice or more in this life  A kind of this book show us a little part    but so important    of our lifes someone probably forgetting when coming an old age  Although it is considered as a novel  cynical  view of life  a novel is powerful in scarscm  humourous narrative that bring me smile almost of pages I passed   My first impression when I started reading this was that the antagonist is kind of an ass and ill be honest  that didn t change as I read  What changed was me  Rather than Holden growing on me  I started to dislike my own teenaged insecurities and judgmental attitude  He really doesn t grow on you because that s just not realistic  I fully respect this novel because it is completely unforgiving and it shines a bright and unflattering light on the soul  I left this experience feeling deadly glad that I am no longer a teenager  sympathetic with the teens I know and desperately sorry for the adults that I know who have never quite overcome that morbid self obsessed vanity the plagues the young adults  What an inspired piece of literature   Definitely in my top five best books of all time  Its one of those books that make me want to be a writer with all my heart  Book that change lives I really can t say how much this book had an affect on me  Honestly saying  this is for sure one of the greatest novels ever written    Book that completely transformed my life  my views of the world and my sense of being  Salinger s alter ego  Holden Caulfield  is perhaps one of the loneliest characters in history  but his rare genius is what separates him from the environment  He understands silliness and stupidity around him  but he can t do nothing about it  And maybe is this the reason why so much people can identified themselves with him    Because after all  we are not so different from each other So  go to some bookstore and by this book  You will not regret it If you like my reviews  you can follow me clicking the button   Follow Reviews  on my profile   In The Catcher in the Rye a major theme is conflict  The main character  Holden Caulfield  believes he is superior and therefore produced conflict with other human interaction and himself  which also leads to alienation  Holden s alienation serves as protection due to the fact that he uses his superiority to push away human interactions which in truth  he can t handle  Therefore he lacks  social skills  and may not know how to speak to people and the way he strives to be alone  he runs into many conflicts throughout the book This first quote is a conversation between Holden and Sunny  the prostitute that he ordered and in this conversation it becomes clear that Holden is just looking for an argument and found someone who he can pay to listen    Do you mind cutting that out   I said   I m not in the mood  I just told you  I just had an operation    Listen  she said   I was sleepin  when that crazy Maurice woke me up  If you think I m    I said I d pay you for coming and all  I really will  I have plenty of dough  It s just that I m practically just recovering from a very serious    97 It is evident that Holden is trying to find someone to talk to but in the end ends up insulting the person and making a mess of what was supposed to be a normal booty call  And therefore showing that this is one of the many ways that he clashes with himself  and that is what the conflict has done to him  I read this  I think when I was sixteen or seventeen  I had heard about it as a story of a teenager acting like a teenager and was curious as to how literature framed that  I was severely disappointed  I found Holden annoying  I didn t understand any of his anger or why he felt entitled to whine about the things that he did  Up until that point  indeed  up until I was in my early 20 s  I hadn t really experienced anger  at least  not in the way that it s portrayed in books and movies  Sure  I had big feelings  but I wasn t particularly pissy about anything  when I didn t want to go to school anymore I graduated early  when I didn t like a job I quit it  when I didn t like my friends I found new ones  I didn t mope around town crying to my rich ass friends about it  I thought  except I did  but I used different language   Cue a week or so ago when  Catcher  was out on display at the library and I grabbed it  and I m so glad that I did  I don t interpret Holden as a teen anymore  he reads like an adult who sees and hates the bullshit but hasn t learned the social graces to pretend otherwise  He s still a shitty teen boy  but there s the spark of earnestness to the character that makes him so relatable  He knows he s a fuck up  and he wishes he wasn t  but he s so driven by his dislike of the world that he doesn t give himself any other choice  I understand that now  I understand the desire to stand in the middle of everything and talk about how lousy it is  helloooo internet  and I get Holden s desire to just run away from it and try to find something small and beautiful apart from all the bullshit  I totally get it   I absolutely loved this book  I read it when I was 22  and wished someone had given it me to read when I was 16  I love the way J  D  Salinger writes  and the whole feeling of alienation in this book is something that I imagine most poeple can connect with  and that most teenagers should be given to read   someone else felt like you do now  This quote is one of the ones that really stood out for me  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behaviour  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them   if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry    J D  Salinger  The Catcher in the Rye  Chapter 24  spoken by the character Mr  Antolini I must have been too young the first time I read it  It was a smart ass book and I liked it  The disadvantage of being able to read above grade level is you can read things you don t have the capacity to understand Rereading it now  as a teacher  I am seeing it from a different perspective  The two teachers Holden visits were particularly interesting  I hope someone will give me a kick in the rear every time  just before I decide to give my students advise  Of course  I ll do it anyway  but maybe I won t be preachy about it  I  also  think that having more knowledge of psychology and more experience with real life crazy people  some permanently  and some not  ruined the book a little bit for me  You re supposed to think about Holden  but not go comparing him like that  It will be good to find out what my students think about the book  The first reading of a good book should be special  like a first love  You may change your mind later  but you don t forget how it felt the first time  Where do the ducks go   I had been meaning to read this for some time and am glad I finally have done so  The writing is finely observed and insightful  It could have been over   stylised  if not a little caricatured on the subject of teenage angst  but it avoided that  It is subtle  honest and a very moving and thoughtful account of a young man s mental illness There are moments in the book that stilled me  the sense that he might disappear as he crosses the street  his sister reaching for the ring on the carousel  his idea of becoming a deaf mute  and many others    I found these beautifully crafted and without sentimentality Many reviewers say they just wanted to shake him  Whilst I know what they mean  I think that this misses the point  Shaking him out of his depression won t be effective  his condition is not self indulgent teenage angst  it goes far deeper than that Stylistically  it feels a little dated now but it s core narrative overcame that for me  I wish I was re read ing it now  having read it for the first time many years ago  I would have liked to hear again how my younger self would have reacted  I think it would have spoken very immediately to me  The first book I read that actually made me think   and got me hooked on literature  Thank you J D  Salinger for giving us one of the most identifiable characters in all literature  and thank you Holden for teaching me a thing or two   I stumbled upon this book by coincidence as a adolescent  around Holden s same age I really did  If you really want to know the truth  this is a terrific book  it really is  The Catcher in the Rye is a must read  that is if you are not terribly worried about growing up  J D  Salinger made Holden unbelievably relatable to teens  Holden  like most teenagers  tries to escape the real world to escape problems like schoolwork or pesky parents that don t actually care about him  but he could never find the right place due to one thing    the occasional graffiti that he ties to the real world   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is   but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  F    you      pg  204  I believe Salinger is implying to not only teenagers  but to everyone no matter what you can t escape your problems without causing more to happen  there are no loopholes in life  not even death because their passed on to someone who truly cared about you even if you didn t know it yourself  This just one example how Holden Caulfield is more then a normal teenager   I really enjoyed this book and do believe that it is the best  coming of age  novel ever  I believe the overall message of the book was revealed near the end when Holden Caulfield  the narrator  was talking with his former teacher  Mr  Antolini  and he teaches Holden the importance of applying oneself in their education  A quote I like from this little lesson goes as follows   Something else an academic education will do for you    it ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have  What it ll fit and  maybe  what it won t  After a while  you ll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing   I think we all have a little bit of  Holden Caulfields  in us   I know I do   If you like books that talk to you like the voice in your head  this is quite  THE  thing  It keeps on flowing at it s own constant pace  and then you realize it s over  If you re about 20       and have a kid sister  the book will all together be a different ball game out of personal experience   Some book   Those who has read J D  Salinger s New Yorker stories  particularly   A Perfect Day for Bananafish      Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut      The Laughing Man   and   For Esme With Love and Squalor     will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is fully of children   The hero narrator in    The Catcher in the Rye    is an ancient child of sixteen  a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield  There are many voices in this novel  children s voices  adult voices  underground voices but Holden s voice is the most eloquent of all  Transcending his own vernacular  yet remaining marvelously faithful to it  he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure  However  like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders  he keeps most of the pain to  and for  himself  The pleasure he gives away  or sets aside  with all his heart  It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep I was a very avid reader  By age ten I was reading books bigger than my parents had read  books that were so much above my grade level I was scared to read them in class  I asked my dad one day   What is your favorite book   He replied with The Catcher In The Rye  One summer day when I was eleven I read it and finished in two hours and cried  I had never read a piece of literature so astonishing and I never will  Many people said I couldn t get the full potential of this novel since I was just a kid  those were my phonies  The Catcher In The Rye changed my life   This is my all time favourite book  it s funny  witty  smart and enticing and the book has sentimental value to me I absolutely love this book and recommend to everyone  In the cerebral book The Catcher in the Rye readers learn that coming of age can be a challenge  sometimes people want to avoid these challenges and childishly play  but one s true attitude is shown when all the doors in life close  The Catcher in the Rye by J  D  SalingerHolden Caulfield  the protag  discusses his journey out of Pencey and living around New York for three days before going home That s really all anyone knows about the story  Sure  there s a lot of crap that happens to Holden in those three days and the many days before them  but no one is ever really sure what it is about  That s what made it so great  I didn t feel like there was an overall  moral  in the story  but millions of little ones from things Holden said and what people said to Holden People are always speaking of Holden Caulfield as this depressed emo kid  but he s so much more than that  Yes  he s depressed  but he s also smart in his own rights  caring  confused  angsty  strange  Holden is in all of us  We all say stupid things that we don t mean  think one thing about people and decide to do something other with them I love the way it was written  and Holden s voice  It s very real and it s not like J D   or doesn t feel like  was writing the story for a purpose or trying to be high and mighty with morals and such It s probably one of the only older boks I ve really enjoyed  thus far  I loved this book  It is one possibly my favorite I ve ever read  I just felt as though I could deeply relate to the main character s loneliness  cynicism  and idealism  I think this is a classic story about a sad  angry teenager  In all his cynicism  he just wants people to be good  But it won t happen  And it makes him lonely and depressed  as he often says  This book broke my heart several times  If you re lonely and have lost your faith in this world  then you must read this  that this book was realy good  alot of action  and emotional scenes but the artist described the main character and subjects realy well  The main parts in the book is when holden fall in loves with jane and when they were playing chess jane was upset and holden was there for her another intresting part in this book is when holden is at the hotel and meetes a pimp name malcom  they started talkng and then he gave holden a prostitute and she went to holdens room       akward moment becaus eall they did was sit there and talked he didnt kno what to do  when i read that part i started to laugh realy hard but i recomend this book to any one who likes a funny  emotional kind of stories   If this is what classic literature is  I have no idea how any modern author can hope to achieve a classic status  This guy s writing is so superior to everything I ve read so far  even  Brave New World   that I think trying to align one s writing genius with his is the impossible task It s like what Dan Rather said when he took over Walter Cronkite s position as news anchor  Some shoes will never be filled  You can only carve your own pair and hope they fit you as well as his fit him  It was something like that but I ll admit that  after all these years  I don t remember his exact words  However  the meaning was crystal clear He wasn t going to try to fill Walter Cronkite s shoes b c he believed it impossible Half the things people who don t like this book complain about still go on in the New York City of today  Lots of New Yorkers are called cynical where I just call them honest  I know this is true  b c I have a really good friend who was born and raised his whole life in New York City  He lived in a really rough neighborhood for the first 20 years of his life He uses cuss words in regular conversation  not connected to any name calling or venting of frustration  He ll say something like  I just have to put on my goddam shoes  then we ll leave  Of course he s usually in a casual setting when he talks like that  like at his house  but my point is he uses words other people would consider profane and assume he s cynical for it when he doesn t mean exactly what they re making of it And lots of people in New York are phonier than AT T  which you either like or hate  My friend  like the guy in the book  hates and refuses to be part of it if he doesn t strictly have to do so  He s a broker for a living  and he says he can t always avoid it at work but  in general he hates it One thing about him  anyway  You ll never wonder what he thinks of you  And  after living with people who would lie about what they ate for breakfast  I prefer the average New Yorker s style  As long as they don t call me names  and he never has  He thinks I talk too much sometimes  everybody I meet forms that opinion sooner or later  but he usually likes me  What he says when I m talking to much is funny  Something about stifling it  Holden Caulfield  in  The Catcher in the Rye   is one of those characters that is found to be immature if not understood properly  To me  Holden is one of those characters I will never be able to forget because he is the embodiment of each teenager  lost in the fear of losing himself  his childhood innocence and in fact  he refuses to enter into the  phony  world he has to be part of  J D Salinger was able to recreate that fear  the characteristics typical of the childhood which none of us should lose  The novel is narrated in the constant prose of Holden  which emphasize his peculiar personality but sometimes  it is an obstacle for the reader To me  his prose is what kept me constantly engaged with the character because being in direct contact with with a character  with this kind of intimacy is a pure and extraordinary gift and that is why I was able to connect deeply with Holden  His rejection to deal with the  real world  shows him almost as a rebel but he soon contradicts himself with his fear and his kindness  The latter is emphasized through the different episodes of the novel  as for example the note to Mr Spencer and the componiment for Stradlater  while his need to love and be loved appear to be one of the mainly aspects of Holden s personality  The feeling of protection he feels towards Jane  the love that connects him to her are only the smallest examples in the book  Old Phoebe and Allie are instead what makes Holden special  their love the reason he decide to stay home  Holden  to me  is just a lonely  lost and sad boy  who tries to protect her sister and himself from the loss of innocence A masterpiece A magical novel   This book is the first YA American novel that I have ever read  I was still in China then  being forced to go to high school everyday and having no goal for future life  Like our protagonist  I thought high school can not be worse as your teachers and parents keep telling you to study hard and become a lawyer or doctor when you grow up  as if every student is as identical as industrial products in assembly line  I love the book because I sort of feel the same way as the protagonist  We both urgently need a enlightening instructor to protect us from getting lost our best ages  to tell us what s worthy for us to pursue and what are just bullshit I learnt loads of curse words in this book lol   Fortunately  Caulfield knows what he always wants in the end  he wants to return to his simplicity and innocence  he hates the sordid and vulgar adult society of that era  I was jealous of him because I had no guts to hew out my own way of living  a utterly different life idea from those implanted by parents  If I can turn back the clock  I would definitely choose another dangerous  but more adventurous life   The catcher in the rye is A fiction novel  about Holden caulfield A young man who decides to fail all his classes except english and leaves his school Pencey Prep because  The school is filled with phonies and jerks   168   He spends his time in bars and hotels  he his depressed and does not know why  And I was feeling depressed all of the sudden and I didn t know why  170   His attitude towards life was clear on how he felt towards the end of the story  He always finds something to complain about  He becomes the black sheep in his family and he does not seem to care  He is annoyed with everyone except his sister phoebe and his diceased brother Allie  Who he mentions alot in the story   My brother Allie I ll tell you the crazy red hair he had   38   You know what I like to do  I like to think about Allie    171 Holden is A very interesting and has many intersting character traits  I really like this book  One of the main reasons why I like it so much is Holden is such A unique character it is kind of amazing and I think this book would relate well to teenagers and young adults to there lives  Holden is witty and sarcastic  Phoebe is smart and sweet and alone is one interesting character  If you are looking for witty well written book by one of the most famous authors of all time I would read this one as soon as possible   Seorang anak muda bernama Holden Caulfield yang selalu memandang negatif terhadap apa pun  harus rela pulang dari sekolah ternama karena ia dikeluarkan  Ia sangat takut dengan bagaimana reaksi kedua orang tuanya mengingat ini bukan kali pertama ia dikeluarkan dari sekolah  Ia tidak berniat pulang tepat waktu dan memilih melakukan petualangan tentang hiruk pikuk dunia kelam sebelum ia pulang Novel amarah anak muda ini layaknya sebuah novel yang ditulis penuh emosi dan tensinya teratur dan tidak terlalu tergesa gesa  Di dalamnya  J D  Salinger mengeksplorasi kebencian kebencian Holden atas dunia di sekitarnya dan menghadapi semuanya dengan pesimisme dan negativisme  Tidak ada yang baik menurutnya  Dari awal sudah kelihatan bagaimana karakter si tokoh utama digambarkan  yaitu liar  tetapi lambat laun menuju akhir  karakter utama digambarkan lebih lunak dan baik hati Cara pandang tokoh utama menjadi yang menarik dalam novel ini  tetapi cara pandang tersebut malah menjebak novel ini menjadi tidak fokus pada si tokoh utama  melainkan melantur ke mana mana  walaupun sedikit berhubungan  Berbagai persoalan mengenai dunia sekolah dan segala macam yang berhubungan dengan itu layaknya menjadi sebuah kritik yang cerdas  Tak hanya itu  selain masalah sekolah  masih banyak masalah yang diungkapkan  seperti masalah keluarga  Hubungan persaudaraan menjadi penutup yang manis untuk novel ini  Love him or hate him  Holden is a fantastic character  This is one of those  classics  that I always meant to read but somehow didn t  So glad I finally made the effort  The writing is just wonderful   you really do  hear  the character  and its use of repetitions is just fantastic  The fact this is just a 48hour period in Holden s life is also a neat device  So nothing happens  So what  Very rare I want to read a book again after I have finished it  but this is one of those  Why did I wait so long until I r rad it    The Catcher in the Rye   by J D Salinger in 1951 is a novel about a teenager that is trying to come to terms with real life  Holden Caulfield has recently gotten kicked out of his latest school  Pencey Prep  He decides to go to New York and while there he has adventures that bring reality crashing down on him  Salinger writes Holden as a bitter teenager that holds angst towards life until he starts to get with reality  The story is written in a way that is relatable to the real world  Brings up sex  alcohol  nightclubs and profanity  Holden makes straightforward statements about everything that he sees wrong with people and society  Stating that the world is full of crooks  phonies and fakes   Pencey was full of crooks   Uses many repetitions  slang  profanity and emphasis throughout the entire story  The Catcher in the Rye was a book worth reading  It s a fascinating read when you discover what Holden see s himself as at the end  You realize near the end how he views reality adult life  and how cruel the world is  Hace muchos anos que me debia la lectura de este libro  Y la espera valio la pena  tanto que las ultimas paginas las dosificaba por semana para que nunca terminara  Creo que es de esos libros que  una vez leido  siempre lo llevas en tu cabeza   Such a fun retread  Originally read it in high school in the sixties and just read it again for my book club  Gotta admit I didn t love it as much this time around but then when I started poking around themes and quotes it sort of came back to me  What a timeless classic that could appeal to a girl from years ago as much as it impacts kids today  Very enjoyable and nostalgic for me   I m quite ashamed that I m seventeen and only now reading this Who would have thought that there was a classic that perfectly describes what being a teenager is like I read in one of the reviews that for this book you either identify with Holden or you don t  I certainly did  although I got through about 80  of the book before I realized how much of Holden I see in myself   I think that speaks to Mr  Antolini s lecture to Holden how a man who is falling isn t supposed to know when he reaches rock bottom Regardless of feelings  or lack thereof  of familiarity readers might feel with Holden s character  the themes of this book are indisputable  Holden s struggles undeniable  While I don t think there is necessarily a moral of the book  I think Salinger s main purpose in writing this novel was just to communicate how nonsensical the world seems to a teen who s lost his way  how lonely he feels  and his fears and staying thoughts  The book in a whole is a statement  I think  so powerfully said  so as to resonate in our inner selves and make us more aware of the side of us that we keep hidden from the world   I don t know how to end this review so I ll just leave it at that  lHrs fy Hql lshwfn   slnjrtrjm    Glb hls   dr lmd lrwy  bmjmlh t khdh shkl lmwnwlwj ldkhly l Hdth  dyd  ymr bh bTl lrwy  whw mrhq fy sn lsds   shr  ndm ytm Trdh mn lmdrs  b d Hlt Trdmtkrr

myself to Holden  the protagonist of the story  as much as i understand him  I love the fact that the entire book is set on a flashback of Holden s experiences after getting kicked out of his former school  One of my favorite things about this novel is Holden s attitude towards things  He always seems to find the negatives in every situation  Holden could be an incredibly smart guy if he took the time for it  Salinger found away to make his characters interact with the reader  It is as if i actually knew Holden  I know Holden s reactions and feelings towards everything  Holden is a very troubled and depressive teenager  I imagine that he is this way due to his brother Allie passing away  Although Holden seems very depressive if i actually knew him he d be a person i really cared for  I truly enjoyed reading how Holden found everyone to be a phony  Without all the cursing it wouldn t make Holden who he is  The same way with his way of thinking  It makes him the interesting character that he is  I m glad Salinger wrote about Holden the way he did  I would not change anything about how he wrote this book  This is one of the few books i could read repeatedly without getting tired of it  I would highly recommend reading The Catcher in the Rye   Dear Holden Caulfied  My old friend There was a time in my life when you inspired me to be exactly the person I wanted to be  others be damned  You taught me to look past the  phonies  and the  wannabe s  and to embrace life in the moment  Many years have past since we first met  I m older and wiser and now looking back I realize that you were simply an angsty teenager with a dirty mouth  a penchant for trouble  and a premature vision of the world  In a lot of ways though  so was I  and you were my luminary  Thank you                                                 Reading this book as an adult was a complete and utterly different experience from when I first read it at 17  The first time I read The Catcher in the Rye it blew me away  I couldn t believe that books like this even existed  Now that I m 26  and I ve read  in my opinion  a lot of really magnificent literature  Catcher in the Rye is just meh  It s very incredibly good  don t get me wrong  but it s a book that s best read as an angsty teen or very young adult  It will always have a special place in my heart  but let s just say I m glad I read it at the right time in my life  Granted this book has a lot of swearing  I mean A LOT of it  But holden caulfield seems to be a very ordinary and well thought out character  He thinks about what is most important in his life  I immeaduately liked the guy with the character having been 15 when i read it  I only wish people at school were a bit more like him   minus the swearing of course  He doesnt think about what hes doing  He beats people up when in a bout of rage  but he also contemplates whats meaningful and genuine  Not many people do the same  Hes rough around the edges and needs some serious descipline but hes not mean or melicious or at least intending to be   which is more then what most can say  A very thoughtfully written book  My English teacher says the concepts become much clearer and you discover something new each time you re read the book  so I do intend to re read it  At first  it may seem that Holden just always complains about life a lot  But Salinger writes in a way that makes Holden tell this story  You can really relate to Holden  in the ways that this is written  This book opens up some themes such as innocence of the youth  That is one theme I really picked up on when reading this book  It seems really emphasized in Holden s actions and thoughts about certain subjects  And though Holden can be what some people may say is a jerk failure  he thinks in ways others may not  He is in a way smarter than many of the characters  because he does not cave in to what the public may think of him  His actions are natural and do not have much thought put into him other than what he believes is the right choice  Over time  you start to sort of understand why Holden is the way he is and not judge his beliefs and choices as you would have at first  This was a great book  which J D  Salinger has written very well   While I was reading  The Catcher in the Rye   all I could help thinking was to wonder why I ever stopped running around catching dragonflies in the dry grass in summers  I used to do that when I was very young  I had no reason why I was fascinated by the dragonflies  but that did not stop me from feeling amused whenever I spotted one  I was entertained by almost everything around me  I still cannot discern how I dropped from that stage to now  It seems so long since I have taken pleasure in doing something so inane and not regretting it later  I had had half the people in my life of what Holden had  but still then I used to have problem with them  Maybe everyone at one point of extreme lethargy and apathy would want to leave the civilization and run for the forest with a river and mountains  However impossible it may seem  one always wants a reason not to run away from normalcy and monotony  Despite searching for a reason  one does not want to give oneself the rationale  It would be betrayal by the mind  Holden starts talking of his expulsion from the school and his teacher  but I must confess I had qualms about finishing the book with a satisfaction of reading a classic  I was wrong  now I realize  It was entertaining  lazy and funny  It really was  I was annoyed by his repetitive usage of words and ending a sentence with  anything  like he was bored of talking  Like teenagers do  He reminds every one of their teenage days or days spent contemplating about deepest issues of life like people  education  world peace and life itself  He describes everything in detail but with unconcernedly which makes anyone annoyed initially  but we will relate to him as we go  He is not doing that on purpose  he is like that  He is depressing  but we cannot hate him  He is funny and obvious  This book has got no great language or a steady plot  but it is a classic  Sometimes it is hard to explain why a book is a good one and a classic  It just is classic because it is simple  I do not know whether I like or dislike Holden  I am ambivalent about him  Actually  I am ambivalent about the period in a person s life when life seems so difficult while easy to others who have been through it sometime before  Simply teenage  There would be thousands of opinions and thoughts sprouting every minute  we cannot keep up with our brain  It is so hard and often is messed up  Suffering with conflicting opinions which are completely incompatible and quite often highly possible of being right at the same time is one of the symptom  I think  At least it was for me  I lie oftentimes without even being aware of that  I do not have a reason for concealing my identity  Like Holden does when he meets Morrow s mother  Some things are hard to explain  like why he loves the company of the nuns or why he misses Stradlater  Ackley  Thus  it is very annoying to have a take on this book  It is so damn true everything of what he talks  This is entertaining in a lazy kind of way while we graze on so many nuances of a teen life  Holden is intelligent and lonely  He has these beautiful doubts about the ducks in the lake  I mean  when did we stop wondering about things so ridiculously small and silly  They made so much sense when everything was young  colorful and leisurely  I am very sure that Holden kept flunking to keep his childhood alive unrelentingly even when he knew it was a futile attempt  I feel bad about how compassionate he is  He is concerned about children who would be thrown into an abyss of premature adulthood by getting to know about what  Fuck you  means  I mean he took the pain of rubbing it off and even want to bash the kid who wrote it on the wall  He is definitely compassionate towards the fragile and sensitive kids  Like how he defended that kid who talked about his uncle who died  He has so many conflicting characters that he is unable to carry them along his journey  The book is warm and simple  It just speaks  it does not preach or even is concerned if you are listening or if you care  Entertaining and leisurely  I am unable to come out of the languor of the Holden s world  Overall  brilliant  When I first read it I was a bit let down at the ending  the thought that nothing actually happened and that there wasn t a set story  But I read it again  and again  and again  I realised that Holden Caulfield was just a normal teenager going about his daily routine   aside from his endeavours to avoid his parents knowing about his current school status   He just represents the above average teenager spending the week figuring out his life in a deep but humorous way  He goes to crazy hotels and nightclubs  goes on dates with old friends  and finally sees his sister  who opens his eyes to the world he is missing out on  His cynical views and extremely frank outlook on life are deep  but funny  and will touch any person who reads his brief memoir  The Catcher in the Rye  This is one of my favourite books  and it never gets old  If you get it or if you don t  you will still love it  This is an amazing book that makes you long to just live in the moment  I strongly encourage you to read it  I love this book  At the beginning  I hated Holden  I found him so immature and narrow minded  But in the middle to the end of the book  that s when I started to like him and eventually empathize and really like him  He wants someone to listen  I empathize Holden  That prostitute  Sally  didn t listen  Carl Luce didn t listen  and Sally didn t really listen  Holden didn t really say anything to Mr  Spencer and Mr  Antolini  they did all the talking  And him writing this book is a way for him to know that someone is listening  I like his relationship with Allie and Pheobe  makes me wish I had an older brother  He both idolized them because they weren t phonies  they were just real  I like the Catcher because Holden is still in the struggle of leaving innocence and becoming a man  He still wants to retain Pheobe s innocence as seen when he tried to erase the  f    you  off the school wall  I thought that was excellent symbolism  And that when he sees children in the park  and they make him happy because they re just enjoying their childhood   I think this book was an awesome book  I liked that the character Holden was really funny   throughout the book hr goes through some really deep stuff but he has a really nice personality  Holden always cracked jokes and he d find ways to make himself happy  but oftenly it didn t work  he s always depressed everything literally everything he does it did depressed him  it could be the funiest thing in the world    still      but at the end Holden realized that being by his sister  old Phoebe  made him happy  he s mood through out the book went from 0 to 100 real quick  this book is like a coming of age story that s why I liked it because in holdens perspective I can learn about it    in that case I did  I put myself in his shoes and to tell you about it  it was rough     I surely do recommend this book to all the readers out there  this book sort of expresses a theme  the theme is a life lesson  l mnH  d an  y shy ltqyym lkml  l nny   ny  qd an l tqbl l lkml   lkml ldhy mnHtny yh blf l hdhh lrwy   mdhsh  mdhsh   w Hd   Zm mqr th ywman  wms qr h  bdan  lm

tries failed early on as some of Holden s turns of phrase just grated on me  This time however  I was determined to push past it and finish the book  even if it wasn t likely to grow in my affections So I was amazed when it did  Despite some of his annoying catchphrases  I found Holden endearing  and more to the point  relatable  I have to say I feel quite surprised at the amount of hate aimed at Holden by others slightly to very past the bloom of youth  I get that their tolerance threshold for whiny  selfish teens is low  but that isn t all that Holden is  He is struggling with depression and loneliness and heading for a breakdown  to me that isn t annoying or boring  But I can see that not everyone will get it  Personally  I was touched by the story of such a desperately sad and lost boy  and saw lots of good in him such as his kindness and generosity  and tender love for his kid sister  And I think that Salinger s ability to tell us so many things about Holden that Holden didn t know about himself while using his narrative voice simply genius  I ve been deeply affected by this short novel and fully see why it has become a classic  makes me remember my years when my younger sister was growing up  how we two different living entities had more to share with each other than to rest of the world   how so different yet so close we were   how mere silence from one made the other take it as affirmation   how childish joys lead to love  a love that innocent and pure   one which always brought joy   and how when we grow up and look back to see this distance grows larger and larger   how the elder sibling wants to escape the call of younger sibling   holden stops on call of phoebe  Perhaps the quintessential coming of age novel    and indeed it is a very smoothly paced and engrossing read  But I m not sure if it is quite the masterpiece that readers and reviewers alike make it out to be In a way  it seems more like a device used by its reclusive author to lash out at everything from the Hollywood establishment  for rejecting him   to the societal structure and rules that most of us accept without much question  And perhaps this is a good thing  But sometimes it s difficult to tell if Salinger is making a powerful statement or simply venting his own personal frustrations  merely masked as the observations  and often defiant declarations  of his emotionally stressed out sixteen year old protagonist There is arguably a fine line between fact and fiction  The only question with this particular book is  Has Salinger crossed it   I know many people out there thinks this book is so overrated and that Holden Caulfield is the biggest phony  I disagree  He and I are the same age and just like any other teenager  he s just confused  About love life family and every other teenage crap out there  Cut him some slack for him judging the hell out of every person he meets  He s just insecure deep down  I m pretty sure he behaved recklessly and didn t put any effort into his schoolwork because of his  SPOILER  deceased brother Allie The way he kept going on and on about Allie proves that fact  He s still grieving and that s why he wouldn t apply himself to ANYTHING  Also  the fact that he s a teenage boy  3 Believe me  I did want to slap him in some parts of the book because he would talk about marrying Sally and then he d talk about much how much he wants Jane  But then again  it s natural for a teenager to behave that way  Either way  some might say the climax was a blur but I d say that s the best part of the book  It s not ENTIRELY life changing  The climax  I mean  But it does make want to  miss  the book you d only get this part if you ve read the book Needless to say  I could completely relate to this little phony and I can see myself reading this book again in the future  Even though it seems that most people seem dislike this book  I thoroughly enjoy it  Usually I m not a fan of first person  it can become very tedious and annoying  but it was different here  It felt like the conscience of an actual person  as if I was listening to Holden Caulfield speak to me  Perhaps Holden was J D  Salinger  but I suppose we will never know for sure  Even if some of the stuff Holden says or thinks is a bit ridiculous  it still sounds genuine  Holden  for me at least  embodies what it is like to be a confused teenager  Lost in society and all of its little idiosyncrasies  Side Note  For anyone worried about the  vulgar  language  it s not that bad  I think it s necessary to keep the character of Holden genuine  to make it sound like an actual stream of conscience   The Catcher in the Rye  written by J D  Salinger  is the story of sixteen year old Holden Caulfield  Expelled on multiple occasions and still dealing with the death of his brother Allie  Holden begins to wander back from Pencey Prep to Manhattan  postponing his return back to his house  where he will inevitably have to face his parents and their disappointment at yet another expulsion  Set in the 1950s  The Catcher in the Rye shows us the life of a troubled and cynical teenager as he does his best to avoid his responsibilities  He speaks of the phoniness of all those around him  and of how superficial people can be  traits that even he displays   Although Holden is sensitive  he sees the world and his own future and well being almost apathetically  so much so that he constantly alienates himself  After reading this coming of age story that takes place over a time period of a few days  you suddenly become aware of all the different stories that exist around you  and that you may share Holden s desire to simply escape and leave everything behind  It is not hard to see why he has become the hero of many readers over the years  his slang and sarcasm combined with his need for love and carelessness all add up to make a very real character  who in the same way as most people  struggles to bridge the gap between adolescence and adulthood  J D  Salinger s brilliantly written novel definitely holds the reader s attention  and lets us in to Holden s world  in which you may even find a part of yourself reflected  whether it be the angsty teenager  the loner  or the hypocrite   Failure is not a choice but needs to be experienced in order for you to redefine  upgrade  discovere or requirement to attain success  Full Review  http   kmzphotoblog com 2012 09 12 th   Around page 200  you start to realize that this kid is having some serious problems  he s not just mind numbingly stupid  He talks like this big tough guy  but the more you see the juxtaposition of how he talks to how he feels and his actions  you see an unsettling depth to his character  His scathing hatred of everything around him is a defense mechanism so that he doesn t get too attached to teachers or places  all of which fail him  This kid holds the human race in such high esteem  it s heart breaking when his favorite people turn out to be crabby kid touchers  What starts off as the story of how the high school bully got pwnd turns into a disturbing  touching coming of age story in a world that you ve idealized throughout your childhood  As you get older  you constantly find out the truth about the Wizard of Oz  instead of a kind  bumbling old man  he s a heartless bastard who wants your 13 year old penis  Such an unforgettable book  Old Salinger s made one of the best  saddest  sharpest  melancholiest  characters in worldwide literature  Holden wanders through the misty road that life is indeed  trying to be himself while getting to know who himself is  There s a funny dilemma here  The Catcher in the Rye would ve worked better as a short story  I mean  as a Salinger work  since I believe is an artifact and not his voice speaking through Holden s  which we may see if we take one of his other works  such as A perfect day for Bananafish  or the few pages I could read of Seymour  An Introduction   but it wouldn t have had the importance  strenght and value it reached  for we indentify with Holden s full development  Nevertheless  this one is a great book  no matter the form it takes   The Catcher in the Rye was hyped up to the point where I had to read it  After I heard Rory Gilmore compare Jess to Holden Caulfield  I immediately bought it  which proved to be a very accurate comparison in the end  up to the point where I considered that Jess Marinaro s character was actually based on Holden   I m talking about Gilmore Girls for those of you that do not know  The main gist of most of the reviews on here  is the hate for Holden and the whole book  I do not feel the same way  After finishing it  I took a moment to consider both the positive and unredeeming traits of our anti hero  I came to the conclusion that he is in fact perfectly likeable and can be easily sympathized with  he s in such a pitiable condition  meaning his mental health not his social or financial situation that you cannot help but feel sorry for him  even though you don t want to and he doesn t deserve it  He doesn t have any right to feel like he does  being perfectly apathetic to his future and social circle  Aside from the  view spoiler  death of his brother and classmate  hide spoiler   he has no valid reason to be like he is   and no  being a teenager is not a reason This brings us to his negative qualities  which are somewhat larger than his positive ones  He is a hopeless hypocrite  He does the things he hates  by lying and deceiving people  He refuses to grow up  yet he demands to be treated like an adult by expecting the people around him to show their true selves to him  I found that annoying  because frankly  I hate hypocrites  He brings the trouble on himself  He hates the people who hate Ackley kid  but he starts of hating him himself  He finds his little sister too affectionate and sensitive  but he freaks out and runs every time someone gets close to him  He blames everybody but himself  Well Holden  I tip my red hunting hat to you  you are the biggest hypocrite I ever read about What made my opinion of this book tip towards the five star end  is the fact that we re supposed to hate him or strongly dislike him  We shouldn t idolize him or take his example  but instead realize that the fact that we identify with him is a bad thing  We need to overcome out inner Holden  and learn from his mistakes by not categorizing people but instead get to know them before judging them  We need to allow ourselves to mature and not be stuck with a Peter Pan syndrome our whole lives  This book is a coming of age novel because that s what it s supposed to do In my opinion  The Catcher in the Rye is a 200 page long caution of what we shouldn t be like or what we should overcome  told in a very entertaining and original way  Salinger is a genious  Holden Caulfield is a phony  But I still love this book  Provides disillusionment for the reality that not everyone who is sad  is sad  Society sets a standard that he was obviously depressed and needed help  Which poses the question  what s wrong with being sad  If one is content with discontent  then why does it matter what they feel  Not everyone is crying out for help in their reality  It s the outsiders who wish they could be on the inside and state that someone is clearly in need of rescuing  Not always so  A classic novel and a must read  While at the time this was written  writing from a teenager perspective wasn t typical  now a new genre has come forth in the form of YOUNG ADULT  Even so I believe this book stands out because of the easy to relate to protagonist who expresses many of the hormone driven emotions that many young people have to deal with  While I may have interpreted this differently than the author intended  I saw Holden as a manic depressive  probably brought on by his younger brother s death and even though I d drawn this conclusion  the last chapter was still a shock to read  I would recommend to all  especially the younger generation who see all  older books  as stuffy and boring  There had some very unusual things about this boy  depressed  sarcastic  illiterate  a lost kid trying to stay out of adulthood he calls phoniness  But Holden  really  to me  is whom I like to call my brother or just a friend I can speak my honest feelings with  If I plan to read this book again  I m actually calling Holden on my cell phone  asking his if he s free and would like to go for a cocktail  I m sure he d say yes  I  like many others before me and many to follow  read this book as required school reading  This gave me a great opportunity to compare my reaction to the book to my peers  reactions  I found this to be one of the most polarizing books for my class  Some people really loved it  Some people absolutely hated it  I was one of the former  But I do understand how people may hate it  And I think that I could have hated it if I had read it at some other time in my life First of all  I think Holden is such an interesting character  There is something undeniably young  angsty and just timelessly refreshing about his narration  That s what I love so much about The Catcher in the Rye  Holden s voice really resonates  Despite the whiny ness  the insecurity  the swearing  the scattered nature of his tangents  you can detect something truly genuine lying at the foundation  whispering the truth in your ear  A true classic  A must read when you re coming of age  Re read it as an adult  and was pleasantly surprised by the thight and fresh prose and the toe curling description of adolescent thoughts   This was my second time reading The Catcher in the Rye and it s an amazing book  it s definitely an easy read so no intimidation there  While reading this book  Holden becomes the adolescence memory that we all have  I recommend this book to everybody  From your grandmother to your young brother  Do make sure people reading it are sane though  We don t want another murder incident or attempt of murder such as Kennedy s and Reagan s      I was dubious at first about giving it the five stars  but after seeing how it looked next to the four I had originally assigned for it  I changed my mind  It is a very effective novel  three times was it about to make me cry   and I kept feeling very caring and affectionate for Holden  he is definitely a very interesting character  with a great sense of justice  despite his condition That appreciation of beauty through fraternal love  and child innocence    Needless to say that the prose is so well managed and carefully constructed in order to lead to that unavoidable relation established between the seventeen year old narrator and the daily reader  It is an easy reading that communicates hundreds of positive feelings   the book preferred by loners and sociopaths  the catcher in the rye is the book i turn to when i feel misunderstood in a progressively dysfunctional and artificial world  while salinger mirages himself in the voice of a troubled 16 17 year old boy  his observations  biased though they may be  still manage to ring true  perhaps salinger s greatest feat here is to create a character who despite being a self dubbed terrific liar holds a mirror up to society and forces it to see itself for what it really is  a bloody mess this is by far one of my favorite books to teach high school students  every moment  even the tangents  feels necessary and significant  the tone and language are relatable and surprisingly relevant  you know  for a book written decades ago   I have yet to figure out how this book sent messages to Mark David Chapman to assassinate John Lennon  the lead singer of The Beatles  Perhaps  Chapman  in his own little disturbed mind  saw an image of Holden Caulfield shooting his brother  the author  Maybe  Chapman just really hated everything in his life just like Holden  He detested the Beatles and decided to get rid of Lennon  Caulfield couldn t stand the word  phony   therefore  did he believe the John Lennon was an example of the word  What ever the case  the fact that Holden found nearly everything around him to be  phony  except the displays at the museum  gives us a glimpse on the fraudulence of human nature  Only these statues remained the same to Holden  while everything else around him changed for the worse  Perhaps this was the force that drove Chapman to murder Lennon   I was motivated to read this book because my grandmother  an English professor  had objected to its language since I was 11  I had reading problems and after a speed reading course  as I began to wake up to the books around me  it was one I wanted to read out of curiosity  It had been forbidden  I never discussed it with her Because of this book  I felt like I could pick up the phone and call an author whose work I really connected with  As a result  when I finished Cat s Cradle  I called Barnstable  Massachusetts and had a wonderful conversation with Kurt Vonnegut  Jr  Pre Internet  My favorite quote from the experience   Honey  a call all the way from Texas    As a researcher in schools with at risk students and as a caregiver  I often thought of this book  wanting to catch others in the rye and do all I could to help  almost no matter how painful the experience    or the loss when it s over Because of this book  I read Nine Stories and was hooked by Seymour Glass  This book was really good  I really liked Holden Caulfield  He killed me  I won t write a review  because reviews are phony  Ok  I know many of you have never heard of this book  but Eric and Matt got this for me for Fathers Day knowing i was the last person alive not to have read it I love Holden Caufield and I love Phoebe  She was the wise one who loved her brother unconditionally and knew she had to help him find himself  He had many experiences on the way  but only a few where you could see other s opinion of Holden  and for the most part  they were all the same  He is such a rich character and i could see so much of my own insecurities as a young boy and my own wonderment on girls at that age A book for the ages  and that includes all ages  at any time  at any age in any period of time  This book is now a part of me and i am forever indebted to my sons for getting this for me  I LOVED THIS BOOK  Holden Caulfield is my idol  He s suitably insecure and but so wonderfully rebellious that surely anyone who was every a teenage boy can relate to him  The thing that first attracted me to the book  despite it s well deserved legacy  is the beautiful cover art shown above  designed by Michael Mitchell  Since reading the book I have gone on to buy a hunting hat  it s blue unfortunately  not red  and attempt to work some of the protagonist s trademark phrases into my own everyday speech   shooting the bull  and  boy  it kills me  it really does    It would probably be my  desert island book  although it s a shame it s only around 200 pages long  The best novel ever written  Every page is a gem    It s funny  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing e everybody  Among the other classics I ve read so far  this is my favorite  It is a light read and entertaining  Holden has a strong sense of humor and most of the time I found myself laughing or shaking my head with a smile because of the things he just said Holden really hate the world or the people in this world  Most of his stories were rants about how depressing people were  He depressed me so much  But then again  there is always someone who will make you see clearly  I am glad he is a very good brother and very fond of Phoebe This book certainly made me laugh  wonder  realized  and depressed  One of a kind  I highly recommend this book especially to men because Holden has a lot to say about girls  Hahaha  But it is for everyone  I really enjoyed this book  What s a book called that every several years you can t help but go back and re read  I d say a classic and that s what this book is  I could get tired of it but I d have to read it six times over in succession before doing so  Holden has to be one of the greatest fictional characters ever created  I ve read other work by Salinger but sadly nothing comes close  then again  few books by any author measure up  It might be a curse to create something at that level  nothing you ll ever do will be appreciated  Come to think of it  it s been about ten years since my last Good Read  Reading this book as an adult changes everything  If you haven t read The Cather in the Rye of haven t  like me  read the book in 10 years   just do it  It is a classic for a reason  The Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger is a great story that teaches and shows a lot of teenagers to not be afraid to be  different   In my opinion Holden was a good guy who just wanted to explore the world in different ways and try out new things  Giving Holden a second chance would have been the right thing to do  I do not think it was fair for him to go back to the rest home  Holden was an accepting  truthful  and out going young boy that everyone seemed to not be able to accept I think that Holden should be allowed to rejoin society instead of being sent back to the rest home  Holden was acting like any other teenager who was about to start his adulthood life  Throughout the novel  Holden seems to be excluded from and victimized by the world around him  As he says to Mr  Spencer  he feels trapped on  the other side  of life  and he continually attempts to find his way in a world in which he feels he doesn t belong  Putting Holden into the rest home again was harsh and does not deserve to be left in there  What Holden needs is someone to understand him and to be there for him  For example  he wears this red hat to advertise his uniqueness and therefore people judge him for being  different   What I like about Holden is that he knows he doesn t need to be like the rest of them in order to fit in  He uses his isolation as proof that he is better than everyone else  and that is why he avoids interacting with them  People can talk all they want but that won t stop him from being who he really is  Holden is just an open minded  honest  young boy who finds the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him almost unbearable  And that is why everyone gets the wrong idea of Holden  they think that he speaks nonsense but in reality he is saying nothing but the truth  However  the criticisms that Holden aims at people around him are also aimed at himself  That is because people aren t able to stand the truth so the easiest thing to do is disagree and judge him for thinking differently  The rest home isn t for Holden  he has a whole life ahead of him and it s not fair for him to be stuck in there  The only thing that seems to really tick people off is when he criticizes and philosophizes about people who are boring  people who are insecure  and people who are  phony   but that s typical Holden  He shouldn t be treated like a crazy person  he doesn t belong in a rest home  timeless classic  read it many years ago and read it again in my thirties still it has the same powerful impression  I would love to read it with my daughter in couple of years time when she can relate as an angry anxious teenager with the lead character  Excellent  especially considering it was written in the 20th century  I can sum it up with these words   Holden  Dude  Get a  goddam  clue   This book was incredible  It had a perfect plot while not really having a plot at all  and the characters were each as intriguing as the next   Although I think Holden s little sister was my favorite    hych wqt bh hyshkhy chyzy ngw gh bgy dlt br hmh tng myshh Este fue el primer libro en ingles  sin saber que era un clasico  que lei a los 17 anos  lo cual es una edad perfecta para leerlo por el contexto en el que se desarrolla la novela  Entretenido y humoristico  I love this book  i really do  The first few pages where a little uninteresting  But then it became so damn captivating  I love the use of language in this book  And the fact that the lead character Holden Caulfield is this strange but beautiful individual  The way he talks and his train of thought are the best  I could read pages full of just him thinking  J D Salinger did a great job on this one  And i can really see why this book became a must read classic novel   What really knocks me out is a book  when you re all done reading it  you wished the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it        It surely is a book like that A must read for all  An easy going book written in very very peculiar fashion  Completely strange style of expressing things not common to books  Seems like author is talking to you and not writing it  Because of it s peculiarity you may end up not liking it  but it s worth trying anyway  It is a thin book  You can t write something like this and fill up 300 pages  It is not a story kind of book with sad or happy ending  It s just a one way communication from a depressed teen who is trying to figure his way out  It assuredly raised many unanswered questions on education system from the point of view of average usual teens  A controversial course book  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody  these are the end lines  It seems like every line from the book is quotable  All very nicely written in true friendly way  The starting line goes like     If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like  and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me  and all that David Copperfield kind of crap  but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  In the first place  that stuff bores me  and in the second place  my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them  I can t write everything I felt about the book  and all      A complete mixture of feelings I have about the book  I am not a writer and blessed with such super power  If you re just looking for a story with a defined structure and moral steer clear of this book  go read literally anything that makes it onto the grocery store book rack  If you enjoy clever writing that still holds up and like the idea of reading a book that knows it s a book  then give this a read re read   I rarely read fiction because I have a hard time suspending reality  I always see the writing rather than the story  That being said  my re read of The Catcher in the Rye was an amazing experience  Every tangent and mini sode of Holden s life has perfect timing  not because it follows a formula  but because Salinger was able to bend and change his own rules as the story unfolded For example  At the beginning Holden often complains about a behavior then replicates it  we get it  But  Salinger uses that gag to set up another gag  He creates an understanding  establishes a premise then builds upon it  That is Salinger s strength Think about any comedy movie you ve ever seen  Does it hold up  Probably a few key parts do  and you ll find that those parts were created by the premise rather than the culture That is exactly what this book does  It creates a premise  an absurd premise  and riffs on it as much as possible  This book wasn t meant to define a teenage rebel  it was meant to give a chuckle to those who lived through being a teenage rebel  everyone  TL DNR   If you get a kick out of the craft of writing  read this book  If you need a solid story  you probably won t enjoy this book  That goddam killed me  It really did  you know Holden Caulfield keeps getting kicked out of schools and he wonders around New York  getting into mischief  thinking about life  and waiting for his parents to find out he has been kicked out again  He doesn t quite know what his next moove is going to be but this novel is all about helping him find out  There were so many great things about this book  It s a classic for a reason and just needs to be read and appreciated for what it is  1   The language was one of my favorite parts about this book  Both the narrative langauge as well as Holden s special way of speaking  The narrative is beautifully vintage and so fun to read  and maybe try to slip into everyday conversation from now on  And Holden had his favorite phrases that he used quite often  and they just killed me  including   that always kills me    goddam    for Christ s sake    phony   his extended us of exaggeration  and my favorite was  gave her the time of night   2   Holden Caulfield himself was amazing  despite the fact that nothing amazing happened  Holden ran into quite a few people during the book  and they were all damn phonies  but he felt sorry for them  And then he ran away from the phonies  but he missed them  And he didn t want to have to talk to or hear any more goddam phonies  but he was lonely   3   As sorry as he feels for everyone around him  and as lonely as he feels in a crowded bar  one thing that makes Holden feel good  one thing that he really likes  is his little sister Pheobe  The relationship between Holden and Pheobe is really touching and makes everything  even having to deal with all the phonies  better Goddam  I m glad I picked up this book  If you ever want to take a trip down memory lane and remember what it was like to be 16 years old and hate everything about the world around you and just not give a care about anyone other than yourself and not fully realize why the world wasn t making sense  look no further than The Catcher and the Rye  and love every minute of it Re reading this book in my late 20 s and not being all excited as I was in high school that I would get to drop the f bomb in class because of this novel  I think about the text very differently now  Holdon Caulfield and his dislike for the fakes and the phonies and his ability to look past all of it is still an admirable trait  The character is someone dis likable and because of that we can find ourselves relating to him  We wish that we could see the world in such black and white as he does  One word of advice  pick this book up and see if you can maybe see a little bit of yourself in Holdon   Definitely one of the greatest classics I ve read so far  The debut tells so much about what is going on in the head of a teenager and how much adventure it takes to find yourself and to understand what surrounds you  I really love Holden Caulfield s character Sadly  he only found happiness in the end  A first person narrative by a teenager who is coming through a crisis point in his life  It seems that he is still grieving over the death of his brother several years before  he has been fighting with depression and apathy  and to avoid getting close to anyone he labels everybody as being phony or conceited  He cannot say anything positive about another person without immediately countering it with a string of negative attributes  It is a defence mechanism  So too is the redirection of his pent up anger and frustration  which leads him to act out  saying and thinking unpleasant things about other people  to be suspicious of every one  and to withdraw from anything that requires any real effort on his part  There are also some hints that he may have been abused at some stage  He has been expelled from yet another school  he burns through the large amount of cash he had in just a few days  repeatedly gets very drunk and becomes sufficiently ill that  near the end of the few days  he collapses briefly  One final soaking in the freezing winter rain sends him to hospital where  with the help of a psychoanalyst  he finally gets the help he needs  Having portrayed misery  frustration  despair  anger  hostility  fear  and self loathing throughout the story  a very short final chapter represents the first small signs of hope  for Holden and for the reader  that he may now be ready to take control of his life again  I would say in Salinger s words   It killed me   I loved it  I honestly did   It was a very new experience for me since I had never come across such style before  In my opinion  it is a book of one personality one character one life  even Phobie  in my opinion  is a reflection of Holand s personality  Funny enough  I accept her as a final Holand s  shape  in the end of his endless journey for self defining  And author s constant reference to her  being small  made me question her  big  role again and again  I accepted everyone and everything else described in the book as a cheap decoration  On the contrast it helped me to focus on the main   on the journey of random lost and immature soul running somewhere in the rye fields trying to catch   what  That is the question that I leave to myself and here I will trust my imagination and time i deeply love this book  and it has meant so many different things to me at different moments in my life  as a teen  i felt it was a story of the mass confusion of adolescence  in my early twenties  i thought it to be more a tale of an anti social personality disorder  now  in my mid twenties  i wonder if it is not more a reflection on the depravity of affluence  and the diminishing effect too much wealth has upon children  and  at the end of the day  perhaps it is all of these  truly  haunting    For the Modern Mrs Darcy 2016 reading challenge  I needed a book that was banned at some point  That was the perfect reason to make this the year that I re read The Catcher in the Rye  which I haven t read in at least five years  From the very first page  I was entranced by Holden Caulfield s voice  which was just as I remembered it  Sardonic  Witty  Crude  Even self deprecating at times  This was a book that I was making excuses to pick up and keep reading  What kept me eager to come back to it was not necessarily the story that was being told  but how that story was being told  Holden Caulfield s world of prep schools and old New York City is pretty much alien to me  but the frenetic stream of consciousness narration just drew me into it and kept me transfixed with his intimate commentary on pretty much everything that passed him by and his exaggerated reactions to slightest transgressions against him  I was a little disappointed that it ended abruptly with  That is all I am going to tell you   or something of that ilk  as I craved to hear more of that voice and get the spin on what followed  Otherwise  it didn t bother me at all that the ending left pretty much everything open and messy  Life  after all  is like that  A few of the things I really liked about this also drove me a little insane  For all his angst and hypocrisy  Holden Caulfield was such a good soul  I didn t like reading about his continuing derailment as an individual by any means  but doing so was surprisingly cathartic  His story is just so pitifully human  and relatable  that I felt happy to have my own slice of wayward teenage soul searching to call my own  Other than my stupidly individual takeaway from this book  I have a lot of respect for its fleshed out characters  sparse description  and almost entirely subjective structure  An honest coming of age novel  I don t wonder why it s known as a classic  I bought this on a whim at a used bookstore yesterday  I read it the first time in high school  Then I read again in graduate school  I read for the third time today  It holds up  What a relief   the book i m really giving such a good review to is Franny and Zooey  although i ve read the others  well  parts of nine stories      now  it s been a while  but mr  salinger s ability to mix sadness with humor is part of why this book is worth reading  the humor doesn t ignore the sadness    and i like mr  salinger s obsession with zen stories  it makes me happy   The Catcher in The Rye  is a great book and a book that makes you think deeply about your own life and how good you have it compared to the main character Holden Caulfield  Holden narrates his story throughout the book and as you read on you learn more and more about his personal life  His personal life is the main reason why I rated this book 5 stars  I felt that I could really connect with Holden because his character is quite similar to mine  except for the fact that he hasn t been the best in school failing out 4 times  His character is similar to me because we both like to philosophize about everyone and everything  Ask my classmates if Jacob Tenpas thinks he is ever wrong and you ll get an answer  no  This is simply because I stay true to my philosophies and generalizations about people until I can t stand behind my facts and judgments any longer  I feel that this is something that has grown upon me because I ve always liked to sit back and observe people and how they act just like Holden  Learning this has made me able to get along with various amounts of people  As for Holden and his character I feel that this is the reason why so many people who read this book can connect to him like I did  Not for being exactly similar but because his discontent and vivid way of expressing people make him able to resonate powerfully with the readers  Almost as if they wish they could have his confidence and say the things he does without worrying and facing the consequences  This constant battle that Holden puts up with his words and thoughts throughout the book is what made me stroll through the pages craving for the next best argument or drama scene he causes  It was very amusing but also relatable and that is the beauty J D  Salinger was able to put into the book and the narrator main character Holden  He fit his role and made this book a 5 star book  This is why Holden is a hero figure among many today and why  The Catcher in The Rye  in society is an all time classic book right up there with the other bests   People either love or hate this book  I can never understand the complaints of those who hate it   Holden is too whiny   What  WHAT   That s ridiculous  You are clearly missing the point of the book  This is ironic  because when I first read it in tenth grade  Sophie said  So did you like it   And I said  Yeah it was pretty good   She said  Did you get it  At the end   Me   No   what   Her   He ends up in an asylum   Me  immediately burst into tears That reaction is dramatic and embarrassing  but it s a testament to J D  Salinger s writing and voice that he was able to create a character that I formed such an attachment to  I loved Holden s voice and reading about him was so fun  His relationship with Phoebe is so touching  That book just leaves me with an almost nostalgic feeling  kind of sad and kind of sweet and then I burst into tears  Just kidding  that was just the one time  Very simple storyline but engrossing all the same  What started with a wonder of how strange and temperamental this guy is  ended with an acknowledgement of my inner voice  which turned out to be not that different after all  Huge Impact I might as well start writing a diary   P I would read it over and over and over again   I liked this book very much because its written in a style that I don t see a lot today  Salinger writes in first person as the main character Holden  Holden is very raw and blunt about how he sees the world  It s very sad how he sees the world and as a reader you wonder why he s so bitter about everything  However as you read you discover why and you almost feel like you re Holden s personal shrink evaluating his mental and emotional health  Some may find Holden to be very offensive but I like how he speaks his mind  At times I felt like I was reading a journal and not a book  I love the first person point of view so much in writing and I wish more authors would write this way     I think Holden gets a bad rap  I saw the play Seven Degrees of Separation   which did not hold water  Holden has the respect to visit his teacher  He misses his brother terribly  He would have given those two nuns his last dime  but let a pimp beat him up over ten dollars  And he just wanted someone to talk to  He is lonely  apathetic   very empathetic  And on an upward spiral to    somewhere to rest Which he needs because now years later  we bother him about liking king s on the back row    Which way he wears his cap  and what does that imply  Just pick  pick  pick  pick   Every move he makes symbolizes something greater  and on up the line  Why  what He tests his breath by blowing on his cupped hand  What does that  Really mean   It s no wonder the poor kid gets turned around  Someone who would gladly change his luggage with someone less fortunate who hides his own bags  Empathy  but those kind of gestures are not always appreciated  Holden puts up a snobbish front  i e  every one is a phony  while he doubts his own personality  values  sincerity  etc  i laughed out loud so many times but towards the end it just started to make me sad This is one of my favorite books ever but I can see why some people dislike it  Holden is a character you will not like unless you are seventeen and angsty  Okay not really  but being able to relate to his situation in life is the only way you wont think of him as a whiny over privileged white boy  I personally love Holden  He is funny and insightful and sweet and maybe a bit naive  An issue people tend to have with him is his exorbitant amount of swearing  However it makes sense to me   he seems so young and innocent yet he is trying to be an adult and cope with adult feelings and one way to feel more adult is to use  grown up words   He is just sort of lost and it makes me want to hug him and possibly become a mute with him  On the actual writing and such  this book is very simple to read and understand yet it is a pretty profound book  I really like it   Salinger s death in January prompted me to reread Catcher in the Rye  What an amazing  singular voice in American letters  Holden Caulfield  from the first sentence  is a completely believable and accessible character  and as torn as any of us by self revelation and preserving one s facade for one s own mental health  My heart ached for him from the first page  Even if you know the story  you worry about Holden  fret with him over his anxieties  and cherish his honesty  I loved D B  and Phoebe for loving him  And ultimately  I have great faith in Holden  in his good sense overtaking him  in his ability to sense the love and concern people have for him  in his resilience  despite the intense alienation he feels  The scene in which he waits for Phoebe at the museum to return her Christmas money before he runs away West  and sees her lugging a suitcase  intent on following him  is one of the most beautiful  cathartic scenes in literature  Holden s teenage fears  his gripes and concerns with phonies are so well wrought  they became talismans for whatever we fear  The universality of this story is striking  Consider Holden s outlook   That s the whole trouble  You can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful  because there isn t any  You may think there is  but once you get there  when you re not looking  somebody ll sneak up and write  Fuck you  right under your nose   And even as Holden tells us at the book s end to never  tell anybody anything   he proves the risk is worth it  The pain the world delivers is worth those moments of pleasure that  thank God  eventually break through   Jo  Me ha encantado  aunque en algunos momentos me he sentido demasiado identificada con Holden   Cuando lo termine me quede un poco eb blanco diciendo que  y ya esta  pero entonces lo asimilie y me ha dejado muy buena sensacion  Ak hladate knihu so silnym posolstvom a taku  o ktorej budete este velmi dlho premyslat  toto je ta spravna volba  Som rada  ze je zaradena do povinneho citania  pretoze  nerada to priznavam  by som sa k nej vobec nedostala a to by bola nesmierna skoda  Ti  co ju necitali  tak povinne precitat       Je to UZASNE DIELO  one of my all time faves  I read this book for hours  I can t stop reading page by page  I can t even pay attention to the songs I m listening during reading in progress  I have never been such a fresh reader as I would be in the good old days  This book gives me alive  youthful and closing to tears  I don t cry  but the book and Holden are struck in my brain demanding me to absorb everything in the rest of my life  When I finished it  I know every detail is worth reading I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS AND I CAN T DIGEST IT RIGHT NOW  I JUST CAN T ARGH P s  Holden is me and this fact hurts me inside   I guess you have to catch this book at the right time in your life  or it won t mean as much as it could  I read this when I was sixteen and just completely blown away by all of the stuff I was starting to learn about myself and how I fit into the world  or didn t  Mostly how I didn t  So this book meant a lot to me  I remember being shocked when I realized that I only had 10 pages to go  because I was so absorbed in it  There are ways to criticize this book and if you were interested  you could  I feel like this book serves a pretty strong psychological purpose  so those nitpicks don t matter as much to me And  it has one of my favorite lines ever  He s about as sensitive as a goddamn toilet seat  Well put  As exacting  as surprising  as funny  as blasphemous  as on the first reading  One of the shortest masterpieces at just about a hundred and ten pages  this book refuses to age  and it refuses so defiantly  One of the all time great books  a shattering confession and a cultural watershed moment on par with  The Beatles   I re read this in less than 24 hours  I liked it the first time as a teen  but got more out of it this time around  25 years ago  I was focused on trying to figure out how this book contributed to Chapman shooting John Lennon  Now  convinced that Lennon s assassination was likely part of a bigger assassination ring  Chapman was out of mind It is a rich observation of human behavior and psychology  told by an intelligent and sensitive adolescent who is going through a breakdown and or depression  I like it when authors aren t afraid to reveal the truth about human nature  even if it s unflattering  That is what makes a book real  I did not find this story depressing  as healing begins towards the end  The 1940 s vernacular and N Y C  setting was also interesting   The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book  If you don t know  now you know reader  yes  that s a Biggie reference   There are a lot of haters when it comes to Catcher  Tons of people think it s just angsty rich white boy nonsense  I HEAR you  Holden can be a lot to take  His language is repetitive and he s a Debby downer  He s no hero  He s not fighting for any cause  He s not even doing a great job of getting by  But he s real and funny and sad  Basically  he s human  He s not perfect or even trying to be  He s just young and devastated by the loss of his brother  trying to figure out what life means and what he s supposed to do with it  I had wanted to read this book for quite a while as I had heard the title thrown around many times and various things about it  When it came up in a search for  stream of consciousness  I was prompted to read it for my dissertation The first thing that came to mind was The Perks of Being a Wallflower  which I thought was very similar in many ways upon beginning to read  but quickly learnt that they are both very different  and with retrospect  I can say that Catcher is my favourite of the two Returning to the text itself  it took some getting used to the style  but after a while I warmed to Holden and began to empathise with him  His continual reminder that Hollywood is a phoney industry for sellouts is a sentiment that I wish more people agreed with  And the more I read  the more I believed in the genuine alienation and displacement anxiety of someone stuck in the American system  Feelings of apathy  teenage angst heightened by the suppressive  cliquey  underworld of American high schools  feelings of longing for something more than just the norm  wanting to escape  These were all things I believed were developed thoroughly throughout the book  and a major characteristic of Catcher is that it is slow burning  There are no climaxes as such  the tension simply continues to rise slowly  which is arguably a risky style of writing  But it definitely works Catcher was criticised and banned for promoting dangerous ideas  one of those being rebellion against the system  I understand in a country like America  this book would be a shock to their morals of acquiescence  blind obedience and complacency  but Holden s reasons behind his rebellion are really something which I took seriously  The constant repetition of the word  phoney  and the development of this feeling of entrapment  which is ultimately explained in unison with the title towards the end of the book is a defining moment  I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff  I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I d do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  His ideal of perpetuating childhood innocence that is despairingly lost in the system  I thought was a very awe inspiring moment  and one which really made me stop and contemplate for a second and realise this was one of the most deeply meaningful books I have ever read I feel as though it perhaps fools you in its simplicity  The language is very very simplistic  The narrator is in school and is expected thus to be somewhat naive and stupid  But the ideas themselves are what makes the book big  It is an outright criticism on western culture  a claim that everyone is inherently selfish and fake  and a realisation that ultimately we must sink into the system  When this realisation came about  for me  it changed the entire text  and I truly think it s one of the greatest ideological novels out there  and the best piece of American literature I have ever read  I have a feeling that you re riding for some kind of terrible  terrible fall        The whole arrangement s designed for men who  at some time or other in their lives  were looking for something their own environment couldn t supply them with        So they gave up looking  One of my favourite books of all time  During the first few pages itself I regretted not reading this a decade or two earlier during my boarding school days  Most of us identify with Holden and can draw multiple similarities with our own lives  It s an odd book though  The last thing which I would have to say is that if I keep horsing around with this review I am gonna be declared a phony    Great book  Really made me think about how messed up I was psychologically during my teenage years  Holden is so lost and confused  Heart breaking book for me with just enough light at the end of the tunnel to feel hope for him and the future  This book has been an awesome read  What could be more appealing than the amazing persona of Holden which a perfect match of nowadays teenagers  All the psychological inclinations  questions  troubles and all have been depicted  Holden doesn t fit wherever he goes  No one understands him and everyone is stupid around him except the innocence of his little sister which shows how he cares for little children and wants to help them be better and smart though he hates some of them obviously  The novel isn t all that dramatic as these first lines might sound  yet humor is dispensed throughout the story  I remember closing the book and laughing for minutes before I return to read  Well  I don t want to spoil the read thus I ll wrap up without posting any of my favorite Holden moments   This is the best book ever  I read it in a day and it is really short   The Catcher in the Rye is a novel that covers three days in the life of sixteen year old Holden Caulfield  During these three days  Holden gets kicked out of his school Pency Prep  due to his rebellious attitude and horrible behavior  He then makes the decision to set off to New York city alone for a few days because he is fed up with his fellow dorm students  While in New York  Holden takes advantage of being alone and goes all out  doing whatever he wants  He meets new people and begins to drink heavily  Even though he is free  he realizes he can t do it all on his own and becomes increasingly depressed  Holden starts to go crazy because he claims all of the people he is surrounded by are  phonies   He can t seem to take it anymore so he decides to return home  After he returns home however  Holdens condition does not get any better  He seeks acceptance from others but it only rewarded with rejection  It is clear to see Holden s horrifying experiences have defined him as a person and he cannot seem to escape the emotional damage  As a result  at the end of the story Holden has a mental breakdown and is sent to a psychiatric center in California for treatment  I think that this book realy offers something for everybody even though many people may have harsh opinions towards it  I found this novel a brilliant and unique look at a universal problem  I would definately reccomend this book to others because it can be loved and understood on many different levels no matter what type of reader you are  YA Classic   Holden Caulfield is a drifter and a college dropout with a penchant for self loathing  and he decides the only way to escape his troubles is to run away from them and leave New York City behind  But there are people who care about him  like his little sister Phoebe  which only increases the pressure Holden feels to stop letting people down and make a decision about what to do with his life and face his ghosts  I love this book  It isn t very  plotty  in the sense that all the events tie together neatly in an easily traced path  It s much too messy for this  But it works because the main character is so relatable and likeable and I couldn t help but stick out the story with him to see if he made out all right  This is a difficult book about difficult issues  and because it is portrayed so realistically there is a lot of crude language and sexual references  but the conclusion of the story doesn t condone any of these things  The protagonist s voice is very real and compelling  and the themes in this book are powerful and not at all cliche  This book is a classic for a reason   In some horrific failing of the American public school system  I managed to escape the assigned reading of J D  Salinger s quintessential classic The Catcher in the Rye  And not just me but  for all I know  every single student graduating  or not graduating  out of my little podunk hometown in Eastern Oregon  missed out on this reigning member of literary canon  I ought to write a letter to President Obama  Mr  President  just how is my generation going to change the future of America for the better if our high school English curriculum doesn t even include The Catcher in the Rye on its collective syllabus  Well  we can t  We re all just a bunch of goddamn phonies  I really mean it  This copy was even owned by some high school freshman named Cheryl  Even 14 year old Cheryl isn t as phony as me   Good thing  too  she went and used a blue highlighter on every single name in the goddamn book  other wise I d never have made it through to the multiple choice exam at the end  Read the rest of this goddamn review http   litbeetle com 2013 08 18 on j     read it once when I was his age  and didn t get it  read it fifteen years later  and totally got it  that says something about the marinade of pain and suffering that is life  i guess  Bought it in a whim Read it after it won in an eniee minee Game held by my little brotherNever thought I would     but I loved it   completelyThroughout the book  I got a Mixed feelings towards Holden   Times  I wanted to scream at him and tell him to wake up   Other times  I felt so sad for him  for he is nothing but a 16 year old kid who it seems that he confronted reality for the first real time The sense of loss and confusion is overwhelming  and it jumps up in almost each line    and that is pointed out in each time Holden plans to do something but then he never try to do it If I wanted to put the whole book in few lines It would be in the part where Holden Talks about Museums  and how it changes daily  but you are the one who keeps on changing  The End was Awesome  simple  and just so innocent    I guess he Made himself at peace with the world    or did he just understood how it works    _  i like Holden  i like Salinger  it was really interesting for me from the beginning till the end  sometimes i read articles about this bokk and understand that there are a lot of things insight  different signs and interpretations and it s exciting   I first read this book in one of my high school English classes and I remember liking it  but not really taking anything away from it  This time though I LOVED it  and feel as though I ve learned a lot more from it  even though I m now quite a few years older than Holden and am not studying it or giving it a super in depth analysis or anything  I also just really enjoyed Holden this time around  I found him rather hilarious and even though much of what he said did thought wasn t overly interesting  I still found it enjoyable to read  The writing style  in general  is rather unique  but occasionally hard to read  It felt as though I was reading Holden s diary  which makes sense seeing as he was basically retelling his past experiences from his own perspective But yes  I would consider this to be one of my favourite classics  though besides loving Holden  I can t exactly say why that is  This book required my utmost patience in tolerating a foul mouthed  immature  demented teenager  Holden Caulfield will provoke you and upset you  maybe even bring up your own past teen angst  I felt angry with this book  but I loved it for it s intricate theme  the mind of a confused  rebellious teen  The tension of hating Holden s guts was needed in order to make his story a compelling one  He wants to be the catcher in the rye  when kids play in a rye field and gets near a cliff  he would catch them  save them  He who would go against the world to save innocent minds from having his goddam feelings  The ending  the last 3 chapters  it killed me  Touched me and teared me  It s the kind of book I wouldn t mind flipping through years later to be reminded of that there is always hope  despite having read the word  goddam  in almost every sentence spoken by Holden  The Catcher in the Rye is a very well written  enjoyable book that gives you something to reflect on when finishing it  Holden s character is thoroughly developed throughout the book  starting from the very first page  and up until the very last  The book doesn t take the reader on a journey  unlike most page turners  or best sellers  instead the book requires a bit of work to read it properly  but gives you a lot to reflect on  and see what journey you have taken  The book shows us how teenagers in society have a feeling that they have nothing in common with the world  or are alienated  as a reader this was something I could relate to very well Overall  very good book  well worth the read   I just finished this book  and really  it wasn t at all what I was expecting Firstly  it s a school requirement and I figured the plot would be far different from what it was  Secondly  I read some heinous reviews towards this book and was afraid I d hate it  too  but I look at it as one of those books you either love or hate  and I m some what of a philosopher and I enjoyed reading it I m glad I read it when I did  I really am    Because like I said  this is a school reqirement read  ut it s for the older students where as I m merely freshman  To be honest  I found this book on the ground on my campus  and that coupled with the cryptic blank book cover with nothing but title and author compelled me to stuff the book in my bag and never look back  I don t regret it  Actually one of the reviews I read kind of spoiled the ending for me  but I didn t mind and I think there s a lot of ways someone could interpret the ending  I mean it is what it is  but there are lots of ways you can choose to look at it  and it s better to look at it from an inbiased point of veiw rather than read it off some review by someone who hardly respected the novel at all  As far as the plotline goes  to be frank  basically the whole time I read the book I was waiting for something of consequence to happen  But towards the end of the book I became content with whatever Salinger happened to throw my way because  even though the book was boring and tedious at times  I liked it  and like that it was boring and tedious at times  I can t explain  I like that it just barely strung you along and if it were any other book I would ve put it down ten pages in but every time I closed my eyes or took a deep breath the ambiance of the story haunted me and I had to finish it  It sounds stupid  I know  I m just telling it how it is  in my case Anyhow  with all these kinds of books I read I see all these hidden messages and metaphors that I promise I ll figure out when really I don t know how to go about it  even though for this book I d really like to try  Because I wanna try and understand the hidden workings of Holden s mind  I really do  I don t know  Maybe I ll give my dad a buzz and we can talk it over I have a trouble with that when I read books I like  I have that book and that author in my mindset  so I start using that writing style  I don t mind it  if you don t  I m just about done here anyhow Anyway I really really liked this book  I feel like it s going overboard to say I loved it  but I did  I could really relate to Holden a lot and I wish he was real so I could find out more about him  haha Anyway I think that s all there really is to say about it  I know I ll think of other things later and kick myself that I didn t put it in here  Anyway   Hayley I first read this as an adult so I don t have fond coming of age memories associated with it  The Catcher in the Rye is working on 2 levels  what the kid is telling   and more importantly what he isn t telling  that certain something you feel without words  This is how Salinger gets to the reader   and that s why you have tears in your eyes when you see  Allie  don t let me disappear  Allie  don t let me disappear  Allie  don t let me disappear  Please  Allie   There is so much grief here  Teens are more sensitive to what is happening to Holden Caulfield I think  Maybe because they are raw and new to the real pain life can bring  Perhaps we adults sneer at them like we do to Holden  cause it all seems so obvious to us  It wasn t always  and it won t always be so   Believe it or not  I actually knew nothing about The Catcher in the Rye  I knew what it was  I knew it was considered an important work of American literature  As a librarian  I also knew that it was  and remains  one of the most challenged and banned books in America  I knew that J D  Salinger abhorred notoriety and fame and took great pains to stay out of public view  But I actually knew nothing about the story itself Once started  I couldn t put the book down  its importance and brilliance immediately evident to me  The protagonist is both highly complex and deeply flawed  I could pity him  dislike him  and relate to him all at the same time  Holden seemed far more than just a fiction  He is human and real in a way that only takes place in the very best fiction  In a very human way I found Holden to be extremely critical of others  yet blind to  and unable to comprehend his own deep and destructive flaws and shortcomings  Like all of us at times  I m sure  he feels alone and alienated  and yet cannot see that he too is partly to blame  possibly even largely to blame   The man falling isn t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom  He just keeps falling and falling    During an emotional and significant weekend he seeks out mentors  friends  and family for stability and companionship and then rejects them as soon as they say something he doesn t want to know or be reminded of about himself  And yet  without the help of others  He is unable to save himself from himself This is why Holden is so real  This is what makes The Catcher in the Rye stay with you  Smysl

with the flaps  Kids who hate yet miss Ackley types  The kids who are truly the catchers in the rye  I hope    Hope is what this book is about  Oh  why are people so hard on this book now  This book affected me so deeply as a teenager  I just couldn t put it down  It made me feel a little less alienated  but at the same time confirmed my suspicions that I might be a psycho  Favourite ever book  Read it when you re 16  Read it when you re younger  Read it when you re older  Read it and it ll be with you  however old you are  Like how you shouldn t grocery shop when you re hungry or talk when you don t know anything  it s probably not a good idea to review something just after you finished reading it  That is especially so if you loved the thing to a ridiculous degree  Going back and revisiting my original review gives me a painful type of nausea like if I d come across some sixth grade love poem I wrote  I reread Catcher just this week  I read it out loud to my wife for her first experience in these particular waters  I d still give it five stars  she gave it four  but I d temper my praise a wee bit if for nothing else but not to come off like a lunatic Speaking of lunatics  you can like this without being one  can t you  I hope so       Original Review 1 20 2013      There are books that are supposedly great and then there are those rare ones  the truly special ones  The phrases  work of art  and  masterpiece  are thrown around a lot but the Catcher in the Rye fits both of those descriptions  I can t remember the last time I thought so much about a book after I finished reading it  Never before have I come online to do further reading on the book and to explore various theses and ideas related to it My only complaint  That no one insisted I read this sooner  I ve been meaning to read this for the longest time  I m glad I finally got around to it  The tear plopping on the chessboard   The saddest thing about this book is that he goes in for therapy at the end  I mean  I m glad he ll have someone to talk to and won t kill himself or something  but most of his complaints about the world make way too much sense  2 19 11  Just reread this  Again    After reading it again as an adult  I can remember I loved it  but not sure why  I must have really been caught up in lots of teen aged angst  Wish I could have just kept the memories of loving it so much instead of rereading it   I loved it  my kids didn t   go figure  It s funny  Don t ever tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody  It really is better to be a catcher in the rye than to be a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist for that matter  At least  if you are doing any good at all  its completely bereft of any pretension then  The overexaggerated speech  the wise words of a depressed pessimistic spirit  oh the  Fuck You  episode    So many things to fall in love with  keep aside the casual speech of a high schooler  But i think I really did fall in love with the sweet sister Phoebe  A Beautiful read I d give this book 6 7 10  a million stars if I could  I loved every second of it  I ll just copy paste what I wrote elsewhere about the book with a few edits  It isn t one of those lame teenage  coming to age adventure novels that are so predictable  In fact it s the opposite  When you zoom out  the story is just about some angsty disinterested teen who s so bored with life that he detaches himself from everything that s supposed to make life what it is  He s just there  wading through  But when you narrow in into his mind and see the world through his eyes  the whole universe becomes bubbly  almost comical  It s full of sarcasm and witty remarks  It depicts humanity as it is  humans as they are  But I mostly liked the cynicism and dark humour  that s what kept me enthralled  It s just too funny  I kept on laughing my guts out every time Holden made a comment on something or someone  just the way he expressed himself   As you can see from the reviews below  the book is highly polarizing  On one side are the 5 star reviewers  like me   on the opposing side are the one star reviewers the phoneys  flits and uglies   P   P   P   It all depends on how far you are able to relate with the prime voice in the book  Holden  To some  Holden is a self centred highbrow slob who doesn t want to grow up  face the world and adapt to it  To others he s the hero or rather  warrior poet   as someone s referred to him elsewhere  of the anti culture brigade  unmasking all the hypocrisy and pretentiousness of adolescence and the stiffness  lifelessness of adulthood  One last thing  I beleive this is the book that brought the word  angst  in vogue  I feel like the people that hate on this book are too busy hating Holden to understand the point of the story  It s a coming of age story of a teenage boy who has been through some traumatic events in his life and doesn t know how to deal with them  Did any of us know us know how to deal with our emotions in a mature way at 15  Exactly  He s an imperfect character and a flawed narrator  And even though he does some stupid shit  he doesn t know any better  The reason I liked it is cause  despite his ridiculous behaviour  I can relate to Holden in a way  Cause I too feel kind of lost in the world and directionless  That s the beauty of it  If you really look into his character and your own self  you can find some way to relate to him too   Perfect for teens and those confused or sickened by human behavior  Love how every aspect of this book you can analyze for deeper meanings and extremely funny loved it    I had no idea what to expect from this story  I read several reviews from people who really disliked it  It s certainly not the conventional teen story  but I don t think it s meant to be  True  nothing really  happens  per se  It s all about a few days in Holden s life  It seems like it s a very in depth character sketch of an intelligent  lonely  rather troubled young man  I was appalled at how he just went around New York City all alone for those couple of days  but since this was set in an earlier time period  it doesn t say exactly but I m guessing 1940 1950    things were obviously much different than today  I didn t like Holden s language but it was part of who he was  I liked that Salinger wrote this from Holden s point of view  first person narration  By the end of the story I really felt like I knew Holden  I really wanted to know what happened to him next  but the way it s written  we really don t know  I didn t expect to like this book as much as I did  I didn t want it to be over  What a terrific read  An American Classic The Catcher in the Rye  This book  without a doubt  is a literary marvel  Not because of the characters  who are some of the most fantastic  vivid  true to life characters ever put to writing  nor for the plot  which is elaborate and engaging  though it seems to go off in so many directions throughout the course of the story  No  this book is truly an awesome demonstration of the power of literature due to the fact that J D  Salinger was able to put to writing the feelings and thoughts inside every adolescent in that challenging  confusing phase between being a child and an adult  As a teen  I often find myself wondering where I belong  I know it s of no fault of my own  nor anyone else  it s just one more thing that everyone has to go through  And at no time is it more important than in those teenage years  As a child  we don t know who we are or what to do yet  we re pulled along by the world around us  never needing to fend for ourselves or find our own way  As an adult  we know who we are and where we need to go  and no one is going to help us get there but ourselves  It s in those teenage years that the two come together  we don t know who we are or where to go yet  and we re trying our best to find out  but at the same time  people are less and less willing to help us along  and more inclined to tell us to just carry our own weight  And it s hard  Many people lose their way during those years  pulling themselves down the wrong path  not knowing where they need to go with their life  At the same time  we re trying to learn about the world  and about people  we re trying to find out what we truly believe  what we truly feel  we re trying to find out who we are  we re trying to find out who we can trust  It s a lot to grasp  and yet  J D  Salinger was able to weave all of this into this one story  Holden Caulfield is  in short  the typical adolescent  Granted  his feelings of confusion and aggressive mood changes are much more pronounced than the average teen s  but that only serves to make those qualities more visible to the reader  His feelings of uncertainty about himself  his sexuality  and his opinions of others are all characteristic of the typical teenager  and serve as a window into the confusing mind of a developing body  He is simply confused  and throughout his journey  he grows to realize that what he thought he wanted might not be what he really wanted  what he thought he needed  he might not really need  This mental journey between childhood and adulthood is perfectly reflected in his physical journey throughout the book  His journey from Pencey to New York is highly symbolic of a teen s journey through life  and reflects how the uncertainty in a teenager can affect the choices he or she makes when experiencing the real world  At Pencey  he was uncomfortable  He didn t feel like he belonged with the people around him  and found some reason to hate everyone  the same feelings many people have about the average high school environment  He wanted to leave as soon as possible  to get away from all the people who he had come to know  he wanted to grow up  But  once he goes to New York  he realizes how lost and confused he really is  He doesn t know where to go  so he goes everywhere  He doesn t know what to do  so he tries everything  He doesn t know who to trust or who to associate with  so he tries everyone  He was lost  no matter how in control he felt  as many teens do when they re forced to go into the  real world   and to grow up  This confusion and exploration through this strange  adult world he finds himself in makes abundantly clear the confusion and exploration all teens have to go through when they go from high school to college or the workplace  The way J D  Salinger used these opposing environments to exemplify the trials of growing into an adult mind in an adult world is truly a masterful use of the written word  and a shining example of the journey between childhood and adulthood  As said by Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye   What really knocks me out is a book that  when you re all done reading it  you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it   This quote is possibly the most accurate example of how I feel about J D  Salinger  and just so happens to be in his own words  His understanding of the adolescent mind is astounding  and his ability to weave that understanding into a book as compelling and engaging as The Catcher in the Rye is a testament to his skill as a writer  His examples of the confusion  the self doubt  the personal discovery that all teens know so well makes me wish I could know all that he had to say about life  as I feel he would have many more insightful things to say  All in all  The Catcher in the Rye is an utterly amazing book  and one of the best stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading  Totally worth 5 stars When I was done reading it  it took my breath away seriously Aren t we all suffering from stupid  showing off people all around us   We are all Holden somehow really  The part where he was thinking and planning to run away was amazing I was blown away with the idea  really it amazed me  And the way he kept describing his siblings was just gorgeous  especially little Phoebe that amazing smart red head girl  kept thinking the whole novel about how smart awesome that kid was  I just loved the way he was talking about her  Some people will get bored when they finish half of the book  but the very exciting part starts when he leaves the hotel so keep reading The novel was well written and narrated  will definitely read it again sometime  This  Catcher and the Rye  was engaging throughout the entire novel  When I first started reading it  I became obsessed with the characters  most particularly Holden and Stradlater  Interesting characters paired with a teenager in distress vocabulary made the book so intriguing and enjoyable  However  through the course of the novel  we notice minor changes throughout the way Holden thinks and speaks and how others interact with him  As readers  we start to lose the initial love we had for him and begin to realize something may be seriously wrong with Holden  after all  he did lose a brother and is coupling with post WWII depression  This increasing annoyance with Holden s character may be because he starts to lose his patience with not only the other characters in the novel but himself also  This growing depression of solitude is what makes this book so relatable to some and perplexing to others  With a myriad use of symbolism  imagery  and interesting characters  the readers are also on a mission to figure out why the heck Holden is so goddamn distressed all of the time  especially at phonies  I gave this book five stars because it really hits home on a historical and personal level  While the entire book is focused on one character  Holden  the readers are shown what Post WWII can do to society as well  Let s just hope Holden doesn t end up as a phony one day  I didn t know anything about this book before I started reading it other than that it is one of those books that teenagers read in high school or their freshman year of college and it immediately becomes their favorite book EVAR  It changes their lives etc  etc  It s the Atlas Shrugged of moody writers  That in and of itself made me a little hesitant and self conscious to read it  being well beyond my teenage years and far from a moody writer  Finally though  it became unavoidable and I gave in and started My first impression was that the book has a lot of swearing  So much  that despite the fairly tame theme  I put it in the same category of  books that I really liked but I doubt I ll ever re read  that Lolita and A Clockwork Orange and Brave New World are in for their much more controversial themes  There is a LOT of swearing in The Catcher in the Rye  Beyond that detail  it s a great story  Holden Caulfield is a great character  He s a kid growing up and struggling with moving from being someone with a pretty apathetic view of adults and adulthood to becoming an adult himself  He narrates the events and thoughts of a couple days after he gets kicked out of his school for bad grades  His honesty about how he sees people is so blunt and unapologetic that I found it impossible not to identify with him and love him Holden points out the stuff that nobody wants to admit  For example  when he remembers back to a roommate that had cheap suitcases but who tried to pass himself as having nice  expensive ones  Holden observes how hard it is for people from different social and economic strata to get along The thing is  it s really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs  if yours are really good ones and theirs aren t  You think if they re intelligent and all  the other person  and have a good sense of humor  that they don t give a damn whose suitcases are better  but they do  They really do  It s true  People care and they have a hard time not caring  It s not impossible  but it s hard  and that s sort of a crappy truth about humanity Similarly  throughout his story  Holden observes that a lot of people are perverts  that good looking people are usually wrapped up in their looks  that there are a lot of base extortionists  superficial and violent people  and in general  that a lot of people live in  or create  what appear to be really depressing situations  Holden doesn t exempt even himself from these observations  He realizes that in a way  he s crazy too  He s moody  sometimes half delusional and flighty and he often doesn t understand even his own motives The beautiful part of the book is that at the same time that Holden has these feelings of hate and disgust for people  he recognizes the beauty of humanity  and far from writing off mankind  he realizes how important it is to him  He sees beauty in children  in nuns and in the downtrodden  Even the people that annoy him the most he misses once he s left and  in a way  he loves them too  So  after reading it  I don t think it belongs purely in the realm of moody teenagers  Holden is self absorbed but he s at the somewhat frightening time of his life where the bleak view teenagers form of adulthood is quickly becoming their reality  It s a time when most Westerners are selfish  whether they want to admit it or not  Holden is not a lost cause though  he s honest and he s got character  He won t take advantage of people and he knows beauty when he sees it  For adults who are perhaps beyond that transitional stage in their lives  The Catcher in the Rye is a good  and sometimes hilarious  reminder of how it feels to grow up in a confusing world  once in a long long while a book comes along that leaves you    or rather doesn t leave you  It last happened with  to kill a mockingbird  and  The Diary of Anne Frank  before that     and recently with  poisonwood bible   It s not so often that you come across a book that make you go Damn  A story of a kid who gets thrown out of college for flunking in more subjects than there was to write  The author wickedly plots a hilarious journey for the reader  from Holden s last day in college till he gets home in one of the most interesting  much ado about nothings  I have ever read  Whilst this novel has been in the banned list of books for it s profanity  I really wonder why    I mean there are books that have profanity and all as a central theme and have not caught as much attention as this  actually there is nothing profane  nothing profanely untoward in my view  But  I do think that this book has been authored more as a secret ode to the ones affected with ADHD   Reviews considering holden caulfield as an anti hero and an icon for rebelling teenagers is also probably very misplaced  Some school of thoughts have associated this book with the  shootings  in America including the attempt on Ronald Regan and the shooting of John Lenon    A must read for it s literary and engaging style   J  D  Salinger  as Holden would say  killed me with this book   The only time I ve heard about  The Catcher in the Rye  was in a movie or a book  I m 20yrs old and German  so our  must read  list looks a little different  to be honest we don t really have one      Anyway a few years ago I decided to read as many classic books as I can  But that wasn t the reason I read The Catcher in the Rye  I bought the book because it was short and I needed a short story So I read the book and I really liked it  I found the writing style refreshing because it was quite different and easy to understand  Holden swears a lot and probably smokes as much as he swears  but that didn t bother me  You don t need to identify yourself with Holden in order to appreciate the book  It s about the problems  the succeeds and the failures of this peculiar boy in that peculiar time  I mean  he s a 16yrs old boy  failing in school and he spends 3 days away from school and home  He is bold and appears carefree although his mind is troubled  He stays in dubious places  drinks lots of alcohol  smokes and does whatever he wants to do  From today s viewpoint it s totally insane  And that s why I like this book  It shows seemingly impossible things  which simply were possible back then  It shows a clever boy who does stupid things and is bored with society and shallow people  He is very emotional  he doesn t fit    And that s wonderful and depressing at the same time    mydwny dws drm chy bshm  mnZwrm ynh kh gh Hq ntkhb dshth bshm  mydwny dws drm chh

agarra forma  Me recordo mucho a Bukowski  La historia es corta  simple y sencilla  pero cada pagina destila hastio  desidia  menosprecio y esperanza  Todo mezclado en la voz Holden  un adolecente que trasciende a la basura del genero  Uno de eso personajes que amas o te irritan  El asesino de John Lennon estaba obsesionado con el  El que intento matar a Reagan  tambien  Mucha gente piensa que este libro le cambio la vida  Yo tambien   Tomorrow I ll be twenty one  and everything will be the same  I know this because this is the second time I ve read the Catcher in the Rye  I matched Holden Caulfield in age the first time  but now I am an  adult   But it hasn t diminished in meaning for me over time  as maybe it should have  As much as I should be an adult now I m clearly still as hateful and selfish as Holden Caulfield is here  I m still more interested in digressions than main topics That s why I worry about people missing this book  21 wasn t too late for me but it could ve been  I wish in vain I could recommend this book  but it would take a time machine to recommend it to people s 14 17 year old selves    khtb r brdryd brwyd gwshh y bnshynyd w bry chnd s t hmrh shwyd b

I don t feel this book needs a rating to be honest  To me it s just not a book that can be judged by any number of stars  but I did give it a 5 just for the hell of it I feel a lot of people  especialy younger readers  wont understand this book completely  I have seen people not like this book mainly because of either a  It was boring    No  If this is why you didn t enjoy it than you shouldn t be reading this type of books b  Holden was whiny and annoying    In this case Salinger isn t asking you to simpathise with the him  I even suspect he probably did write him to be somewhat annoying on purpose Holden was an interesting character  For one thing he was funny throughout  But my feelings toward him varied a LOT whislt reading  In the beginning you kind of relate to him and sort of have a good time getting to know his personality  Around half way through I did start to get somewhat frustrated with him  And yes  I did think he was being very immature and rather annoying  But that frustration is worth it because nearing the end you simpathise with him again as he grows and learns and that gives you a really gratifying feeling  The story progressed over the period of a few days and  as the reader  you really feel like you have been with him every single step of the way  You actualy feel like you are going with him to these places and meeting these people mainly because of the laid back  conversationalist writing style that Salinger opted for  You really feel like he s having a casual conversation with you Lastly  the ending isn t a conclusive one realistically but on the other hand the character development wrapped up so well that it was conclusive enough for you  Which was very satisfying Go into this book with a laid back atitude and just go with it  if you take it too seriously you will probably end up missing the whole point  I ve read this book a few times  from my teens  through to my twenties  thirties  and now in my early forties  It is the most compelling  touching  heart aching  soulful expression of an angst ridden teenager  Holden Caulfield  Despite the fact it was published in the 1950s  it remains  for me  the best  most touching articulation of the troubles of an intelligent  depressed  disturbed  principled teenager  It reads so smoothly  so easily  you are captured by Caulfield s voice   his anxieties  his love  for Albie  his dead brother  for Phoebe  his younger sister  who is beautifully portrayed  cute  clever and genuine  and DB  his eldest brother   besides which you share Caulfield s disgust angst about  phonies  that he feels surrounded by  albeit while he has a true sense of purpose and value  While there are a number of novels written from a child s adolescent s perspective  also written in a deeply impressive way   one thinks in particular of the mesmerising voice of David  the adolescent narrator in The Neon Bible  and the similarly compelling voice of the six year old child narrator  Scout Finch  in To Kill A Mockingbird  50th Anniversary edition  besides such autobiographical novels from an adolescent in an asylum viewpoint as Girl  Interrupted  and Bell Jar  The   I think this novel transcends all those works  apart from Harper Lee s and John Kennedy Toole s   and remains a true classic in its own right for its convincing sense of personal  individual truth expressed by a troubled youth expressed in a vernacular that is both genuine  as well as conflict ridden  and overwhelmed with his confused sense of shame and humiliation  It is profoundly moving  written without any authorial artifice  and holds you through to the end  always willing  wishing and hoping that Caulfield will find a way out of his purgatory  of course  he doesn t   One of the best 20th century novels  most beautifully  genuinely and touchingly expressed  irrespective of addressing issues of adolescence and trauma  I can t recommend it highly enough   Holden is a character that is very easy to relate to    loved this book  Some very rich characters  and a very rich story  Dry and witty     the best type  Love it or hate it  or anywhere in between   this book is a marvel of voice  tone  and characterization  It was necessary  at least for me  to put aside all of what I know about the myth and mystique surrounding TCitR  and focus on it entirely as a reading experience  As an adult  I related completely differently to Holden and his pain  with more objectivity  more analysis  more sympathy and less empathy  perhaps  His dead brother  his repeated school failures  his mostly imaginary sexual experiences  his struggle to find connection and companionship and meaning    all seen through the eyes not of a peer but one old enough to parent and realizing how hard it is to grow up  even at the best of times  Yes  it s dated  yes  it s stylized   and that style may be grating on some  But its power is undeniable   El libro me gusto demasiado y disfrute un resto leyendolo  me hizo pensar bastante y me daban muchas ganas de seguir leyendo y no parar a pesar de tener cosas que hacer para la U  La historia que nos cuenta Holden  de un Nueva York desde su punto de vista  guiado por sus pensamientos y sentimientos hacia las demas personas nos deja mucho en que pensar  en como ciertas cosas de la sociedad  a pesar de que pasa el tiempo  siguen sucediendo hoy en dia que  a pesar de que el tiempo cambie  las personas no lo hagan  I had completely no idea what this book was about  But it was worth it  The book has so much hype and mystery I definitely didn t think I d find it the the young adult section of the library  Reading that George W Bush listed it as one of the books that inspired him and the large amount of A listers that wanted to make the move I started the book with anticipation like I was concurring a life mile stone  Some top secret life changing revelation type stuff Then started laughing to myself like crazy when I found out what it was about  The scatter brain ranting of a teenaged virgin privileged know it all  OMG this book is funny  I loved it       I tried to imagine the era where the profanity was unheard of and the little hint of sex or homosexuality  flit  was totally vulgar for the time and also put my mind of a teenager reading this say yeah he s got the right idea  Oh hey this dude is cool  My nephew is this age 17 with the mind of a 12 year old  and I could just vision him with the same ADHD style of telling a story and laughing at the book I think he nailed some of his observations of people  but he can t see he is just as phony as everyone else  Phony is word most used  Phony can describe all of us   Catching up with a ClassicA wonderfully simple complex read  The character of Holden is so brilliantly written  Holden is so able to bring out the best and worst reaction in you within the same sentence  Like driving past a disaster  you just have to see the worst and hope for the best  You want to shake him and hug him at the same time  And at times I had to stop reading because I was too worried about what might happen to him The voice of Holden is rich with rye opinion and delivered in his whiny  endearing vernacular  Holden is cynical   but not the voice of a typical cynical teenager   he is damaged goods who wants a perfect world but sees only  phonies   He is such a touching malcontent   Who wants flowers when they are dead  Nobody  This book caught me at the end  From the part  where Holden comes out drunk and dizzy  and so depressed  He sits on a bench in the Central Park  and thinks he s gonna die of pneumonia  with little hunks of ice on his hair  Boy  it is such a beautiful book  With the phonies  and all the corny people  An Mr Vinson and his regression  and the smart Mr Attiloni  And Mr Spencer with his blanket that he bought from an Indian   And Allie  and Phoebe and D B And old Holden  dealing with rebellion and depression  and coping up  God damn  Say what you will about the narrator  but the book is a masterpiece in its own right  I thought I would hate it  now I m in love Holden Caulfield is one of the best characters I ve read in a long time  Holden is a disenchanted extrovert who longs for real contact with other people  but never gets it  This is why he is always complaining about morons he can t have an intelligent conversation with and phonies with nothing substantive to say  As little as Holden likes the people around him  he considers abandoning society something akin to dying  because he does value the company of others  He hates his dancing partners but needs to dance  His narrative idiosyncrasies and glaring personal flaws can be grating  true  but it s worth it to get a look inside his head  I have never been so absorbed in a protagonist s struggles before without there being much plot to go along with it  Maybe it s because  somehow  you can relate to and pity Holden even while you re annoyed by him  Maybe it s the beautifully crafted symbolism and the poetic way Salinger handles serious issues like innocence and mortality  Maybe it s because I annotated it for English class and had to highlight every single thing Salinger did to make this novel a masterpiece  which  hate though I do to admit  made me appreciate it more  Whatever the case may be  I can see that this is a book I will be thinking about for a long time to come  this book would have been my bible some ages ago  so many things have been said about this work and i am exactly on my way to repeating them so  as holden caulfield would have done  i ll just say what i want to say and not be a phony  very much like old castle   i think this book should be read at least once in every 10 years  if not in a lifetime  like going to that natural history museum  the book will stay the same but the reader won t  i ll wager it will give me another perspective 10 years after  reading  and understanding  its passages will make one feel intelligent to know just what caulfield is talking about but would also make one realize that he can t do anything about the things that make him depressed  a lot of things can really depress you if you dwell on them for a long time  but he makes a lot of sense it s scary to find that yourself agreeing to his train of thoughts and trend of conversations almost all the way  half knowing that there s something off about this kid  speaking with frankness  honesty and clear confusion  subconciously aware that you wouldn t feel surprised if he turned out to be crazy   and that would mean you might be crazy too  pretending you re otherwise would be phony though  too  one may also feel that the narrative is not going to get anywhere  that it s just all babble and there s no point  call it blasphemy but it could be as dangerous a book as the bible  with all its honest thoughts  all in all  i d say this book killed me  Catcher in the Rye is now one of my favorite single novels  that s not part of a series  for many reasons  So many teenagers can relate to Holden  it s incredible  The loneliness  the depression  failing and being judged for expressing his own opinion    All of it comes together to make it interesting for many people  I don t know how well an adult would like it  considering it seems to be directed towards teenagers  but I know I did  The purpose of the book seems solely to be that he wants to tell his story  and let those who feel the same way that they re not alone  I think why I found this book to be so amazing is because it s just a true story  No dragons  no one being saved  no fantastic ending where everything turns out good  Just reality  just a true story  I m definitely going to be reading this again in the future   Nach Jahren wieder gelesen und finde es noch besser als damals  Mir war garnicht mehr bewusst  dass der Roman zahlreiche Hinweise auf andere Literaten wie Ring Lardner  Hemingway  Scott Fitzgerald enthalt  Und die Beschreibung des Verhaltnisses zwischen Holden und seiner kleinen Schwester ist unglaublich beruhrend   One of the very few books I ve had to read for school that I ve actually throughly enjoyed  Holden has a tone of voice that just makes me want to get to know him  I was never bored while reading this  When this summer started  I really had no idea how I was going to occupy myself  Three months with nothing to do  But then I found The Catcher In The Rye in the back of an old bookshelf at my house  I thought reading this book would be an interesting thing to occupy my mind with over the summer  and I definitely was right  The story follows Holden Caulfield  a high school dropout  The story is about a portion of his life and his opinions about things such as people  religion  and love  My favorite quote from this book is  Among other things  you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior  You re by no means alone on that score  you ll be excited and stimulated to know  Many  many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now  Happily  some of them kept records of their troubles  You ll learn from them  if you want to  Just as someday  if you have something to offer  someone will learn something from you  It s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement  And it isn t education  It s history  It s poetry   This to me is one of the most beautiful quotes in the book because it explains one of the most important concepts in life  I can t explain why I love this as much as I do  but I really just love it for exposing the most amount of truth I ve ever read in a fiction book  The author s writing style in this story is one of my favorite writing styles of any author  J D  Salinger is brilliant in this book  He writes in a way where you don t want to stop reading  I think everyone can relate to this book  which is why it makes it so special  Anytime any artist creates anything which can relate to anyone who reads it  he is a genius  I recommend this book to anyone who sees life as a struggle  as a constant fight to get through the fake and monotonous things in order to be with the people you love  There is no way anyone can read this book and not agree with anything Salinger says  One of the best if not the best book I have ever read   I went to a  private school   read Christian  where books were censored  As an avid reader  I read what I was told to by my teachers  but I always wanted to read the  banned  list I got my chance  in 2003  my National Guard unit was sent to Iraq for Operation Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom  Prior to leaving  I bought about fifteen pocket paperbacks  each one was on the banned list at my school  to take with me  At the time  I was in graduate school working on a Masters in English  and I was horrified that I had not read some of the most important works in literature  I was afraid I d be labeled as a fraud for not having read these   After working eighteen hour days  I d hit my bunk  pull out one of these and start reading  My first banned book was   The Catcher in the Rye   I was absolutely blown away by this book  Salinger captured exactly what I felt as a young person  heck  he captured what I was feeling at the moment while in the desert  I read many other  banned  books during that time  but this one stayed with me  Although many of my tent mates made fun of me for reading  schoolbooks   they  nevertheless  tired of their romances and  Harry Potters  and eventually asked to borrow my  banned books   Although the situation was not ideal  I am extrememly grateful for my  banned book  time as now I feel I am not quite the English major fraud any more  Published in 1951  Catcher in the Rye foreshadows the anx that was to permeate youth culture of the 60s  and perhaps permeates all youth   I confess  I love a strong first person narrator and Salinger s Holden Caulfield is as strong a narrator as you will find  Yes  he moans and whines  Yes  he contradicts himself  Yes  he s drinks a lot and smokes even more  But there is something about him that almost any young person can relate to  I read the book for the first time in 1971  and just reread it  I m 40  years older  but I found that the book held up wonderfully  Is it for everybody  If you don t have a bit of existential anx  then probably it s not for you  But I found it a powerful  and enjoyable  read  The ending is a tad abrupt  but maybe that s because I didn t want the book to end The story is fairly simple  The 16 year old Caulfield narrates the story of a couple of days  just after he s been expelled from prep school  His constant wry observations about what he encounters  and has encountered  and fears he may encounter  as he makes his way home from prep school and hangs out for a couple of days in seedy hotels and bars is what makes the story intriguing and capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation Hey  Holden  I still relate Note  recently saw a documentary on PBS about Salinger  who became a reclusive author  I can see where the story comes from  I hadn t heard of this book till very recently  when one of my friends added it to her list here  Initially  I though I wouldn t be able to procure a copy anytime soon  but it was chance that I saw it in my library  This is a book that has a protagonist I can understand  one that makes me wonder if life would have been simpler if I had such an attitude to life  so many facets to a character instead of just one or two  Though slow through most of the book  the book brings out most of Holden s character in lovely detail  Tongue in cheek  humorous    I think it s reasonable to be classified as a classic and it is one that I shall purchase and re read My review  http   bit ly 15xRGM5 This is the type of writing style which I love where there is not much structure to the plot but the author just takes you on a random journey and shares his intimate experiences with you as you go along for the ride  It s very relaxing in some sense making this quite a pleasure to read  Word of advice  don t take this book too seriously  It s meant to entertain  That s all it is  and I loved every page of it  Oh  Jerome David Salinger  you are truly the champion of wayward youth  Some people find this book pointless  but I have to disagree  After the hit and miss of Nine Stories  I wouldn t have been surprised to have this book come to an unsatisfying or just plain depressing end  but I actually found the end satisfactory Holden Caulfield is a great character  Some of his catchphrases get borderline overused   That really depresses me  and  if you want to know the truth   for example   However  his way with words gives him a very strong voice that distinguishes the novel  You can just tell that Salinger knows this character Things even get sweet when Holden talks about the two people he actually seems to like  his little sister Phoebe and his old friend Jane Gallagher  Phoebe was vivid and funny  and I like to think that Holden is in love with Jane  His love for them redeems him for me  What can I say  I love this book  a book I had to read for english class that could be this good was beyond me  I loved this book inside and out  and not for the uses of  phony  and whatever other bad language people saw and Holden s behavior  I was seventeen when I read this book and I felt sorry for Holden  He was always misunderstood and he had issues that needed to be sorted out  but the people around him were not making it easy for him  This is one of the few books I would read over again   Best book I ve ever read  Truly amazing  To be able to really enjoy and take it in  you have to be able to see all the symbols and understand the metaphors  or else you miss the whole point of the book  This book isn t just about phony people and corruption  but about grief too  The symbolism is mind blowing in this novel  Sallinger is a genius  I feel with Holden so much  and this book really hit me in the heart   A friend once said in her review that J D  Salinger s  The Catcher in the Rye  is such a depressing read  Somehow  that particular book description got me intrigued with the book  I couldn t help but wonder  would I also have the same reaction when I get to read it The answer finally came when I learned the whole story of Holden Caulfied  the story s main character  Unlike what happened with my friend  I was quite far from getting depressed while I was going on with the novel  even though most of the events related by Holden were usually mishaps  and Holden himself kept on mentioning about getting depressed and all  In fact  I find Holden s sarcastic narration to be amusing and entertaining  if sarcasm had been a legit language  he must have been very fluent in it Aside from those  what made me appreciate this novel is that it unravels how exceptional Holden could be in his own ways  A portion of his mind may be full of cynicism  but deep inside his heart lies sincere compassion  He may tend to be distasteful towards some people that come along his way  Yet  at the same time he is also an endearing brother to his siblings and son to his parents  Despite his cynical manners  Holden is sensitive and shows concern especially when it comes to predicaments involving his family  Furthermore  he also owns this kind of eccentric  dark humor which adds up some radiance to the plainness of the scenes he relates throughout the book Holden Caulfield is a perfect example of the character that others could easily judge right away  with his cynicism and passion for expletives  among his other flaws  Nevertheless  as the story progresses  it can be seen that he is still worthy to be known better  to be given with appropriate understanding If the readers could only give a proper attention to Holden and his not so mundane encounters  one may learn how to empathize  instead of agonize  with what he is going through  At a sudden glance  his narrations might seem no big deal    However  at a much closer look  every detail might actually have a certain significance that the reader should not dare miss  With a much better view of these details  the readers might be able to see the light amidst the murky world of Holden Caulfield   Although I was forced to read J D Salinger s  Catcher in the Rye  I have no regrets of doing so  I could relate to a lot of what was going on  because I am a rebellious person myself  The main character  Holden Caulfield  was very rebellious his self as well  Since all humankind is rebellious  no matter what they think  I would recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a good read  I can honestly say that it s one of the few books that I have read cover to cover  Like many teens that are turning in to young adults  Holden goes through a few struggles here and there  Holden has constantly had problems with schools and keeping his grades up  It s obvious by the number of schools he had attended  As you hopefully will continue to read you will find out that Holden is having a BIG problem with his grades at his current school of attendance  Pency Prep  Holden was expelled  and has to go home  But the problem with going home is that Holden failed to notify his parents of what was going  on and spend the remainder of his time figuring out what was next for him in life  Holden s grades weren t the only problems he struggled with in school  Holden also struggled socially  Being a very stubborn and very easily influenced person  Holden found it hard to get along with most people he came in contact with  And those he did come in contact with  he left them wondering with his many lies he told them  Holden didn t really have a problem with his roommate until he started  messing around  with one of his childhood friend s  Jane Gallagher   It angered Holden that one of his childhood friends was being abused by a jock  Although Holden was angered by the relationship that was going on   at the same time Holden found himself influenced to want to  be involved  with someone  He soon realizes that   being involved  with someone was not what he need at the time when comes in contact with a prostitute  When Holden was confronted with his issue of sex with the prostitute  he found it hard to act on it  Sex without marriage being a rebellious thing to act on anyways  he soon realized that he would rather be in a relationship with someone  Through his rebellious struggles  Holden rarely reached out to others  Holden usually found himself reaching out to the past for relief  The past being his younger brother  Allie who was deceased  Holden seemed to hold on to Allie as source of happiness and comfort  Allie wasn t the only thing that Holden reached out to when he seemed to be at the edge of the cliff  Most of the time  he found himself resorting to alcohol  Holden also looked to one someone other than Allie for comfort  his young sister Phoebe  It was Phoebe that made Holden realize a lot of his problems in life  Phoebe made Holden realize that he indeed didn t like anything that was happening in his life  Holden at times communicated to himself and others in a vulgar tone  Which added a lot of intensity and anticipation of what he was going to say or do next  Although because of his vulgar tone I wouldn t recommend this book to those who are ages twelve and younger  mainly because of the influence and the potential message it might send to those of young age  Holden s attitude about life and his future was what really made you want to read more and more of the book  Holden seemed to have an  I don t give a crap  attitude about whatever he was going through in life  Which I can relate to at times  and I m sure others do as well  Despite Holden s many rebellious actions  he was a good person at heart  He seemed to only show his loving and caring side to his youngest sister Phoebe  Who at times was more mature than Holden himself   Holden at times communicated to himself and others in a vulgar tone  Which added a lot of intensity and anticipation of what he was going to say or do next  Although because of his vulgar tone I wouldn t recommend this book to those who are ages twelve and younger  mainly because of the influence and the potential message it might send to those of young age  Over all this book was a good read  and I d rate it a nine out of ten  Hope you enjoy   khb   hwldn khlfyd    tw

drm      of Times Read  14Date s  Read  Repeatedly between the year 2005 and 2009General Thoughts  I know that this novel is not for everyone  but I try my best to avoid negative reviews  The Catcher in the Rye means too much to me  It hurts me on an almost physical level to see people bash it  Take a look at that number at the top of this review  I read this book over and over again during my late high school and college years  It was a lifeline and a sanctuary for me  Holden Caulfield is my soulmate  If he s irritating and depressed and morose and immature and obsessive and uncool and desperate  then so was I  Like so many others  I saw myself in Holden  He made me laugh and he made me cry and he is one of my best friends  Insulting him means insulting me  I would not be who I am if not for this book  I love it forever and always  Holden  everything will be okay  Favorite Quote  Anyway  I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all  Thousands of little kids  and nobody s around   nobody big  I mean   except me  And I m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff  What I have to do  I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff   I mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them  That s all I do all day  I d just be the catcher in the rye and all  I know it s crazy  but that s the only thing I d really like to be   Thoughts on Adaptation  I hope that Salinger s wishes are respected and this novel is never  ever adapted to film  It cannot be  Soundtrack Recommendation   Beautiful Child  by Fleetwood Mac  If you told me you hate this book  I d probably understand why  there s not particularly much happening except Holden meeting people and feeling depressed and finding everyone  phony   and feeling sad and crap and swearing  But then  this is not a typical bildungsroman  Salinger set out not so much trying to capture the growth of  an initially  sullen protagonist as giving voice to one  The loneliness  sense of alienation felt by Holden  is minutely captured  and his rebellion non conformity against to the rules set by a world he is so estranged from  is resonant with what many feels at a certain age while trying to tally individuality or some of degree of eccentricity with societal expectations  This is a book you either hate or love   No doubt about it  lots of teenagers empathise with Holden Caulfield  I am no exception It is amazing how a book  published 60 years ago  is so relevant in this day and age  I hated this book when I was younger  All I could think was  man  that Holden Caulfield is a whiny little brat who needs to shut the eff up  and so I avoided the book like the plague for almost a decade and a half  I picked it up again two weeks ago and was surprised by how much I sympathized with Holden  which was kind of weird because he s a 16 year old boy and I m a woman on the cusp of 30  but whatever  I think what resonated most with me was his lack of the kind of social coping mechanisms that those of us who can t stand  phonies  and want an authentic life but don t want to crack up eventually develop over time   he was kind of like this walking wound  trying to put up fronts to protect himself from what he saw as a meaningless world but failing miserably  I felt bad for him but at the same time I felt hopeful that one day he d figure out how to deal and grow up to be a good  decent man To me  the book was about that moment in a person s life when they either figure out how to swim and thrive despite the bullshit  or they sink and perish because of it  I should have read this book as a youth as it might have propelled me to open more books and explore what one might find inside the cover  As the old saying goes  never judge a book by its cover  or in this case even the title  as J D  Salinger s bold  let it rip  writing style contrasts with many other classic writers The novel is centered on Holden Caulfield  an intelligent yet failing prep school youth  who is constantly intrigued by human behavior  especially phonies  Holden s frank impromptu inner thoughts become quite fascinating and humorous  His brash use of  goddam  grips you early on  but over time through repetition you come to expect it   I so enjoyed reading this book  but I didn t know why  Then I skimmed over the Sparknotes and realized that even though Holden was a  delinquent  16 year old boy living in the 1950s  and I am a  socially acceptable  53 year old woman living in 2015  we have a lot in common  Obviously this book will not appeal to everyone  but I think I may become obsessed with it  Someone recently suggested that I might benefit from reading a couple self help books  But I think that an in depth study of Holden will give me more insight on myself than any number of trendy self help books could   This book is such an anomaly  Short and self obsessed  narrowly focused but so profoundly far reaching in its observations on youth  frustration  promises deterred and potential greatness and happiness  More than anything else though  it s a novel about loneliness  It sneaks up on you  this book  and I had to reread the last chapter to try to get a better fix on the final mark it wished  I thought  leave  Oh Holden  Holden  Holden Caufield  I love this book  Some people say they don t understand Holden but I like him and relate to him even though I had none of his experiences   I finished The Catcher in the Rye exactly ten day before my twentieth birthday  Just as I was about to say my lengthy farewells to my teenage years  here comes Holden Caulfield and his hunting hat knocking me off that podium to resurrect me of my long forgotten angst and insecurities I found myself connected to Holden Caulfield  his acts of isolation and delusion of supremacy over his contemporaries and the rest of the world  the loosening grips on his youthful innocence and the desire to save the rest of this reality of growing up  the defiance and non acceptance of change and the intention of living in the less complicated past  a warm affection for family and mundane details like carousels and good old records  This novel affects me as it had highlighted every issue I willfully dejected of acceptance when I was younger  And now  being thrown into those memories once more  it feels depressing knowing that I am still just as troubled as Holden NOTE  The Catcher in the Rye is a timeless coming of age tale of a troubled young boy beset by the same issues all teenagers have  one way or another  found themselves tangled in  like  issues of identity  belonging  connection  and alienation  These themes are encountered throughout the novel  which may potentially put the reader in deep recollection of his own troubles as a teen  The language of J D  Salinger is extremely accessible to young readers  his syntax is unlike any other I ve read  Holden s life crisis is something most of us can relate with at one point or another    wondering about people s phoniness  experiencing loneliness  craving connections        So I m 15 and in the 10th grade and I had to read this book for school  I thought it was going to be a crap book that was hard to understand and boring etc I m sure you get my point  To be honest w you I was pretty sure I wasn t going to read the book at all  HOWEVER  now that I ve finished it  I ve labeled it as ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IVE EVER READ  Clearly it s in my TOP 5 Books  EASILY  Holden  the main character  is sarcastic and judgmental but all in all  he s just like me  and most all high school teens  He s just a kid trying to find his place in the world  not knowing where he s going or what will become if him  This book has fantastic quotes and life lessons  I really did love it  if you wanna know the truth  it s a really good read     I thought what I d do was  I d pretend I was one of those deaf mutes    p  198   That quote is why I finally decided I wanted to read the book  It shows up in The Ghost in the Shell  Stand Alone Complex series  My husband had read the book and said I should read it too so when the opportunity presented itself to me  I had to  Now having read the book I see much more of the of it in the series than just this short quote used by the Laughing Man Beyond inspiring an arc plot in an animae series  Catcher in the Rye seems to be the book that so many recent first person rambling books with teenage male protagonists spring from  The book reminds me a great deal of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time though better written  There s also a bit of Everything is Illuminated as well but again  much better written   Great book  From the perspective of  every depressing thing you have ever thought about   A young man  Holden Caulfield  questions the legitimacy of everyone and everything  Salinger does a terrific job of navigating the minute by minute thoughts of a mentally troubled teen  The thoughts of the character are extremely credible given the great consistency with which Salinger portrays them  The voice used by the narrator is laugh out loudable  Many of the  Holdenisms  were repetitive  but they never felt that way and did not seem corny despite frequent use  If you really want to hear about it  the first thing you ll want to know is why I wrote this review  what my lousy thoughts are  and all that other David Copperfield kind of crap but I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  This is one helluva good book  For chrissake  I could read the goddam thing ten times and not even get tired of it  Books these days are so goddam crumby though this one was swell  I was just about getting sore and all  too many goddam phony writers and such crumby characters  but Holden  he was damn charming  horsing around like one helluva crazy person  I would bet my dough you d like him too  Actual review  I had many interpretations on the themes of this book   Cynicism  loneliness  teenage angst etc      The real brilliance about it is just how well Salinger is able to reflect the attitudes of people on paper and just how believably he characterizes Holden and his reactions to the world around him  Sure  he s at times whiny and refuses to change his own prospects  he wants to escape society instead of overcome  he is judgmental  and many of his habits contradict each other  That s why I love Holden  He s real and you can relate to him  His problems apply to anyone  and his entire struggle is universal  Good to know he went back to school    And poor Mr  Antolini  He was NOT a flit  he was just drunk   I picked this book up on a whim while searching for another author  Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that I ve always felt I should read  yet never have  It was intriguing  It s a first person account  which I usually avoid  but this story could have been told no other way  I felt as if I were be taken into Holden Caulfield s confidence  Although at times I could hear the whiney  teenage petulance  He would complain about attributes of others  but then act in the very same way  Towards the end  I felt as if  as the reader  I was in part acting as his psychologist I could recognize pieces of myself in Holden  I could also recognize some of his attributes in others I know  I sympathized with him and his loneliness At times I found myself wishing I had Holden s ability to lie and make things up on the spot  It would make my life so much more interesting I read this book in one day  Perhaps I shouldn t have read it so quickly  but know that I will probably read it again  Maybe Holden is not indicative of how anyone should be  Maybe this book doesn t deserve its renown like some people say  All I know is that I couldn t put it down  The Catcher in the Rye is a bedrock of a literary genre  Although this book sometimes makes me feel sad and lousy  I can t help myself from re reading it every once in a while   Can people escape their way in life  Supposedly in Holden Claufield s  he can  After reading  The Catcher in the Rye  again after a couple of years  I felt that Holden wanted to live life on his own terms  Sometimes  however  living life according to their terms might not work  In Holden s case  he wanted to escape dealing with the consequences of flunking out of Pencey by taking a self discovery road trip that lead to violence  betrayal  and a  flitty  man petting his head while he was sleeping  He knew he had to tell his parents the truth about flunking out of Pencey  but what would he expect Perhaps maybe Holden or any person could build their own log cabins  and never get out  But eventually  they would have too  Great Book about a young boy  who is going through every one of us is   puberty  Young Holden Coulfield does t know what he wants to do in the future  what to expect from life  He is trying to get his first sexual experience  he is realizing that he loves a girl  He realizes his love to family This book unfortunately doesn t have its movie adaptation  but I would strongly suggest some of the regiseurs to take that opportunity  not because this book is really controversial  because of its vulgarisms  described sexuality and youth revolt  but because this book is a master piece of explanation of real life and youth  And I think that Mr  Salinger exactly explained what every youngling fears the most   becoming and adult  I loved the book  I loved how since it was told from a male teenager point of view  I could relate to it and feel for the kid  I don t think the profanity is too much  I think it gives a realistic feel for the character s situation and feelings  Plus  he is a tennage boy  and that s exactly hpw they talk  I feel like the whole apsect of how he gets kicked out really shows how hard headed he is  but it also shows that he is just looking for a place he can truly call home  I feel like every since his brother died  he has been sorta lost  When he  gets the ax  his attitude is sort of  Eh  i ll make new friends  somethin  different every time  I truly feel sorry for him because of his struggles throughout the story  Great book  absolutely loved it  I m not a big reader  but this really got my attention and im so happy i read it  He s the modern Huckleberry Finn  making his epic journey from school to New York  It may not sound like the stuff of great or lasting novels  but Salinger tapped into something with this depressed cynic of a teenager  It s something that not every reader will be able to grasp and or hold onto  but it s something you ll never forget  even if you hate the book   This book is one of my favorites  It still has the edginess and ingenuity it had when it was first published  I can completely agree with Holden s disillusions of the world around him Another thing I loved about this book was it s style of writing  Holden is a unique narrator  I just love how he digresses throughout the entire novel  It s ironic that he says he isn t going to tell about any  David Copperfield crap  and focus on his Christmas vacation  but through his digressions you learn all about him and his past  Wonderful to the end  A classic   Like Holden  I don t give a lot of hooey about what others think about CITR  I think it s brilliant and perfectly written in many parts  I think it should be required reading long after high school  I love the prism through which he sees the artifice of life  especially the East Coast bourgeoisie   I read this once as a kid and totally didn t remember it later  except that it had bad language and involved the main character sneaking into a sibling s room   I read it again and I am a Holden fan  Good God  Now I know why this book rules  So       where DO the ducks go anyway  And does he ever get a hold of old Jane Gallagher  I too catch bodies comin  through the rye  Paperback  288 pages  Publisher  Back Bay Books  Reissue edition  January 30  2001   Language  EnglishThe world that surrounds Holden Caulfield is full of excruciating disappointments  like the phonies who attend his prep school  And like the adults who teach there  Parents are often portrayed with all of their flaws  too  as Holden very diligently examines the world he sees and describes it for the reader in his first person narrative Almost from the opening paragraph  the reader can feel what Holden feels  see the world through his eyes  and begin to completely relate  even if the reader is an adult  When this sixteen year old shares his thoughts and feelings  we are reminded of our own adolescence  And while we may not have been prep school students living in New York  the feelings are universal Not belonging  Doubting everyone around us  Questioning the realities we see Holden has been expelled from still another school  and he has until the following Wednesday before his parents find out  He grabs the opportunity for freedom and leaves school early  On the streets of New York  his observations of life continue as he seeks out old friends who make him feel  not so depressed   One by one  they manage to disappoint him in some way  however  until finally he reconnects with his younger sister  And with her  he shares his passion to be someone who protects and saves other children from the disasters of life  He envisions them running toward a cliff in a field of rye and he  catches  them Sometimes I found Holden very depressing  but  of course  his feelings were coming through  His disillusionment was intense  I especially felt for him when the one adult he turns to near the end  a mentor and favorite teacher  does something he perceives as appalling  thus crushing still another idol in his mind A glimmer of hope presents itself near the end as the rain falls in the park and everything seems cleansed  Like a new start Beautiful and evocative  The Catcher in the Rye is a timeless coming of age tale  Five stars Why was The Catcher in the Rye banned The challenges generally begin with vulgar language  citing the novel s use of words like  goddamn   with more general reasons including sexual references  blasphemy  undermining of family values and moral codes  Holden s being a poor role model  encouragement of rebellion  and promotion of drinking  smoking  lying  and promiscuity   I decided to read The Catcher in the Rye after my aunt nicknamed me Caulfield  She says that I am always complaining about the show off people on my school  about actor s works  about my country  pretty much about everything  I googled about Holden Caulfield and the book itself but I haven t got interested about the story at all  In my mind it would be the something like Skins  you know  that TV show     but after a while being called Caulfield I decided to finally give a chance to it I went to a book shop near my house and bought a 15 bucks pocket edition just because I didn t felt like spending more than 20 reals on it  But God  I was wrong While reading the book I kept asking myself how can a book published in the early fifties describe so much what I am feeling now  a Brazilian  21st century girl  Salinger s writing is so fantastic that I felt the same thing as Holden while reading the book  When he got mad  I got mad  When he got real sad  I cried The only thing that made me heartbroken was the book being only 214 pages  at least in my edition  I had to read it in tiny bits so the book wouldn t be over so fast  All things considered  I believe this is a book that you either don t like the main character and hate it  or you identify to Holden and love it as much as I did  Kato uchenichka s m v zpriemala romana kato intriguvashcho chetivo

bit blue  uncertain  emotionally exhausted or just plain old miss Holden Caulfield then I grab my copy and start reading  Sometimes you feel the world doesn t understand you or maybe  you don t want to understand those around you  This book is not for everybody but for whom it is  the book is an absolute delight  Salinger s novel is truly a 20th century juggernaut  His protagonist Holden Caulfield  is both neurotic and highly sensitive  and it is his colourful narration which is the driving force behind the work  Many teachers and critics see Holden as being representative of the  Rebellious Teenager  trope and that his experiences in the book represent are a stage in life that everyone will reach and pass  Unfortunately  this mainstream interpretation is much too simplistic  Holden is certainly rebellious and disillusioned  but his perception  sensitivity and life experiences make him so much more than just an everyman  Salinger writes with a vulnerability that make his protagonist  and story  as authentic as they come   I think that the ending of this story is a very realistic one  Not everything is resolved  Holden never calls Jane  and we never find out if he succeeds in his life  I think the fact that Holden never calls Jane symbolizes him finally moving on from the past  him letting go  He s always in this perpetual state of loneliness that I think a lot of us can relate to  It s stupid and pointless  but we still feel it  Holden has good intentions  he just doesn t know how to put them into action with all of this negativity swarming around  I think this novel is just the beginning of Holden s story  It s about him pulling himself together  and taking his life seriously for once  We don t know what lies on the horizon for Holden  but that s what makes it so real  There s no  happily ever after   but the ending leaves us feeling refreshed and satisfied  Before reading this  I had someone tell me that the novel is terrible  That there is no maturation or development  So when I began reading it  I instantly decided that I don t favour it too much  About 30 pages into the book  I remember thinking  Wow  Holden is a complete asshole  All he does is criticises the people around him as if he s perfect   But reading further on  I really did enjoy this  I think that everyone should read this  and I will get my children to read this when they re very young  and then I will make them read it in their teenage years and I will make them read it during their adult years  This gives such a great overview of what it s like to be a teenager in a world you barely understand  Where you want to question everything but don t really understand what is you re questioning  How there are only a handful of people who don t irritate you  how there are people who irritate you but you don t do anything to remove yourself from them   OK  I guess everyone either loves or hates this book  it s hard to be indifferent to it  Of course many people have done something similar in the years since it was first published but it still remains unique in the perfection of the adolescent character s alienation from the society he lives in I was hooked from the first paragraph and on finishing the book  felt very sad  I wished it had gone on for hundreds of pages more You don t have to like the teenager or even identify with him to enjoy the book  Just imagine what this character is like  how he feels and then observe how seamlessly Salinger creates the language and behaviour that fit  Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger  was possible the best book i have read  The Author s choice of vocabulary gives us a vivid interpretation of the main character s personality  The ending though was very disappointing when Holden leaves his siter to go on his adventure  Lyk If U Cri Erytime This book is just perfection  I read it only because I was curious  I knew nothing about it when I started it    This is definitely a new favourite    This book was one of our set work books at school  I think that I was one of the few people in the grade that actually enjoyed this book and definitely the only one out of my friends that enjoyed it  This book is well written and for me personally  is very relatable  There are so many things about the main character in the book  Holden Caulfield  that I feel people  especially teenagers  can relate to  I understand that people might have issues with the book in terms of blasphemy  although most reviews say that this is not meant in a blasphemous way  and the amount of swearing  There is actually not that much swearing in the book and when it is done it adds to the character and is not just put there for the sake of having swearing in the book  Definitely a book that I would recommend to others  When seeing these reviews it reminds me of what my American Literature professor said about this book  You either hate it or love it there never seems to be any middle ground when it comes to this novel  I loved it personally because when you read it more than once your stance on the whole thing can change  One passage you thought meant one thing can be seen from another view when you read it again I am a little late to read this book as the English lit course I took in high school did not include this book  I am catching up on what I have missed out  So far this book has been great  The technique the author uses and the fact how the boy is referring to the audience directly make a difference and make this an interesting read  If you haven t read it yet  you should consider it because you will like it   I read the Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  It has 214 pages When I first saw the book  i thought it will be too difficult for me to read  I saw the word  rye  and it just blew my mind The cover of the book is not that detailed however you cannot judge a book by its cover I was not really excited to read the book  When I started to read the first couple of pages  it caught my attention  The Catcher in the Rye is fiction  I typically do not read those books  I usually read books that are based from true events A character that I thought was interesting was Holden  Holden is the main character and as the readers we just see his view points  Holden is very optimistic  When he describes people  he always talks about their negative side  He only describes their weaknesses  Throughout the book  you rarely hear any positive details that comes from Holden  Holden is also very immature  He does not like to talk about sex that much  Whenever he does talk about it  he ends up talking about other things  This tells us that he is immature because he does not know hoe to handle situations like that  Another character that seemed interesting to me was Phoebe  Holden s younger sister  She is very arrogant  She wants to know everything that she asks  We see at one point in the book that Phoebe and Holden meet  It s almost the end of the book and Holden visits Phoebe  He tells Phoebe that he does not go to school anymore  Phoebe seems very arrogant when she asks him questions that Holden does not want to answer  When Holden wants to change the conversation  Phoebe still wants to talk about Holden not going to school  The book is about a college student named Holden that goes through a lot  After he is kicked out of school  instead of retrying again and try to go back to school  he just gives up  He does not even try to go back to school Two themes that i thought were important in this book were immature and freedom  Holden wants to be free  That s why he does not go back to school  yet he has other ideas in mind that does not involve education  A quote that i found   Finally  what i decided i d do  i decided i d go away  i decided i d never go home again and i d never go away to another school again    Salinger 198   This quote tells us that Holden just wants to be free  He wants to leave everything behind even his family  My point of view of this book is so far really good  I think of the book as a motivation  I see the book as a motivation because Holden that does not know how to appreaciate the education  There are many people  including me  that would like to be in the position that he is  Even though i do not like Holden  I will still recommend it to a friend because it s kind of like a motivation to keep learning and having a carrer  I ve read Catcher before and I rated it 5 out of 5 stars and I can t remember much of it at all  This must be the third time I ve read the book  the last was in 2008  and I m having trouble remembering why I loved it so much the last time I read it  Don t get me wrong  I do love the book  I love the voice of Holden Caulfield who s a bit confused  a bit ambivalent  a bit certain  a bit sexy  a bit coy  and very unpredictable  I love how Salinger gives him actions instead of emotions  confusion and uncertainty instead of feelings and reasons  I read somewhere that no actor could ever do justice to Holden Caulfield except possibly Salinger himself  Well  I have a candidate   a person I m very fond of mentioned the book in passing and I m having a hard time not thinking of him as Holden  I m reading this book in the shadow of this person and picking out details that are consistent with his character and laughing at the similarities  he drinks malted milk  he s fond of his little sister  his sense of humour  his slight misanthropy  his way of speaking  There are differences of course but their worldviews seem very similar  It makes me love both him and Holden Caulfield more   Possibly my favorite book of all time  This being one of my first classic novels I read outside of school  I was kind of nervous to start this  but I do not regret it  I loved this book so much  J D  Salinger captured the essence of teenage angst perfectly  People complain about not liking Holden and I think that is partly because they don t like teenagers or forget what it s like to be one  Holden complains a lot  Teenagers complain a lot  Holden curses a lot  Teenagers curse a lot  I believe Salinger was real to Holden and his decisions throughout the novel and I related to him very well  While the book has no real driven plot  I was enraptured in following around a teenage boy around New York  This is a superb work and recommend it to any teen or adult  Recently I ve come upon the basis that the value of this book is highly disputed about  I found this book to hold of much worthy content  however  The writing is excellent  along with the plot  Reading this story in class  forcefully being made to analyze each chapter  I have revealed that much symbolism is used  Though the symbols are very subtle  they come to create much understanding  Now  the first time I read the ending  harsh opinions and feelings were formed toward Salinger for leaving it open ended  Many questions abruptly formed in my mind  leaving me with no answers  Did Holden attempt suicide  If so  how  Will he try to do so after he escapes the grasp of the mental institution  Then  after several times of thinking about the vague ending  I realized that it s brilliant  It leaves it s readers forever questioning and making up their own ending  Instead of each person reading and grasping the same words that explain one ending  The Catcher in the Rye allows each to experience and produce their own conclusion  Magnificent   The Catcher in the Rye is an exciting book  I really love how it looks as if Holden is actually using his own words  it is just like he is talking out loud  we can read his voice on the page this story mixes childhood innocence in the form of Holden s sister  Phoebe  and the phoniness as Holdoen thinks of it in most adults in the form of Mr  Antolini  It mixes two things that are basically opposites  and uses it to make Holden hate to become mature  Holden is neither a child nor a grownup because he sees becoming mature as losing a part of yourself rather than growing to become a better person  I love how he can fit a lot of his jaw dropping experiences over two days in the story  We can all relate to him at the start since he starts of in a private school  known as Pencey Prep  The fight between Holden and his roommate is sad because it starts of with the roommate not being able to appreciate a theme Holden wrote for him about his deceased brother  Allie s baseball glove  Holden showed it in the book  and at points you just can t take it anymore in life when his roommate win the fight  and Holden took the first train he could find to New York City instead of returning  To his parents on Christmas Break  a joyous time where families care for eachother which only emphasises Ho dens rage towards the school  I love how now as Holden is on a sanitarium he misses everyone  even the jerks  and especially his precious little sister Phoebe  Only is his dream  Came true of being  the catcher in the rye   He would stand in a field of rye at the edge of a cliff waiting for children to almost fall to only save them  This book is something I cannot truly express  and the only way you will understand it is by rising it yourself   Wow  Just   What an amazing book  right from the beginning  this book pulled me in  the main character Holden Caulfield  a rebellious young man who gets kicked out of his school  The entire novel takes place in the period of about 5 days  He goes around New York City doing whatever he wants using his leftover money he had  He wants to do anything he can before he breaks the news to his parents that he got kicked out    again  Even though the book s only main character is Holden  he goes through so much change and is so interesting that you want to keep reading to see what happens  This book isn t called a classic for nothing  back when this was first published  many people were shocked because the book had  bad language  such as  crap  or  helluva   The book should be read by everyone because it is one of the best books ever written  khtb jlbyhHdql z bykhyly qhrmn dstt wsh tjrbh hy jdydsh khwshm wmd Holden Caulfield is an annoying prat whose horrible teenage angst never annoyed me  I may have just been relating  but it embellished the novel and made it fun to pick out his flaws and the holes in his narration  A fantastic story of rebellion  What can I say that hasn t already been said  I fall into the camp of loving the narrative and relating heavily to the unfolding tale and characterisation  Stands the many tests of time  I m about due to read this one again  I get something new from it every time  The world is terrible and everyone is a phony  or at least that is how Holden Caulfield sees it  Holden Caulfield  from the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger  is a pessimistic seventeen year old with a head of grey hair who cannot stay in a school  Holden comes from a rich family  loves his little sister Phoebe  but cannot stand the rest of the world  In his eyes  no one is ever real or honest  everyone is a  phony   He believes to be so alone in the world  so alone in his views  that he often says  I swear to God I m a madman   The book follows Holden after he gets kicked out of yet another school  and his three days alone in New York City  During that time  Holden meets two nuns  gets into a fight with a pimp  goes on a date  seriously considers suicide twice  get extremely drunk  reminisces on his old friend Jane and his dead brother Allie  and takes Phoebe on a carousel  Throughout all this  Holden is standing there with an endless stream of cynicism  wit  and pessimism  In the end though Holden still seems very jaded in his world view  but something does change  Holden realizes  and teaches the reader  that no matter how bad the world might seem  one can always find a bastion in loving relationships Holden is primarily a pessimist  but secondarily a hypocrite  Throughout the whole book  he criticizes other of their actions  and consistently he is guilty of such crimes himself  For instance  he criticize a friend of his for calling him  Boy   Throughout the rest of the book Holden calls half of the people he meets boy  He is the adolescent mind  critical of things in other people that are in themselves  Holden s pessimism does have a good root  in the tragic and early death of his brother Allie  Allie was a kind sensitive  bright boy  who wrote poems on his baseball glove so he could read them in the field  Allie was killed by leukemia four years before the events of the book  and Holden is still understandably bitter  He thinks the world is a terrible callous place  that will never allow peace  such as his brother  and this is shown through a very odd series of events late in the book  First  while staying at an old teacher s house when he has no money  the seemingly innocent and cozy place takes a dark turn  Holden wakes up in the middle of the night to find his former teacher caressing him  and he runs away as fast as he can  This is followed up the next day by going to Phoebe s school  a place of education and learning  and seeing a  Fuck You   260  written on the wall  Angry at someone corrupting the innocence of the world  he rubs it off only to find another  Fuck You  on the wall  only this time etched into the stone  Unable to do anything about that message  and still waiting for Phoebe to get out for recess  he goes to the museum right next door  He goes to the Pharaoh s tomb  and stands there alone  quiet  peaceful  only to realize there is yet another  Fuck You   264  written in red crayon on the wall of the tomb  This represents that in childhood  corruption exists  but one can rub it out and go on carefree  When alive  corruption is all around  and there is nothing any person can do about it  Finally  even in death corruption is still there  Holden himself talks about that idea saying that his tombstone will  say  Holden Caulfield  on it  and then what year I was born and what year I died  and then right under there it ll say  Fuck You     264  Caulfield is shaken after these events  and then the redemption of relationships occurs  On his way to Phoebe s school  Holden is walking down the block  and suddenly believes that  I d never get to the other side of the street   256   He thinks he is going to just keep walking and walking and walking  and that he will never see the end  Holden then does something he himself does not understand  saying to himself  Allie  don t let me disappear  Please  Allie  Allie  don t let me disappear   over and over again  thanking Allie every time he made it to the end of the block  After the unfortunate series of  Fuck You  s  Allie takes his sister out of school  and takes her to a carousel  she gets on the carousel  on an old horse  and rides it around three times  On the third way around  it starts pouring rain  and all the parents of the little kids run onto the carousel to shelter themselves  Holden does not  Holden stays in the rain  he lets the world rain on his parade and he is fine with it  Holden realizes on that day that the world is going to take every opportunity it has to make a person miserable  to take away what they love  Holden realizes that the only thing a person can hold onto are relationships  with those alive and with those dead  it does not matter  as long as the relationship is true and loving  Holden is still cynical  Holden is still angry  but he is at peace with the way things are  just as long as he has his sister and his brother   I hadn t read this novel in at least 30 years  and I was worried that it would disappoint  but it still retains its freshness and power to move me  The 1950s New York City prep school setting was already in the distant past when I first read the book  but I think it s worn really well    especially as Mad Men has reacquainted us all with the particular WASPy mix that was 1950s NYC  The main thing about this book is the VOICE  Holden Caulfield is  and will always be  such a strong  clear voice for a particular form of adolescent angst that most of us experience in some degree  The idealism and the cynicism  the emotional authenticity and the phoniness  Even as Holden criticises the world around him  you sense that double edged adolescent quality of being attuned and obtuse both at the same time  He is selfish and selfless  neurotic and innocent  he is crushed by the weight of parental and class expectation  and also cushioned by his enormously privileged station in life  There were some nuances to Holden s nervous breakdown that I had completely forgotten  his brother s death  for instance  and his anxiety about being hit on by his former teacher   Actually  this scene is incredibly vague and could be interpreted a number of ways    but you could make a case that Holden has worries about his sexual orientation   All in all  I was just in love with this book as I was when I was 16  Truly a classic  I read this for the first time in year 12 when we had to study it in English and I hated it  I knew it was a good book but I hated the way we had to study it all  I was so sick of the words   ostracized  and   phoney  and   identity   If my teacher mentioned one more time that Holden s red hat was a symbol of him trying to fit in with his red headed siblings I would have screamed  But I didn t want to give up on it so I gave it another chance  I m so glad I did because I loved it the second time around  I can finally see how sweet of a boy Holden is and how much pain he is in  His mind is so messed up and I enjoyed being with him as he tried to sort out his life and find somewhere he belonged  I m sorry I hated it at school because I feel like it could ve helped me back then  I wish I d had a teacher who didn t make it so boring   Holden Caulfield thinks you are a phony  You and me both  to be honest  I grabbed this book not even knowing what it was about  just acknowledging it was a classic being sold very cheap at the bookstore  Then I decided to read just because I needed something short between  The Vampire Lestat  and  To Kill A Mocking Bird   I Invited some friends to read along and they were all in  but also thinking of it as a mushy romance  I love you forever doesn t matter how long we d be apart  kind of book  What a surprise  Salinger s style reminded me SO MUCH about the Beat Generation  which I love   even though he wasn t one of them  I absolutely adored the intonation patterns now and then presented on the stressed syllables  And don t even get me started on how much I laughed hard while reading it  sometimes even in public places  where people would just stared at me thinking I was some sort of a weirdo     But be ready to feel heartbroken sometimes  it will happen in such a melancholic way you wouldn t ve even know what hit you and how much in perspective you shall put some conceptions you have regarding your own life and and your very own choices  Damn  you re definitely going to question yourself  if you want to know the truth  And then you can talk endlessly to your fellas about it and each of you will have a different opinion  which is gonna be grand  It s totally worth the hype and the attention it has been getting throughout the years  even though we are corny and phony and probably would bore the hellaout Holden  the most amazing 16 year old I ve ever met  I love how human he is and can be at the same time incredibly careless  and selfish and arrogant and yadda yadda just like any other teenager  and still be able to feel and to be moved by the simplest things in life that wouldn t ve touched anyone else but him  And he ll let you know that  he will  Gotta luv this goddam old kid  though  I truly love his perceptions  I really do  Be prepared to feel both breathless and speechless sometimes  This book won t let you stand idly by or would let you go incognito  You just take sides  you do  And you re going to love  to hate  to live  to laugh  to cry and will desperately try to end up this insane cycle of cynicism we ve been living in for a while now  There s so much more in us than the little amount we re willing to let people see  P S   Whatever happened to the ducks       Nobody d be different  The only thing that would be different would be you  Not that you d be so much older or anything  It wouldn t be that exactly  You d just be different  that s all  You d have an overcoat on this time  Or that kid that was your partner in line last time had got scarlet fever and you d have a new partner  Or you d have a substitute taking the class  instead of Miss Aigletinger  Or you d heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom  Or you d just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them  I mean you d be different in some way   I can t explain what I mean  And even if I could  I m not sure I d feel like it        Certain things they should stay the way they are  You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone  I know that s impossible  but it s too bad anyway  Anyway  I kept thinking about all that while I walked    The exhilarating novel  The Catcher in the Rye  by J D  Salinger  is told in the first person by Holden Cauldfield from a rest home where he has been sent for therapy in the 1950 s telling the story of three days of his life  This young man  17  has just flunked out of the boarding school  Pencey Prep   in Agerstown  Pennsylvania  failing four of his five subjects  Holden tells the story in a way that holds your attention from beginning to end  Whether you are a teenager  or you have teenagers  or you just remember being  like that   his story holds you  He does not know what he wants in life  or why people want what they want of him  The story is all about a flashback of his previous struggle through a rough part of his life before his mental breakdown  At this point in his life  Holden can not even accept his own  being called  phony  day and night  He is having a hard time with everyday life and eventually this and other factors lead to his mental breakdown  He aimlessly wanders around the vast city of New York  New York  staying at hotels and going to night clubs  He eventually talks to the one person he trust  his younger sister  only 10  Phoebe  She has an interesting role in Holden s life  for she is the only one Holden feels he can relate to  She seems to complicate the novel  She is only ten but has the maturity to realize that Holden s bitterness toward the rest of the world is really bitterness toward himself  She sees that he is a deeply sad  insecure young man who needs love and support  He sneaks into his parent s apartment at night to talk to his sister  He tells her about his dream to be a  catcher in the rye   and that he wants to run away  To me  this book is a masterpiece  a fine work of art that was painted by the brilliance of J D   Jerome David  Salinger  The story held on to me and made me want to read to the sun rose in the morning  I particularly enjoyed how the story is told  It is made clear that Holden is in this correctional facility recovering from his breakdown  He shows us what happened the three days before it all fell apart  This was a twist in the story considering most stories told in the form of a flashback is when the narrator is old and or returning from a great journey  not post a mental breakdown  One thing that really had my attention throughout the book  was how he was so young but drinking  smoking  flirting with older women  and getting away with it all  To me  he is obviously heading down hill in his life and can not see the light at the end of the tunnel  The way Salinger set this piece makes it better and better every time I have read it  which is actually thrice  One of the big themes in The Catcher in the Rye  is  The adult world is phony   He explains how adults can be amazingly fake   phony   and get away with it because they believe what they are is real  Being a teenager myself  this theme connects with me and I agree with it 99  plus 1  You do the math  Throughout the flashback  he meets many who seem contaminated with this plague  Holden puts so much effort into finding and exposing this phoniness that he cannot see his own problem he has with being a phony  Every time Holden thinks   Wow  Fake      he is being incredibly hypocritical almost wanting me to stand up and yell  Look in the mirror dumb      The book  plot  and all other elements of the novel are astounding and I think you  yes you whom is reading my review  should get yourself a copy today  You may have your own opinions but I think the small  6 99 dollar fee on Amazon com to purchase this book and own your own copy is quite worth it  I recommend it to all and maybe it will become one of your favorites as it has become one of mine    Me aburro cuando  las personas  no divagan nada en absoluto   Que harias tu si te expulsaran de la escuela preparatoria tres dias antes de terminar el curso Holden Caulfield decide no quedarse en su escuela en Pensilvania y adelantar su llegada a Nueva York sin que sus padres se enteren El libro es la descripcion de aquello que vive en esos dias  Escrito en un lenguaje propio de la edad del protagonista nos adentramos en la Gran Manzana de la posguerra  Una epoca que si bien no era todo felicidad  al menos se esperaba que el futuro brillara en las mentes de los mas jovenes  Y ese no es el caso de Holden Cualquier persona que haya pasado por la adolescencia puede entender perfectamente su sentir  Sus pocas expectativas sobre lo venidero  Sus constantes quejas  Y si quieren la forma fantasiosa en que a veces planea resolver su vida De las cosas que me atrajeron particularmente esta la forma en que divaga al narrar  Puede comenzar hablando sobre como odia la escuela  ligarlo con sus experiencias en escuelas pasadas  recordar una tarde lluviosa  hablar de su infancia y volver al tema inicial  Es fantastico  Es casi como leerle la mente   I wasn t forced to read this in high school so I finally got around to it  I m glad because I don t think this book should be taught to high school kids  not because it s offensive or anything but I just don t think most people have had enough life experience at that point to really understand this book   Holden Caulfield is an interesting character because he s kind of a loser in a lot of ways  but he doesn t try to pretend to be any better than he actually is  and when he tries to fit into the world around him it just doesn t work because he s looking for something a lot deeper than what he s finding around him  He gets angry at all the superficiality he sees in his friends and acquaintances  However I don t think he s incapable of liking anything  I just think he s looking for deep people  and they are hard to find  He obviously loves all his siblings dearly and it s very touching  especially his relationship to his younger sister  The scene at the end where he is watching her on the merry go round and is crying because he feels truly happy is such a beautiful scene  He also sees that his brother D B  is actually a really good writer and is angry at him for going to Hollywood  which he sees as a waste of his talent  He really cares about Jane because she s very genuine and she s not a  phony  like most of the other girls he knows  such as Sally who just seems to be a social climber interested in looking smart and knowing important people   He also really loves dancing and having good conversations with people but it s difficult for him to find people who want to talk about the things he wants to talk about  When he finds a girl who s a great dancer she pays absolutely no attention when he tries to have a conversation with her and of course that aggravates him because he wants to have a connection to people   He also really takes a liking to the nuns he meets in a cafe  and he likes that they don t wear any makeup and they re not off on their way to some swanky restaurant or to go shopping like the other women in his life   Really he s a lot like all of us  It s all well and good to have a drink every now and then and just dance around  but it really doesn t mean anything if that s all there is to life  Most of us want to find a deeper connection to someone and it gets aggravating to be surrounded by superficial people   I found this book really interesting  I can sort of see why people compare  the Bell Jar  to it  and I feel like in both cases the main characters are looking for a deeper meaning to life and are having trouble finding it  Parts of both books take part in New York  which I think is also important   This book is also hilarious  There are some bits of dialogue that are absolutely priceless and for some reason a few scenes reminded me of  the Sopranos    I really enjoyed this book and I definitely recommend it but I probably wouldn t suggest reading it in high school or at a younger age   This is the only book I can recall that I ve read twice and I m glad I did  This second time I read it nearly straight through  I especially loved Holden s narration  true to his voice and manic depressive outbursts Holden also reminds me of an ex  someone who also struggled with people s authenticity     consistently defaulting to a position that everyone around them  especially those with money  were fake  shallow  insincere and couldn t trust anyone s intentions  And took it upon himself to confront such hypocrisy independent of any social structures or standards  Salinger simply nails it I can t help but draw comparisons to other contemporary  rich boys  struggling to find their place and meaning  Igby Goes Down  though a movie   Less Than Zero  The Rules of Attraction  which I m reading now   Oh the Glory of it All  non fiction     many  many more And I keep pausing on how Salinger s story unfolds over a weekend  Then I think about how similar these stories are  even though they re 40  years apart  Without spiraling into a long side conversation thought hole  I do find it interesting that though the root of these boys   pain  or  struggle  seem similar  the role of drugs  alcohol and sex differ  making them more the egg the chicken hatched than the chicken that bore the egg  4 5 stars The first thing that I d like to say is that this book made me care  I m not insensitive in any way  I like to think that I m really good when it comes to being empathetic towards others and understanding what they re feeling  but this book was something else  I was able to take Holden s misery like a physical box and look at every aspect of it  not just what s on the outside  I looked inside it  I analyzed its corners  what they meant  I made it my own  The Catcher in the Rye is one of those stories of which one either looks at the surface only or is able to go beyond the actual words  For the people who think that s all the stories  let me tell you something  when you read a novel that got to you the way this novel did for me  you ll understand  I love when this happens because the novels really say something about each reader depending on the way they ve felt afterwards  I know readers who ve felt this way about Huckleberry Finn or The Picture of Dorian Gray  This usually happens with novels which discuss controversial topics  usually arising discomfort because of its strong opinions  novels which may have been banned at some point in history cough  cough   Why not all novels  Well  let s just say that there s not much for a person to care when there s a book that doesn t present strong opinions or ideas  If an individual can t hate it  another one can t love it  right  These are opposites which come together  one doesn t tend to happen without the other one  And without strong opinions or ideas there s not much for a person to hate  I ve heard people complain about how this novel has no plot and is nothing without the analysis or  deeper meaning   I wouldn t call it nothing  There s this sixteen year old boy  Holden would want me to call him a boy  nothing else  who is frustrated with life itself  His team lost a competition  actually  they didn t show up  because of him  he s being kicked out of school and he has no real friends  This story was  to me  a good read on its own  not amazing  but a good one  And then  after giving it a first read  I started rereading  analyzing  really paying attention to what Holden was saying  I m not a fan of rereading until I know every line  analyzing until there is nothing to be analyzed  but this book was worth it  I knew that there was so much more  I knew that J  D  Salinger hadn t written just one superficial novel and that was it  So I started paying attention to Holden s red hat and how he bought it after having lost the team s equipment on a subway  in a moment of weakness  and how it gave him confidence  Then there is his love for the New York museum he goes to with Phoebe  a place in which nothing ever changes  which is very symbolic because he  himself  does not want to change  Then all of those contradictions  he does not want to throw a snowball to a car because it looks so clean and he is so innocent  but then  a day after  he smokes and gets wasted  All of these unobvious things  together  form a moving  thought provoking novel about a helpless boy and his struggle  Moving on to less abstract aspects of the book  I like how J  D  Salinger took advantage of the context  post war social disorganization among other things  to show readers what extreme a misunderstood sixteen year old can reach  Holden s desperation to be listened to merges with his big dream to stop the clocks and freeze time resulting in a beautiful story anyone at any point in history could sympathize with  some more than others   Its words are carefully chosen  I ve read somewhere the phrase  sort of  appears 179 times  this isn t poor writing  this is excellent writing  so that readers can easily understand Holden s situation  He always starts conversations with  Hey  listen  or  Look  because he desperately wants to be listened to  But of course  almost no one pays attention to him  and the only one who does seems to have other intentions  which is really sad  Holden is confused  and we love him for it  Some people think that he is irritating and didn t like him as a protagonist because he complains a lot about the  phonies  that surround him and how they are all hypocrites  But can t you see that all of those complaints and imperfections J  D  Salinger enhances so clearly when it comes to Holden are there to make a point  Holden sees these  phonies  and  hypocrites  and feels desperate because he is trapped  He s angry and pissed and hates everything because he knows that eventually he will grow up  and when he does  he will inevitably become all of those things  The only person in the story he seems to actually care about is little Phoebe  who is a kid  Holden does not want to grow up  he wants to remain the way he is and stop others from growing up  because when one grows up one becomes all of this horrible things and one loses his innocence  If no one else is willing to  he wants to be the one to stop the inevitable  to be the catcher in the rye  I admit that this novel is not perfect  but taking into account what J  D  Salinger wanted to accomplish I think that we can agree that it s a great one  I ve read this book cover to cover only three times  butI wouldn t mind reading it five  ten  or even more   I told myself I wouldn t like this book  but now it s my favorite YA book  Why is that  The catcher in the rye is an amazing book  When I first start reading the book and didn t find it very intersting book  But as I was keep on reading and reading I was so into the book  The book is about a boy who thinks his parents don t like him from my point of view  But also he thing his parents like his older brother because he is a Hollywood director  One interesting thing about him is that he likes his brother more than anything  but he hates his parents  So it s like going totally opposite and his doing the things that he shouldn t  Also his not interested in school and he likes his teachers  But he hates the work the teachers give it to him   HOLDEN  Where are you so we can have a drink       Haha I absolutely loved everything about this short novel  A friend told me this was his favorite book and that I should read it  so I did  And my God  I loved it  Loved it loved it  The main character Holden  is by far the only person that I really wish I could meet and have as a friend  He d probably think I m phony  Only because I m a girl  Lol anyways  With how hilarious his persona is and his potty mouth going off constantly your going to enjoy this book   Must have a sense of humor in order to read  and just keep in mind not all books have a lesson to be learned  There are books like these that fall under a category I like to call  fun reads  meaning enjoy the damn book  There s everything to love about it  Plus it s plot is in NYC  Another reason I loved it  If you live in New York City or you ve lived in New York City you can relate to every possible place he mentions in this book  And that is pretty awesome   Much  much better than I rememberedIf I started digging the gold out of every passage that I thought was brilliant  there really wouldn t be an end  so I ll just jot down my favorite  It s pretty unrelated with the main point that Salinger wanted to get across I guess  but more than the teenage cynicism and angst  which earned quite a few laughs in its own right   I loved the relationship between Holden and his little sister  Phoebe  It s really the only relationship that develops throughout the whole novel  so perhaps that s the reason why I found it so touching  In a world where he s obviously searching for some form of meaning or happiness  he doesn t find it in intelligence  in wealth  or in superficial relationships  rather  he finds it through an afternoon spent with his sister  Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books and a true classic  It follows a frustrating main character named Holden Caulfield  that is blunt and phony  However  as you read  you can t help but want to continue on in his journey  Throughout the novel  Salinger develops Holden s character by making him go through tough situations and meet a great deal of colorful people  This is a classic  coming of age  novel  that creates understandings for such a struggling character  The customary way to look at this  is as a coming of age story  A 17 year old boy who s struggling to come to terms with the commitments and responsibilities that a well adjusted adulthood requires  One who s cynicism and lack of obedience call into question his psychological disposition  as well as his ability to make the transition into adulthood successfully  The lengthy meditations on his childhood museum trips  the summer days spent with Jane and especially  the brother he lost  all betray Holden s nostalgia for the past  And further contribute to the question of his maturity  All together  he can t deal with anything  doesn t like anything and can t do anything right  We learn right away that he can t even keep track of his sporting equipment Or is it that Holden is one of the sensitive ones  one who sees through it all  A clever reader isn t supposed to buy into this cleverness  He is awful smart  though  And observant for a young kid  We re supposed to question his reliability as a narrator because  well  because he s blinded by his own disdain for everything  But Salinger s nascent tendency and leanings toward eastern spirituality serve as an indication of the root of his protagonist s general discomfort in life  The illusory world  defined by material gain and interest  is ripe for all manner of game playing  games less innocent than Jane s checkers  Piercing this veil  seeing through this world of appearances and machinations  where conformity gets you the prize  the approval and a good lay  is no small feat And for your accomplishment  you end up looking like the weirdo  It almost makes you think of Camus  The Stranger  especially the beginning of that book  when Camus  lead couldn t grieve for his mother in the way that was expected by society  Oh  the absurdity of a manufactured  or as Holden is wont to say  a phony emotion  Even though our young Holden Caulfield is smart  he s getting the ax  Again  Why  Mostly for his lack of conformity  He doesn t write papers exactly as instructed  even though there s no lack of creativity  as evidenced by the paper he wrote for Stradlater   nor does he join in the testosterone fueled  group jeer fest  just because some kid digressed in his classroom speech Everyone s a phony  It s all artificial  Artificial  just like his brother s Hollywood  itself  the very same Hollywood that took a good writer and reduced him to a tool  And it ll keep going round and round like the carousel  or like Hinduism s own samsara   the endless cycle of life and death which will continue until we wake up  We ll keep playing the games  like acting in a grand  absurdist theater  just like that Christmas play Sally loved so much  We ll continue all the nonsense  We ll keep defending the bad guys and fooling each other and stealing from each other  And we ll make big money doing it  The highest calling in Salinger s beloved Gita is  after all  service to others   Catching  others  as in Holden s fanciful vision  But going around drunk will never get you off this ride  Yes  Holden teeters between nobility and the inebriation  in all its varieties  that keep us on this merry go round  And that s where he s stuck  But alas  no one has offered him any real options  Is there room for a soul like Holden s in this world  Until we wake up to our own truth and integrity  and until  we have the courage to stick with it  as only a precious few ever have  we ll continue to be beaten  as he himself was  in that miserable hotel room Because much too often  not giving in  not giving up your ideals or your integrity  gets you expelled  Or like Castle  costs you your life  But it s the only way off the ride  When it comes to reviewing  The Catcher in the Rye   it s not particularly interesting to look at the story itself  I mean  the story is similar to Brett Easton Ellis   Less than Zero   it is somewhat outdaded for people like you and I who read in the 21st century and nothing seems to happen in it  There is not a natural climax  a potent conflict  etc  However  what should be subject for reviewing is Holden and his relationships with the characters in the book  Holden himself seems to be your average mainstream rejecting and counter culture embracing teenager  which still resides in us all no matter how old we get  The worst way to describe a person in his mind is to call them  phonies  or  dopeys   he dislikes pretentious people  or at least people he perceives to be pretentious  and he dislikes people who s had just an ounce of  societal success   i e   people with often applauded accomplishments Holden seems to only possess two moods  but he describes them in a juvenile fashion  which is strangely enticing  Things can either  kill  him or  depress  him   kill  is being used in a positive wa to describe to the reader something that is hilarious to him  It is quaint  though  that something that evokes froth and joy in him should be described with a word usually subject to negative connotations  but this could just be his insipid use of colloquial terms  The women closest to Holden are Sally Hayes and his sister Phoebe  The rendezvous Holden has with Sally seems to be somewhat of a turning point in his mannerisms  at the end of it  without spoiling it to the soon to be reader  he trots out of the encounter with seemingly more confidence  At least in relation to Sally Hayes  he still avoids the main girl that propels the entire novel into action  which is  in the words of Holden   helluva depressing   I don t want to talk about Holden s relationship with his sister Phoebe as you really need to read about it yourself to get it to the fullest extent like Salinger wanted In closing  read this book  There is nothing more to say  I loved how the author used the name  catcher in the rue  to describe one of the main themes of this book and how he critically and indirectly described all the adults to be hypocritical  It showed clear message and the devices used in this book were just great I really enjoyed this novel  I feel as though if you read this in high school  it might be interesting to pick it up and re read it  You may have a new take on the entire story    Catcher in the Rye  is a compelling story about a teenage boy who s transitioning from childhood to adulthood  Holden wanders around New York while facing the present based on his past  I personally think that he achieves and propels his life forward in an unexpected turn  This page turner novel is the ideal book for any teenage  Although it can be argued that it s a bad influence towards the teenage mind  I think that it s actually the opposite  the passion  the fear teens face everyday and their way of  escaping  portrays the chaotic mind of a young adolescence  This was my very first intellectual book  and i was 16 at the time  As a child  I was never fond of reading books  i was a television kind of girl  No teacher also opened me up to the world of books  until i moved to another school  The first time i had read  The Catcher in the Rye   my mental capacity to see past the narrative level was zero  So  I was completely lost till the day in which we started exploring the novel  J D Salinger who had just come out of fighting the war  no longer saw the world as it is  This distortion  resulted him to write   The Catcher in the Rye   a book about a boy s misplace in society   to put it short  identity and belonging  The book contains a lot of symbolism   words that do not explicitly state what they mean  for the narrative chooses the words  In reading this book  much of Holden s words can not be trusted   you would have to find  truth  in Holden through his actions  and the slip of words  I would recommend this book to a lot of adolescents  whom would be able to position themselves in Holden s situation   as a child  but growing up to be an adult  the in between phrase of life that becomes very confusing for us  But come to realize the  reality  of it all  through the experiences of Holden Caulfield  The Catcher in the Rye is truly one of those books that will never get old because there will always be teenagers in the world who can understand Holden Caulfield s struggle  This book exemplifies an attitude that is often chillingly real in regards to how people treat each other and how being a teenager isn t always the greatest time of one s life  filled with disappointment  rejection  and fake people  In regards to the man who shot John Lennon supposedly at the behest of this book  I do believe that this book is more realistic than others  portraying people often in a light for which they wear figurative masks to avoid  So  if anyone really wants this book banned  I do believe it is because of their fear of tearing down their social facades  rather than promoting violence in human beings  If someone wants to take a message of hatred or dislike toward his fellow man because of this book  then I think that person is missing the point Salinger was trying to make   Salinger will have you speaking like Holden for days following  Plenty of laughter  And more than laughter  thoughtful moments that linger forever  It is easy to forget that this is not a book about teenage angst  It is a book about grief and death  Facing death  everything seems a little phony  I know that some people find  The Catcher in the Rye  annoying as they grow older  but  for me  the more I read this novel the more I appreciate it  I wish I ran away to New York City  This book is probably one of the best I ve ever read  I m only an adolescent  and was given this book to complete my english lit study at school  I couldn t put this book down  and found myself feeling guilty if I d stopped reading it  Salinger captures the true essence of boyhood  the crude beauty of depression  and how when it s victim is fragile  it consumes and becomes inalienable  Many claim that Holden is just whiny  and that the novel is repetitive and develops no storyline  From an objective perspective  this is true  However  those who are able to identify with the protagonist are capable of realising that  although in an unorthodox nature  Caulfield makes it clear that he is slowly unravelling inside  The pure genius descriptions and flow of language in this novel compensate for it s non existent storyline  It makes me ecstatic to know that this book is still being studied throughout educational institutions all over the world  It sets no limits for the reader   other than it s need to be understood and evaluated   The first best book i ve ever read    Um dos livros mais deliciosos  ao nivel do sentido de humor e da empatia criada pelo protagonista  que li este ano  Agarrei uma versao em portugues e o tradutor fez um excelente trabalho a passar as expressoes e entoacoes da maneira de falar de um adolescente nova iorquino dos anos 50 para o nosso tempo  No fim  fica o desejo de ter conhecido Nova Iorque nos anos 50 e de ter o Holden como amigo  e dar lhe um abraco  claro    I m sorta glad they ve got the atomic bomb invented  If there s ever another war I m going to sit right the hell on top of it  I ll volunteer for it  I swear to god I will    Holden  C I read this for the first time when I was around 16  A few days ago  I picked it up and decided go re read it  It s as powerful as I remember  but this time  instead of relating to Holden  all I felt towards him was sympathy  The details of how this very cynical yet somehow empathetic teenager saw the world and things around him is heartbreaking  This is must read  as overwhelming as it is   Was excited to write about this one  I loved The Catcher in the Rye for how the whole thing is about what Holden experienced and went through for a coupla days  contemplating and trying to escape life  It has done a good job unconsciously trying to pull out our inner thoughts  even coming from the thoughts of a teenager  emphasizing our own points of retreat and surrender from the Horrendous Life Itself  And finding out in the end that this bitterness in failing  in being misunderstood  in being missed out is just a phase itself  And that there is always more to life that what we have witnessed from its surface  That it s multi dimensional  and that everyday it shifts to another weather  a reason we should be hopeful  If you d ask me  that s what I loved about how it ended  The fact that the entire story was being built up on Holden ditching his life or life as a whole  and how he decided to live it and live with it and everything that has happened  I love the fact that the book is just narrating life as usual  Favorite part  When Phoebe asked Holden what are those he likes  It was a rebuking moment  and for me  would be the turning point of the protagonist     The book does a stellar job at giving the readers an inside view of Holden s thoughts  mannerisms  colloquialisms of his day  the nuances of his emotions and his pessimistic views on the world  Holden acts rather his childish in this way  however  and there is no progression of this behavior beyond learning that he wants to be a  catcher in the rye   The lack of any real plot causes the book to drag on in a sluggish way and admittedly  if the book wasn t required for school  completion of the book would ve halted indefinitely  However  the skill of Salinger at making a character seem like somebody one encounters daily is highly commendable and excuses the book of its unconventional storytelling   J D  Salinger s  The Catcher in the Rye  is one of the best books I ve ever read  This book should be required reading for anybody who hasn t read it The short novel tells the story of a young boy who is getting kicked out of his private school and spends a few days in New York City before heading home  His train of thought is filled with teen angst  the contradictions of youth  and uncertainty of a future filled with a thousand possibilities This book is often found on banned book lists  After reading it  I can easily see how the conservative sensibilities of the 1950 s would be offended  The young boys narrations are filled with curse words  sexuality  drinking  prostitution  and more  He s not necessarily a good role model  but in many ways he is like all kids who are growing up  That s why it s so important for students to read  I give this novel five out of five stars  If you never read it in school  I didn t   then I encourage you to pick it up  It s a quick read Originally reviewed on my blog at http   www AustinJamesHere blogspot com Catcher in the Rye by J D  Salinger discusses important topics that many teens go through during their school years and lives  Many teens feel ostracized from society and are starting to loose their innocence as they go through their teenage years  One character in Catcher in the Rye that goes through this is the main character Holden Caulfield  He says that he doesn t like  phony  people  but he is constantly being phony by being a pathological liar  He is very cynical of all people  even his brother D B  who he thinks faked out in the real world by becoming a Hollywood director  Holden can come across as aloof because he doesn t like to get attached to anyone  Even when he makes a connection he quickly jumps out of it  For example when Mr  Antolini strokes his head it was more of a pedagogical  sympathy stroke because he was trying to teach him to shape up and become a better student and get on with his life  Instead Holden saw it as a pedophile move because he is cynical of others and aloof to getting close to others  Another example of this would be with Jane  Jane was one of the only people who Holden actually felt a connection with  but he was always too scared or hesitant to call her because he didn t want to connect with others  One of the main lessons that J D  Salinger wanted readers to get out of his writing was the idea that growing up can be painful  As Holden grows up he learns about things and stuff he doesn t want to  For example  when the prostitute comes to his room he can t go through with it because he is a virgin and is scared of crossing that line  This takes away Holden s innocence because he was tempted by the lust of sex and the pleasures that can come with it  Also  another example of growing up can be painful was when he went to the Natural History Museum  which also stands as symbol of innocence  and said that he wished everything would just be the same like the museum  This showed that Holden was having a difficult time with change and the pain of growing older and seeing things he had never even imagined of  The museum also stands as a symbol of innocence because nothing ever changes in the museum and Holden wishes that was true of his own life  Another example of innocence is Holden being insanely protective of Phoebe s  his younger sister  innocence  He doesn t want her to see any of the bad things in life and is constantly trying to shield her from growing up  A reoccurring theme in Cather in the Rye was the idea of lying  Lying can come in all forms and is associated with being phony  Holden constantly says that his pet peeve is phoniness when in fact he is the biggest phony of all  He is callous towardds others by lying about their sons  his age  and everything under the sun  He can t seem to stop lying and being deceiving  He never seems to notice that he is phony because he is too busy being derogatory and lambasting others to see his own flaws  J D  Salinger s style of writing was very relatable to young readers because he captured many problems that teenagers have  For example  being ostracized from groups  not trying your absolute hardest in school  and the scariness of losing your innocence and becoming independent  The part that affected me most in the novel was when Holden was so protective of his little sister  He constantly tried to hide the bad things in the world from his little sister  I can relate to this because I don t want my little brother to grow up too fast either  and I want to shield him from things that would upset him or things that he doesn t need to know or understand at such a young age  I would recommend this book to others because I feel that it was really interesting and made you want to keep reading to see where or what would happen to Holden  A book is written for a purpose and this one justified fairly its timeless existence  I am not sure for the messages it transfers to adolescents  but I think this is a book to be read or reread by mature ages as well  Teens may  or may not  find in Holden s rebellious thinking their mirror image and they may  or may not  get the message that it is a matter of time and occurrence to inevitably land to maturity one way or another  For older ages  though  this book is an excellent reminder that they should never forget their own transition path Here is an interesting link with some key quotes for better understanding Holden s dead ends  http   www novelguide com thecatcheri    I never read this book in high school  I wish I did  I am glad I finally got around to reading it  I absolutely loved this book  I loved Holden Caulfield  He was an entertaining narrator  both extremely immature  but also wise beyond his years  I think that s true of a lot of teenagers  The few teens I am friends with usually surprise me with some of the profound things that come out of their mouths  while being immature at the same time  Holden is a true reflection of this phenomenon  In some ways  this book reminds me of The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath in the sense that we watch a young person slowly unravel and become physically sick trying to make sense of and struggling with societal norms  In other ways  this book reminds me of the South Park episodes where Stan turns 10 and realizes everything is shit  His doctor tells him that he s a cynical asshole   It was a great episode  by the way   Holden is cynical and he thinks everything is phony  which reminds me of the phony guy from Family Guy  Anyway  before I keep getting off track  I think this book is amazing and relevant to society  Holden may not be the most likeable character  but I think the way he sees the world is not unique  I cannot count all the times I ve felt the way Holden feels  I ve met people for the first time and thought to myself that he or she doesn t seem like a real person to me  Like their whole personality is fake  like they are trying too hard to be something  If I didn t have someone to connect with  like Holden connects with his sister   I d probably go crazy  too  The world can sometimes be so overwhelming  so full of aggravation and shit and phonies that overthinking can drive just about anyone insane  I am glad this book is still being read in high school  though I think it s much better to read when you are a little older  too  I suppose that s probably the same with just about every classic  though  Wonderful read and I m so glad I finally got around to this one  http   meganm922 blogspot com 2012 06    O maior hino literario a juventude  i m very glad i read this when i was young  it meant the world to me  i read it in one night  and was sad when it was over  what better review could there be  I read this book for a class assignment not expecting to think much of it  I ended up completing the entire novel in the matter of two plane rides  I was fascinated with the narrator Holden Caulfield  His observations about life and his opinions on everything you could possibly imagine are completely original and often times very poignant  I found Holden s spiral into self destruction riveting and maddening at the same time  At moments I hated him because he was so intelligent but yet he was willing to throw his life away yet at some moments  especially th ones with his younger sister  I found myself feeling so sorry for him  Holden s complexity as a character is truly shocking considering how slim the volume is  I would highly recommend this book  I read this book in my teens  I recall identifying with Holden s sense of alienation  At 19  I found the book to be beautifully written  thrilling  I d have to re read it today  so many years later  to see how it affects me   I finished this book almost a week ago and purposely put off reviewing it until now  I was a little taken aback by this book and honestly didn t know what to say about it  I loved it  I can start with that  I thought it was a fascinating character study and I really love character driven books  so that worked for me  I guess I was sort of bowled over though by the way this book made me question what it means to be sane  So many here review this work with a comment of  enough with the teen angst all ready   But I hardly saw Holden as naive  Instead  I found him wise beyond his years  Unstable  perhaps  but really in the end  this book makes a person question what it means to be mentally healthy anyway  Holden is so driven by truth  it begins to make you wonder who the more sane ones are    those idealistic and  caught  in the rye  or those who went over the edge to begin with in the name of normalcy  That s a pretty powerful thing to make a person consider  and it s no wonder this book causes such a division in readers  reaction  Chalk me up to loving it  though  I was completely caught  I have no idea about the book at first  but I was so eager to read this because I believe that it s a great one based on the ratings and all  I also got no idea what does the title  The Catcher in the Rye  mean  and what s the relation of it to the story  which I find very clever after reading the book  and realizing the source of the title    Spoiler Alert  I think everyone  somehow in their lives  experienced the phase Holden Caulfield was experiencing during the time of the story  Late teens do feel troubled most of the time  do not care about their grades at school and all  want to escape with their current lives  and such  But I think that he s just trying to find himself and not yet realizing what he really wants to do with his life  And I also believe that Holden also has his good side  I find it very sweet that he and Phoebe has a good relationship as siblings  because even though he s troubled  he always had a thought for his sister  He s also actually an intelligent boy  Even though he flunked most of his subjects  you can see that English do interest him  the time that he made Stradlater s paper and the time he s discussing with the two nuns the books he had read   I like it that you can see Holden s positive traits  along with the negative ones  throughout the book This book got me so pensive  I am currently still absorbing every bits of the book after finishing it 2 hours ago  There are a lot of issues involved with the story and that s what makes it so great  I would definitely re read this again  maybe after some years  This one s a 4 6 5 stars for me  This book kind of changed my life    I read this book when I was 15 and it never fails to really ground me  I suppose  I think there s a little bit of Holden Caulfield in all of us  and that s why it still resonates with people to this day   as a side note  because I m a loser  has anyone hear the song Who Wrote Holden Caulfield by Green Day  ok i m done     Reread  Aug 2015 5 stars  Catcher is still a terrific book  but I m finding a lot more things I don t understand  I like it when I can catch a truth about life or family or kids  like when Holden is watching Phoebe on the carousel and he s afraid she ll fall off      but I didn t say anything or do anything  The thing with kids is  if they want to grab for the gold ring  you have to let them do it  and not say anything  If they fall off  they fall off  but it s bad if you say anything to them   Phoebe with her suitcase kills me  she really does  I just read this book for the second time  should have been the twentieth  Five stars again  it s really great   I couldn t get past the first few pages due to the bizarre and yet casual voice of the main character  From what I had heard about this classic  I couldn t believe how many grammatical errors there were and how ignorant the character seemed  I pushed through  and am glad I did  The voice of Caulfield is intentionally artistic to represent his personality  This novel is intriguing and I was left wondering how many Holden Caulfields there are left in the world  He is immature to the naked eye  but sometimes immaturity directly translates to spiritual maturity  I believe that we need more people in this world who are not fooled by the ways of society  Truly I will say to you all  whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all   Mark 10 15 Bu kitap hakkinda sayfalarca yazilabilir ve yazilmis da  Daha da ne yazilabilir bilmiyorum ama sanirim Holden hic unumayacagim bir karakter olarak hafizamda kalacak  Ek olarak ceviride bazi goze batan kisimlar oldugu

bu cilgin bir sey   Holden is growing up  just like any other boy  but you can bet anything to prove that he is no ordinary lad  Seen a failure by the eyes of academia and a rebel at the sight of his parents  Holden has now been expelled from yet another school  given to his lack of success when passing examinations  Fearful that his parents will exaggerate the situation  Holden decides to wander around the streets of New York City  killing time so that he would arrive home on Wednesday  at the beginning of Christmas brake  giving himself time to face his troubles  Holden parts from Pencey Prep with a  Sleep tight  ya  morons   and a red hunting cap at hand  Rather than through Holden s eyes  the reader engages to the story through his words and mannerisms   words flying in all directions at maximum speed  dancing  and no grammar or structure to tame the beast beneath the letters  J  D  Salinger  being one of the most prominent writers of the twentieth century  immerses himself completely into the mind of a conflicted teenager  taking the vanity of elaborated sentences out of The Catcher in the Rye  introducing his reader to a raw diversion of literature  For me  it is very much impressive to think that  after witnessing one of the most monstrous wars men have ever seen  Salinger sat down not to write about death or fire or blazing guns and bombs  but to involve into a two day reflection on the messy brain of a screwed teenage boy  It is evident that Holden is a hypercritical character  almost to the point where he might be considered by some as a somehow distasteful character  He is complicated  but those are really the traits that make him so real  so human  We can all find a part of Holden inside of us   Besides  I firmly support the thought that a novel should not be judged by the likeability of its characters  but rather by how well they are portrayed for the sake of the plot   Salinger has delivered a story that has reached for the core of the youth of older generations  and will surely continue to maintain its position as one of the most important pieces of literature ever created  the story of the boy thorn between the innocence within him and the bearing curse of becoming a man   a prey for the absurdity of the adult world  I ve had this book on my  to read  list for a while now  but I never gave it the chance to fall into my hands until just about a few months ago  when my English teacher made it an assignment  I couldn t believe I had never read it  and yet I think the timing was just right form me to enjoy the whole experience  Holden s voice and humour  merged with the slightly philosophical symbolisms of Salinger s  made me enjoy my way through the entire novel  In part  I can say I that part of my enjoyment came from the fact that the way The Catcher in the Rye is written reminded me a lot of the style Antony Burgess uses in A Clockwork Orange  which I had read previously this last summer  Both Alex and Holden being quite peculiar and not precisely likable characters  outcasts  made for a fascinating analogy   yn br sry bh dnyy jdhb w mkhwf slynjr zdm  khtb fwq l dh mhm w zybyy bry mn bwd  shkhSyt

relatable and an interesting character  His views on the world were interesting and the storyline was good  The book starts out with Holden getting kicked out of school  and from there well  you ll have to find out for yourself  It was well written  though I m still slightly uncomfortable with the language  just the frequency though  because I was tempted after reading it to use those words at school   I love how he tries to find his place in the world because I know I m finding mine  I recommend this ages 14 and older  mostly for language and some other things in it  I am always hesitant with classic books  but once I started reading this I didn t want to stop   Holden Caulfield is a pain in the arse  One of the most unlike able characters it has ever been my displeasure to read about  Self centred  self entitled  miserable  and socially retarded  That s exactly why I love this book You get to know the guy inside and out  he doesn t  come of age  so much as run away like a huffing child  and then come crawling back at the end of it all  He has a few drinks  he obsesses over girls  he ruins all of his friendships  and generally makes a pig s ear of his life It s a compelling lesson in what not to do and how not to act  and a great example of why no one likes teenagers  not even teenagers themselves  I read it when I was twenty  and I saw a lot of the old me in Holden  He s hard to like  but in my opinion  the book is hard to hate  It s well written  making great use of stream of conciousness narrative  and shows us that even in the mundaneness of a normal day  a great story can be found  it doesn t all need to be magic and murder and fairies and vampires  Ok  again  I m not sure if I reviewed this book before or not  but  God  I love this book  I read this before out of curiosity knowing that Mark David Chapman  John Lennon s killer  was driven by this book to actually kill Lennon  So  I picked it up and read it  It was 2010 then  but I never actually grasped Holden s sentiments  can t comprehend his hate for people until four years later and somehow  now  I understand  I don t know exactly what to say  but this book is a book that I will let my child read  will re read 12391023x and will keep forever  That s just how I freakin  love this book  I even love my copy now that is worn out and brown with orange highlighted pages  that it is small  and will fit my hand and I can bring anywhere I go  I just freakin  love it  love it  love it  I M EVEN FUCKING GLAD THAT THIS WON T EVER BE A FILM    Since  J D  Salinger s traumatic experience  And that just means that I will have this book  clear  free from other else s interpretation but mine  I can only see Holden from my own head and no one else s  And it is mine  All mine  Forever  That makes me love this a bizillion times more   Haters are gonna hate this book  which is no wonder for me But I feel a kinda relief to confess that this was the book which drew me close to reading literature  This book is miraculous  the kid and his unique way of language is mesmerizing  The way he uses words like  lousy    phony  really kills me I dont care whether any book teaches you lessons or not  I am total dumb about morality and all The childhood crisis faced by the protagonist is real touchy  Salinger is master in crafting and his literary art is of no limit    He just can make words carry magic with them 5 stars is the lowest stars with which I can rate this book    I read this book last year and reflecting back on it  all that I can really remember are a few points in the book  I can remember that he hates pretty much everyone  Holden considers just forgetting everything else and starting a new life pretending to be deaf so he doesn t have to deal with people in general  I ve done just about the same thing  I just want to stop talking so all of the people in the world will just leave me alone and keep their stupidity to themselves  But that doesn t work  I have to correct them if they say something incredulously wrong  I feel like Holden realizes that he has a flaw too  since his sister wants to tag along with him and he just can t ignore his sister  Most of the book is Holden performing simple tasks like sitting down  Simple  The word just has this weird feeling of good and bad  Holden just wants a simple life where he can save kids from falling over the cliff into his world of hate    What a hell of a book   OOPS   must of slipped    well if u found that bad and innapropiate  this book is NOT for you      trust me   This book is very interesting and it is based ona fictional character  Holden Caufield  He is talking to a therapist  or if i have to use my vocabulary term      talking to a pshyco analyst      spelling       about his life and etc  He has been to a lot of prestigious schools but has been kicked out of evryone of them  6 i suppose     the latest school to be kicked out of was Pency Prep  He has a lot of ISSUES and does a lot of innapropiate things    he drinks underage  loves intercourse  cusses  and a lot of things you NEVER want to do    This book keeps you reading and should be deserved to be read     jst be careful of the language and explicit content    O           Don t tell anybody anything  If you do  you start missing everybody  This is only the second time  But would read the book over and over again    This is one of the first schools books I actually enjoyed  Holden is so descriptive and rude and cynical and pathetic  I love him  But he has a good heart  He still loves his dead brother  Allie  And his sister Phoebe  Even his parents and friends  He also uses the word  gorgeous  to describe something sarcastically  whether it is an appearance or an event  it s hilarious  Who does that  Sometimes he s a hypocrite  saying everyone is a phony when he is one sometimes  And everyone is a madman to him  including himself  I also love the way he says how something  just killed him   Ahahaha This book was great  Everyone should read this book in their lifetime  even more than once  I desperately need to reread this book  because my memories of it can be pretty much summed up as follows  rusty razors  profanity  a hunting cap  angst  prostitutes  pimps  ducks  taxi drivers   boarding school  failure  profanity  angst  and I Hate Everyone Reminiscing That Will Likely Only Be Interesting To Me Most of which I m remembering through the somewhat unreliable series of commercials based on the book that I did as a project in English class   My friend and I still talk about it  six years later  a stuffed duck as a Miss Cleo type psychic hot line  a Mastercard commercial with my friend in a slutty dress   prostitute   5  excuse me   10   for only 39 cents a day  you too can save a duck      that was a fun class   I know Holden is emotionally damaged   but he is so perceptive  A great book  sometimes funny  sometimes piercing  and sometimes very  very clever Kids won t get many of the references   I really enjoyed reading this book  I guess I m at just the right age where I no longer have teenage angst  and am well enough beyond that angst to find it humorous  I thought Holden was incredibly perceptive in his depictions of the people around him  Salinger highlights both the strengths and faults of people  and he added enough of both that the characters avoided being simply black and white  They felt like flesh and blood people  I loved Holden s contradictory explanations of his behavior and his evolving view of himself  He seems to be at the stage where he is trying on a hundred roles a day  discarding them  and then putting them back on to reevaluate how they fit  At times I wanted to hug him  and at other times I wanted to smack him  By the end  I appreciated him as a complex and changing person who struggles to reconcile his idealized view of the world with the world as it really is  I think with Holden  Salinger does an amazing job of showing the world for all its grey qualities  and shows how connecting with the imperfect world  even in the face of loss  reveals that there is still plenty of love and beauty worth holding on to   I adore Holden a little bit more each time I read this book  There is always a new way of seeing his character and his struggle  especially depending upon the students I m working with  When I was in high school  I readily recognized Holden as the kind of boy I always developed a crush on  Now I recognize him as the kind of student I feel desperately ill equipped to deal with   Those crushes also  incidentally  left me feeling desperately ill equipped   Also  as a more advanced writer and teacher than I was the first  and second and third  time that I read it  I find more to appreciate in terms of the brilliance of language and the tension between the rather deluded narration and the harsh reality of the novel   At first I was trying to find in this book the expectations that lived in my mind  Sadly I didn t found any of them  I expected something deep  full of motion  live changing from the first word  I couldn t see none of this from the beginning but thankfully I kept reading until I reached the end  where I found all this in such concentration that it trembles in my mind for years  It was like verbal explanation of my childish fears and hopes  dreams and the exact occupation in society I wanted to fulfill  But the biggest positive The Catcher gave me was that I fell in love with Salinger and I kept and kept reading  not that there s a lot to read in quantity  but in quality for sure    Well  I changed my rating of this from 3 to 5 stars  I read this many years ago  don t remember how many  all I remember is that I was young  probably Jr  High  and I remember thinking it was OK  but it didn t really strike me or anything  I went into it this time not expecting to like it very much  and BOY was I wrong  I LUUUUURVED it this time around  I was able to relate to Holden more than I was the first time around  I always wanted to grow up  always  I just couldn t wait  I always preferred having coffee with Mom and Grandma over playing outside with the other kids  I only wish I would have some kind of a record about what I thought about it before  it would be an interesting comparison   Well  my five star rating  though not in my mind at the time  indicates what I thought of this book over fifty years ago  when I was reading it under the covers at night  laughing my ass off into my pillow  that s a strange thought  isn t it  maybe something Holden would relate to  And if you don t agree with me  I know darn well that Holden would dismiss you as   a crummy moron   Nuff said  slynjr twld 1919 w mt 2010     akhr ktb lh kn 1965     w akhr lq kn 1980lm tqr lrwy  htHs n Hd

school assignment in Bountiful  Utah  when I was there early  80s  This was a highly enlightening read  Certainly changed my life for the better  if not for the happier  I hard to describe the emotions while reading this one  its such a compelling narrative that you can t help but empathize with the protagonist Holden  Its paints a rather bleak view of the kind of people we all are  and the worst  or rather good  part its mostly true  Never have I read something were moment to moment thoughts and actions are put forward in such a relatable fashion   I have nothing objective to say  This book is one of my lasting favorites  I ve read it over and over again  and will probably keep picking it up time after time  Immer noch aktuell uber die Orientierungslosigkeit des Erwachsenen und des Daseins allgemeinIch weiss nicht  ob ich Holden Caulfield auf Anhieb mochte  ich glaube ich habe das Buch einmal angefangen  als ich noch zu jung dafur war  vielleicht mit 12  spater  mit 18 fand ich es grossartig  Holden fangt einfach mit allen coolen und abgeklarten Spruchen die Verlorenheit seines Alters ein das nicht weiss  wo es hingehort  In manchen Hinsicht ist er eine Satre artige Figur  die sich treiben lasst und ohne Orientierung ins Leben stolpert  auf der Suche nach Gefuhl und Emotion  Ein Teil des Grundes fur den Erfolg ist vielleicht auch das Geheimnis  das um das Leben des Autors rankt  Schliesslich ist dies sein einziger Roman  danach zog er sich vollig zuruck und eigentlich verloren sich danach die Rezensenten im Erstellen von Psychogrammen des Autors  der genau das hasste und sich daraufhin noch mehr zuruckzog Ein absolut lesenswertes Buch  wobei ich die anderen Bucher und Kurzgeschichten des Autors teilweise noch besser finde  The Catcher in the Rye is about being a teenager  One who happens to have at least one  if not more  mental disorder  It s okay to dislike Holden or to not love this book  opinions are opinions after all  But I take issue with people who fail to realize that he writes from a mental hospital  He s messed up  And to think he s a whiny spoiled brat     well  yeah  he s spoiled  but the reason he is the way he is is because he s got a mental disorder  Those who like this book either know what it s like firsthand to be depressed  or even different in general  or know someone who has felt the adverse effects of it   Really great  one of my favorites  I read it in high school and was told that if I read it again later in life I would get much more out of it  I m not sure if I got more out of it but I feel like I got a better idea of who Holden is  The story takes place mostly in New York City in the 40 s 50 s era and Salinger s dialogue really represents that era in American history perfectly  The story takes place over a 3 day period and it is a lot of Holden s lucid thoughts  it s a very fast moving novel Holden Caulfield is a 17 year old who is very tall and skinny and has a lot of grey hair  The story starts off with Holden talking about the current boarding school he attends called Pencey  Holden gets kicked out of this school because he is failing all his classes except English  He talks to his history teacher about his decisions and what he will do for the rest of his life  but Holden is very unsure of what he wants  He often contradicts himself a lot and is somewhat a hypocrite  He talks about how he hates movies and plays but he encourages his younger sister Pheobe to be in her school play  He also despises  phonies  but he discusses at great lengths the importance of having expensive suitcases  Holden s parents are super wealthy  his dad is a lawyer but we never meet them as characters  Although Holden is super wealthy  he has not had the easiest life  his brother Allie died and the reader can tell this is a demon that Holden deals with on a daily basis  He also is constantly being expelled from expensive boarding schools  Holden also has an older brother named D B  who lives in Hollywood and is trying to make it as a writer who is sort of a phonie according to Holden  It is obvious that Holden does not want to let go of the past  even his name implies that he is holding on  I remember that from high school   But this time I noticed that Holden really likes the museum of natural history because it never changes  even though we change as time goes by  He also enjoys going back to his little sister s school where he went  but he notices the fuck yous written on the stairs of the school which upset him  I remember that symbolizing the loss of innocence  Holden deals with prostitutes  drinking  and smoking so this could mean that he lost his innocence  You also meet a few people that Holden knows  He goes on a date with Sally which he screws up  he meets girls in bars that are from Seattle that he dances with  and a creepy family friend that pets Holden s head while he sleeps  Holden truly cares about his sister Pheobe and decides to stick around for her instead of moving to Colorado and never coming back  It s a quick read a Holden is a depressed  emotional  sensitive  pretentious teenager  But I still hope things work out for him  no matter what he did or said  I still did not hate the character and I just want Holden to get his life together  If you really want to hear about it  I suppose I should tell you that I always have this copy of The Catcher in the Rye sitting on my desk  It s my favorite book  really  I m pretty good at reading  Other than that  I m kind of illiterate  The cover is pretty nice  I mean  I guess it s the best part  I wouldn t want to put an ugly book on my desk  now would I  The only book with a sweller cover than that one is that damn Gatsby book   but that book was full of phonies  I don t know  I guess the plot on the inside is kind of cool too  even if the themes are a little phony  This Salinger guy is the biggest phony of them all  really  writing a book that reaches absurd success during his lifetime and thinks so highly of himself that he became more and more secluded  What kind of guy does he think he is anyways  He probably isn t that phony though  he did write this book after all  There is just something funny about him  So yeah  I always keep this book on my desk  I m not sure why  I don t feel like going into it  if you want to know the truth  I don t keep any other books on my desk  besides the ones that I ve only partially finished and will get to at some point  I guess the phoniness just kind of rubbed off on me a little bit  That Cauliflower guy is one of the least phoniest people I ve ever read about  Besides him  I feel like the only other real non phony is me  In fact  I m even less phony than him  if that s even possible  He s a real whiner  if you think about it  He just needs to suck it up and figure out a comfortable place  That s what I did  If you really want to know the truth  I guess I was a lot like him when I was younger  I don t want to sound like that Salinger phony  but that Cauliflower guy is kinda like my little brother  if I had one  Or like a past me  or something  Maybe a little bit of me now  You probably don t care  but that s why I leave it on my desk  I think  I read this book as part of a comparison  between this one and The Perks of Being a Wallflower  for a highschool paper 2 years ago  and to this day this book spoke to me more than so many others did  Yes  it is your cliche coming of age story but it s written in the most honest way  There s no additional drama  or a teenage flair like the ones in movies  This is a story of a real boy in a real world going through real things   and it s his real reaction to all of the obstacles in his life he tries to overcome No matter what you ve been through  or how easy your life has been  I think we all connect to Holden to some extent  I d definitely recommend this book  especially if you re a highschooler  or just need help knowing you re not the only one lost  This book uniquely stands the test of time in modern American literature  It defines what it is to be an adolescent in a fully industrial society and all the anxiety  anger and feelings of helplessness that accompany that  Everyone can relate to Holden and his contradictory feelings about everything  Simply one of the top 5 modern novels and a must read for anyone who has ever struggled through puberty  This is one of those stories that changes everytime you read it  depending on your current state of mind  I read this in high school and I despised Holden Caulfield  I didn t understand a word he s saying  Three years later  at a different stage in life  all of Holden s motives and actions really resonate in me  I really have a deep connection with him this time through  I really do  How strange  our minds are I still refuse that this is simply about growing up  I still refuse that Holden s fight in this book is about trying to preserve his innocence  I refuse to oversimplify the  phonies  as  adults   I think Holden s fight is much larger here  This is quite a controversial book and something which I must say before analyzing the entire text is that this book is not for everyone The plots revolves around a teenage boy Holden Caulfield who basically doesn t like anything  He finds everyone phony and he hates everything  He thinks everything is crap  He gets kicked out of a school and thereafter beings travelling to the city and a series of events ensue The progress is remarkably slow yet it is enthralling to a teenager  A teenager who reads this book might find a lot of similarities between the character and his own  but then again  he might not  Someone well past the teenage years will find this book tedious and boring and annoying  to be honest There is a very small amount of character development in the protagonist Our thoughts are the fastest  Our thoughts travel from one strain to another within a fraction of milliseconds  Caulfield s words are exactly like that  When left alone with his thoughts  he goes from a boy in his school to something completely off topic and a thousand light years apart  But there lies the beauty of the book  It s realistic  It portrays teen angst the way it actually is  Teenage years are troubling for most of us and that is exactly what the author  J D  Salinger put forth in his novel If you can read an incredibly slow book with almost zero character development  if you can tolerate reading the point of view of a troubled teenager who hates everything on earth  then you can definitely read this novel  Otherwise  it will just end up frustrating you Personally  I loved the book because it depicts life the way it is  The realism shown in the book is uncanny  I guess the first question to answer is does this book really need another review  There are over 3 000 of them here already  I managed to plow through the first couple of hundred and I came to the conclusion that yes  clearly  this book does need another review Perhaps someone has already mentioned this  maybe near review 1 700  which might as well be in the center of a stone buried deep within the earth just south of Blue Balls  PA   but I think what might be missing for most people who  don t get the book  is the correct filter with which to read it  Holden completely blames himself for his little brother s death  His behaviors  thoughts  and actions all seem to be a result of not coming to grip with his brother s untimely death His weekend activities are all about trying to find an answer to why his brother died and why he couldn t save him  The title of the book helps you along there  as it points out what might otherwise be thought of as a minor point  He incorrectly thinks the line of a song is  If a body catches a body coming through the rye     when in fact good old Phoebe tells him it s actually a poem   If a body meets a body      That s how screwed up he is  He takes that poem and twists it all up  and all he really wants to do with his life is be the  catcher in the rye  that keeps kids from falling off a cliff  this is Mr  Salinger s genius   He needs someone to tell him it s not his fault that Allie died  This is also why his older brother is a  sellout  because he was able to move on with his life  That s why everyone else he meets is a phony  because how can they be the same after this tragic event  yet he is so lost and changed  Phoebe is really the only thing left that s keeping Holden here on earth with us   That s what makes this a compelling read for me and one of the best of all time  I really enjoyed this book  I m 17  and it may be due to the fact that I m going through a pretty complicated age and all with adult hood lurking around the corner  but I feel as if I can really relate to Holden in this book  To me this book is much more then words on paper  You ll enjoy this book if you ve felt at times  alone  outcasted  depressed  uncaring  or even just unsure of your own future  It s a  teen angst  kind of book  and a great read  I rate 10 10    I wish I also had Phoebe as my sister  this book was given to me at a time when i really needed it  to this day  it remains one of my very favourites  as common as it is   akhr yn ktb yh jmlh dsht kh bh nZr mn rzshsh b kl ktb brbry myknh  gr zmn myshnwyd hychwqt chyzy bh ksy ngwyyd gr bgwyyd ywsh ywsh dltn bry hmh tng myshwd   All the rest of the family read this as teenagers  About time at almost 61 to try it  HC is a good character  on the lines of Owen Meany  With only 214 pages  i went from thinking of this as drivel from a lying irresponsible teenager to a more serious person who has glimmer of real life  He constantly pounds on hating phony people and not being phony himself  By reading it in two three days I got the connection to real life  Not sure if the screen involved teens of today would appreciate his abandon  I gave this book 5 5 stars because I really did enjoy reading it and even though it didn t meet all my expectations it sure was a great book anyways  My expectations of this book was completely different from what I thought it would ve have been  The title of this book was shown in an incredible way  I loved how the name of this book shows the hope of Holden because he dreams of being his version of the catcher in the rye and in order to do that he would first have to save himself  I would recommend this book to people 15  because some material is for mature readers but overall it was an amazing book and I believe everyone should read it  I Think I would never find another writer who can speak to my heart as much as my dear Salinger  God bless his beautiful soul     I simply had to read this book again after almost eight years  And I can say I still find it a compelling read   funny and sad at the same time  And even though I am definitely not a teenager anymore  I can still relate to this book  probably more than I would ever wish to admit   It also helps that this book reminds me of some of the dearest people in my life    p s  Where do the ducks go  Or better yet  where did the ducks go  The ones from the 700  not the ones from Central Park  I couldn t care less about Central Park    The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause  while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one   I absolutely loved this book I know that it s compulsory reading in a lot of schools in the US  but I actually read it because I heard that it really got into the dilemma that teenagers feel themselves go through while going through puberty  And I actually could really relate to not understanding what is going on around you and why certain things can happen  I could really understand how he felt trapped int hat world that has been created for him by all the adults around him  without him knowing how to actually fit into it It s such a masterpiece and I would recommend it to everyone  It s my new favorite book  This was an amazing book  At first  I didn t know what I thought of it  but as I kept reading I was more and more interested by the author s controversial writing style and Holden Caulfield  I really liked Holden  He really showed the different sides of the teenage years like  feeling alienated and teenage angst  This is probably one of the best books I ve ever read   I can say this is one of the best books I ve ever read  I noticed that a lot of people find boring reading memories written in such a spontaneous manner  but I think this is the best part of the book  Holden is a damn smart boy struggling with the changes that his age requires  He s fighting with other people expectations and his self who can t figure out which are the goals in his life  It is a precious reading for anyone whoever felt like this  There are some very nice metaphors and pieces of advice  When I was in the 8th grade I had a brilliant English teacher who wanted nothing more than to open our minds  The Catcher in the Rye was not allowed by our school at the time but my teacher read it to us anyway  and as he read it  most kids dicked around but I was infatuated with it  This book is nothing short of excellence to me  Now that I am a 19 year old college student I thought I would reread the book as I often do with classics  Boy  let me tell ya  I think I love the book now more than ever  Holden s character is truly genius  it s almost as if the book was written at random with no planning but Salinger is just one hell of a writer  Holden is spunky and full of angst    He represents a side that we can all relate to  I have a more serene connection with the book as I have experienced life as Holden has    But in my own my way  Some say this book is overrated but I ll tell you this its a much better read than Scarlett letter   I d never heard anything about the book before reading it  other than the fact that it s something  everyone has to read at some point in their lives   and my goodness I could not agree more   It made me cry  and laugh  and cry again  You get so attuned to Holden s way of thinking you start seeing the world through his eyes while reading the novel  and the whole way through I was just wishing he was real so I could go and give him a hug  The ending is so original  it just kind of hits you in the face  but it s a beautiful  I couldn t speak for minutes after putting the book down  and when I regained the ability to do so  all I could manage was  Wow  All in all probably one of the best books I ve ever read  if not the best  If you haven t got round to reading it yet  don t hesitate to do so   cause you re seriously missing out  It s me   Just that I never got expelled from school  This book was written for me  I know there are many few people who would embrace the fact that they partially hate people even though they like love them  The author writes this in the most fun way  He talks about alienation  frustration  loneliness  The hate actually comes from the annoyance he feels in the difficult time  He talks about being the Catcher for children in the Rye field so that none of the kids fall off from the cliff but in contrast  he actually becomes the fallen The author creates a flow that keeps you fixated I love the fact that he refers to many people as bastard  I love it  Holden me desesperaba por momentos con sus estados depresivos  aunque a veces me identificaba con el y llegaba a entenderlo  A pesar de ciertas cosas que me aburrian  el libro fue dirigiendose muy bien hacia el final  terminando por encantarme la historia  Tiene algunas frases bastantes memorables  Rei en varias ocasiones y disfrute algunas escenas demasiado  Me gusto mucho entender el titulo del libro  que era algo que me llamaba mucho la atencion  With this book it seems as people either loved it or hated it there is not really an in between  I personally loved it  I liked the way it was written and had this old feel to it  I liked Holden s unique personality  perspective and the way he would describe things or say these little things about what he said to someone and why he d say it  i had never read Catcher In The Rye  before my girlfriend recommended it to me  It came at just the right time  compelling me towards authenticity  towards real raw and ragged human interaction  Salinger s characters are deep and scarily lifelike  I love the way he writes dialogue  i really do  This is a must read for writers  show you how it s done  with a quickly moving plot  which still manages to be slice of life  atmospheric and poetic  Bonus points for the descriptions of New York in the early  50s  which was practically the main character in the book  Very short  quick read  too  so if you haven t been into reading for a minute  this is a great way to get back in  Down with phoniness  Here s to the real thing   Catcher in the Rye is about an average teenage boy  Holden Caufield  He was expelled from his school  Pencey  and had to leave over the Christmas Break  Salinger tells of how instead of returning home right away  he decides to go to New York City and everything that happened after that  This book just follows Holden s story  revealing his thoughts and feelings of his surroundings Before I read this book  I had heard so much about how great it is  and always wanted to read it  However  I was hesitant because I thought it would be dull or hard to understand  Now that I have read it  I realize that I was completely wrong  It was written in a way that anyone  teenager and older  could relate to  Holden was rebellious and he questioned things that I myself have thought of as well  I would recommend this to any teenager  Friends of mine who I never expected to read in the first place said that they loved it  After finishing the book I realized that it is totally possible to build an atom bomb  disguise it as literature  and drop it on someone  If I had read this book 10 years ago  I wouldn t be surprised if I had  Holden Caulfield   at least the initials   tattooed on my arm somewhere  I wouldn t be surprised if I still do it  If only there was a protagonist s voice I loved any more in the books i ve read  I fell in love with the narration  the attitude  the naked and brutal truth being told  and the meaning of the title  I don t know how most people react when they learn the meaning of the title but I reacted by shutting the book  and going into the restroom of the coffee shop  and just breaking down a little  I wanted to be the Catcher in the rye  People say its for teenagers but they are wrong  I can assure you that this book  was written and  is for adults  but yes  its popular among teenagers  I found out later that Salinger landed on D Day  during Second World War  with six chapters of the book on him and kept writing while surviving atrocities and death that was all around him  The Catcher is a book that teaches you  or gives you courage  to reject the fake and phonies of this world and stop saying the obvious about things that are to be appreciated  If you haven t read this book  or don t remember it  then pick up a copy and come to terms with preserving what little innocence of childhood is left inside you  Is it liberating  Yes  Life changing  yes   Certain things  they should stay the way they are  You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone    Holden Caulfield  a teenager growing up in New York during the 1950s  has been expelled from yet another school   This time  it s Pencey Prep   His teachers had found him to be incompetent and an underachiever  After coming to the conclusion the so called  friends  he had made were phonies  Holden decides he has no reason to stay  He packs his bags and leaves  deciding to  take a vacation  in New York before returning to his parents  inevitable wrath  Told as a monologue  The Catcher in the Rye not only describes Holden s thoughts and activities throughout these few days  but it also goes back to his past  He describes some of his true friends  how his parents and childhood were and gives reasons for his actions   Like deciding not to have sex with a prostitute   These few days can probably be best described as a developing nervous breakdown  a result of his unexplained depression  impulsive spending and generally odd  erratic behavior  However  life continues on around Holden as it always has  with the majority of people ignoring the changes that occur in him  until it begins to get them seriously ticked off  Progressively through the novel we are challenged to think about society s attitude to the human condition   does society have an  ostrich in the sand  mentality  a deliberate ignorance of the emptiness that can characterize human existence  And if so  when Caulfield begins to probe and investigate his own sense of emptiness and isolation  before finally declaring that the world is full of  phonies  with each one out for their own phony gain  is Holden actually the one who is going insane  or is it society which has lost it s mind for failing to see the hopelessness of its own existence  This is a timeless classic  not to be missed  Just finished this book recently for my AP Language and Composition class  I loved it more than anything I ve read lately  It s really not a book for everyone  but as a teenager  growing up experiencing similar angst as Holden  I can relate to the narrative story very well  Holden s personality was actually really fun to decipher  Because the story was in his point of view  there were actually two story lines for the reader to follow along with  and in this way  it was a sort of mystery  Our eventual thesis paper after finishing the novel  was to psychoanalyze Holden  This was probably the most fun I ve ever had completing an assignment this year   Oh look  I just got emotionally destroyed by another book  I guess I could have read this book easily  you know  without getting emotionally destroyed and all of that  if I had done it with a little less thinking  Once you start to think about it  discuss it  really  get to know  Holden  you start to realize how depressing the book actually is  and how universal Holden s experiences are  Depending on your perspective  you might have mixed feelings about Holden  It s usually something like this  you either want to punch him in the face or you want to give him a hug  The way I see it  he s annoying as hell  but he gets punched enough in the book as it is  And yes  by he s a huge hypocrite as by his own definition there s no doubt he s a  phony   and so are you  by the way  but he knows that  I identify with Holden  as most of us  at some point in our lives  will  I don t believe that human nature is inherently negative  but certainly there have been times in my life when I have had a similar outlook  If you haven t  you probably will one day  Even if the extremity of your circumstances doesn t match Holden s  the feelings of loneliness he describes are universal  I think that when we do experience this overwhelming loneliness and depression  we are often under the impression that no one really cares about us  as if others can see through us and know how we are feelings  and they do  but they don t care  As a person who has identified more with Holden in my past than in present circumstances  I was constantly saddened by Holden s inability to reach out to others  But at the same time  I really felt as though I got to know Holden  In short  this book is depressing  it is relatable  it develops a great narrative voice  and it is honest in describing human emotion  I firmly believe that those who are displeased by the novel s lack of plot are missing the point  For me  this novel was more of an experience than a book   The Catcher in the Rye is a book about a young adolescent who has a hard time at school  The main character is Holden Caulfield  He is a student who gets kicked out of Pencey Preparatory  The school is originally in Pennsylvania but as he is kicked out of the school he begins a journey throughout New York  The book is about Holden hanging out in New York   The character encounters certain problems which makes his life harder  He also has a limited amount of money  Its the life of which everybody may encounter in any time  it is very well written and it is very entertaining  The Catcher in the Rye is an exceptional book which I think everybody should read  I loved Holden Caulfield  He was the most complicated and intriguing character I have ever chanced upon  However confused and sad he may be  his kindness and inexplicable understanding of innocence are both touching and heartbreaking  There is a reason why this book is beloved by so many  it tugs on your heartstrings and challenges all the  phonies  and the brutality of adolescence in a stunning way  His language is amusing and quirky  and I have actually started speaking like him when I get mad  He has a special place in my heart   Classics can sometimes be dry and tedious  They don t absorb you and make you want more  The Catcher in the Rye honestly made want to keep reading  because I cared about the hero   Scoprirai di non essere il primo che il comportamento degli uomini abbia sconcertato  impaurito e perfino nauseato  Non sei affatto solo a questo traguardo  e saperlo ti servira d incitamento e da stimolante    Plot  Holden Caulfield has just been kicked out of Pencey  the latest in the line of failed boarding schools  Lost in a world of phonies  he spends his last few days of freedom in New York City Review  He hates phonies  but Holden Caulfield is a phony  He s too consumed with being authentic that he hardly ever is  He hates repetition but always says things twice  In a way  though  this is what makes him a good  flawed character rather than an all knowing teenager Sure  the book lagged in some parts  but it s one of those that stays with you  Some schools are considering slashing it out of the curriculum  and that s ridiculous  No matter the time  Holden s story is relevant Favorite characters  Phoebe  James Castle I loathe Holden Caulfield  He s an insolent brat and a hypocrite and he has this ridiculous unfounded sense of superiority  But Holden Caulfield is an incredibly realistic character  and he s a character that gets better and better with time for future readers who read about this world of the past that they ve never known and then they read about this character who is pretty much exactly like them  It s timeless  I ve grown out of my Holden phase but I still feel a lot of the things that he feels and a lot of the ideas that he turns over in his head I feel very strongly about  I m attracted to innocence  More than anything that s what I look for in someone and I know it s really bad because people grow up and they re not as innocent as they may seem anymore  I m not innocent  The object of my affection is not innocent  and I m going to continue to be crushed until I accept that there is no such thing as purity and that s died with childhood  I wish it didn t  though  I wish more than anything I could be a catcher in the rye  I hate seeing obscenities scrawled onto the walls of my brother s school  Anyways  sometimes I get the notion that I should call this girl who I ve projected my innocence onto  but then I make up some ridiculous excuse to myself and I don t do it  I never end up doing anything  So maybe I haven t grown out of my Holden Caulfield phase  The fact that I m denying it is the greatest proof of all   So  this book is one of my favorites simply from the fact that countless people have tagged me as Holden Caulfield  Be it my chronic underachievement at my Pency like all boys prep school  to my poor wind from smoking  to my loathing of anything fake or phony  to my ardent infatuation with my younger sister s purity  lots of things that I do remind others of me  which I guess is kind of messed up  Anyway  this book is in and of itself a very entertaining  empathy inducing book  It s one of the few books that I have ever read that both made me laugh out loud and also made me feel like somebody out there  gets it   You thought I was going to say  understands me   didn t you  C mon  dude    MY FAVORITE BOOK  The Catcher in the Rye  is a novel that you will come across a sporadic number of times in your lifetime  Narrated with a somewhat apprehensive   angsty  tone  the story never fails to amuse its reader The effect of the intense and ardent emotions of Holden Caulfield  the main character  are simply inexplicable The setting itself was not necessarily epic  i e  a war siege heist   in fact  the story was rather simple    Holden s brief trip in New York City  after running away from boarding school  In my opinion  the only apparent conflict was between Holden and himself  He seemed to be annoyed by even the most minor trivial of incidents  This  of course  is what made the story gripping and intriguing Holden Caulfield has served as an inspiration for many  There are multitudes of poems  films  and songs that are based on this marvelous novel  There is definitely a lot of insight that can be taken from this masterpiece  Salinger certainly has lots of perspective to offer Honestly  when I started reading this book  I could not put it down  It does contain a few sensitive topics that may not be appropriate for everyone  Also  there is a significant amount of strong  crude language  But  other than that  it is a great book  Classic     Pallavi Chamarthy One of the most compelling  interesting  round characters I have ever read  Hayden is a character that you both love and hate  You want to trust him and yet you question his opinions and stories  I would highly recommend this read  but more seriously  I would recommend reading the novel twice  It gets better each time  It is an experience  not just a novel  When reading the novel  do not take it as a fiction  Read Holden Caulfield the way you would read any individual telling you this story  He comes to life  While some may see Holden as annoying and as a typical teenager  if you read between the lines you will discover a boy who is lost  lonely  and who has suffered incredible tragedy  It is a classic for a reason   I learned to swear after reading the book  please excuse my words  So there comes the day when you feel everything around you is a big shit  when you feel fucking fed up and everyone sounds so flashy and phony  and all you want to do is to go away to somewhere so far away  where you build a small cottage for yourself and live simply till the end of your life  That s when you should read The Catcher in the Rye  This teenage chap named Holden will sit with you for a while  smoke a cigarette and drink a shot  and talk about how the society is so much into fame and money  and how everyone just forget the values of life  and share with you the desire to run away  And then you hear his little stories about his younger brother Allie s baseball glove  and his smart and thoughtful sister Phoebe  and his dream to be a catcher in the rye to save children from falling down the cliff  And then you know that you re not alone  that life still has beautiful things to listen to  that you still have the reasons to live  and fight for what you believe  Neu co mot ngay nao do ban chan doi bo me  va ban thay moi nguoi xung quanh ban gia tao va bo tich bo me  tu lao dong nghiep  den may

throughout the book The novel covers two days of the life of Holden  Holden has flunked out of his school  called Pencey Prep  Holden is seventeen when he tells his story  He gets into multiple fight with his roommates and classmates  Holden propositions some of his ex girlfriends to run away and go hitchhiking out west  The girl  Sally Hayes  declines Throughout the book Holden has been let down by many people  At the end of the book it is stated that Holden has a nervous breakdown and will be attending another school at in the fall  There are many things that I like about this book  This is very emotional book  The first thing I like about the book is how I can relate to how Holden is feeling  For example when Holden ask Sally Hayes to go out west with him  She unfortunately declines leaving Holden upset and disappointed  One time in my life I ask someone to go somewhere with me and the declined  which left me angry  That is the best thing I like about The catcher in the Rye  I can make connection with the protagonist  One thing that I don t like about the book is how the author is sometimes to up front with what Holden is feeling  For instance  the author states in the book that Holden was having sexuality needs  I think that is unessential to add to a plot  I would highly recommend reading The Cather in the Rye  It is one of my favorite books  A teenager would enjoy reading this book because most can make connection with Holden  Holdens story kept me reading craving for more of story   The story starts out with the main character  Holden  talking to what I imagine to be the equivalent of a Psychiatrist  He then speaks in the first person about everything that has happened over the last couple of days and his feelings about the world  My impression of the book is that this poor young man has been through a lot in the last few years and is having a very hard time processing the world that he lives in  I think from time to time we all feel as cynical as Holden does about the world in which people seem to say one thing but actually mean something entirely different   people he calls  phonies   He sees his younger sister as someone that represents what his life used to be like before everything went wrong  At the end of the story  the merry go round represents that world and causes him to have a breakdown The story kind of just ends  but I would hope that the next step is that he will get the help that he needs to move forward  Just before Christmas holiday begins for the private school Pencey Prep  situated in Pennsylvania  16 year old Holden Caulfield is expelled   just as he had been from previous schools  Not wanting to stay at Pencey Prep until break began and  obviously  not wanting to confront his parents  Holden takes on several misadventures as he travels around New York  He spends his few days visiting bars  driving around in taxis  and being in desperate need for conversation and some human connection J D  Salinger s writing was perfected  with the reader being actively engaged through his use of vivid diction and storytelling  While Holden appears superficially emotionless and careless  as the story progresses  his true feelings are pronounced  and his character is clearly developed  The book was intriguing  with the audience hearing about Holden s criticisms about society and his personal anecdotes  which make us feel more sympathetic towards him  The ending  however  was somewhat disappointing  and there was no dramatic climax  but while these points negatively impacted the book  the story of Holden Caulfield overall was still excellently written and depicted   An amazing story of Holden Caulfield  Holden is struggling to grow up  so when he is kicked out of his school he decides to spend a weekend in New York  While he tries to escape the real world to remain his innocent self  his antics put him in deep trouble losing most to all of his money and getting swindled by a hooker  Will he grow up  A true masterpiece  Read it if you like a great story of growing up
